           EXT (DAYLIGHT) FINANCIAL DISTRICT - MANHATTAN - MAY 11, 1888

           A SEA OF YOUNG PROFESSIONAL MEN CONDUCT THEIR MORNING MARCH 
           DOWN BROADWAY.

           They look nearly identical: Perfectly parted hair, black 
           coats, wing collared shirts, long black ties. Some have 
           moustaches, a few boast mutton-chop beards.

           On the street, HORSE-DRAWN HANSOMS clatter downtown.

           TROLLEY CARS zip crosstown past chatting SOCIAL SECRETARIES 
           in bright dresses. MESSENGERS scurry through the din of 
           chirping NEWSBOYS.

           ADVERTISEMENTS on the street proclaim the newest marvels of 
           the age: “BRILL SHAVING CREAM!” “BAYER COCAINE!” “AMERICA’S 
           FIRST WORLD’S FAIR — IN CHICAGO!”

           Only a few days ago, the newspapers revealed that Jacob Astor 
           had become officially richer than the Queen of England. These 
           streets are bursting with a wealth never before seen in human 
           history. These people came here to get it.

           From amongst the bustle, we pick out one face. Walking 
           quickly. Just one of these confident young men on his way up 
           in this new world...

           ... His name is PAUL CRAVATH — 26, a preacher’s son whose 
           ambition and smarts combined to lead him away from his 
           family’s Nashville farm. He has worked for everything he has; 
           and he doesn’t even have much.

           As Paul gets closer to us, we notice — though he doesn’t — a 
           WORKMAN high on a ladder in the background, fiddling with a 
           string of BLACK CABLES that criss-cross in the air.

           These are ELECTRICAL CABLES, they’re brand new, and they’ve 
           gotten tangled in the wind. 

           The Workman struggles to untangle them...

           ... Paul gets closer...

           ... As behind him the Workman grapples with the wires...

           ... Paul’s face almost fills the frame as suddenly...

           ... The Workman slips, grasping one hand on each of the wires 
           for support... Making a connection...

           ... And in an instant the Workman BURSTS INTO FLAMES.

           Paul TURNS: Good Lord in heaven.
           200 OTHER PEOPLE ON THE STREET turn as well to see:

           The FLAMES SET FIRE TO THE WORKMAN’S CLOTHES —

           — Which are incinerated as the poor man TUMBLES FORWARD —

           — His arms WRAPPED in the wires, which hold him aloft —

           — His roasting body assumes the position of Jesus on the 
           cross —

           — As a BLUE ELECTRICAL FIRE SHOOTS from his mouth.

           ON PAUL: He has never in his life seen anything like this.

           ON THE CROWD: They haven’t either. It’s TOTAL FUCKING 
           PANDEMONIUM.

           Children SCREAM, pedestrians FLEE, horses SPOOK, hansoms 
           CAREEN into one another.

           Paul can only stare as the Workman’s body literally MELTS 
           before his eyes —

           — The man’s blood SPRAYING OUT into the terrified crowd.

           In the PANICKED STAMPEDE: A YOUNG WOMAN is PUSHED by the mob. 
           She is AGNES HUNTINGTON — 24, high-society elegant, possessed 
           of the easy cynicism that comes from packing too much life 
           into too few years.

           In the riot, Agnes Huntington TUMBLES to the dirt...

           ... Stray BLOOD sprays her Doucet frock...

           ... A pair of SCARED HORSES rear up on their haunches...

           ... And the WHEELS of their carriage threaten to TRAMPLE 
           Agnes.

           ON PAUL: The sight of the woman in danger breaks the spell of 
           his shock and he DIVES towards her —

           — Trying to YANK her out of the way of the wheels —

           — But the horses are CHAOTIC, WILD, and keep dragging the 
           wheels toward Agnes —

           — Paul looks up as the CARRIAGE DRIVER leaps from his post, 
           letting the horses have their way —

           — So instinctively, Paul JUMPS UP TOWARDS THE HORSES —

           — And expertly UNHOOKS THEIR REINS —
           — As Agnes ROLLS AWAY —

           — The horses TEAR OFF into the distance —

           — And Paul and Agnes are left PANTING in the dirt.

           Slowly they stand, still points in the chaos. Trying to 
           process what in the hell just happened.

           The BELLS from a HORSE-DRAWN FIRE ENGINE clang as a fleet of 
           RED-HATTED FIREMEN arrive to bring order to all of this.

           ON THE FIREMEN: Staring dumbfounded at the hellfire blooming 
           from the workman’s corpse.

           ON PAUL AND AGNES: They have just seen a horror together the 
           likes of which almost no human being has ever witnessed...

           ... So what do you even say?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Are you all right, Miss?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                             (nods)
                        How did you know how to do that? 
                        With the horses?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I’m not from around here.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                             (re: his accent)
                        I can tell.
                             (beat)
                        Was that... electricity?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I’ve never seen it up close before.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        It’s a terror.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        People love it.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Any of these people?

           Paul can’t say much to that, can he?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON (CONT’D)
                        ... Thank you. For helping me.
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I’m glad you’re safe. Paul Cravath. 
                        Esquire.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        “Esquire?”

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Yes?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        It’s just an old-fashioned word.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Well where I come from —

           But before he can finish something OCCURS TO HIM.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH (CONT’D)
                        — SHIT.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Pardon?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        What color was the man’s uniform?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        ...What?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        The man who burnt up? He was 
                        wearing a uniform. What color was 
                        it?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        I have no idea —

           To Agnes’ surprise Paul abruptly RUNS OFF —

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        — I beg your pardon, Ma’am —

           He runs to the firemen, and the SMOKING CORPSE they’re trying 
           to tear down.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH (CONT’D)
                             (re: corpse)
                        Can I see the body?

                                 FIREMAN
                        You should back away, Sir.
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Please. Just let me get eye-to-eye 
                        with him for a second. 

           ON PAUL: Trying to look over the fireman’s shoulder at the 
           charred corpse. It’s been burnt completely black.

                                 FIREMAN
                        He doesn’t have any eyes.

           INT (GASLAMPS) CARTER, HUGHES & CRAVATH - MANHATTAN

           That night, Paul walks down the hall of his tiny, three-
           person law firm with his fellow junior partner CHARLES HUGHES 
           — 30, smarmy, he dreams of running for president one day. (He 
           actually will: In 1916 he’ll lose to Woodrow Wilson.)

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        ... And then there were two!

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        A man just died.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        But the man who died worked for Mr. 
                        Lynch! Not our client. You’re sure 
                        the uniform was green?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        That’s what the fireman told me. It 
                        was the most horrible thing I’ve 
                        ever witnessed.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        This is fantastic.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        A human soul has passed on.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        So has a major corporation! Lynch 
                        built the wires that burnt that man 
                        alive. The press will chew his 
                        company to a nub. “Electrical power 
                        that’s not safe to light an 
                        outhouse,” that kind of thing. 
                        Lynch will be out of business in a 
                        week. Which means...?

           ON PAUL: Wearily, he has to agree with Hughes’ analysis.
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Which means that with Lynch 
                        gone, there will be only two 
                        companies left competing to wire 
                        this country for electric light.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        And we represent one of them! 
                        Before it was a melee. Now it’s a 
                        duel. Edison General Electric 
                        versus the Westinghouse Electric 
                        Company. Will you, for one second, 
                        just smile and acknowledge our good 
                        fortune?

           Paul regards Hughes’ indelicate enthusiasm. It’s grotesque, 
           but Hughes isn’t wrong.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... This is good news.

                                 WALTER CARTER (O.S.)
                        Boys!

           They both turn to see their senior partner down the hall: 
           WALTER CARTER — 60s, attorney as artisan, he handles a case 
           the way a master cobbler would a leather sole.

           He does not look happy.

                                 WALTER CARTER (CONT’D)
                        This is no time for celebration. 
                        There’s been terrible news.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT (GASLAMP) CARTER, HUGHES & CRAVATH - CARTER’S OFFICE

           Some minutes later, Paul and Hughes sit before Carter.

           A SINGLE GASLAMP in the corner FLICKERS unhelpfully.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                             (re: the lamp)
                        Paul, would you...?

           Obediently, Paul walks over to the gaslamp and fiddles with 
           the NOZZLE. The light BLINKS ominously.

           Darkness... Light... Darkness... Light...
                                 WALTER CARTER (CONT’D)
                        Thomas Edison is suing George 
                        Westinghouse for patent 
                        infringement.

                      CHARLES HUGHES
                                                      PAUL CRAVATH
           Shit.
                                              Damn.

           Paul’s FIDDLING with the gaslamp finds success, and the room 
           is finally coated in a dim flicker.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                             (re: papers on his desk)
                        This will be filed in New York 
                        State Court tomorrow. A friend gave 
                        me warning. Edison is using his 
                        patent on the light bulb to ask for 
                        an injunction against Westinghouse. 
                        Forbidding the manufacture or sale 
                        of any such devices. 

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        With Lynch gone, Edison is forced 
                        to compete head-to-head. So he’s 
                        arguing that Westinghouse has no 
                        legal right to compete at all.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        Why fight a duel when you can win 
                        before it starts?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Edison’s light bulb patent is 
                        airtight. Famously so.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        He’s won every single suit he’s 
                        filed on the matter. Dozens? 
                        Hundreds? Paul, you’ll check the 
                        case history.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                             (nods)
                        I don’t see a path to victory for 
                        Westinghouse here.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        I agree. We should advise our 
                        client to go back to the railroad 
                        business. Sell off his electrical 
                        work while it’s still worth 
                        something, leave the field to 
                        Edison.
                                 WALTER CARTER
                        And now you see the true nature of 
                        our difficulty.

           ON PAUL AND HUGHES: They don’t.

           With a weary sigh, Carter explains further —

                                 WALTER CARTER (CONT’D)
                        I have known George Westinghouse 
                        for 20 years. I have represented 
                        him in dozens of contract disputes; 
                        negotiated a hundred deals with 
                        suppliers on his behalf; the man is 
                        obstinate. And more problematic 
                        still — he’s a man of certain 
                        principles. He is going to want to 
                        fight the injunction.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        That would be a mistake. There 
                        could even be damages against him — 
                        punitive. It’s not worth the risk.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        Indeed.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Sir, you should talk him out of it. 
                        Explain to him that his case is 
                        unwinnable, and that a carefully 
                        choreographed retreat would be the 
                        prudent course of action.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        No.
                             (beat)
                        You should.

           ON PAUL: Pardon?

           ON HUGHES: Pardon?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Me?

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        I was impressed by your work on the 
                        Kuhn & Loeb suits last month. 
                        You’ve developed quite a persuasive 
                        way with words. We need someone to 
                        talk some sense into old George, 
                        and I was hoping you might be the 
                        man for the job.
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        You’re assigning me to litigate 
                        Edison v. Westinghouse?

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        No. I’m assigning you to make quite 
                        certain that we don’t have to.
                             (beat)
                        Unless, of course, you don’t think 
                        you’re ready?

           ON PAUL: This is an amazing promotion. Even if it’s only to 
           talk their client out of fighting the case.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        No no, Sir. I’m ready. Thank you. 
                        For the opportunity.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        This will be a valuable learning 
                        experience for you, young man. The 
                        hardest part of our profession is 
                        not handling your opponent — it is 
                        managing your own client.

           INT (GASLAMPS) METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - 39TH STREET

           ARMED GUARDS PATROL A SPANISH PRISON.

           Well, fake guards. In a fake Spanish prison. This is a 
           THEATRICAL SET on the stage of the (new) Metropolitan Opera 
           House.

           And bursting into action on that set is Agnes Huntington, 
           SINGING the lead role as Leonore in Beethoven’s only opera, 
           “Fidelio.”

           As her song describes the daring prison break she engineers 
           for her husband, we realize that Agnes is the star of the 
           show.

           And as she SINGS, in German no less, we can tell why.

           Her song ENDS, and Agnes takes a triumphant BOW to RAPTUROUS 
           APPLAUSE as we —

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT (ELECTRIC LIGHTS) METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - DRESSING 
           ROOM

           AGNES’S FACE UNDER HARSH ELECTRIC LIGHT.
           She’s staring into her dressing room mirror, which has, only 
           hours before, been wired up with ELECTRIC LIGHT BULBS.

           ON AGNES: Staring at the contours of her face... The lines, 
           the shadows, the imperfections...

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                             (re: the lights)
                        ... I don’t like it.

           REVEAL: Behind Agnes, waiting patiently, is FANNIE HUNTINGTON 
           — 50s, she has been Agnes’ business-minded manager for nearly 
           as long as she’s been her mother.

                                 FANNIE HUNTINGTON
                        I didn’t imagine that you would. 
                        You need to get used to the lights 
                        before they’re put up on the stage.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        They cannot expect me to sing under 
                        these things.

                                 FANNIE HUNTINGTON
                        The public loves the novelty. 

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        I don’t feel safe.

                                 FANNIE HUNTINGTON
                        After what happened on the 
                        street... I understand. But these 
                        bulbs are top quality. The House 
                        Manager said they’re direct from 
                        the laboratory of Thomas Edison 
                        himself.

           Agnes thinks about this. Looks again at the light bulbs.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                             (realizing)
                        Damn it, the House Manager told you 
                        what the autumn production is, 
                        didn’t you?

                                 FANNIE HUNTINGTON
                        Well, I don’t know precisely —

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        — MOTHER.

           ON FANNIE: Should she tell her daughter?
                                 FANNIE HUNTINGTON
                        I’ve heard it might — possibly — be 
                        “Paul Jones.”

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        The only female part in “Paul 
                        Jones” is a scullery maid.

                                 FANNIE HUNTINGTON
                        You know how these historical 
                        tragedies are — bunch of men 
                        ranting and raving at each other.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Because there weren’t any women in 
                        history?

                                 FANNIE HUNTINGTON
                        There won’t be unless I can urge 
                        them to mount a different 
                        production.
                             (re: lights)
                        By giving the managers, and the 
                        audience, something in return.

           ON AGNES: There is absolutely nothing she can do about this, 
           is there? Play ball... Or play a scullery maid.

           If only this light did not creep her out so much.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        ... I’d like to send a thank you to 
                        the man who helped me. On the 
                        street.

                                 FANNIE HUNTINGTON
                        That’s polite.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Tickets, perhaps.

                                 FANNIE HUNTINGTON
                        I’ll tell the girls upstairs. 
                        What’s his name?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Paul Cravath.
                             (beat)
                        I believe he’s some sort of 
                        attorney?

                                                                CUT TO:
           I/E (DAYLIGHT) PENNSYLVANIA LMTD - FIRST CLASS CAR - SEQUENCE

           Paul walks through a FIRST CLASS TRAIN CAR. He makes sure his 
           jacket doesn’t wrinkle as he takes his seat.

           INT (DAYLIGHT) PENN STATION PLATFORMS - PITTSBURGH - SEQUENCE

           Paul checks his jacket for wrinkles before he descends onto 
           the platform.

           He’s met by a SERVANT, who leads him to... 

           ... a PRIVATE TRAIN PLATFORM.

           Only one line runs from this platform. That line runs one 
           train. And that train consists of one car. That car is:

           INT (DAYLIGHT) GLEN AYRE - SOLE CAR - PENNSYLVANIA - SEQUENCE

           The GLEN AYRE is the 1880s version of a G5 — a private train 
           decorated in REAL GOLDS and SILVERS.

           Paul again carefully folds his jacket for the journey.

           WHITE-TAILED SERVANTS serve an afternoon snack of FRESH 
           OYSTERS that Paul doesn’t eat before the Glen Ayre pulls to a 
           stop at:

           EXT (DAYLIGHT) PRIVATE STATION - HOMEWOOD, PA - SEQUENCE

           Paul is greeted by yet another SERVANT, who loads him into a 
           CARRIAGE.

           The carriage carries him through ACRES OF MANICURED LAWNS —

           — Down a WINDING DIRT PATH and under a FOREST OF WILLOWS to —

           EXT (DAYLIGHT) WESTINGHOUSE ESTATE - MAIN VILLA - SEQUENCE

           The PALATIAL WHITE BRICK VILLA that composes the nucleus of 
           the massive Westinghouse Estate.

           INT (DAYLIGHT) WESTINGHOUSE ESTATE - MAIN HALLWAYS - SEQUENCE

           Inside, the BUTLER leads Paul down thick-carpeted corridors. 
           As they come to a doorway, Paul prepares to enter...

           ... But catches the Butler’s eyes drifting to something on 
           his jacket.
           Paul looks down, embarrassed to find a WHITE THREAD that 
           somehow, despite his care, got caught there. He picks it off.

           The Butler ushers Paul into —

           INT (DAYLIGHT) WESTINGHOUSE ESTATE - MAIN VILLA - KITCHEN

           Paul enters the kitchen to meet his new client for the first 
           time: GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE — 42, a Pennsylvania family man who 
           grew up middle-class and built a burgeoning railroad 
           business, he is more craftsman than scientist.

           To Paul’s surprise, Westinghouse is calmly CHOPPING 
           VEGETABLES for a salad with his five-year-old son, GEORGE JR, 
           and his wife MARGUERITE — 40s, seems never to have committed 
           an inelegant act in her life.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                             (to George Jr)
                        You see, if you slice through all 
                        the way, the onion falls apart. But 
                        if you refine your slice and then 
                        turn it —
                             (seeing Paul)
                        — Ah! You must be Walter Carter’s 
                        boy. I’m George Westinghouse.

           ON PAUL: This is not quite the meeting he was expecting.

           Marguerite smiles at Paul politely while George Jr struggles 
           with the onion.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Paul Cravath. It’s an honor, Sir.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                             (to George Jr.)
                        That’s good, that’s good, now turn 
                        the onion over.

                                 MARGUERITE WESTINGHOUSE
                             (to George Jr)
                        Careful with the knife.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                             (to Marguerite)
                        He’s doing terrific.
                             (to George Jr)
                        Aren’t you?

                                 MARGUERITE WESTINGHOUSE
                        If he cuts himself, you’re sleeping 
                        in the guest house.
           ON PAUL: Feels like he’s an intruder on this family moment.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                             (to Paul)
                        So what would you like to talk 
                        about?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Sir, would it be best to 
                        discuss our business in private?

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Anything you can say to me, you can 
                        say to Marguerite. She has a better 
                        head for the law than I ever did.

                                 MARGUERITE WESTINGHOUSE
                        I have a better head for cutlery as 
                        well, apparently.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        He’s doing terrific!

           George Jr triumphantly SLICES through the onion, sending 
           cubes FLYING across the cutting board.

           Westinghouse is clearly proud. Marguerite remains suspicious.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... I’m here to discuss Thomas 
                        Edison’s lawsuit against you.

                        How do you think we should respond?

                             (playing it cool)
                        Well, I am of two minds. On the one 
                        hand, electricity could be a 
                        valuable business in the future. At 
                        the moment, the light bulb is the 
                        only thing it’s good for, but who 
                        knows what sorts of devices one 
                        might eventually be able to power 
                        with it.

                        Anything is possible. But on the 
                        other hand, though...

                        From a legal perspective, it is 
                        difficult to see a clear path 
                        around Edison’s injunction. Around 
                        his patent.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        “Difficult?”

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I’ve been thinking of it in terms 
                        of risk versus reward. If we fight, 
                        there are great risks — punitive 
                        damages, a long, costly legal 
                        battle with an uncertain outcome. 
                        Conversely, if we take a step back 
                        — figure out a deal to sell off 
                        your electrical holdings for a tidy 
                        profit — we’d face little risk and 
                        certain reward.
                             (beat)
                        So as I said: I’m of two minds.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Gosh, I can see why this is such a 
                        tricky decision.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Yes.

           Westinghouse looks up at Paul.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Kid, will you stop lawyering me?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Pardon?

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        “Two minds?” Please. You came here 
                        to convince me to roll over. To 
                        abandon the field of electricity 
                        and leave it to Edison.

           ON PAUL: Caught. Perhaps he was not as subtle as he’d hoped.

           So now it’s time for total honesty.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Sir, in my professional opinion, I 
                        do not believe this case can be 
                        won.

           ON WESTINGHOUSE: Taking this in thoughtfully.
                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        ... Marguerite and George, Jr here 
                        are my two favorite people on God’s 
                        earth. And yet every single day I 
                        go down the road to my lab and toil 
                        all night with my engineers to 
                        build the best electrical device in 
                        the world. Why would I do that? 
                        What am I fighting for?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH

                        Then let me show you.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT (DAYLIGHT) WORLD’S FAIR GROUNDS - CHICAGO - SEQUENCE

           600 ACRES OF MUD extend across the South Side of Chicago.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE (V.O.)
                        The United States of America has 
                        just won the right to host its 
                        first World’s Fair. The century’s 
                        greatest showcase of human 
                        technological achievement will not 
                        be in Paris. It will not be in 
                        London. It will be in Chicago.

           Amidst all that mud, a construction project larger than the 
           pyramids of Egypt is already under way. A HUNDRED SKELETAL 
           WOODEN STRUCTURES rise up from the wet ground.

           It’s as if someone is building 100 Taj Mahals next door to a 
           pig sty. (That’s also literally what’s happening, as the 
           city’s oldest slaughterhouse is only a half mile away.)

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE (V.O.)
                        Daniel Burnham is designing a city 
                        of white marble. George Ferris is 
                        building some great big wheel that 
                        I’m told will be larger than the 
                        Eiffel Tower.

           We see THOUSANDS OF WORKMEN digging a grand LAGOON in the 
           center of the grounds.

           The construction of the world’s first FERRIS WHEEL is just 
           beginning — the spokes haven’t been attached yet.
                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE (V.O.)
                        The fair grounds will be wired for 
                        the newest wonder of the century: 
                        electricity.

           We see the workmen raising ELECTRICAL POLES — but there are 
           no wires on them. Not yet.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE (V.O.)
                        All told, the Fair Committee 
                        estimates that 25 million people 
                        will pour through those gates. For 
                        most of them, it will be their 
                        first time seeing electric lights. 
                        The question is, whose light will 
                        they see?

           INT (ELECTRIC LIGHTS) WESTINGHOUSE ESTATE - LABORATORY

           A MURKY BLACKNESS.

           Suddenly, an ELECTRIC LIGHT BULB BURSTS TO LIFE...

           ... REVEAL: Paul stands with Westinghouse in the latter’s 
           laboratory “testing room”.

           A SINGLE LIGHT BULB SHINES A DIM GREENISH GLOW from a table 
           in the room’s center. Paul struggles to get accustomed to the 
           unsettling light.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        That’s Edison’s light bulb?

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Dim. Displeasing. And it won’t last 
                        more than a few days. It’s just 
                        shoddy. Now, my bulb, on the other 
                        hand...

           Westinghouse UNSCREWS Edison’s crappy light bulb from the 
           socket and replaces it with his own...

           ... Westinghouse’s bulbs COATS the room in a BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN 
           ORANGE LIGHT.

                             (can’t deny it)
                        It’s beautiful.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        I did not steal Edison’s design. I 
                        improved upon it. Tremendously. 
                        He’s embarrassed. I’m only a 
                        railroad man. I made my fortune on 
                        air brakes and wheel pistons; he 
                        made his on telegraphs and 
                        telephones. Yet here I am, 
                        engineering the pants off of him 
                        from Pittsburgh.
                             (beat)
                        And mine is safer, too. One of my 
                        workmen isn’t going to immolate on 
                        Broadway. 

           ON PAUL: Hoping no one else has to suffer what he saw that 
           man suffer the other morning.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        If we compete on even terrain, I 
                        will win. So Edison has enlisted 
                        the legal system to prevent me from 
                        competing at all.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I know that the law can sometimes 
                        seem unfair —

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        — “May the best work win.” 
                        Shouldn’t that be what this country 
                        is all about?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        The law doesn’t say “best.” The law 
                        says “first.”

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        And you wonder why people hate 
                        lawyers.

           ON PAUL: It’s hard to argue with that.

           case is impossible.

           Isn’t it?

           INT (DAYLIGHT) CARTER, HUGHES & CRAVATH - PAUL’S OFFICE

           Paul works at his desk, carefully examining two different 
           LIGHT BULB DESIGNS — Edison’s and Westinghouse’s. They’re 
           similar... But the different shapes are apparent even to a 
           layman’s eye.

           He’s interrupted by the arrival of:

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        ... Well? How’d it go with 
                        Westinghouse? Did you convince him 
                        not to go to court?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I wouldn’t quite say that.

           ON HUGHES: Seeing a flash of earnestness across Paul’s face.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        ... Oh dear God don’t tell me 
                        you’re falling for that kindly old 
                        scientist routine. Paul.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Did you know that Westinghouse is 
                        right? I had a consultant look at 
                        it — his light bulbs really are 
                        safer.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        Look, I forget which low-country 
                        backwater you grew up in —

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        — I’m from Tennessee —

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        — But you cannot be this naive. If 
                        Westinghouse is sued into 
                        bankruptcy, it won’t just ruin your 
                        career — it’ll ruin mine. I’m 
                        supposed to handle his taxes next 
                        year!
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I’ve always been moved by your kind 
                        and selfless heart.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        This is exactly what Carter was 
                        afraid of.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        What are you talking about?

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        Why do you think he assigned you to 
                        the case?
                             (off Paul’s look)
                        Because he had a hunch that 
                        Westinghouse would do something 
                        crazy — like fighting Edison — and 
                        he wanted to make sure the ensuing 
                        disaster did not fall on his 
                        record.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Carter thought I was ready.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        If this goes to court, Westinghouse 
                        is going to get demolished. Carter 
                        will need someone to blame. Who do 
                        you think that’s going to be?

           ON PAUL: Carter wouldn’t do that to him... Would he?

                                 CHARLES HUGHES (CONT’D)
                        ... There is an unimaginable sum of 
                        money on the line here. Do not be 
                        an idiot.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Westinghouse doesn’t care about the 
                        money. This is personal for him.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        You’re his lawyer. So it better not 
                        get personal for you.

           ON PAUL: Thinking. But before he can respond, there’s a KNOCK 
           at the door.

           Both men turn to see Paul’s SECRETARY, bearing a telegram.

                                 SECRETARY
                        I figured I should hand this to you 
                        straight away.
                                 (MORE)
                                 SECRETARY (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        It’s from Thomas Edison.

           Paul and Hughes share a look: “Holy shit.”

           Paul takes the telegram, opens it —

           ON THE TELEGRAM: “Mr. Cravath — My office — Midnight — Much 
           to discuss — T Edison”

           ON PAUL AND HUGHES: What the hell is Edison up to?

           EXT (STARLIGHT) CARTER, HUGHES & CRAVATH - 120 BROADWAY - 
           LATER

           Paul exits his office building into the dim night. The 
           streets are lit by prehistoric COAL LAMP — barely twenty feet 
           of cobblestones are exposed in any direction.

           Paul HAILS A PASSING TWO-HORSE HANSOM —

           I/E (STARLIGHT) HANSOM - TRAVELLING UP BROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

           — Which, after Paul boards, clatters uptown.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        65 Fifth Avenue, please.

           The CABBIE turns around.

                                 CABBIE
                        You’re going to see The Wizard?

           Paul gives a look: He hates it when people call Edison that.

           The Cabbie grasps the reins and the men ride past the quiet 
           canyons of Houston Street —

           — Between the FASHIONABLE ROW HOUSES OF 14TH STREET —

           — All dim by the light of coal-gas and a sliver of moon —

           — Until the horses pull around a corner and SUDDENLY:

           A BRIGHT HEAVEN GLITTERS BEFORE THEM ON FIFTH AVENUE.

           Fifth Avenue is lit by ELECTRIC ARC LAMPS, which makes it 
           many times brighter than the surrounding blocks.

           Both Paul and his Cabbie BLINK. It’s as if they’re driving 
           from the 19th century into the 20th. 
           Paul looks ahead to —

           EXT (STARLIGHT) EDISON GENERAL ELECTRIC - 65 FIFTH AVE 

           65 FIFTH AVE is a six story building bathed in electric light 
           that bursts from the windows on the top floor. This building 
           is both literally and figuratively the source of this 
           shimmering, crystalline future.

           There are TWO GUARDS outside the building. They display their 
           REMINGTON PISTOLS at their waists, and then gesture at Paul 
           to be similarly forthcoming.

           Paul opens his coat, showing that he’s unarmed.

           Satisfied, the Guards pass Paul to Edison’s right-hand AIDE:

                                 AIDE
                        Mr. Edison is expecting you.

           The Aide ushers Paul through the glass doors —

           INT (GASLAMP) EDISON GENERAL ELECTRIC - CONTINUOUS

           — And up the polished marble staircase —

           INT (ELECTRIC LIGHT) EDISON GENERAL ELECTRIC - CORNER OFFICE

           — And into the CORNER OFFICE from which this business is run.

           Paul BLINKS: Along the walls is an ARRAY OF ELECTRIC LIGHT 
           BULBS, dozens of them formed into the shape of a single word:

           E          D           I           S           O           N

           Paul is frozen under the lights.

                                 THOMAS EDISON (O.S.)
                        Hello.

           Paul turns to see:

           THOMAS EDISON — 41, he was homeless as a teenager and made 
           his first million by the time he was 30. His is not a 
           position that one attains through a lack of drive or 
           willpower.

                                 THOMAS EDISON (CONT’D)
                        My name is Thomas Edison.
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                             (re: light bulb display)
                        I can see that.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        It’s for the World’s Fair. I 
                        thought it might be helpful, after 
                        I light it up, to let the public 
                        know under whose bulbs they frolic.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Paul Cravath. Esquire.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        You’re Walter Carter’s apprentice.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        His junior partner.

           ON EDISON: “Ooooh. Fancy.”

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        One of my attorneys said he taught 
                        you. In law school.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Mr. Lowrey. Yes.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        He said you were quite the student.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I’m flattered.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        He said you graduated first in your 
                        class.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I did.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        18 months ago.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        And now you’re Walter Carter’s ... 
                        “junior partner.” You must be very 
                        ambitious, young man.
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I cannot imagine seeming ambitious 
                        — or young — to someone who 
                        registered his first patent by 21 
                        and made his first million by 30.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Well at least our respect is 
                        mutual.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... How may I help you tonight, Mr. 
                        Edison?

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        So yesterday, my man was in 
                        Chicago, taking some measurements 
                        of the fair grounds. And do you 
                        know what my man said? He said that 
                        he saw one of George Westinghouse’s 
                        engineers on the grounds as well. 
                        At first I figured, well, perhaps 
                        the fellow is just excited about 
                        the Ferris Wheel. But then I had a 
                        wild thought: What if Westinghouse 
                        is actually going to fight my 
                        injunction? Because that would be a 
                        tragedy.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        We’re leaving our options open.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Your “options”?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        It is my job, as counsel to Mr. 
                        Westinghouse, to present him with 
                        as many options as possible.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        May I present you with another 
                        “option”?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Of course.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Great. If you’d like, I have the 
                        option of bankrupting your foolish 
                        client, ruining your fledgling 
                        firm, and ending your once-
                        promising career before you ever 
                        make it into a courtroom.
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Are you threatening me?

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Oh, young man. I don’t have to 
                        threaten you.
                             (turns)
                        Do you like the view?

           Edison gestures to the windows: Outside, Manhattan’s SKYLINE 
           simmers in a glow of burning oil.

           At the far edge, Paul can make out the STATUE OF LIBERTY, 
           just visible all the way from Bedloe’s island. The TORCH 
           shines bright: It’s lit with electrical light.

                                 THOMAS EDISON (CONT’D)
                        We've been having trouble with the 
                        Pearl Street station recently. Some 
                        instabilities.

           Edison RUNS HIS FINGERS across the desk to a BLACK BUTTON at 
           the far edge....

           ... Edison TAPS THE BLACK BUTTON...

           ... And suddenly the TORCH ATOP THE STATUE OF LIBERTY GOES 
           DARK.

           ON PAUL: Starring, stunned, at the black space where he used 
           to be able to see the Statue.

                                 THOMAS EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Gas was such a predictable thing. 
                        You take a heap of coal. You heat 
                        it, filter it, pressurize it, 
                        strike a match, and... voila. 
                        Electricity is trickier. So many 
                        different kinds of filaments, 
                        casings, vacuums. And yet the old 
                        system of power crumbles into 
                        obsolescence. Do you know, the 
                        police tell me that when my lights 
                        go up in a public space, all manner 
                        of horrid violence decreases? Men’s 
                        working days are no longer bound by 
                        the setting sun. Factories double 
                        their production. Midnight and noon 
                        grow indistinct. The nighttime of 
                        our ancestors is ending. Electric 
                        light is the future. The man who 
                        controls it will not simply make an 
                        unimaginable fortune. He will not 
                        simply dictate politics. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 THOMAS EDISON (CONT’D)
                        He won't merely control Wall 
                        Street, or Washington, or the 
                        newspapers... No no no. The man who 
                        controls electricity will control 
                        the very moon in the sky.

           And with that, Thomas Edison PRESSES his black button again 
           and THE STATUE'S TORCH BURST BACK TO LIFE.

                                 THOMAS EDISON (CONT’D)
                        If you think you can stop me, I 
                        invite you to try. But you'll have 
                        to do it in the dark.

           EXT (STARLIGHT) EDISON GENERAL ELECTRIC - 65 FIFTH AVE

           A few minutes later, Paul EXITS the front door of Edison 
           General Electric.

           He takes a quiet breath of spring air. Above him, the 
           starlight of the gods. Behind him, the man-made light of 
           Thomas Edison.

           ON PAUL: He is about to go head-to-head against one of the 
           most powerful men in the world.

           INT (DAYLIGHT) CARTER, HUGHES & CRAVATH - MANHATTAN

           A pair of DELIVERY MEN truck BOX after BOX of papers into 
           Paul’s office.

           Paul watches with Carter and Hughes as their offices are 
           packed floor-to-ceiling with dozens of boxes of documents.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        ... 310 lawsuits.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES

                             (off his look)
                        Rhode Island and Maine suits are in 
                        the corner.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        Thomas Edison is suing every 
                        Westinghouse partner. Every local 
                        company he’s ever done business 
                        with.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        Or might do business with.
                                 WALTER CARTER
                        Edison is no longer just trying to 
                        block Westinghouse from selling 
                        lights to the World’s Fair. Now 
                        he’s trying to put him out of 
                        business entirely.
                             (to Paul)
                        I assigned you to make sure we did 
                        not have to litigate a losing case. 
                        Now you’ve managed to get us 
                        litigating 310 of them.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Our client has requested a vigorous 
                        defense.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        You’re about to vigorously defend 
                        him into bankruptcy.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        What Edison is doing is 
                        fundamentally unfair. Edison can 
                        own his specific design of a light 
                        bulb, but nobody should be able to 
                        own the idea of a light bulb. This 
                        goes right back to the Constitution 
                        — patents were established to 
                        defend the rights of outsider 
                        geniuses and to foster innovation. 
                        Not to stifle it. What Edison is 
                        attempting is a perversion of the 
                        law.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        ... I sincerely hope your argument 
                        in court is better than that.

           ON PAUL: Frustrated, but this is still his boss.

           But they’re interrupted by the arrival of Paul’s Secretary:

                                 SECRETARY
                             (to Paul)
                        A visitor for you.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        Christ. Who is Edison suing now?
                                 SECRETARY
                        I don’t think she’s here about Mr. 
                        Edison.

           ON THE MEN: “She?”

                                 SECRETARY (CONT’D)
                        It’s Miss Agnes Huntington.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT (DAYLIGHT) CARTER, HUGHES & CRAVATH - PAUL’S OFFICE

           A minute later, Paul leads Agnes into his office.

           Embarrassed about the mess, he tries to find her a place to 
           sit —

           — There’s not much he can do.

           She graciously doesn’t seem to mind.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... I apologize for not recognizing 
                        you. On the street.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Would you have behaved any less 
                        gallantly if you had?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I’d at least have had the manners 
                        to get your name.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        If you’d recognized me, you 
                        wouldn’t have needed to.

           ON PAUL: She’s got him there. And she’s witty about it.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        How may I be of service to you, 
                        Miss Huntington?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        First, I wanted to offer you these.
                             (removes tickets from her 
                              purse)
                        Tickets to the Metropolitan Opera. 
                        To say thank you.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        There’s no need.
                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        There is. And a pair of orchestra 
                        seats doesn’t even begin to cover 
                        it.
                             (beat)
                        And second... Well I’ve found 
                        myself lately in need of a lawyer.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        A lawyer?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        You are one, right? “Esquire”, and 
                        all that.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Yes.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                             (removes papers as well)
                        My contract with the opera house. I 
                        was wondering if you could look 
                        over it for me. The owners — you 
                        know, JP Morgan and his friends — 
                        want to mount a new production in 
                        the autumn — one in which I might 
                        not play a part. Are they able to 
                        cancel my contract so easily?

           Paul looks at the contracts in her hand — and at the tickets 
           she’s placed on his desk.

           ON PAUL: Making a surprisingly serious decision.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... I’m sorry, Miss. I’m afraid I 
                        cannot be of assistance.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Pardon?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        It’s just this case... Edison v. 
                        Westinghouse. I cannot be 
                        distracted from it. I hope you 
                        understand. May I recommend another 
                        attorney?

           ON AGNES: Is Paul actually saying no to her? When was the 
           last time someone said no to her?

           She stands, somewhat offended.
                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        That’s quite all right, Mr. 
                        Cravath. I’ll find my own attorney, 
                        thank you.

           And with that, she leaves.

           ON PAUL: Watching her go. Pissed at himself for having to do 
           this. And yet these are the sacrifices required of him, are 
           they not?

           Charles Hughes pops his head in the doorway:

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        ... Did you just turn down Agnes 
                        Huntington?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                             (re: boxes in the hall)
                        I don’t exactly have an excess of 
                        time right now.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        Do you have any idea how much seats 
                        at the Met cost?
                             (beat)
                        Can I have your tickets?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        This case is the only thing that 
                        matters right now. All right? I 
                        have to find a way to win.

           ON HUGHES: And how the hell are you going to do that?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT (DAYLIGHT) COURT HOUSE - LOWER MANHATTAN

           Paul enters a lower Manhattan court house, winding through 
           the halls to find —

           — The COURT CLERK behind his desk.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I’m here to file a lawsuit, please.

                                 COURT CLERK
                        All right...
                             (taking out paperwork)
                        ... And who are you suing, Sir?
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I’m suing Thomas Edison.

           Off of the clerk’s shocked face we —

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT (DAYLIGHT) EDISON ESTATE - MENLO PARK, NJ

           A MESSENGER scurries from Edison’s austere MANSION — it has 
           23 separate fireplaces — to his massive “R & D” LABORATORY, 
           just down the road.

           INT (DAYLIGHT) EDISON LABORATORY - MENLO PARK - CONTINUOUS

           The Messenger, clutching a telegram, enters the laboratory, 
           moving past the ROWS of ENGINEERS —

           — To Edison’s OFFICE in the rear.

           The Messenger enters, delivering the telegram to Edison’s 
           attorney, GROSVENOR LOWREY — 50s, one of the most esteemed 
           eminence grisé in the New York legal community.

           Lowrey reads it and nods before turning back to his client.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        ... Confirmation from London. My 
                        God, I’ll say this kid is a smart 
                        one.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        You cannot be serious.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        I can. Mr. Cravath’s technique here 
                        is ingenious. He’s bought Sawyer & 
                        Man’s British light bulb patents, 
                        and is using them to counter-sue 
                        you in American court. Their patent 
                        predates yours, so he now claims 
                        that your light bulbs infringe on 
                        his patent.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Sawyer & Man’s design doesn’t even 
                        work.
                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        Which places us in the unenviable 
                        position of having to explain that 
                        to judges in both New York and 
                        London.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        If Cravath is so clever then 
                        perhaps I should hire him to 
                        represent me.

           ON LOWREY: He’s just going to swallow that insult.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        ... That won’t be necessary. He’s 
                        stalling for time, but it won’t 
                        work and he knows it.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        This needs to be handled before 
                        bidding begins on the fair.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        It will be.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        I told you that the lawsuit alone 
                        would not be sufficient to 
                        eliminate Westinghouse.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        Sir, we agreed upon this course of 
                        action. It is going to take a 
                        little time, but I assure you that 
                        Westinghouse will back down and you 
                        will win the fair. You just need to 
                        be patient.

           ON EDISON: “Patience” is not exactly a virtue he’s known for.

           But before he can respond they’re interrupted by —

                                 DASH EDISON (O.S.)
                        God damn you.

           Both men TURN at the arrival of DASH EDISON — 20, inherited 
           all of his father’s moxie but little of his genius.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        I’ll leave you two alone.
                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Stay.
                             (to Dash)
                        Our appointment is not until five.

                                 DASH EDISON
                        You cannot schedule appointments 
                        with me like I am one of your 
                        goddamned employees.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        If you’re so keen on being a 
                        businessman, then I will treat you 
                        like a businessman.

                                 DASH EDISON
                        You are treating me like your 
                        competitors: You’re suing me.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Mr. Lowrey. Will you explain the 
                        situation to Mr. Edison?

           Lowrey looks back and forth between his client and his 
           client’s son: It is his task to be the voice of reason.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        ... Your father isn’t suing you. 
                        Precisely. He is simply trying to 
                        block your deal with the Morris 
                        Chemical Company.

                                 DASH EDISON
                        I sold them my ideas.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        They did not pay you for your 
                        ideas. They paid you for your name.

                                 DASH EDISON
                        They’ve renamed the company in my 
                        honor!

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        They’ve put the word “Edison” in 
                        the title so that their sales will 
                        triple.

                                 DASH EDISON
                        You think I have no value to anyone 
                        except as your son.
                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        I think that you are in possession 
                        of a very pricey surname. And it is 
                        not yours to sell.

                                 DASH EDISON
                        It’s our family name.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        I gave it to you. And I have 
                        instructed Mr. Lowrey to take it 
                        back.

           Dash looks between his father and Lowrey. He cannot believe 
           what is happening.

                                 DASH EDISON
                        ... You’re suing your only son for 
                        your name back?

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        The only thing a man has in this 
                        world is his name, do you 
                        understand? It’s high time that you 
                        earned yours.

           Dash doesn’t even know what else to say, and STORMS OFF.

           ON LOWREY: Handling difficult clients, like Edison, is why he 
           gets paid the big bucks.

           INT (DAYLIGHT) WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CO FACTORY - 
           PENNSYLVANIA

           The GRINDING of great big MACHINES reverberate through 
           Westinghouse’s massive factory. AIR BRAKES, WHEELS, 
           PISTONS... It’s all manufactured right here in the most 
           efficient, modern factory in the country.

           REVEAL: Westinghouse is making one of his frequent 
           inspections of the place — his eyes dart to little details, 
           checking for imperfections.

           Paul follows close behind.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        ... Sawyer & Man’s bulbs don’t even 
                        work.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I know. But they were first.

           ON WESTINGHOUSE: Kind of impressed.
                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Huh. So your counter-suit will be 
                        successful?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        No. The American courts will 
                        eventually realize the British 
                        patent is bad. But if Edison can 
                        use the legal system to bog us 
                        down, we can do the same thing to 
                        him. The counter-suit will buy us 
                        time.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Time for...?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Time for you to light the World’s 
                        Fair. And time for me to build 312 
                        defenses against 312 other 
                        lawsuits.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        It sounds like we both need an 
                        army.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Unfortunately, one cannot conscript 
                        people in an army of lawyers.

           Westinghouse takes a good long look at Paul.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        ... Do you know what size poppet 
                        valve to use on a twelve-inch brake 
                        cylinder?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Can’t say I do.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Can’t say I do either. But Bill 
                        does.

                              foreman)
                        You see Jim, over there?

                        He knows more about air reservoirs

                        with frame levers. 

           ON PAUL: Failing to see Westinghouse’s point.
                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Being the president of this company 
                        does not mean being the top expert 
                        on every facet of our work. It 
                        means knowing enough to hire people 
                        who know a lot more than I do. This 
                        company is a team.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        The law is not like a locomotive. 
                        You cannot manufacture legal work 
                        in a factory.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Why?

           Paul is about to answer...

           ... When he stops. He doesn’t have an answer, does he?

           Off of Paul’s thoughtful expression we —

                                                                CUT TO:

           Paul walks across the blocks-wide 47th STREET CAMPUS of his 
           alma mater — Columbia University Law School. (They won’t move 
           uptown for five more years.)

           INT (DAYLIGHT) COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - SEQUENCE

           A few minutes later, he stands at the back of a LAW SCHOOL 
           auditorium, where a GROUP OF STUDENTS are engaged in a MOCK 
           TRIAL.

           Paul is joined by their PROFESSOR, with whom Paul is still 
           friendly. They’re quiet as they watch the students argue.

           ON PAUL: Less than two years ago, he was one of them.

           INT (DAYLIGHT) COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - LATER

           After the debate is over, only FIVE STUDENTS have been chosen 
           to stay behind with Paul and the Professor.

           They sit in the front row as Paul addresses them:

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... What I am proposing is a 
                        hierarchical system of legal work.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH (CONT'D)
                        You will report to me, and I’ll 
                        report to Mr. Carter. Think of it 
                        like one of Mr. Westinghouse’s 
                        factories: If he has an industrial 
                        system for producing mass 
                        quantities of electrical work, why 
                        can’t we have an industrial system 
                        for performing legal work?

                                 LAW STUDENT #1
                             (confused)
                        Because a legal brief is nothing 
                        like a steel wire?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Who’s to say? We are facing an 
                        unprecedented legal assault. No one 
                        man can fight it. But a system... 
                        With all of your help...

           The Students all think: What Paul is proposing is unheard of. 
           (But this structure will eventually be the foundation of all 
           modern law firms.)

                                 LAW STUDENT #2
                        So we’d be attorneys?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Not exactly. You won’t have your 
                        licenses yet.

                                 LAW STUDENT #3
                        So we’d be clerks?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Not exactly. You’ll be performing 
                        highly skilled legal work.

                                 LAW STUDENT #4
                        So we’d at least be paid well?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Not exactly.
                             (beat)
                        Think of yourselves as.... 
                        “Associate attorneys.” Somewhere 
                        between lawyers and clerks, on the 
                        floor of a legal factory.

           The Students look to their Professor, who seems encouraging.

                                 LAW STUDENT #1
                        ... What’s in it for us, then?
                                 PROFESSOR
                        In a year, Mr. Cravath will promote 
                        whichever one of you does the best 
                        work to junior partner at his firm.
                             (beat)
                        But only one of you.

           The Law Students look at each other competitively as we —

           The five Law Students move into Paul’s office, which now 
           becomes their (increasingly cramped) bullpen.

           Carter, Hughes and Paul watch them move in. This is the 
           craziest thing the older lawyers have ever seen.

                             (to Paul)

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Yes.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        And who is going to pay for all of

           INT (DAYLIGHT) WESTINGHOUSE ESTATE - LABORATORY

           At his laboratory desk, George Westinghouse looks at a BILL 
           for legal services.

           His scowl indicates that the numbers involved are not small.

           REVEAL: Paul stands before him. Behind are ROWS of identical 
           workstations, at which DOZENS OF ENGINEERS work on projects 
           assigned to them by the boss. On every desk are the tell-tale 
           TUBES and WIRE COILS of 19th century science.

           It’s as if Dr. Frankenstein’s laboratory has been converted 
           into the Google campus.
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... I know that it’s expensive, but 
                        if the associates are successful in 
                        their task, their salaries will 
                        more than pay for themselves.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        And their task is...?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Simple: To find a flaw in Edison’s 
                        patent.
                             (beat)
                        The only way to win — in all of 
                        those lawsuits — is to prove that 
                        his patent is invalid. That there 
                        is some mistake there, somewhere, 
                        that makes it worthless.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        You think that if enough men devote 
                        enough hours to going through the 
                        documents, they can find some 
                        bullshit technicality on which to 
                        blow up the most valuable patent in 
                        America?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        And you wonder why people hate 
                        lawyers.

           Westinghouse smiles. Paul is becoming quite the attorney, 
           isn’t he?

           Westinghouse checks his watch.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        ... You missed the last train back.

           few PITTSBURGH GENTRY...

           ... And of course, Paul.

           He stares at the ARRAY OF GOLD CUTLERY before him on the 
           dining table: Over a dozen forks and knives, of intricately 
           differentiated sizes and shapes.

           ON PAUL: What the hell is it all for?

           Marguerite Westinghouse notices how out-of-place Paul is, and 
           gestures to the correct utensils for his benefit.

           He gives her a grateful nod.

                        his right hand to buy from his 
                        left. 

                                 RICH PITTSBURGH MAN
                        I’ll bet the World’s Fair will be 
                        thrilled to provide their audience 
                        with the same bulbs that the Met 
                        provides theirs.

                                 RICH PITTSBURGH WOMAN
                        George, are you going? To see the 
                        lights?

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                             (dismissive)
                        What do I want with New York?

                                 MARGUERITE WESTINGHOUSE
                        I’ve tried to get George to go to 
                        Manhattan once. He didn’t make it 
                        past Philadelphia.
           Everyone LAUGHS. Westinghouse pretends to be offended, for 
           comedic effect, before winking at Marguerite.

                                 RICH PITTSBURGH WOMAN
                        It’s impossible to find tickets 
                        anyway. And I’ve heard Agnes 
                        Huntington has been a terror to the 
                        stagehands.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        She’s seemed quite lovely to me.

           Everyone turns: What?

                                 RICH PITTSBURGH WOMAN
                        You know Agnes Huntington?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        We’ve met.
                             (beat)
                        Briefly.
                             (beat)
                        Some time back. She seemed very 
                        polite.

           ON THE GUESTS: Extremely impressed with the social calibre of 
           Westinghouse’s young lawyer.

                                 MARGUERITE WESTINGHOUSE
                             (to Paul)
                        Well then if I were you, I’d go see 
                        the lights. And tell your friend 
                        that we say hello, while you’re at 
                        it.

           ON PAUL: The attorney of George Westinghouse does belong at 
           the Metropolitan Opera... Doesn’t he?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT (DAYLIGHT) HABERDASHERY - LOWER EAST SIDE - SEQUENCE

           Paul is fitted for a proper NEW SUIT. There will be no 
           further need to borrow from Westinghouse.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH (V.O.)
                        “Dear Miss Huntington —”

           INT (GASLAMP) PAUL’S APARTMENT - 50TH STREET - SEQUENCE

           In his humble ONE-BEDROOM apartment, Paul dresses in WHITE 
           TIE for an evening out.
                                 PAUL CRAVATH (V.O.)
                        “If you could find it in your heart 
                        to pardon the belated nature of 
                        this reply, I would be most honored 
                        to join you at the opera.”

           Almost every inch of his tiny apartment is covered in LEGAL 
           DOCUMENTS, which he has to wade through on his way out.

           I/E (STARLIGHT) HANSOM - TRAVELLING ACROSS MIDTOWN - SEQUENCE

           Paul takes a HANSOM through LONGACRE SQUARE (later renamed 
           “Times Square”), the headquarters of all the big carriage 
           companies and a square half-mile of thieves, prostitutes, and 
           other low-end entertainments.

           INT (ELECTRIC LIGHTS) METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - DRESSING 
           ROOM

           Agnes RECEIVES Paul’s letter, along with the CONTRACTS she’d 
           given him.

           He’s NOTED up the contracts dutifully.

           ON AGNES: “Okay then...”

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON (V.O.)
                        “Dear Mr. Cravath — Of course the 
                        invitation still stands...”

           EXT (STARLIGHT) METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - 39TH ST - SEQUENCE

           Paul arrives outside the Metropolitan Opera House. Signs 
           announce the importance of the evening’s show:

           “FIRST PERFORMANCE UNDER EDISON’S ELECTRIC LIGHT!”

           Paul looks up at the sign, and at the HUNDRED IMPECCABLY 
           DRESSED RICH PEOPLE going in...

           ON PAUL: Well he’s sure made it, hasn’t he?

           INT (ELECTRIC LIGHTS) METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - STAGE

           Paul watches the empty stage from his orchestra seat.

           ON THE STAGE: Lit only by a long line of CANDLES, a SOLITARY 
           FIGURE walks out onto the stage. It’s too dim to see his 
           face...
           INT (ELECTRIC LIGHTS) MET OPERA HOUSE - DRESSING ROOM

           After the show, Paul migrates down to the subterranean 
           dressing rooms, where various members of the CAST and CREW 
           MINGLE with the SWELLS.

           Paul enters Agnes’ room to find her and Fannie enjoying 
           champagne with various DIGNITARIES.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Miss Huntington. That was 
                        marvelous.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Thank you. And thank you for 
                        looking over my contracts — seems 
                        the Met can do with me as they 
                        like, according to your analysis.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        After a performance such as that 
                        one, I can’t imagine the Met doing 
                        anything other than putting you 
                        front and center on the stage.

           ON AGNES: Flattered... But knows her position is more fragile 
           than it would appear.

           Fannie Huntington approaches, curious about who her daughter 
           is talking to.

                                 FANNIE HUNTINGTON
                             (to Paul)
                        Are you an admirer of the opera?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                             (off Paul’s inquiring 
                              look)
                        Meet my mother. Fannie Huntington.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Ma’am. I’m an admirer of any opera 
                        that your daughter is in.

                                 FANNIE HUNTINGTON
                        Which has been your favorite?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        This one.
                             (caught)
                        I haven’t seen any others.

           Agnes smiles.
           Fannie shrugs, then walks off to speak to someone more 
           important.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH (CONT’D)
                        ... Your mother is...

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        ... Protective.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Of you?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Of the position that we’ve earned.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Is this what you came to New York 
                        for?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        This is what everyone comes to New 
                        York for.

           ON PAUL: He can’t deny it. But it provokes a troubling 
           thought.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... I can’t get the image out of my 
                        head.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                             (knows exactly what he 
                              means)
                        The burning man. The nightmares 
                        haven’t stopped.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        So we have one thing in common.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        What?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        We have the same nightmares.

           A charged moment between the two of them.

           It’s interrupted by the arrival of an impeccably high-class 
           MAN named —

                                 HENRY JAYNE
                             (to Agnes)
                        Brava! Brava!
           He leans in and KISSES Agnes’ hand.

                                 HENRY JAYNE (CONT’D)
                             (to Paul)
                        Do we know each other? Henry Jayne.

           ON PAUL: Recognizing his name. Especially his surname.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I know you by reputation alone, Mr. 
                        Jayne. I’m Paul Cravath.

           ON HENRY: Does not recognize the name. Certainly not the 
           surname.

                                 HENRY JAYNE
                        I’m afraid I don’t have the 
                        pleasure of knowing your reputation 
                        yet, Mr... Cravath, you said?

           Jayne takes Agnes’ arm in his. Clearly, he’s been calling on 
           her for some time.

           ON PAUL: How could he have been so stupid as to not have 
           known that Agnes would be entwined with someone like Jayne?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Mr. Cravath is the attorney I told 
                        you about.

                                 HENRY JAYNE
                        Oh yes! You know my family is 
                        always in need of another good 
                        attorney. If you’d like some more 
                        work.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Kind of you to offer.

                                 HENRY JAYNE
                             (to Agnes)
                        Dearest, the gang is headed to the 
                        Player’s for a nightcap. You’ll 
                        come?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                             (to Henry)
                        As long as they have champagne.
                             (to Paul)
                        Will you join us?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I’m afraid I have to get back to 
                        the office.
                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Pity.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Good night.

           Paul SLINKS AWAY, almost rudely, as quickly as possible.

           ON AGNES: Watching him retreat, realizing his embarrassment.

           INT (GASLAMP) PAUL’S APARTMENT - 50TH STREET

           Some minutes later, Paul bursts into his apartment. He’s 
           pissed at himself for being so stupid as to ever think Agnes 
           might be interested in him.

           Paul turns on the single gaslamp in the corner. Looks around 
           at his cramped apartment; at the stacks of daunting, 
           impossible legal work in front of him. 

           He takes off his stiff, uncomfortable BOW TIE.

           Pours himself a WHISKEY as he settles in to work through the 
           night.

           EXT (DAYLIGHT) CARTER, HUGHES & CRAVATH - MANHATTAN

           The next morning, Paul enters his office building, rather 
           bleary-eyed from the night before —

           INT (DAYLIGHT) CARTER, HUGHES & CRAVATH - CONTINUOUS

           — But the very second he steps foot in the office he’s met by 
           an angry, blue-collar BUSINESSMAN who has clearly been 
           waiting for Paul’s arrival.

           The businessman’s name is:

                                 CHARLES COFFIN
                        ... Oh, so you do make it into the 
                        office every now and again, do you?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Pardon, who are you?

                                 CHARLES COFFIN
                        I’ve sent you six letters.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Mr. ... Green?
                                 CHARLES COFFIN
                        Mr. Coffin. Massachusetts. Green is 
                        your local man in Connecticut. 
                        Though I spoke with him yesterday 
                        and he’s just as furious as I am.

           ON PAUL: Realizing who this is. Feeling terrible.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Why don’t you join me in my 
                        office, Mr. Coffin, so we can 
                        discuss how I can help you?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT (DAYLIGHT) CARTER, HUGHES & CRAVATH - PAUL’S OFFICE

           Moments later, Paul takes a seat behind his desk.

           Coffin declines the offer for a chair.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Edison is trying to scare you.

                                 CHARLES COFFIN
                        He’s doing a good job of it.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        He has sued 311 other companies, 
                        just like yours, in order to get us 
                        to back down and give him the fair.

                        that.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        It’s a good school.

                        All you rich, New York lawyers... 
                        You don’t care about people like 
                        us, do you?

                        The second I saw that suit you’re 
                        wearing, I knew exactly what kind 
                        of man you were.

           ON PAUL: He just bought this suit last week. And he was so 
           proud of being able to afford it.

                        company. We render copper. I was 
                        the one who landed us the deal with 
                        Westinghouse — to supply his 
                        devices with copper wiring. 
                        Assemble them locally. God, I was 
                        so proud. And now I’m being sued 
                        for everything I have — and much 
                        more — by Thomas Edison.

           Minutes later, Paul BURSTS into the cramped conference room 
           that’s become his associate attorneys’ bullpen.  

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        No one is going home until we

                        Edison’s patent. What do you have?

           ON THE ASSOCIATES: Not much.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT (GASLAMP) CARTER, HUGHES & CRAVATH - ASSOCIATES BULLPEN

           Late that night, Paul and his associates are still at it. 
           True to his word, no one appears to be going home any time 
           soon.

           They’re each looking through separate piles of documents, 
           without much success.

                                 ASSOCIATE ATTORNEY #1
                             (reading from an old 
                              magazine)
                        “And that’s when I made my great 
                        discovery. Perhaps the greatest 
                        discovery of this century or the 
                        next: the light from a strip of 
                        glowing hot carbonized platinum lit 
                        up the entire room.”
                             (beat)
                        Edison is so modest in his 
                        interviews.

           All the men keep reading, when one of the associates notices 
           something:

                                 ASSOCIATE ATTORNEY #3
                        ... The filament isn’t made of 
                        carbonized platinum.

                                 ASSOCIATE ATTORNEY #1
                        Edison told the reporter from the 
                        Herald that it was platinum.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                             (”Both of you shut up”)
                        Saying the wrong thing to a 
                        reporter is not against the law.
                                 ASSOCIATE ATTORNEY #2
                        I have an interview from a few 
                        years later where he says the right 
                        filament anyway. Look: Bamboo. He 
                        just mis-spoke.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Edison’s filaments are made of 
                        cotton.

                                 ASSOCIATE ATTORNEY #2
                        Here he says it’s bamboo.

                                 ASSOCIATE ATTORNEY #1
                        Here he says it’s platinum.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                             (holding up patent)
                        Edison’s patent is less than two 
                        pages long, and I have read it at 
                        least 1000 times. I know every word 
                        of this thing. The filament is not 
                        platinum or bamboo. It is cotton. 
                        If you want to be attorneys, you 
                        have to pay attention to the 
                        details, all right?

           The associates look down at their respective papers again. 
           Paul is... wrong.

                                 ASSOCIATE ATTORNEY #3
                        We are... In this interview, from 
                        before the bulb was released, he 
                        says platinum. In that interview a 
                        year later, he says bamboo.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        What the — what are you saying?

           Paul gets up to look — but the associates are right.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH (CONT’D)
                        The patent itself says cotton.

                                 ASSOCIATE ATTORNEY #3
                        Christ.

                                 ASSOCIATE ATTORNEY #1
                             (not getting it)
                        But lying to a reporter isn’t 
                        against the law. Right?

           ON PAUL: His mind racing. Putting together what this means.
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Right.
                             (beat)
                        But what if Edison didn’t lie to 
                        the reporter? What if he lied on 
                        the patent?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT (DAYLIGHT) WESTINGHOUSE ESTATE - MAIN VILLA - STUDY

           Paul and his senior partner, Carter, meet with George 
           Westinghouse.

           Westinghouse looks over the PAPERS Paul is showing him.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        September, 1878. Hundreds of 
                        scientists all over the world are 
                        racing to make a working 
                        incandescent light bulb.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Including me.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        But then, one day... Thomas Edison 
                        announces to the press that he’s 
                        done it. He demonstrates a glass-
                        enclosed vacuum in which glows a 
                        platinum filament. The stock of all 
                        the big gas companies plummets 30% 
                        in two days. All of his opponents 
                        quit.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Not me.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        But then, curiously, Edison doesn’t 
                        file for the patent for almost a 
                        year. And when he does, it uses... 
                        A cotton filament. And then another 
                        year later, the first light bulb 
                        rolls out of his factory, in which 
                        glows... A bamboo filament.
                             (beat)
                        Edison was only first because the 
                        light bulb that he patented didn’t 
                        actually work.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        How did I miss this?
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Everyone did. And if I can get him 
                        to admit that in court...

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        In court?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I want to bring this to trial. To 
                        confront Edison on the witness 
                        stand.

           ON WESTINGHOUSE: You want to go to court now?

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Bids for the World’s Fair are due 
                        in mere weeks. Why not wait? The 
                        fair is finally within reach.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Because if I can get Edison to 
                        admit the discrepancy then his 
                        patent will not be worth the paper 
                        that it’s printed on. The lawsuit 
                        will be over, and you and he may 
                        duke it out over the fair as you 
                        always should have: On scientific 
                        merit alone.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        But a newspaper interview is not 
                        admissable in court. This only 
                        works if you can get Edison to 
                        admit that the bulb on his patent 
                        didn’t fully work. He has to admit 
                        it out loud.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        So I’ll have to get him to admit 
                        it.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        If you go to trial and lose, then 
                        Mr. Westinghouse’s bid won’t even 
                        be accepted.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        It’s worth the risk.

           Westinghouse looks back and forth between Paul and Carter.
                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                             (to Paul)
                        The day I met you, you told me you 
                        thought winning was impossible.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I was wrong.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        What changed your mind?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... The day I met you, you were 
                        willing to stake your name on a 
                        principle. Something bigger than 
                        all of us. Something bigger than 
                        the fair. Now I am too.

           ON WESTINGHOUSE: Pride at his young attorney’s commitment to 
           their cause.

           ON CARTER: He did not realize that Paul and Westinghouse 
           would bring out such idealism in one another — and he doesn’t 
           like it.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        All right. Let’s go to court.
                             (he stands)
                        Oh, Mr. Cravath?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Yes, Sir?

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Edison sure better admit it out 
                        loud.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT (DAYLIGHT) COURT HOUSE - LOWER MANHATTAN

           Paul stands in front of the New York State courthouse in 
           Lower Manhattan. Ready for the show down. He’s trying to calm 
           his nerves.

           Charles Hughes approaches.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        It’s really important to me that 
                        you don’t screw up today.

           ON PAUL: No matter what, he can at least count on Charles 
           Hughes to be Charles Hughes.
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... It’s important to a lot of 
                        other people too.

           INT (DAYLIGHT) COURTROOM - LOWER MANHATTAN - LATER

           Paul shuffles his papers at the DEFENSE TABLE. 

           Grosvenor Lowrey passes by Paul on the way to the PLAINTIFF’S 
           TABLE:

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        ... Paul Cravath. You’ve made it 
                        very far since my first-year 
                        introduction to contracts course.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Thank you.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        Whatever happens — you should be 
                        proud. If you ever find yourself in 
                        need of a job, my firm is always 
                        hiring.

           ON LOWREY: A kind smile, to further rattle our young lawyer.

           ON PAUL: It’s not going to work.

           They both take their seats, before STANDING AGAIN as the 
           JUDGE enters.

                                 JUDGE
                        Good morning. Mr. Cravath, I 
                        believe we’re ready for you to call 
                        your first witness.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        The defense calls Thomas Edison.

           And with that, the rear doors of the court room open and 
           Thomas Edison ENTERS, led by one of Lowrey’s apprentices.

           Edison passes by Paul, giving him a little WINK.

           Paul just nods resolutely as Edison takes the stand.

           ON PAUL CRAVATH AND THOMAS EDISON: Two expert verbal 
           duelists, ready to joust.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH (CONT’D)
                        What was the first thing you 
                        invented, Mr. Edison?
                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Mr. Edison’s process of invention 
                        is the very thing we’re here to 
                        discuss. I for one would like to 
                        hear a bit more about it.

                                 JUDGE
                        Let’s hear a bit more.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        It was a... Well it was called an 
                        automatic repeater.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        And when was this?

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Is George Westinghouse claiming 
                        that he invented that now too?

           Paul gives him a look.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Your Honor, I’ll ask —

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        — The year was 1865. I was a 
                        butcher boy in Port Huron, selling 
                        candy on the rails. Found odd jobs, 
                        here and there. Things that needed 
                        fixing. I’ve always had a way with 
                        machines.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        So it would appear.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        I would overhear the chatter of the 
                        Western Union men at the stations. 
                        “If only we could relay the 
                        signals.” But then they wouldn’t do 
                        anything about it. I did. I fiddled 
                        until I’d built a device that 
                        worked.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        And then you sold the patent to 
                        Gold & Stock. For $200.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Is that a question?
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        By the time you were 22, you’d made 
                        it all the way to New York.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        And by 30 I lived in a mansion on 
                        Fifth Avenue.
                             (beat)
                        You’ll be 30 soon, won’t you?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Was your process on the light 
                        bulb similar to the one you’ve just 
                        described?

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        For a hundred years people had been 
                        trying to make functional, safe 
                        indoor light. It was a problem that 
                        no one could solve. Until me.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        What about Sawyer & Man? Their 
                        patent predates yours by a few 
                        years.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        But their device wasn’t complete. 
                        It was a suggestion of a thing, not 
                        the thing itself.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        For instance, the Sawyer & Man 
                        claim did not specify a type of 
                        filament?

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Oh my! That’s very technical. Yes. 
                        The Sawyer & Man patent suggests, 
                        among its vagaries, that there 
                        should be some sort of carbonized 
                        filament. But it doesn’t go further 
                        on that point, or on many others.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        And then on your patent claim, you 
                        did specify a filament, didn’t you?

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        I’m sure.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        And what was that filament?
                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        You must have the claim on you.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I hoped you would tell me.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        You’ll be disappointed: I’m not 
                        sure I remember.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I’ll help: Your application says it 
                        was a cotton filament.

           Paul presents Edison’s PATENT APPLICATION to the Judge, who 
           receives it from him.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Very well.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        So it was a cotton filament that 
                        finally, after years of trying, 
                        made the lamp work?

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Apparently so.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Are you sure? Because you gave an 
                        interview with the New York Herald 
                        in which you said it was made of 
                        platinum.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        I give so many interviews.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        And, Your Honor, those interviews 
                        are not admissable.

                                 JUDGE
                        That’s correct.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                             (to Edison)
                        Is there platinum in the bulbs that 
                        you currently ship to your 
                        customers?

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Are you in the market for a light 
                        bulb?
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        If I go to an Edison shop and 
                        purchase one, will I find a 
                        platinum filament at the center? Or 
                        might it be bamboo?

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        Objection.

                                 JUDGE
                        Grounds?

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                             (straining)
                        ... Relevance?

                                 JUDGE
                        The witness will answer.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        I couldn’t say.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                             (to Edison)
                        Cotton, platinum, or bamboo? Which 
                        one actually works?

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Does it matter?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        If you were the man to finally make 
                        a working filament, then which was 
                        the filament that finally worked?

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        Objection. Asked and answered.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        — Not answered, your honor —

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        — I’m happy to continue —

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        — There is no need —

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        — Cotton, platinum, or bamboo?

                                 JUDGE
                        — Sustained. Mr. Edison, you don’t 
                        need to answer —
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        — You’re the best inventor in 
                        America? Tell me what you invented.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        I’d like to answer this —

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        — Thomas, not another word —

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        The bulb didn’t work, did it?

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        Judge, Mr. Cravath is trying to get 
                        my client to —

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        — Mr. Cravath is trying to get me 
                        to admit that the filament 
                        specified on my patent didn’t work.

           Silence.

           ON PAUL: Holy shit. Did Edison just say that out loud?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Can you repeat that, Mr. 
                        Edison?

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        There were three different 
                        filaments. Only the last one 
                        worked, but that wasn’t the one I 
                        put on the patent.

           ON PAUL: He just won the largest patent suit in American 
           history.

           All eyes are on him. He’s too stunned to breathe.

                                 THOMAS EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Are you pleased, Mr. Cravath?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Yes. Thank you. Mr. Edison.
                             (to Judge)
                        The witness is excused.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        You know, there were even more than 
                        three.

           Everyone turns to look back at Edison: What is happening?
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        More?

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        There were 10,000 different 
                        filaments.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Pardon?

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        You have never understood what it 
                        is that I do for a living. Your 
                        Honor, may I explain?

           ON PAUL: What is Edison doing?

                                 JUDGE
                        The witness is entitled to fully 
                        answer Mr. Cravath’s question.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        I create things that did not exist 
                        before. How? Well, I survey all the 
                        designs that have been tried. I see 
                        what has fallen short. I spot the 
                        cracks and I set my men to paving 
                        them. Science is not the hand of 
                        God reaching down to press the 
                        pointed finger. It’s drudgery. It 
                        is trying 10,000 different shapes 
                        of bulb. Then trying 10,000 
                        different air fillings. Then, yes, 
                        10,000 different filaments. It is 
                        realizing that those are the three 
                        components that matter and then 
                        trying 10,000 times 10,000 times 
                        10,000 combinations until one of 
                        them lights up. And then selling 
                        this to a public who never thought 
                        such a thing was possible. Of that, 
                        I am guilty as sin: I sold the 
                        light bulb. Is there any part of 
                        you that believes that without me 
                        Americans would have electric light 
                        in their homes? Of course not. 
                        George Westinghouse can tweak his 
                        needling details. But perfecting 
                        the steps is hardly any good if 
                        you’ve failed to make it to the 
                        dance. I hired the band, I booked 
                        the hall. I advertised the show. 
                        And you hate me because my name is 
                        on the poster.

                        If the word ‘invention’ is to 
                        maintain even a semblance of 
                        rational sense, then it must be 
                        said that the light bulb was my 
                        invention. It is my patent. Every 
                        single bulb. Every last filament.

           EXT (DAYLIGHT) COURT HOUSE - LOWER MANHATTAN - LATER

           Paul stands outside the court house, trying to make sense of 
           what Edison just said.

           He’s approached by Carter and Hughes, each wearing ashen 
           faces.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... He admitted that it didn’t 
                        work.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        It doesn’t matter.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I got him to admit it.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        And it doesn’t matter.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I did it. I did everything —

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        — Paul. It doesn’t matter.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        The Judge will not go for Edison’s 
                        argument.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        The decision just came in.
                             (hands Paul documents)
                        You lost.

           Paul looks down at the papers: He can’t believe it.
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        He’s ruled that not only is 
                        Westinghouse forbidden from making 
                        electric lights, but so is 
                        everyone. Everywhere.
                             (looks up)
                        Thomas Edison owns the entire 
                        concept of electric light, as 
                        presently understood.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        The punitive damages are even 
                        worse.

           Paul is dumbfounded by the numbers he sees.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        “$2 million?”

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        Westinghouse’s electrical holdings 
                        are now worthless, so he’ll have to 
                        sell off his railroad holdings to 
                        cover the damages. Maybe the house.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        How could the Judge do this?

           Carter and Hughes share a look: Should they tell him?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        We never looked into the Judge.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Why would we look into Judge 
                        Reynolds?

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        Because Judge Reynolds has presided 
                        over at least 25 previous cases 
                        involving JP Morgan’s companies. 

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        25 cases that we were able to find 
                        this morning, at least.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        And he has ruled against JP Morgan 
                        precisely zero times.

           ON PAUL: This hits him like brass knuckles to the gut.
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Morgan bribed the Judge?

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        Paul — Morgan didn’t have to. 
                        They’re members of the same clubs. 
                        They sip port at the same exclusive 
                        tables. This is New York.

           Paul’s world is crashing down around him.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I gave Westinghouse my word. Mr. 
                        Coffin. I told them I could do 
                        this.

           For the first time, Carter looks at him with genuine 
           kindness.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        Look, if there’s anyone who would 
                        want to blame you, it’s me. And I’m 
                        the one telling you: It’s not your 
                        fault. This was never a fair fight.

           INT (DAYLIGHT) HUNTINGTON HOUSE - NO 4 GRAMERCY PARK

           CLOSE ON: The front page of the New York times. The headline 
           reads:

           contract for the World’s Fair”

           REVEAL: Agnes is in her sitting room, looking over the 
           morning’s paper. She sees Paul’s name in the article.

           ON AGNES: This must be the most crushing loss of Paul’s life.

                                 FANNIE HUNTINGTON (O.S.)
                        I have some good news.

                        The theater will restage it as a 
                        comedy. What a hoot! Don’t you

           Fannie leans in and HUGS her daughter. Fannie is thrilled; 
           Agnes is strangely subdued.

                                 FANNIE HUNTINGTON
                        ... You’re welcome, by the way.

                        I’ll thank the director.

                                 FANNIE HUNTINGTON
                        Not who I meant.
                             (off Agnes’ look)
                        I cannot imagine that Henry Jayne 
                        failed to put in a helpful word.

                        You don’t think they’ve hired me

                        I think that every little bit 
                        helps.

           Fannie registers Agnes’ distinct lack of total enthusiasm, 
           and is annoyed.

           Edison takes his breakfast alone in his massive dining room. 
           He’s reading the morning papers when Grosvenor Lowrey enters.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        ... It’s a fine day, Sir.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        I should say so.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        Our man in Chicago says that 
                        Westinghouse obeyed the court’s 
                        ruling and didn’t submit a bid for 
                        the fair. So in —
                             (checks pocketwatch)
                        — About three hours, bidding will 
                        close, and that will be that.

           ON EDISON: Not really the type to give his employees a pat on 
           the back for a job well done.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        ... Is there a reason that you’re 
                        still standing there?

           ON LOWREY: His client can’t even be pleasant in victory.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        Thank you for trusting me to fight

           The fair grounds have advanced considerably since last we saw 
           them: A few of the GRAND BUILDINGS, each the size of a 
           museum, have been completed.

           The lagoon has been FILLED WITH WATER.

           As HUNDREDS of workers SPRAY PAINT the newly finished 
           buildings in a pristine white, we find —

           — A 50-year-old MAN we’ve never met before RACING across the 
           grounds. His name is LEMUELL SERRELL.

           Serrell holds a large PACKAGE under his arm as he runs 
           through the construction —

           — Past the CANALS spreading out from the lagoon —

           — Past the spider-web-like Ferris Wheel — 

           — Before sprinting into the massive TENT at the very center —

           INT (DAYLIGHT) WORLD’S FAIR GROUNDS - CENTER TENT - 
           CONTINUOUS

           — And brushing past various ASSISTANTS —

                        Sir? Pardon me? SIR?!?! You can’t —

           — The mysterious Lemuell Serrell arrives straight at —

           —  THE BACK ROOM OF THE TENT:

           Inside, the FAIR COMMITTEE — a dozen older men — is 
           deliberating.

                        There are two fundamentally 
                        different kinds of current: 
                        Alternating and direct. Every

                        present... Nikola Tesla.

           Serrell steps off the stage, and the CURTAINS OPEN, to 
           reveal...

           ... Nothing.
           The stage is empty.

           MURMURS from the crowd.

           Until a head pokes out from one side of the curtain...

           ... And, tentatively, out steps a 6’6” Serbian man with jet-
           black hair perfectly parted in the center.

           Nikola Tesla offers a REALLY WEIRD LITTLE ONE-HANDED HALF-

                             (thick Serbian accent)
                        ... Goodbye.

           Tesla turns and walks BACK BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

           The stage is empty.

           ON THE AUDIENCE: “What. The. Fuck...?”

           ON WESTINGHOUSE AND PAUL:

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        There is absolutely no way that 
                        that man has designed a functional 
                        alternating current.

           ON THE STAGE:

           But just then, Tesla returns pushing TWO METAL CARTS.

           On one cart is an ELECTRICAL GENERATOR. On the other is a 
           long, TUBULAR LIGHT BULB.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        I am apologized. The subject on 
                        which I speak at your invitation is 
                        an alternate system of power 
                        electrical: Current in alternation.
                             (beat)
                        An alternate system of alternate 
                        current.

           In the pause that follows, it becomes apparent that Tesla 
           thinks this is a joke. Maybe a pun? It’s really hard to tell.

           ON TESLA: Realizing that no one has a clue what he’s saying.
                                 NIKOLA TESLA (CONT’D)
                        It is perhaps not a strength I 
                        boast to speak as mellifluous like 
                        Mr. Thomas Edison.

           Tesla gives Edison his strange little half-wave thing.

           ON EDISON: He waves back, almost amused.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA (CONT’D)
                        Nor do I manufacture prodigious 
                        machines like Mr. George 
                        Westinghouse.

           Tesla gestures to Westinghouse.

           ON WESTINGHOUSE: He... Smiles? Maybe? He guesses?

                                 NIKOLA TESLA (CONT’D)
                        My strengths are habitated 
                        elsewhere.

           Tesla TURNS ON THE GENERATOR...

           ... And suddenly the LONG TUBULAR LIGHT BULB BLOOMS TO LIFE.

           The NEON LIGHT that comes out of it is unlike anything anyone 
           has ever seen.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA (CONT’D)
                        Explanations will benefit.

           Tesla turns around begins SCRIBBLING INCOMPREHENSIBLE 
           EQUATIONS on the CHALK BOARD behind him.

           ON THE CROWD: Between the devices and the equations, the 
           assembled engineers are overwhelmed. They’re frantically 
           trying to take notes, to figure out how this is possible...

           ON PAUL AND WESTINGHOUSE:

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        ... That man just designed a 
                        functional alternating current.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT (DAYLIGHT) COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - ENGINEERING HALL - LATER

           Some minutes later, the hall has been cleared of spectators, 
           leaving only:
           Westinghouse & Paul, Edison & Lowrey, Tesla & Serrell, plus 
           the Fair Committee. The nation’s three best inventors, their 
           three lawyers, and the judges of who will light America.

                                 FAIR COMMITTEE CHAIR
                        ... The Committee is satisfied by 
                        Mr. Tesla’s demonstration. Your bid 
                        to light the fair with A/C will 
                        advance to a second round of 
                        competition, along with Mr. 
                        Edison’s D/C bid.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        Pardon, Sirs, but we have a legal 
                        objection.

                                 LEMUELL SERRELL
                        Are you serious? Westinghouse’s 
                        lawyer might let you get away with 
                        that nonsense, but I will not.

           ON PAUL: He kind of deserves that.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        The Fair’s rules state that the 
                        bidder must be physically capable 
                        of manufacturing his proposed 
                        system.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        I have only momentarily 
                        demonstrated my functionings.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        Manufacture, Mr. Tesla. You have no 
                        company behind you. No factories. 
                        No employees — draftsmen, 
                        metalworkers, welders. The Fair 
                        opens in six months. Who is going 
                        to build it? You?

           Everyone looks at Tesla.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        ... I am adept with the 
                        screwdriver’s turn.

           ON SERRELL: Shit.

           Lowrey turns back to the Fair Committee:

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        My point exactly.
           The Fair Committee exchanges some WHISPERS.

                                 FAIR COMMITTEE CHAIR
                        It seems Mr. Lowrey is correct. Mr. 
                        Tesla’s bid to light the fair is 
                        invalid —

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        — WAIT.

           Everyone turns to look at Paul.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH (CONT’D)
                        George Westinghouse would like to 
                        add his name to Tesla’s bid.

           ON WESTINGHOUSE: “I would?”

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Mr. Westinghouse is not permitted 
                        to build electric lights.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        We’re not going to build ours.
                             (re: Tesla)
                        We’re going to build his.

           ON WESTINGHOUSE: “We are?”

                                 PAUL CRAVATH (CONT’D)
                        We have a small army of engineers 
                        and craftsmen. A flotilla of 
                        factories. Tesla has the patents on 
                        this A/C lighting system.
                             (to Serrell)
                        You did register the patents, 
                        didn’t you?

           ON SERRELL: “Do I look fucking stupid?”

                                 PAUL CRAVATH (CONT’D)
                        Right. So then we’d like to join 
                        our bids. Mr. Westinghouse and Mr. 
                        Tesla will compete together against 
                        Mr. Edison.

           ON EDISON AND LOWREY: Whispering frantically. Trying to 
           figure out a defense against this... 

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        ... Sirs, Westinghouse and Tesla 
                        cannot just... Work together.
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Why not?

           ON LOWREY: He can’t think of a reason why not.

           ON THE COMMITTEE: Neither can they.

           ON WESTINGHOUSE AND PAUL:

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        You want me to partner with... Him?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        If you have a better idea, I’d love 
                        to hear it.

           ON THE FAIR COMMITTEE:

                                 FAIR COMMITTEE CHAIR
                        The Committee will accept this 
                        arrangement. Provided that Mr. 
                        Tesla has no objections?

           All eyes turn to Tesla. What’s he going to say?

           ON TESLA: Thinking very hard about something...

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                             (to Committee Chair)
                        ... Your shirt possesses nine 
                        buttons.

           EXT (DAYLIGHT) COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - ENGINEERING HALL

           As all of the men leave the building, Edison approaches Paul 
           and Westinghouse.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Rescued from the jaws of death by a 
                        lunatic.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Pity that you can’t hide behind 
                        your attorneys any longer. You’ll 
                        have to face me on the field of 
                        pure ideas.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Ideas? Yours weren’t good enough so 
                        you’ve resorted to buying his. My 
                        second-hand slop.
                             (off their look)
                        You didn’t know? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 THOMAS EDISON (CONT'D)
                        Tesla used to work in my lab. A 
                        draftsman. 3rd class. He showed me 
                        his A/C designs and begged me to 
                        buy them. I fired him instead.

           Edison gives Tesla another WEIRD LITTLE WAVE.

           Tesla, across the steps, WAVES BACK.

           Edison isn’t lying: They really do know each other.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        ... A/C is more powerful than D/C.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        You say more powerful. I say more 
                        dangerous. Don’t you know, men are 
                        dying on the streets from this 
                        stuff!

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        I would never put my name on a 
                        product that hurt people.

           Edison shrugs.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        I guess the public will decide.

           Edison walks away with a slight smile, leaving Paul and 
           Westinghouse to ponder this statement.

           EXT (DAYLIGHT) LEMUELL SERRELL’S OFFICE - WALL STREET

           A few days later, Paul waits outside an office building in 
           the financial district, reading a newspaper.

           ON THE HEADLINE: “AGNES HUNTINGTON TO PLAY ‘PAUL JONES’”

           ON PAUL: Thinking fondly — wistfully — about a woman he can 
           only admire from afar.

                                 LEMUELL SERRELL (O.S.)
                        ... I’ve been wondering: What did 
                        it feel like to lose the largest 
                        patent suit in history?

           Paul looks up to find Lemuell Serrell standing before him.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I’ve had better days. And thanks to 
                        your client, I’m hopeful for better 
                        ones still.
                                 LEMUELL SERRELL
                        Yes, I got the sales agreement from 
                        your “associates”...

           Serrell leads Paul into the OFFICE BUILDING:

                                 LEMUELL SERRELL (CONT’D)
                        ... I’m sorry, but I cannot sell 
                        Tesla’s patents to you.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        The only way to compete against 
                        Edison is if we work together. 

                                 LEMUELL SERRELL
                        Agreed. Which is why I will 
                        consider licensing them.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT (DAYLIGHT) LEMUELL SERRELL’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           A minute later, Paul sits across from Serrell in his office.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Something tells me that this 
                        “licensing” arrangement will entail 
                        a considerable royalty for Tesla.

                                 LEMUELL SERRELL
                        My client worked for Thomas Edison 
                        for two years. At $17 per week. How 
                        many millions do you think Edison 
                        made off of his ideas? I will not 
                        let him be taken advantage of 
                        again.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        George Westinghouse is not Thomas 
                        Edison.

                                 LEMUELL SERRELL
                        Right right, because you’re the 
                        good guys? Money doesn’t matter to 
                        you, it’s only about principle?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        We would never take advantage of 
                        a... 
                             (trying not to say 
                              “lunatic”)
                        ... Character such as Tesla.
                                 LEMUELL SERRELL
                        Forgive me for wanting that in

           Serrell slides a CONTRACT across the desk to Paul.

           Paul looks down at it. The numbers involved are not cheap.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        For someone decrying the influence 
                        of money, you’re sure asking for a 
                        lot it.

                                 LEMUELL SERRELL
                        He’s not crazy, you know. He’s 
                        just... Unique. Like his ideas.

           ON PAUL: And his ideas are revolutionary. But this is still a 
           holy ton of cash.

                                 LEMUELL SERRELL (CONT’D)
                        ... So. Do we have a deal or not?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT (GASLAMPS) DELMONICO’S RESTAURANT - MANHATTAN

           SHOT: THREE GLASSES OF MONTRACHET CLINK TOGETHER.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE (O.S.)
                        Congratulations, Mr. Tesla.

           REVEAL: A few nights later, Paul and Westinghouse have taken 
           Tesla out to a celebratory dinner at Delmonico’s — the most 
           elegant and exclusive restaurant in New York.

           WHITE-COATED WAITERS flit about, seeing to their every need.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Welcome to our side. I trust you’ll 
                        find it considerably more pleasant 
                        than Edison’s.

           Paul and Westinghouse sip their wine...

           ... Only Tesla leaves his untouched.

           Paul notices, but doesn’t comment.

                             (to Tesla)
                        Have you been to Pittsburgh before?
                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        I haven’t.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Greatest city in America.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                             (gonna ignore that one)
                        We were hoping you’d join Mr. 
                        Westinghouse there for a time. To 
                        help his team assemble their bid 
                        for the second round.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        Ah. Oh. Yes... Well. Negative.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Pardon?

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        I have answered no. These 
                        incandescents... They are bygone 
                        news.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Incandescent light is the newest 
                        frontier in science.

           Tesla scoffs.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        They were five years historical. We 
                        must give to the public the very 
                        newest.
                             (conspiratorially)
                        I nomenclatured it “neon.”

           ON PAUL AND WESTINGHOUSE: What on earth is a “neon?”

           Just then, an expert team of WAITERS slides plates of Lobster 
           a la Newberg in front of the men. Steam blossoms off the 
           buttery crustaceans.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA (CONT’D)
                             (to the waiter)
                        Pardon. How many centimeters?

                                 WAITER
                        Sir?

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        This plate. How many centimeters?

           The Waiter looks to Paul for help, but finds none.
                                 WAITER
                             (to Tesla)
                        Centimeters, Sir?

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                             (measuring with his 
                              fingers)
                        35 centimeters? Yes. And four 
                        centimeters deep. That is 140 cubic 
                        centimeters of your broth, minus of 
                        course that dispositioned by the 
                        tail...
                             (more measuring)
                        ... So only 104 cubic centimeters. 
                        Apologies I cannot be ingesting.

           The Waiter politely removes Tesla’s plate from the table.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA (CONT’D)
                             (explaining)
                        It is the unevenness, that is what 
                        makes difficulty in calculation.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        You can only eat the lobster once 
                        you’ve accurately measured its 
                        cubic dimensions?

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        No no, of course not. I can only 
                        ingest a dinner the cubic volume of 
                        which adds to a number divisible by 
                        three.

           Westinghouse looks to Paul: “This is the genius who got A/C 
           to work?”

           Paul returns the look: “Give him a chance.”

           But just then, Paul sees someone walking through the 
           restaurant —

           — It’s Agnes Huntington.

           She’s with a group of FRIENDS, including Henry Jayne.

           Flush with embarrassment over their last meeting, Paul turns 
           his head away from her as she passes near their table.

           Westinghouse and Tesla both clock Paul’s reaction (but don’t 
           see her face.)

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        ... Do you know that woman?
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        No.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        Your wish is not to be viewed by 
                        this woman?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I promise you, I don’t know her.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON (O.S.)
                        Paul Cravath!

           To Paul’s further embarrassment, she approaches their table.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Hello.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        I knew you were Mr. Westinghouse’s 
                        attorney, but I didn’t know that 
                        you were also his friend.

           Westinghouse looks instantly impressed as he recognizes her.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Your reputation precedes you, Miss 
                        Huntington. I’ve long been an 
                        admirer of the opera.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Then you’ll have to accompany Mr. 
                        Cravath the next time he attends.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        And when will that be?

           ON PAUL: He just wants this conversation to be over.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I’ve been rather busy.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                             (to Agnes)
                        You chant in the opera? 

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        ... You’re Nikola Tesla! 

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        How are you knowing?
                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        The papers have been abuzz about 
                        you. They say you’ll be the man to 
                        light the World’s Fair.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON (CONT’D)
                        My friends would love to make your 
                        acquaintance.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        Mine?

           Agnes looks to the front door, where her friends are just 
           leaving. Henry Jayne MOTIONS for her to join.

           Agnes looks back at Tesla and Paul.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        ... Would you gentlemen like to 
                        come to a party?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT (GASLAMPS) GRAMERCY PARK - MANHATTAN

           Paul and Agnes walk across the gaslit chiaroscuro of GRAMERCY 
           PARK at night.

           Tesla walks a few paces ahead with Henry Jayne and Agnes’ 
           other friends. Jayne in particular seems fascinated by Tesla.

           He turns back to make eye contact with Agnes: “Can you 
           believe this loon?”

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Rarely are the rumors in New York 
                        understated. But in the case of Mr. 
                        Tesla...

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... He is not from our world. So 
                        thank you for showing him a touch 
                        of yours.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        I’m sorry about the last time we 
                        met. I should have mentioned Henry 
                        Jayne.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        There was no need.
                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        I didn’t mean to offend you.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I wasn’t offended.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        You ran out of the opera house that 
                        night because you just had to get 
                        back to your legal briefs?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        It’s not what you think. Between 
                        myself and Henry.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        He isn’t courting you?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        He is.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Well then. You could hardly do 
                        better.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        I’m sure I can “do” as I like.

           ON PAUL: This conversation could be going better.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to come to the 
                        party.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Westinghouse went home and someone 
                        should look after Tesla. Will your 
                        party be particular raucous?

           As Agnes’ determines how best to answer we —

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT (CANDLES) THE PLAYERS CLUB - NO 16 GRAMERCY PARK

           THE BEST PARTY OF 1888.
           An evening at the Player’s Club is not one of Mrs. Astor’s 
           impeccably elegant white-tailed affairs — this is the most 
           fashionable collection of ARTISTS, ACTORS, SINGERS, DANCERS 
           and MUSICIANS in the nation. It’s raucous, crowded, thick 
           with smoke and booze.

           As Agnes leads Paul and Tesla inside, they both stare.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        ... Welcome to the Player’s Club.

                        What are they to play?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Nothing, actually. It was founded 
                        by Edwin Booth.
                             (off Paul’s look)
                        His older brother John Wilkes 
                        sullied the Booth name pretty 
                        badly. When he murdered the — well 
                        you know. So Edwin created this and 
                        invited every popular artist, 
                        actor, entertainer, and singer to 
                        dance away the stain.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        This is New York: Money is just the

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        What’s the end?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Status.

           A SEQUENCE:

           — Agnes says hello to EVERYONE. EVERYONE knows her; she knows 
           everyone.

           — Tesla is ENCIRCLED by a group of on-lookers, who’ve all 
           caught wind of his reputation. Jayne introduces Tesla around 
           like he’s showing off a new puppy. Tesla DELIGHTS the crowd 
           with tales of what he’ll display at the World’s Fair: 
           “Telephones without wires!” “Neon lights!” “Spectrographs!”

           — Paul has never seen this much champagne in his life. He 
           finds he likes the taste.
           — Agnes begins to sing the popular tune “Where Did You Get 
           That Hat?” with the musicians in the corner — it’s fun.

           All of the partygoers turn to stare, including Paul.

           As he watches her, entranced, he’s approached by:

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        Men from the newspapers have 
                        requested interviews.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        You’re the newest hit in town.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        I have never before been so hit.

           Tesla tries a sip of champagne for what might be the first 
           time.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA (CONT’D)
                        Do you think they will feature 
                        champagne at the World’s Fair?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Something tells me that if we win 
                        the World’s Fair, we can get you as 
                        much champagne as you like.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        I have not said to you thanks. But 
                        I have never wanted anything so 
                        much as to bring my lights to your 
                        fair. It means a wide world to me. 
                        And to my Eliza.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Oh! Is Eliza your... sister?

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        My pet pigeon.

           ON PAUL: Yes. Of course Tesla has a pet pigeon.

           Agnes’ song comes to a close. In the APPLAUSE, Tesla makes 
           eye contact with Henry Jayne.

                                 HENRY JAYNE
                        Nikola! Come come, you must meet 
                        Edwin.

           Tesla goes off to meet more of Jayne’s friends.
           Paul watches as the stylish guests LAUGH at every word out of 
           Tesla’s mouth...

                                 PARTY GUEST
                        Do tell me more about these 
                        telephones of yours!

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        Not a wire betwixt them —

                                 PARTY GUEST #2
                        — Your accent is so fascinating. 
                        Where on earth are you from?

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        A town nomenclatured Smiljan —

                                 PARTY GUEST #3
                        — Are you and Westinghouse really 
                        going to light up the World’s Fair? 
                        Can you get me a ticket to the 
                        opening?

           ON PAUL: The contented smile fading as more unsettling 
           thoughts take over. The way these people are laughing at 
           Tesla... They way he’s clearly enjoying their attention...

           Paul suddenly walks out to —

           EXT (GASLAPS) GRAMERCY PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Paul takes a breath of fresh air in the cool evening.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON (O.S.)
                        You don’t like the party?

           Paul turns to see Agnes in the doorway.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps it was the guests.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        They’re going to devour Tesla 
                        alive.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        He seems to enjoy being the meal.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Maybe he’s a nut. Or maybe he just 
                        wants us to think he is.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH (CONT'D)
                        But either way it’s all a great 
                        laugh to those people as long as 
                        they think he’s won the fair — and 
                        if he loses, they’ll toss him aside 
                        just as easily.

           She studies him for a moment.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        You have a secret, Cravath.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        What’s that?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        You play the very image of the 
                        ambitious young striver. Only deep 
                        down, you’re just a good country 
                        boy, aren’t you?

           Paul thinks about how to respond to this.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... My father is a travelling 
                        preacher. Congregationalist. Kind, 
                        generous, devoted his whole life to 
                        justice for the poor. He is the 
                        most infernally sainted man I have 
                        ever known. And do you know where 
                        my father lives?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Nashville?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        In a three-room shack ten miles 
                        outside of Nashville. He’s the most 
                        goodly man on Earth and he never 
                        had two nickels to rub together to 
                        make a third. I wanted more. I came 
                        here because I believed that if I 
                        did honorable work well, I would 
                        get ahead. Is that so wrong?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        It’s not.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        My father disagrees.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Perhaps he hasn’t met many saintly 
                        rich men.
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Perhaps I have. 

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                             (re: Player’s Club)
                        In there?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        George Westinghouse didn’t need to 
                        sell his soul to make his fortune.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        You may be the only person who’s 
                        ever been made more idealistic by 
                        New York.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        You think I’m naive because I 
                        wasn’t born into your pricey 
                        cynicism.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        I think I earned every bit of it.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Perhaps I just feel sea sick on 
                        these waters because I didn’t learn 
                        to swim in an ocean of champagne.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Where do you think I learned to 
                        swim?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Montauk? Connecticut? Don’t tell me 
                        — Greenwich?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Kalamazoo, Michigan.

           ON PAUL: “Wait, what?”

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON (CONT’D)
                        My mother dusted China in the 
                        houses of every rich family from St 
                        Louis to Boston so she could buy us 
                        two tickets to Paris. I swept 
                        stages at the Bijou until they let 
                        me sing for the first time. You 
                        think I’m going back? Absolutely 
                        not. You can have your money. Booth 
                        can have his status. Edison and 
                        Westinghouse can run the world 
                        while Tesla invents a future one.

                        But the stage is mine. Singing is 
                        the only thing I have ever loved to 
                        do and if you think I will 
                        apologize about having to drink at 
                        the right parties or feign thrill 
                        at the right jokes to get here, 
                        well... Then perhaps we had less in 
                        common than I believed.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        What do you think we have in 
                        common?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Neither of us came here to lose.

           ON PAUL: Unsure how to respond, as they both listen in 
           silence to the SOUNDS OF THE PARTY from inside.

           EXT (DAYLIGHT) WORLD’S FAIR GROUNDS - CHICAGO

           As a HARSH WINTER descends on Chicago, the structures of the 
           fair are more complete, despite the construction 
           challenges...

           ... HORSES are freezing on the icy ground...

           ... So are many of the WORKMEN...

           ... But still they press on, under the watchful eyes of the 
           Fair Committee...

           ... ANGLE: We notice MISSING GAPS between the structures, 
           empty holes where the electrical components should be as this 
           image —

                                                         TRANSFORMS TO:

           INT (DAYLIGHT) WESTINGHOUSE ESTATE - STUDY

           CLOSE ON: A HAND-DRAWN MAP of the fair grounds.

           But filling in a gap at the center is a rectangle marked 
           GENERATOR — and then lines delineating WIRES extend outwards 
           to every building.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH (O.S.)
                        It’s amazing.

           REVEAL: Paul looks at Westinghouse’s BID while the inventor 
           stands behind him, proud of his work.
                                 PAUL CRAVATH (CONT’D)
                        You’re only using one generator?

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Because A/C is more powerful than 
                        D/C, it can be made to travel 
                        greater distances. So unlike 
                        Edison, we don’t have to install a 
                        generator in every building. 
                        Instead, one in the center, to 
                        which each structure is linked.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        That’s how you’ve been able to 
                        lower the price of your bid so 
                        much?

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        To build things of high quality and 
                        low cost. This has always been the 
                        goal.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        As long as it’s lower cost than 
                        Edison.

           Westinghouse regards Paul’s competitive zeal.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        ... You want to see something even 
                        better?

           Paul nods and Westinghouse removes from his desk a SECOND SET 
           of MAPS. He lays them out so Paul can see them.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        What are these?

           ON THE MAPS: They’re not of the Fair...

           ... These are MAPS OF AMERICA.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        The same principle can be applied 
                        to towns as well. Cities. States.

           Paul looks closely at the maps: Prospective townships have 
           been marked with BLUE DOTS. Elmira, NY. Telluride, CO. 
           Redlands, CA.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        No longer will we have to wire 
                        houses one-by-one. Instead... 
                        Networks. 
           Paul stares at the world’s first map for the electrification 
           of the United States. 

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        From the kernel of Tesla’s idea, 
                        you’ve built...

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        ... Networks of power. Networks of 
                        current. Whole communities linked 
                        together by our cables. Everyone in 
                        it together.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Sir, this is... This is a wonder.

           ON WESTINGHOUSE: All in a day’s work.

           Just then they are interrupted by a Westinghouse Electric 
           Company EXECUTIVE bearing a telegram.

                                 EXECUTIVE
                             (re: telegram)
                        Word from our man in Chicago.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        And?

                                 EXECUTIVE
                        The second round of bidding isn’t 
                        officially over yet. So this is all 
                        tentative.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        But?

                                 EXECUTIVE
                        I’m just saying, a grain of salt.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        But?

                                 EXECUTIVE
                        Unofficially, Edison’s bid is 
                        coming in at three times your 
                        price.

           ON WESTINGHOUSE AND PAUL: Holy shit.

                                 EXECUTIVE (CONT’D)
                        Unless the Fair Committee wants to 
                        overpay for an inferior product, 
                        the fair is yours.
           INT (ELECTRIC LIGHTS) JAYNE MANSION - DINING ROOM

           BLACKNESS, over which we hear only GIGGLING until —

           — CLICK: An ELECTRIC LIGHT bursts to life, revealing a dozen 
           APPLAUDING GUESTS at Henry Jayne’s dining table. The company 
           is as elegant as the surrounding: NY STATE SENATOR RICHMOND, 
           his WIFE, assorted other POLITICIANS and REAL ESTATE HEIRS... 
           And of course Agnes Huntington.

           HURRAYS all around.

                                 HENRY JAYNE
                        It’s everything Edison said it 
                        would be, isn’t it?

                                 STATE SENATOR’S WIFE
                        Is it safe?

                                 HENRY JAYNE
                        Of course! When Edison’s men 
                        installed the generator downstairs, 
                        they said that —

           — But the light begins to FLICKER. As if there is some sort 
           of electrical problem...

                                 HENRY JAYNE (CONT’D)
                             (to a SERVANT)
                        Check the generator, will you?

                                 SERVANT
                        Yes, Sir.
                             (beat)
                        Check it for what?

           ON HENRY: He has absolutely no idea how any of this works.

           As the light seems to STABILIZE, the guests take their seats.

                                 HENRY JAYNE
                        Let’s hope he gets the kinks worked 
                        out before the World’s Fair.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        I think Misters Tesla and 
                        Westinghouse will be the ones to 
                        light the Fair, if the papers are 
                        to be believed.

                                 STATE SENATOR RICHMOND
                             (playful)
                        I wouldn’t put your money on 
                        Westinghouse just yet.
                                 HENRY JAYNE
                        Are you headed back to Albany for 
                        the winter?

                                 STATE SENATOR RICHMOND
                        Such is my great calling at the 
                        State Senate: To see that we spend 
                        less time in Albany.

           LAUGHTER.

                                 HENRY JAYNE
                        The Sattin family has a place —

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                             (to Senator Richmond, 
                              serious)
                        — Why don’t you think Westinghouse 
                        will win the fair?

           ON JAYNE: That was a bit abrupt, wasn’t it?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON (CONT’D)
                        It sounds like our friend in the 
                        State Senate knows something we 
                        don’t.

                                 STATE SENATOR RICHMOND
                        It comes with the position.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        It’s not a part of your position to 
                        regale our table with a good story?

           Senator Richmond looks at Jayne: What’s gotten into Agnes?

           ON JAYNE: What has gotten into Agnes?

                                 HENRY JAYNE
                        Agnes has taken a very active 
                        interest in this 
                        Edison/Westinghouse business of 
                        late.

                                 STATE SENATOR RICHMOND
                             (relenting)
                        Edison’s men have spent their 
                        summer treating us to more steak 
                        dinners than seems healthy.

           As he continues we —

           INT (DAYLIGHT) WESTINGHOUSE ESTATE - LABORATORY - SEQUENCE

           George Westinghouse and his huge TEAM OF ENGINEERS pore over 
           endless DRAFTS of their bid — making it more efficient, more 
           inexpensive. More useful.

                                 STATE SENATOR RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        Edison is asking the New York State 
                        Legislature to ban the use of A/C.

           From his own section of the laboratory, Nikola Tesla presents 
           them with his contribution: A NEON BULB to run on the new 
           system.

           Tesla is too resistant to authority to work within 
           Westinghouse’s team, but he’ll work alongside them.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON (V.O.)
                             (to Senator Richmond)
                        How can he do that?

                                 STATE SENATOR RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        By making the public so afraid of 
                        A/C’s supposed dangers that they 
                        demand it be forbidden by law.

           INT (DAYLIGHT) EDISON GENERAL ELECTRIC-CORNER OFFICE- 
           SEQUENCE

           Edison and his BUSINESSMEN work with a team of DRAFTSMEN to 
           draw up their own great work — ADVERTISEMENTS for their 
           system.

           And all the ads feature one word in big letters: “EDISON”

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON (V.O.)
                        He’s already written editorials 
                        about how dangerous it is. What 
                        more can he do?

           Edison is interrupted by a DRAFTSMAN, who shows him a design 
           of a new machine: It’s a CHAIR.

           Why would Edison design a chair?

           INT (GASLAMP) CARTER, HUGHES & CRAVATH - PAUL’S OFFICE

           Paul looks up from his work to find Agnes bursting through 
           the door, having come right from dinner at Henry Jayne’s.
                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        You need to talk to Westinghouse 
                        right now. I know what Edison is 
                        doing.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Agnes... It’s all right. We’ve 
                        almost won.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        No. You’ve almost lost.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT (GASLAMPS) WESTINGHOUSE ESTATE - KITCHEN

           Late the following night, Paul and Agnes sit with George 
           Westinghouse in his kitchen.

           They’re showing him a SKETCH.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        ... What the hell is this?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Edison calls it an “electric 
                        chair.”

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Why would you make that? It’d kill 
                        somebody.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        That’s exactly why he wants to make 
                        it.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Thomas Edison has petitioned the 
                        State Legislature to abandon the 
                        noose. And to begin executing 
                        prisoners with this.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Why would Edison want his 
                        technology used to kill people?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        He didn’t ask the legislature to 
                        use his technology.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                             (getting it)
                        ... Oh my good God.
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        He’s going to make your A/C system 
                        the official current of death.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        The Fair Committee will never allow 
                        the current that New York uses to 
                        kill people to be the current that 
                        flows above their patrons.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Your technology is better. So 
                        Edison is going to see that it’s 
                        banned.

           INT (GASLAMPS) WESTINGHOUSE ESTATE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

           An hour later, Paul and Agnes walk down the hall towards 
           separate guest rooms on the second floor.

           They pause in front of their respective rooms.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Thank you. For what you’ve done 
                        for me. For us. It must have been 
                        difficult for you to come so 
                        quickly.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        It was the right thing to do. I’d 
                        have done it for anyone.

           ON PAUL: Is he chastened by that? Or emboldened because she’s 
           here with him?

           Another charged moment between them. They’re alone...

           ... If Paul leaned in and kissed her, no one would know...

           ... Does she want him to? ...

           ... But he can’t.

           Paul turns and enters his bedroom.

           ON AGNES: Simultaneously wishes he’d kissed her but is 
           grateful that he didn’t.

           INT (DAYLIGHT) COURTROOM - BUFFALO, NY

           Paul argues in the courtroom of JUDGE DAY.
           Grosvenor Lowrey is at the opposing table.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Your Honor, even if the State 
                        has the right to electrocute a 
                        prisoner with alternating current, 
                        it lacks the equipment to do so. My 
                        client has never sold an A/C 
                        generator to the State of New York.

                                 JUDGE DAY
                        Cannot the State simply purchase 
                        one of Mr. Westinghouse’s 
                        generators from one of the many New 
                        Yorkers who owns one?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Actually, it cannot.
                             (produces a set of 
                              documents)
                        These are the bills-of-sale that my 
                        client makes with of its customers. 
                        As you’ll see, the language of this 
                        contract — which I wrote myself — 
                        clearly states that the customer is 
                        forbidden from selling the device 
                        to a third party. If anyone were to 
                        sell their A/C system to the State 
                        without my client’s approval, 
                        they’d be in violation of their 
                        agreement to operate the unit in 
                        question.

           Judge Day looks over the contracts: Paul is right.

                                 JUDGE DAY
                        It appears that Mr. Cravath is 
                        correct.

           Paul relishes a rare and all-too-precious moment of victory.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        Very well. Unless, of course, we 
                        already owned one of Mr. 
                        Westinghouse’s generators. Legally. 
                        And we donated it to the State.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        We’ve never sold you an A/C system.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        Indeed. The same cannot be said, 
                        however, for all of your local 
                        partners.
           A man stands up from the audience...

           ... It’s CHARLES COFFIN, the Massachusetts businessman who 
           Paul had met with early on.

           Coffin walks to the front of the courtroom —

           — And over to Lowrey’s table.

                                 CHARLES COFFIN
                             (to Paul)
                        Sorry, Kid. Goliath pays better.

           INT (GASLAMPS) WESTINGHOUSE ESTATE - MAIN VILLA - BEDROOM

           George and Marguerite Westinghouse get ready for bed.

           As is their routine, she sits in her MAKE-UP CHAIR while he 
           helps her to remove the POWDER from her face.

           It’s sweet, familiar. They’ve been through a lot together.

                                 MARGUERITE WESTINGHOUSE
                        ... Wait, you’re going to have to 
                        remind me who he is again. Charles 
                        Coffin?

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        He runs a small copper company — 
                        you know what? It doesn’t matter. 
                        The first execution isn’t till next 
                        week. Perhaps we can find a buyer 
                        for —

                        — George.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        What?

                                 MARGUERITE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Find a buyer for a company that 
                        manufactures a murder machine that 
                        will soon be banned across the 
                        country? By next week A/C won’t be 
                        worth a dime. Just stop.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        I owe $2 million in damages. If I 
                        can’t sell the company then the 
                        next thing to sell will be —
                                 MARGUERITE WESTINGHOUSE
                        — The house?
                             (off his surprise)
                        I spoke to the accountants. It’s 
                        all right.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Selling our home is all right?

                                 MARGUERITE WESTINGHOUSE
                        ... Do you remember when we met?

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        You know, honestly, I met so many 
                        young women in those days...

                                 MARGUERITE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Ha. Ha. There was a gleeful irony 
                        to meeting the world’s foremost 
                        designer of railroad parts on a 
                        train.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        We were travelling third class. I 
                        wasn’t the foremost anything just 
                        yet.

                                 MARGUERITE WESTINGHOUSE
                        My point exactly. I didn’t mind 
                        being poor.

           ON WESTINGHOUSE: His wife — not to mention his son — are 
           simply too good for him. They deserve better.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        ... I did.

           INT (GASLAMP) PAUL’S APARTMENT - 50TH STREET

           Paul wades through the enormous stacks of legal documents 
           that cover every surface of his apartment when he hears a 
           KNOCK at the door.

           He answers it to find...

           ... George Westinghouse.

           Paul is embarrassed at Westinghouse seeing where he lives.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Sir. There’s port somewhere. Maybe—
                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        — I don’t care what you have to do. 
                        I don’t care what it takes. But 
                        this execution cannot happen.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I tried appealing on constitutional 
                        grounds. Cruel and unusual 
                        punishment. But unfortunately the 
                        court won’t —

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        — If this execution happens, I will 
                        not simply lose the fair. I’ll have 
                        gambled away everything I own on 
                        banned, worthless technology. I am 
                        unwilling to sell off the roof over 
                        my family’s head. Do you 
                        understand?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        The only person who can call off 
                        the execution now is Edison. And 
                        there is nothing we can offer him 
                        that —

           Paul stops. Realizes something.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        What?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        There is exactly one thing we can 
                        offer Edison that he wants.
                             (beat)
                        But you’re really not going to like 
                        it.

           INT (DAYLIGHT) EDISON GENERAL ELECTRIC - CORNER OFFICE

           An AIDE leads Paul into Thomas Edison’s corner office.

           Edison has been expecting him.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Paul Cravath! I feel as if we never 
                        see each other anymore. How have 
                        you been?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Call off the execution.
                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        There is nothing in the world you 
                        could offer that would convince me 
                        to do that.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Are you sure?

           Paul takes out an ENVELOPE and places it on the desk.

           ON EDISON: Paul has piqued his curiosity.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH (CONT’D)
                        ... That’s a letter to the Fair 
                        Committee. George Westinghouse’s 
                        signature is already on it.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        What does it say?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        It’s not sealed.

           Edison opens the letter...

           ... And as he reads his eyes go wide.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        You’re rescinding your bid to light 
                        the World’s Fair?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        All you have to do is put that 
                        letter in the mail and we’re done. 
                        The fair is yours.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        The fair will be mine anyway.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Probably. But why risk it? Make 
                        this deal and you won’t need to 
                        bother going through with the 
                        execution. You’ll have nothing more 
                        to gain by bankrupting 
                        Westinghouse. You want to win? 
                        Here. You win.

           ON EDISON: He doesn’t like making deals with his enemies. But 
           Paul is literally offering him something for essentially 
           nothing...

           Edison takes the letter.
                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Pleasure doing business with you, 
                        Kid.

           EXT (DAYLIGHT) DOWNTOWN INDUSTRIAL BUILDING - MANHATTAN

           Paul arrives at a crummy looking INDUSTRIAL BUILDING: A five-
           story sweat-shop of SEAMSTRESSES and who-knows-what else.

           Paul CHECKS the address against a piece of paper: Yup, this 
           is the place. 

           He enters —

           INT (DAYLIGHT) TESLA’S LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul climbs the steps to the fourth floor, where a doorway 
           leads him to —

           — TESLA’S NEW MANHATTAN LABORATORY. As rundown as the outside 
           is, the inside is marvelous — pristine, well-appointed, 
           stocked with EVERY KIND OF ELECTRICAL AND SCIENTIFIC GIZMO 
           IMAGINABLE.

           Tesla looks up from his WORKSTATION, happy to see Paul. He is 
           the only person here.

           INT (DAYLIGHT) TESLA’S LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           As Tesla shows him around the lab, Paul takes it all in.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Is this what you’ve built with 
                        your royalties?

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        A palace of my own inventions. No 
                        company. No business. Purely my 
                        thoughts birthed to life.

           ON PAUL: It’s remarkable. And lonely.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I’ve come to tell you that we’ve 
                        rescinded our bid for the World’s 
                        Fair.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        Why would you do that?
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Because in exchange, Edison has 
                        agreed to call off the execution. 
                        Your alternating current won’t be 
                        banned, and you can keep working on 
                        all of these machines.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        No. No. No. No. No.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        This is rotten news, but at least 
                        this way you can —

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        — NO. Undo what you have done. Re-
                        submit, please.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        The fair rules are quite clear. 
                        It’s done.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        This bid had not been yours to 
                        rescind.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        It was ours. And I made a decision 
                        that was in all of our best 
                        interests.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        ... You have never for one moment 
                        understood myself. For why I have 
                        done all of this.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Nikola, believe it or not but I’m 
                        your friend. I did this for you.

           Tesla looks at Paul as if he is the most detestable, 
           conniving bastard in the world.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        Why do you believe I first bid, 
                        after you had lost?
                             (off Paul’s look)
                        I arrived on your stone shore with 
                        no items of possession. An 
                        immigrant on your island. Can you 
                        imagine what it would be to have my 
                        name upon the World’s Fair? My 
                        mother in Serbia. My father. My 
                        sisters. They would see this. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NIKOLA TESLA (CONT'D)
                        That I have travelled to America, 
                        that I have left them, for 
                        something.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        You never told me.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        You never asked.

           ON PAUL: This is a punch to the gut.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA (CONT’D)
                        I have watched the way you regarded 
                        me at the Player’s Club. As if I am 
                        some infant naif. No. The richest 
                        of Mannhattaners were knowing that 
                        an immigrant was to build for them 
                        what Thomas Edison had not. You 
                        believe myself crazy because I 
                        verbalize in an odd manner? I have 
                        this accent, so I am but a joke to 
                        you? With nothing I have done what 
                        your great men could not. And now, 
                        thanks to your lawyering, no person 
                        will ever know.

           ON PAUL: He thought he was helping Tesla... And now Tesla 
           hates him for it.

           INT (ELECTRIC LIGHT) METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - DRESSING ROOM

           Agnes finishes putting on her manly SAILOR’S COSTUME and 
           looks at herself in the mirror.

           Sure enough, she looks just like Paul Jones...

           ON AGNES: Is this what the public wants?

                                 HENRY JAYNE (O.S.)
                        Well hello gorgeous.

           She turns to find Henry Jayne in the doorway, bearing 
           FLOWERS.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        You like it?
                                 HENRY JAYNE
                        I’d give you a kiss but I think 
                        that might be illegal.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Thank you.

                                 HENRY JAYNE
                        Are roses bad luck before a show? 
                        Someone told me that once.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        I don’t mean for the roses.
                             (beat)
                        It means a lot to me that you’d 
                        support my singing. Not every man 
                        in New York would.

           ON JAYNE: He really does care for her.

                                 HENRY JAYNE
                        Well it’s the autumn show at the 
                        Met, for Christ’s sake. I didn’t 
                        want you to miss out on this just 
                        because there weren’t lady sailors 
                        in the Revolutionary War.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        I bet I’d be rather handy on a 
                        boat, actually.

                                 HENRY JAYNE
                        I love to hear you sing. And it’s 
                        quite a triumph to bow out on top.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        ... “Bow out?”

                                 HENRY JAYNE
                        Not to be presumptuous... But if 
                        our respective mothers get their 
                        way and we are engaged...
                             (beat)
                        ... Well Agnes, it’s not as if you 
                        can perform when we’re married.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Why would I have to stop singing if 
                        we were married?

           ON JAYNE: Is she really this naive about how the world works?
                                 HENRY JAYNE
                        ... Agnes Huntington is a great 
                        star of the New York Stage. Agnes 
                        Jayne, on the other hand... Well my 
                        family couldn’t bear it.

           ON AGNES: Has she sung her way to the top of New York society 
           only to be forced by that same society to stop singing?

           INT (DAYLIGHT) CARTER, HUGHES & CRAVATH - PAUL’S OFFICE

           Charles Hughes walks into Paul’s office at dawn, the morning 
           paper under his arm and a pale look on his face.

           Hughes sees Paul asleep at his desk. Paul clearly didn’t go 
           home the night before.

           As Hughes COUGHS, Paul wakes up.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        There’s news about the execution.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Yes, I know. Edison agreed to call 
                        it off.

                                 CHARLES HUGHES
                        Is that what he told you?

           Hughes shows Paul the newspaper. The headline:

           “FIRST EXECUTION WITH ALTERNATING CURRENT TOMORROW”

                                 CHARLES HUGHES (CONT’D)
                        I’d say the headline should read 
                        “Edison lied”, but that’s not 
                        exactly news, is it?

           ON PAUL: If there is any possible way he could have fucked 
           this up worse, he doesn’t know about it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT (DAYLIGHT) AUBURN STATE PRISON - UPSTATE NEW YORK

           At 6am the next day, a CROWD has gathered outside the PRISON 
           GATES for the execution.

           As Paul pushes through, a REPORTER tries to get close.

                                 REPORTER
                        Mr. Cravath! Care to comment?
                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        John, this an execution, and you 
                        should be ashamed of yourself for 
                        covering it like a ball game. So 
                        no: I don’t have a comment.

           Paul just brushes him off as he enters —

           INT (DAYLIGHT) AUBURN STATE PRISON - EXECUTION CHAMBER

           A basement room has been outfitted for the world’s first 
           execution by electric chair.

           Two dozen seats for various LAWYERS, JOURNALISTS, PHYSICIANS, 
           the WARDEN, Judge Day and Edison’s attorney Grosvenor Lowrey.

           Paul sits as far away from Lowrey as possible as they face 
           the OAK CHAIR in the center of the room. LEATHER STRAPS. 
           WIRES running up the sides, which come from the ceiling. A 
           BELL in the corner lets the warden communicate with the 
           EXECUTIONERS who will OPERATE THE GENERATOR from a faraway 
           room.

           The PRISONER is led to his seat. He’s wearing a three-piece 
           suit of a lovely summer grey.

           The guards STRAP the Prisoner into the chair. They attach 
           ELECTRODES to his back, cutting holes in his shirt to do so.

           They’re about to attach a LEATHER HEADPIECE around his skull 
           when the warden offers the Prisoner an opportunity for any 
           last words.

                                 PRISONER
                        Gentlemen. I wish you all good 
                        luck. I know where I am headed and 
                        I know that it is a good place. I 
                        can only hope the same will be true 
                        of you.

           The warden shakes his head.

           Paul watches as the guards fit the headpiece onto the 
           Prisoner’s skull, sliding a wet sponge into his mouth.

           He will be unable to scream.

                                 WARDEN
                        All right then.

           The Warden RINGS A BELL —
           — IN A DISTANT ROOM: EXECUTIONERS turn the CRANK of a 
           Westinghouse A/C generator —

           — And Paul braces himself as 1000 volts of A/C FLOW THROUGH 
           THE BODY OF THE PRISONER.

           The Prisoner SHIVERS —

           — His muscles TIGHTEN —

           — His hands FLUTTER, trying to escape —

           — But the straps HOLD FIRM —

           — As the Prisoner’s index finger CURLS IN ON ITSELF —

           — Drawing BLOOD from his palm —

           — Until, blessedly, it’s OVER.

           The warden again RINGS THE BELL, the distant executioners 
           stop turning the crank, and the Prisoner’s body SLUMPS.

           Paul looks to Lowrey, who SHUDDERS: Thank God that’s all. 

           Paul stands: Some air would feel good about now.

           But just then...

           ... He hears a FAINT NOISE.

           Everyone looks: The NOISE is coming from the Prisoner.

                                 PHYSICIAN IN AUDIENCE
                        Oh dear God... He’s still alive!

           White froth BURBLES from the Prisoner’s mouth as he tries to 
           breath, but finds his lungs too burnt to use.

           The warden quickly takes control:

                                 WARDEN
                        Sit! Everyone! Be seated!

           He rings the bell furiously —

           — The executioners, confused, turn the crank again —

           — And another 1000 VOLTS OF A/C FIRE THROUGH THE PRISONER.

           Burning. Frying. Sizzling.

           Paul can smell the Prisoner from where he’s sitting.
           The warden rings the bell to stop it —

           — The current ceases —

           — But this time the Prisoner HEAVES against his restraints.

           Whatever pain he must be in must be unbearable.

                                 PHYSICIAN IN AUDIENCE
                        Stop it! This is horrible.

           But the warden ignores the cries of protest and tries a third 
           time —

           — Ringing the bell, sending the current through the Prisoner—

           — Who now begins to BURN ALIVE:

           The sponge in his mouth starts to fry, like chicken 
           blackening in a pan.

           Wisps of smoke rise from the Prisoner’s hair.

           It takes FOUR HORRIBLE TRIES TO KILL THE PRISONER —

           — Over the growing protests from everyone assembled —

           — And to the increasing dismay of Lowrey —

           — As the poor man’s eyes turn black —

           — And blood pours from the wound in his hand —

           — And at long last the same BLUE HELLFIRE that Paul saw above 
           Broadway those fateful months before BURSTS from his mouth, 
           incinerating his skull.

           Fucking pandemonium as EVERYONE FLEES.

           EXT (DAYLIGHT) AUBURN STATE PRISON - YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           The men BURST into the morning sunshine.

           Paul immediately VOMITS into the dirt. This is the most 
           horrific thing he has ever — or will ever — witness.

           Behind him, the various physicians TALK animatedly, trying to 
           figure out what the hell just happened.

           The reporters SCRIBBLE in their notebooks, hoping to take 
           down each gruesome detail.
           ON PAUL: Sick to his stomach... Covered in dirt... Staring at 
           his shirt sleeve, which he notices is streaked with BLOOD...

           ... When suddenly Paul realizes something.

           He jumps to his feet and approaches the reporter from before:

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                             (to Reporter)
                        John! You know what, I would like 
                        to comment. This is an important 
                        event and I for one am grateful to 
                        you for covering it. It’s been 
                        proven beyond a reasonable doubt: 
                        A/C isn’t too deadly. It’s too 
                        safe.

           Agnes enters her dressing room after the night’s show to find 
           Paul waiting for her.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        What are you doing here?
                             (beat)
                        And who even let you in?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        “Edison lied.” The headlines 
                        finally say it.

           He shows her the evening PAPER.

           ON THE HEADLINE: “A/C TOO SAFE TO KILL — Edison’s 
           misstatements under scrutiny”

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        ... And he killed a man in the 
                        process.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Did he lie about A/C’s dangers? Or 
                        was he just mistaken? This is an 
                        opportunity.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        For what?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... I’m working on that.
                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        You already rescinded your bid for 
                        the fair.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Yes. And once a bid is rescinded, 
                        that’s it. 

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        So there’s only one remaining bid, 
                        and it has Edison’s name on it.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        If Edison’s name is  —

           Paul stops. He is in the middle of the thinking up the most 
           important idea of his life.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH (CONT’D)
                        — His name... Shit... Edison’s name 
                        has to be on the bid...

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        What are you mumbling about?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        We’re going to submit a new bid.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        You just said you couldn’t.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        A joint bid.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        You already submitted a joint bid 
                        with Tesla.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Not a joint bid with Tesla. A joint 
                        bid with Edison.

                        I’m genuinely having a hard time 
                        figuring out which.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I can’t do this without your 
                        signing off. Literally. There are 
                        going to be a lot of documents. And 
                        we’ll need Tesla’s signature as

                        He hasn’t responded to my letters. 
                        Any of them.

                        You’re a good man, Paul. And he 
                        should know what you’re doing for 
                        him. What you’re doing for all of

                        But before I can explain it to him, 
                        you’re going to have to explain it

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        It’s a... “hostile takeover.” But 
                        if it works, then Westinghouse will 
                        effectively control Edison’s 
                        company.

                                 WALTER CARTER
                        If it doesn’t, than Edison will 
                        most certainly own Westinghouse’s.

                        Because your client isn’t Thomas 
                        Edison. It’s his company.

                                 GROSVENOR LOWREY
                        Thomas Edison is his company.

           he rat Carter and Paul out to Edison?

           run-down hotel.

           ON WESTINGHOUSE: This is not somewhere one wants to end up.

           The bellboy takes Westinghouse to a room, and Westinghouse 
           KNOCKS on the door.

           The door opens to reveal...

           ... Nikola Tesla.

           He seems rather worse for wear.

           INT (DAYLIGHT) HOTEL NEW YORKER - TESLA’S ROOM - MOMENTS

           Tesla shows Westinghouse around his messy, single-occupancy 
           hotel room.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        ... I have enlisted all of the

                        Eliza.

           Tesla shows Westinghouse ELIZA, his PET PIGEON, in a cage.

           Tesla feeds the pigeon lovingly — she is his best friend and 
           only companion.

           ON WESTINGHOUSE: This poor guy really is losing it.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        ... Look, I want to clean up this 
                        business between you and Paul. He 
                        told me that you were upset about 
                        the fair. That you wanted your

                        you sign these, you will.

           From his coat, Westinghouse removes a BLUE FOLDER OF 
           DOCUMENTS.

           ON TESLA: Face brightening. Is that really possible?

           removed from the auditorium, allowing the THOUSAND GUESTS to 
           DANCE freely across the great domed room. STRINGS OF ELECTRIC 
           LIGHTS hang from the balconies. A FORTY-PERSON ORCHESTRA 
           plays a spirited waltz.

           And the GUESTS... Rainbow-draped, diamond-jeweled, 
           extravagantly buoyant décolletage.

           The sight takes Paul’s breath away for a moment, until he 
           spies...

           ... Thomas Edison. Talking to a COTERIE OF MEN at one side of 
           the dance floor.

           Agnes sees Edison, and then points elsewhere, at the back of 
           a man we assume to be JP MORGAN.

           ... And begins to TWIRL.

           It takes Paul a moment to realize that Agnes is LEADING HIM 
           IN A WALTZ ACROSS THE DANCE FLOOR.

           As Paul struggles to keep up, he can feel her warm breath on 
           his neck. Feels the tightening muscles on her back.

           He tries to avoid eye contact as he dances. Trying to avoid 
           the way he feels about her, this woman he cannot have, this 
           love who will soon be engaged to another man, when...

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        One bid for the World’s Fair. One 
                        system. Our current. Your bulbs. We 
                        do the manufacturing. You get a 
                        royalty. Both companies are more 
                        profitable. 

           ON MORGAN: This is... Nuts... Isn’t it?

                                 JP MORGAN
                        Thomas will never in a million 
                        years partner with you.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Great. Because I don’t want to 
                        partner with him. I want to partner 
                        with you.
                             (beat)
                        Fire Edison. Replace him with a 
                        proven corporate executive who we 
                        can trust to zealously pursue only 
                        the bottom line. 
                                 JP MORGAN
                        You have a guy in mind?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Charles Coffin.
                             (off Morgan’s look)
                        You install Coffin at the helm of 
                        EGE. He makes the partnership deal 
                        with Westinghouse. Together, we 
                        eliminate the burden on consumers 
                        of having to choose between our 
                        incompatible products. Let’s stop 
                        trusting our futures to a fickle 
                        public and an unpredictable free 
                        market. Let’s put the control back 
                        where it belongs: In the boardroom.

           ON MORGAN: Thinking about what Paul is suggesting. Playing 
           out all the angles. All the implications.

           Is he going for it?

           Morgan reaches into his pocket and removes a CIGAR. Lights 
           it. Blows SMOKE across the room.

           From outside, we hear the SOUNDS of the partygoers: “3... 
           2... 1... HAPPY NEW YEAR!” Yelling and applause.

                                 JP MORGAN
                             (re: the noise)
                        ... 1890. Did you ever think you’d 
                        live to see it?

           EXT (DAYLIGHT) WALL STREET - MANHATTAN

           A few days later, the sun rises over Wall Street.

           The boulevard is already busy, even at dawn. The American 
           dream is being bought and sold a million times a day by the 
           ambitious men running back and forth across the street.

           And right at the corner, at the literal cornerstone of 
           American capitalism, sits:

           INT (DAYLIGHT) JP MORGAN’S OFFICE - WALL STREET

           Morgan’s office is thick with cigar smoke. He sits behind his 
           enormous desk, taking in his visitors.

           REVEAL: George Westinghouse. Walter Carter. Charles Hughes. 
           Grosvenor Lowrey. Charles Coffin...
           ... And Paul Cravath.

           They all look exhausted — no one has slept much in the past 
           few days.

           In a quiet moment, the FINAL CONTRACTS ARE SIGNED.

           Paul stares at the signatures. A few pen strokes just sealed 
           the future of American industry, science, law... And light.

           Westinghouse SHAKES Paul’s hand.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        ... Very well done, young man.

           ON PAUL: This is the proudest moment of his life.

           ON HUGHES AND CARTER: “Shit. The kid actually pulled it off.”

           ON LOWREY AND COFFIN: “Edison got what he deserved.”

           ON MORGAN: It’s impossible to tell as he puffs at his cigar.

           But suddenly the door bursts open, revealing —

           — THOMAS EDISON.

           His face is ashen as he looks around the room at these men — 
           his enemies, his friends, his partners — who have all 
           conspired to betray him.

                                 JP MORGAN
                        ... Let’s not have a scene.

           ON EDISON: This is the worst moment of his life.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Just tell me the part about the 
                        company name isn’t true.

                                 JP MORGAN
                        That part was my idea. I didn’t 
                        want the name “Edison” hanging over 
                        the company like a spectre. 
                        “General Electric.” It’s snappier.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        You took my name away?

                                 JP MORGAN
                        Thomas... It’s business.
           ON EDISON: Looking at the resolute faces of these men one by 
           one... Preparing to launch into another of his bellicose 
           speeches...

           The men all brace for it as Edison opens his mouth...

                                 THOMAS EDISON

           But he has nothing left.

           Instead Edison just SLINKS AWAY. Out the door. Humbled. 
           Humiliated. Defeated.

           ON PAUL: At least Goliath had the courtesy to fall with a 
           grand thud when David slew him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT (ELECTRIC LIGHTS) THE WORLD’S FAIR - CHICAGO - MONTHS 
           LATER

           ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PATRONS pour through the gates of the 
           World’s Fair: An unprecedented 600 ACRE, 200 BUILDING 
           celebration of American technological achievement.

           The people flowing through these gates are mostly from small 
           towns — they’ve never seen a building over 3 stories. This 
           fair has an 8.5 million cubic foot art museum and a 265 foot 
           Ferris Wheel. (The world’s first, actually. George Ferris is 
           scurrying around somewhere making sure it works.)

           Before the fair closes, 27 million people will attend. For 
           most of them, this is their first experience of electric 
           lights. And these lights, as we can see, have one name on 
           them:

                  W    E    S    T    I    N    G    H    O    U    S    E

           At the very center, a GRAND TENT displays the next generation 
           of electrical devices. Emblazoned across it, in bold NEON 
           LETTERING, is another name:

                        T
                                  E
                                            S
                                                      L
                                                               A

           Yet throughout the fair, the name “Edison” is nowhere to be 
           found.

           ON THE PUBLIC: OOOHING and AAAAHING as they walk under 
           electric lights for the first time.

           AT THE GATES:
           A STAGE has been assembled, before which thousands of people 
           await remarks to commemorate the grand opening. Families. 
           Children enjoying a new novelty called “cotton candy.”

           BACK STAGE:

           Paul and Agnes peek out between the WOOD BOARDS at the 
           PUBLIC.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        ... I dunno, do you think they’re 
                        excited enough?

           Before Paul can respond to her joke they’re interrupted by —

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        Damn it! Where’s my speech?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        Sir?

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        10,000 people out there and I can’t 
                        find my speech!

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        It must be around somewhere.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        If it was around here, I’d be 
                        holding it, now wouldn’t I?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Have you checked the carriage?

           ON WESTINGHOUSE: Shit. He did not.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        ... I’ll be right back.
                             (calling O/S)
                        Marguerite! The carriage!

           Paul and Agnes watch Westinghouse go.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        He really does hate public 
                        appearances.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        He just gets nervous. 
                             (removes the SPEECH from 
                              his coat)
                        That’s why he wrote out his speech 
                        by hand.
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAUL CRAVATH (CONT'D)
                             (off Agnes’ shocked look)
                        He left it at the hotel.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        You are such a scoundrel!

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        What do you expect? I’m a lawyer.

           She LAUGHS, but her expression changes as she sees someone in 
           the distance.

           Paul turns to see what she’s looking at:

           Nikola Tesla, preparing a NEON TUBE for a display.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        ... You haven’t spoken to him yet?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        I don’t know what to... Do you 
                        think he’s forgiven me?

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        I suppose there’s only one way to 
                        find out.
                             (beat)
                        I’m going to get Marguerite in on 
                        your little joke. No one will find 
                        this funnier than she will.
                             (re: Tesla)
                        Good luck.

           Agnes walks off to find George and Marguerite Westinghouse.

           Paul slowly approaches Tesla.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... I’ve been walking the grounds 
                        all day, and everywhere I turn, I 
                        see your name. In neon, no less.

           Tesla looks up at him...

           ... And SMILES.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        It is pleasing to visage you, Mr. 
                        Paul Cravath, Esquire.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        It’s good to see you too.
                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        I am indebted.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        No. I’m the one who’s indebted. 
                        Thank you for your faith in me.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        When Mr. George Westinghouse told 
                        me of your difficulty with my 
                        royalty, I knew that granting them 
                        to you was the only correct route.

           ON PAUL: Wait... What?

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        ... Royalty? What are you talking 
                        about?

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        I gave all of my royalties to Mr. 
                        George Westinghouse.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT (DAYLIGHT) HOTEL NEW YORKER - TESLA’S ROOM - FLASHBACK

           We return to the scene of Westinghouse enlisting Tesla’s 
           support in the coup against Edison.

           This is the part we didn’t see.

           Westinghouse hands Tesla the SECOND SET OF DOCUMENTS. The RED 
           FOLDER.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE
                        I’ll be straight with you. You and 
                        I are visionaries. But Paul is an 
                        imbecile. And thanks to him, I owe 
                        $2 million that I don’t have. The 
                        only way to keep me afloat is if 
                        you give up that expensive royalty 
                        we’re paying you. For the good of 
                        the team. So we can light the 
                        World’s Fair.

           Tesla nods. Lighting the fair is all he’s ever wanted.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA (V.O.)
                             (to Paul)
                        It was only money. What is that, 
                        compared to what we have done?
           Tesla happily SIGNS THE PAPERS Westinghouse gives him, 
           oblivious to the fact that he’s signing over all of his 
           future earnings. Millions and millions of dollars.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH (V.O.)
                        Without that royalty, you’ll have 
                        no income. No lab. No — damn it, 
                        where was your attorney?

           Back to Paul and Nikola in the present.

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                        Mr. George Westinghouse said I did 
                        not have requirement for one. You 
                        were looking after me. I have 
                        always had trust for you, Mr. Paul 
                        Cravath, Esquire.

           ON PAUL: His whole world just turned upside down.

                                 PAUL CRAVATH
                        No, Nikola... George lied to you. 
                        He tricked you. He just wanted the 
                        money. He stole your —

                                 NIKOLA TESLA
                             (seeing something O/S)
                        — Pardon! I must be examining the 
                        generators.

           Paul watches, helpless, as Tesla WALKS AWAY.

           Paul stands there shocked, stunned, hurt, trying to process 
           what he’s just learned when —

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE (O.S.)
                        After all this time, you’re nothing 
                        but a liar and a thief.

           Paul turns to find his client behind him, wearing a stern 
           expression... 

           ... Which breaks into a smile.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        The speech! Agnes told me about 
                        your joke. Very funny.
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Is everything all right? You look 
                        pale.

           ON PAUL: How can he even begin to express the betrayal?

           Instinctively, he just hands Westinghouse the speech.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. Now, shall we go make 
                        something wonderful?

           Paul can’t even move his lips as Westinghouse ASCENDS ONTO 
           THE STAGE...

           ... And the crowd bursts into WILD APPLAUSE.

           Paul stands at the side of the stage, swirling with white-hot 
           rage and cool-blue heartbreak.

           IN THE DISTANCE: Paul can see Nikola Tesla walking away from 
           the stage, into the dim dark background with his machines.

           ON PAUL: Westinghouse is no better than Edison. He might even 
           be worse.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                             (to the crowd)
                        Thank you! Thank you! Ladies and 
                        Gentlemen. Thank you. I cannot take 
                        credit for doing all of this alone 
                        — but I will.

           LAUGHTER from the crowd.

                                 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        But seriously, this is not about 
                        me. It’s about America. Tonight, 
                        together, we are all laying the 
                        foundation for the future of this 
                        country. And folks — the future of 
                        America is bright.

           Paul just stares when Agnes approaches from behind. She puts 
           her arm around him affectionately.

           Paul doesn’t know what to say — how he can even tell her...

           ... Agnes, unaware, looks up at the HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 
           LIGHT BULBS that hang over their heads.

                                 AGNES HUNTINGTON
                        Have you ever seen anything so 
                        beautiful?
           ON PAUL: A dark stain in the center of a fantastic landscape.

           TEXT ON SCREEN: After the fair, Nikola Tesla launched a 
           series of new ventures. All of them were financial failures. 
           He died penniless in his single room at the Hotel New Yorker.

           TEXT ON SCREEN: George Westinghouse’s A/C system became the 
           national standard for power in the United States. Tesla never 
           saw a cent of the profits. The Westinghouse Electrical 
           Company is currently part of a large conglomerate containing 
           Viacom and CBS.

           ON PAUL: He got the girl... He won the war... And look what 
           he’s become a part of to do it.

           TEXT ON SCREEN: Thomas Edison moved back to New Jersey, where 
           he went on to invent both phonographs and motion pictures. He 
           fought two more standards wars over those systems, first with 
           Victrola and then with the Warner Brothers. Edison lost both.

           TEXT ON SCREEN: Paul Cravath and Agnes Huntington married in 
           1892. Their daughter was born three years later. The 
           hierarchical “Cravath System” stands as the foundation of all 
           major law firms, including the one that even today bares 
           Paul’s name. It is the oldest and most prestigious firm in 
           New York.

           ON PAUL: Does he still believe in America anymore?

           Does anyone?

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
