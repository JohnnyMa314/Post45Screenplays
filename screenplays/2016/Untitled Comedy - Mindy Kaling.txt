           EXT. THE COMEDY STORE - NIGHT - LONDON

           CHYRON: LONDON, 1980

           It’s night, and it’s bitter winter. There is a light snow 
           falling. We see the famous London Comedy Store lighting up 
           the dark night like a beacon. There’s a line around the 
           block. 

           INT. COMEDY CLUB - BACKSTAGE 

           Backstage, in a smoky room that is at once bare and full of 
           electricity, we pan over a sea of MALE COMICS, talking, 
           drinking and smoking cigarettes. KATHERINE NEWBURY (19, very 
           nervous) enters. She has a freshly-skinned knee which is 
           bleeding.

           Heads turn. We see a man holding a clipboard, the MANAGER. 
           Katherine approaches. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Hi, I’m here to perform for the 
                        Sunday Showcase? I signed up weeks 
                        ago--

                                 MANAGER
                        Name.  

                                 KATHERINE
                        Katherine Newbury. I’m so sorry I’m 
                        late. I took the train from 
                        Cambridge-

                                 MANAGER
                            (grimacing)
                        What happened to your knee?

                                 KATHERINE
                        I ran here from the station. 

                                 MANAGER
                        You’ll have to go last. If we run 
                        over, you’re cut. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Don’t they usually put the new 
                        people in the middle?

                                 MANAGER
                        Don’t like the spot, don’t have to 
                        perform.

           Katherine nods. The manager glances at her bleeding knee. 
                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Clean that up. It’s very 
                        unappealing. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Of course. I’m so sorry. 

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           Katherine looks at herself in the mirror. She is wearing a 
           simple dress and has terrible pit stains. She dabs her knee 
           with a wet paper towel and applies lipstick.  

           INT. BACKSTAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER  

           Katherine looks out at the room of men. She retreats to a 
           corner. Katherine holds index cards with scribble on them. 
           She studies them. A few comics near her gossip. 

                                 BEARDED COMIC
                        You know, Walter Lovell is in the 
                        audience tonight. 

           Katherine perks up. 

                                 OLDER COMIC
                        Who is that?

                                 KATHERINE
                        The American comedy producer. He’s 
                        a legend. He manages Richard Pryor 
                        and half the cast of Saturday Night 
                        Live. He’s really here?

           The room regards her with silent suspicion. 

                                 BEARDED COMIC
                        Yes. 
                            (then)
                        Whose girl are you?

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m no one’s...I’m performing. 
                        Stand-up. 

                                 OLDER COMIC
                        You done stand-up before?

           Katherine braces herself.
                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes. I did a youth hostel in Soho 
                        and a club called Lentils.

                                 BEARDED COMIC
                        Lentils? The vegetarian restaurant 
                        on Carnaby?

                                 KATHERINE
                            (defensive)
                        They have a comedy night the first 
                        Tuesday of every month.

           The comics look at each other, who is this lightweight? Then 
           turn away from Katherine.

           INT. COMEDY CLUB - BACKSTAGE - A LITTLE LATER

           Katherine watches a comic onstage from backstage. She 
           impatiently checks her watch. It’s getting a little late. 
           Will she be able to go on? Her knee starts to bleed again. 
           Dammit. She pulls tissue from her armpit and dabs her knee 

           INT. COMEDY CLUB - BACKSTAGE - LATER 

           Katherine nurses a soda. There are two other glasses in front 
           of her. Then from stage: 

                                 EMCEE
                        Katie Newbury is next. This is her 
                        Comedy Store debut. I know 
                        literally nothing about her except 
                        she is-
                            (judgement)
                        From Cambridge. 

           Katherine bolts from her seat. As she passes the emcee, he 
           whispers:

                                 EMCEE (CONT’D)
                        You have three minutes.

                                 KATHERINE
                        My set is longer than that--

                                 EMCEE
                        They’re drunk and they’re tired. 
                        You have three minutes.

           Katherine is stunned and nervous and nods, walking onstage. 
           INT. COMEDY CLUB - LONDON - LATER 

           Katherine walks onstage. It is magical and overpowering. For 
           a moment it goes silent and Katherine closes her eyes. Being 
           on this stage is intoxicating. Then suddenly: 

           The light is blinding and the crowd is packed and wild. It’s 
           Friday night and they are drunk. 

           We hear Katherine’s breathing. It’s loud and scared. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Hello, everyone. My name is 
                        actually Katherine Newbury, not 
                        Katie. I’m fairly new to stand-up. 
                        I’m not saying I’m nervous, but if 
                        tonight goes badly, I will kill 
                        myself. 

           There is a ripple of some surprised laughter.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        The problem with being depressed - 
                        which I am, both clinically and 
                        conversationally - is that the 
                        highs and lows are not remotely 
                        equivalent. If tonight goes badly: 
                        I kill myself. If tonight goes 
                        well: I get a little drunk and take 
                        a train back to my university.

           People are now beginning to pay attention. Who is this girl?

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I was talking about it with my 
                        psychiatrist and I could tell I was 
                        depressing her, which is a whole 
                        new level of depressing for me-- 

           Then suddenly: 

                                 HECKLER
                        Fuck off you stupid cow!

           Katherine is thrown completely. She stumbles to regain 
           composure.

                                 KATHERINE
                        -So, um, the ups and downs are not 
                        the same.

           It’s too late, she’s totally thrown.
           INT. COMEDY CLUB - LONDON - MINUTES LATER 

           We hear a smattering of pity applause. The emcee takes the 
           stage. Katherine walks offstage past the comics, flushed and 
           fighting off tears. 

                                 BEARDED COMIC
                        It’s not so bad, Cambridge.

                                 OLDER COMIC
                        You don’t have to be funny with a 
                        face like that. 

           She grabs her coat and leaves, humiliated. 

           EXT. ALLEY - LONDON - CONTINUOUS

           Katherine storms outside. It’s now snowing quite a bit. 
           Holding back tears, she walks towards the street to hail a 
           cab. 

                                 MAN (O.C.)
                        Hey! You dropped this. 

           Katherine turns to see a dashing 50 YEAR OLD AMERICAN MAN. He 
           holds out a tube of LIPSTICK. Katherine walks back and takes 
           it. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Thank you. 
                            (re: cigarette)
                        Do you have another? 

                                 WALTER
                        I do. But I’m not going to give it 
                        to you. 

           Katherine looks at him quizzically. 

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        I saw you onstage tonight. You need 
                        to cope with failure in a healthier 
                        way. If not you’ll be smoking a lot 
                        of cigarettes. 

           Oh, fuck this guy. She stalks off. 

                                 KATHERINE
                            (under her breath)
                        Wanker. 
                                 WALTER
                            (calling off to her)
                        Oh, c’mon. I was just kidding.

           Katherine keeps marching away. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Fuck off. 

                                 WALTER
                        Well, it wouldn’t be a Tuesday 
                        night unless a comedian told me to 
                        fuck off. Last week it was Richard 
                        Pryor. 

           Katherine stops and turns around. Is it? Could it be? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Are you...?

           She walks back slowly. 

                                 WALTER
                        Walt Lovell. Comedy producer. 
                        American. Wanker. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m so sorry, I had no idea who you 
                        were.  

                                 WALTER
                        Out of curiosity, what does wanker 
                        mean, exactly?

                                 KATHERINE
                            (weakly)
                        It’s not that bad. It can be 
                        affectionate. 

                                 WALTER
                        You’re a terrible liar. But, I 
                        deserved it. I shouldn’t even be 
                        talking, I’m not a performer. The 
                        piano a little bit...

                                 KATHERINE
                            (very miserable)
                        I can’t believe you saw that. They 
                        told me I had three minutes, and I 
                        had a twelve minute set-

                                 WALTER
                        Twelve minutes? Jesus. What would 
                        you possibly have to say in--
                                 (MORE)
                                 WALTER (CONT'D)
                            (off her heartbroken face)
                        Okay..lets do this: to make up for 
                        me being a wanker, I’ll tell you 
                        what I thought of your performance 
                        in the amount of time it takes me 
                        to finish my cigarette. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Thank you so much. 

                                 WALTER
                        I was thinking about the reason it 
                        went so poorly. Your material isn’t 
                        bad, and it’s definitely not as bad 
                        as the reaction you got, which was, 
                        I think we can both characterize 
                        as, very negative. I think the 
                        reason is because you’re so clearly 
                        a winner. Which makes people 
                        dislike you to begin with, and on 
                        top of that--
                            (gestures to her outfit, 
                              face)
                        -you’re trying to look pretty. 
                        Which I bet you’re doing to project 
                        confidence, but it makes you seem 
                        like you don’t have any.

           Katherine is devastated over by this assessment. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        That was very...candid.

                                 WALTER
                        It’s how I would talk to a man. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        It’s hard to have confidence when 
                        every comic there either hates me 
                        or wants to fuck me and nothing in-
                        between. When you’re literally the 
                        only woman to show up at these open 
                        mics--

                                 WALTER
                        That’s your problem. You can’t have 
                        contempt for them. You are them. 
                        You are one of them. You’re not a 
                        woman, you’re not a man. You’re a 
                        comedian. 

           Katherine thinks on this. 
                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        And when you first walked onstage I 
                        leaned forward to see what you had 
                        to say. That’s not something that I 
                        do for many people. You’re smart. 
                        You connect. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Thank you. 

                                 WALTER
                        But this outfit, the dress? Not 
                        right. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I wanted to show that I cared.

                                 WALTER
                        You don’t look like you cared. You 
                        look beautiful. Like the most 
                        beautiful girl I’ve ever seen. 

           Katherine is stunned. Immediately Walter feels vulnerable, he 
           didn’t mean to say this to her. 

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        But that’s not the point. This 
                        lipstick? That’s your problem. 
                        You’re not a sex object, you’re a 
                        comedian. 

           She thinks about it. He finishes his cigarette and flicks it 
           on the ground.  

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Perfect timing. Good luck. 

           He starts to head back in. She steels up her courage. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Do you want to come back with me? 

                                 WALTER
                        Back with you?

                                 KATHERINE
                        To my dorm. At my university. We 
                        would have to take a train, unless 
                        you have a car. 
                            (then)
                        Do you want to come home with me? 

           Now Walter is taken aback. 
                                 WALTER
                        I’m old enough to be your father, 
                        Katie.

                                 KATHERINE
                        It’s Katherine, not Katie. And 
                        you’re older than my father. 

                                 WALTER
                        I’m married. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I know. 

           He walks up to her, shocked how attracted he is to her. He 
           takes her arm and they begin to walk away. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        How’s that for confidence?   

           She drops her lipstick in the snow, and they walk off into 
           the snowy London night.

           INT. KENNEDY CENTER, WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT (PRESENT DAY)

           Katherine (in her 50’s, magnificent, our heroine) gives an 
           acceptance speech at the Kennedy Center. She is receiving the 
           Mark Twain Prize for American Comedy. She is doing well. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        ...well, I think America is in a 
                        tough spot if they’re giving the 
                        Mark Twain Award for American 
                        Comedy to a foreigner. You’re 
                        really scraping the bottom of the 
                        barrel. Isn’t there someone still 
                        around from Laugh-In? Is Carol 
                        Burnett dead? 

           Some laughter. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        America is my great love because I 
                        fought to be here. I will never 
                        take it for granted. Because I view 
                        it as a privilege and not as a 
                        right. 

           Then. 
                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        And for young people watching, 
                        maybe you need to think about if 
                        you’ve fought enough for your 
                        privilege to exist here. Do you 
                        have the same drive and 
                        determination as the immigrants 
                        around you? Or are you plagued with 
                        the self-reflexive sickness that is 
                        the narcissism of social media? If 
                        I sound like I am speaking about it 
                        with contempt - you’re right, I am. 

           People listen.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Most of you know very little about 
                        me. And that is on purpose. I don’t 
                        have a publicist, I detest 
                        interviews. I don’t have a brand. I 
                        don’t have an app. It’s about my 
                        work. It’s always been about the 
                        work. My personal life is private. 
                        But here is what I can tell you. I 
                        can tell you that I have been 
                        married for thirty six years to the 
                        love of my life, Walter Lovell. 

           We see Walter, now 86, in a wheelchair in the audience. There 
           is applause. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Walter taught me about excellence. 
                        And seeking excellence has been my 
                        obsession ever since I met him. I 
                        have spent decades in search of it; 
                        both from myself and the people 
                        around me. Too many young people I 
                        meet think that being expressive is 
                        the most important quality. “I need 
                        to say it, therefore it must be 
                        important.” I disagree. Quietly 
                        learning to be good, rather than 
                        expecting the world to see the 
                        innate goodness in you - that’s 
                        important. And all the social media 
                        in the world can’t teach you that. 
                        So thank you America, Mr. 
                        President, Mark Twain, for this 
                        award. It’s been an honor to 
                        lecture you here tonight. Because 
                        it wouldn’t be an Katherine Newbury 
                        speech without a bit of a dressing 
                        down, would it?
           She smiles. More applause. 

           INT. - KENNEDY CENTER- RECEPTION HALL - LATER

           At the Presidential reception, there is a long receiving line 
           for Katherine. Two GROWN MEN take a selfie with her. She 
           cringes. She turns to an AIDE. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Can you direct me to the bathroom, 
                        please?

           The aide pulls her aside and they walk out. She walks 
           straight through a side entrance into the street, where the 
           car is waiting. 

           INT. KATHERINE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Katherine leafs through the trades. There is picture of 
           BONNIE MORTON, head of the network at NBC, early 50’s, tiny 
           and beautiful in a way that infuriates other women. There’s a 
           photo of her in a suit looking powerful with her hand on her 
           hip. Katherine frowns as she reads. 

           Katherine’s phone rings. It’s her executive producer, BRAD, 
           (40’s, looks 50’s, wan, brilliant, overworked) on the phone.

                                 BRAD
                        How’d the speech go?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Terribly.

                                 BRAD
                        Did you like what the writers 
                        wrote?

                                 KATHERINE
                        No. I threw out everything, which 
                        is a pity because I pay them a lot 
                        of money. I rewrote it myself.

                                 BRAD
                        You always rewrite it. If Mark 
                        Twain himself wrote your Mark Twain 
                        acceptance speech, you’d have 
                        rewritten it. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes, but probably a little less. 
                        Bradley, why are you bothering me? 
                                 BRAD
                        The network has been trying to 
                        reach us. You have to call Bonnie 
                        back. She’s the head of the 
                        network. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m actually reading an article 
                        about her right now. Listen to 
                        this. ”As the female president of 
                        the network,” - don’t start a 
                        sentence with “As a female”, how 
                        tacky - “I need to care about 
                        things that my male counterparts 
                        don’t. Making dinner for the kids, 
                        getting my hair colored. It’s a 
                        balancing act.” Uch, regular 
                        Elizabeth Cady Stanton, isn’t she? 

                                 BRAD
                        Who’s that? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        A woman who never colored her hair.

                                 BRAD
                        Also, Gabe Eichler wants to talk to 
                        you.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Who the fuck is Gabe Eichler?

                                 BRAD
                        He’s one of our writers. I’ve told 
                        you repeatedly.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Can’t you just do it?

                                 BRAD
                        He requested you be there. I think 
                        it’s about a raise.

           INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL BAR - GEORGETOWN - NIGHT

           Katherine, still wearing her gown, drinks whiskey by the bar. 
           She texts Walter. 

                                 KATHERINE (TEXT)
                        Did you get back safely? I’m sure 
                        you have notes on the speech. 
                                 WALTER (TEXT)
                        My only note is that your husband 
                        looks much too old for you. Don’t 
                        drink too much, my love. 

                                 KATHERINE (TEXT)
                        I won’t. See you tomorrow. 

           Katherine smiles and puts down her phone. Just then, there is 
           a loud wave of laughter through the bar. People are rapt, 
           watching a TV, where an arena stand-up comedian in his 40’s 
           is pacing a stage in an HBO comedy special. He’s animated, 
           he’s great-looking, with charisma to burn. He’s also a manic 
           asshole. This is DANIEL PERKINS.

                                 PERKINS
                        You know what I hate? When someone 
                        tells you to take off your shoes 
                        when you go to their house. I’m 
                        like: “this ain’t Japan”. This is 
                        the United States and I will take 
                        my filthy fucking shoes all over 
                        your white carpet. So the next time 
                        you go to someone’s house who asks 
                        you to take off your shoes, do 
                        this: take a shit in one of the 
                        shoes. 

           A bunch of YOUNG BANKERS in their 20’s (look like they went 
           to Duke, but definitely not as smart) sit next to Katherine, 
           watching the TV and laugh loudly. One of them, good-looking, 
           notices Katherine. 

                                 BANKER
                        You’re on TV, aren’t you.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Katherine Newbury. Tonight with 
                        Katherine Newbury. 

                                 BANKER
                        Holy shit. That’s awesome. You 
                        should have Perkins on your show. 
                        He’s great.

                                 KATHERINE
                        He’s certainly very popular. What 
                        do you like so much about him?

                                 BANKER
                        He’s just really funny. He says all 
                        this crazy shit, it’s just like, 
                        crazy.
                                 KATHERINE
                        Crazy how? Is it absurd or non-
                        sequiturs?

           Banker has no idea what she’s talking about. 

                                 BANKER
                        It’s just like he’s the funniest 
                        guy in my frat, he says the stuff 
                        you think about and just don’t say.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Maybe there’s a reason you 
                        shouldn’t say it.

           He looks at her quizzically. 

                                 BANKER
                        Can I buy you a drink? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’ve had enough to drink. I’m in 
                        room 612. Come alone. 

           She leaves. 

           INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

           Katherine and the Banker finish having sex. 

                                 BANKER
                        So, you’re married, huh? I just 
                        looked you up.  

           Katherine goes ice cold. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        When I come back, you should not be 
                        here. 

           She enters the bathroom and shuts the door. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - MORNING - VARIOUS

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - KATHERINE’S OFFICE - 
           NEXT DAY

           Katherine and Brad sit across from GABE EICHLER (comedy 
           writer, nebbish, 40’s). He looks nervous. 
                                 GABE
                        I’m here to ask for a raise. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Okay. Why do you think you deserve 
                        one? 

                                 GABE
                        Well, you know, I am in a single 
                        income household. And Jen and I 
                        just had our second baby. Taylor. A 
                        girl. 

           He shows her a photo on his phone. Katherine nods politely.  

                                 BRAD
                        She’s getting so big--

                                 KATHERINE
                            (rote)
                        Very cute. 

                                 GABE
                        I’m facing a lot of new expenses at 
                        home, I’ve been at the show for 
                        over a decade, I love working here 
                        and I think it’s time for a raise. 

           There is a long beat as Katherine mulls this over. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I see. Gabe, this is actually 
                        exciting. 

                                 GABE
                            (light up)
                        Really?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes. Because what you are 
                        describing here is the most clear-
                        cut example of the classic sexist 
                        argument for the advancement of men 
                        in the workplace I have ever heard. 
                        This is why in the fifties men were 
                        promoted over the women they worked 
                        with. “Family men” got promoted and 
                        single women were not. I’ve never 
                        encountered it in such a clean, 
                        teachable way. 

                                 GABE
                        I don’t think that’s at all what’s 
                        happening. 
                                 KATHERINE
                        Of course it is. I can’t give you a 
                        raise. It’s like if I gave a drug 
                        addict a raise. 

                                 GABE
                        I do not see that at all.

                                 KATHERINE
                        It’s practically identical. A drug 
                        addict makes certain decisions 
                        outside of work for their sense of 
                        comfort and self. Then their 
                        addiction demands more money, more 
                        time, more attention. Like a child.

                                 GABE
                        Taylor is like a drug problem?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Exactly! You are saying that 
                        because you had a child - something 
                        no one asked you to do - you should 
                        get special treatment. If you had 
                        put in more hours this past year it 
                        might make some sense. But no, in 
                        fact you’ve been here less 
                        frequently because of your personal 
                        situation. 

                                 GABE
                        How did you know that?

           Katherine leans in. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I know everything, Gabe. 

           Brad nods. She does. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t do it. You can imagine how 
                        unfair that would be to a single 
                        man. Or a woman.

                                 GABE
                        Well, there aren’t any women on 
                        this staff. And there haven’t been 
                        for as long as I’ve been here. 

                                 BRAD
                        Gabe-
                                 GABE
                        And the reason there aren’t is 
                        because you can’t stand women. You 
                        hate them. So you can sit here and 
                        spout off your pseudo-feminist 
                        reasons to not give me what I 
                        deserve, but we all know what’s 
                        going on here. 

           Katherine is silent. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Well, we should change that. 

                                 GABE
                        Really?

                                 KATHERINE
                            (to Brad)
                        We need to hire a woman. 

                                 GABE
                        I think that would be really cool. 

                                 KATHERINE
                            (to Gabe)
                        You’re fired. Obviously. 

           Gabe stands to leave. 

                                 GABE
                        Fuck you, everybody hates you.

                                 KATHERINE
                        That would mean a lot more from 
                        someone who had a job.`

           Gabe leaves.

                                 BRAD
                        I don’t think you dealt with that 
                        in the best way. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I was right.

                                 BRAD
                        But you didn’t have to do it that 
                        way.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I don’t know how else to do it, 
                        okay? Brad, I don’t hate women.
                                 BRAD
                        I don’t think so either. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        So why the fuck aren’t there any 
                        women on this staff?

                                 BRAD
                        It’s hard. I want the show to be 
                        really funny.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I am a woman! And I’m in at least 
                        small part responsible for why the 
                        show is funny. 

                                 BRAD
                        That’s true. But you are very rare.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m going to stop this conversation 
                        before it descends another rung. I 
                        never want to be put in that 
                        position again. Replace Gabe. With 
                        a woman. 

                                 BRAD
                        I have a short list but I don’t 
                        know if there’s a woman-

                                 KATHERINE
                        Bradley.  

                                 BRAD
                        Would a gay guy work?

                                 KATHERINE
                        No.

           Brad stands and leaves. Katherine sits back. It’s a bad day. 

           MAIN TITLES

           EXT. 30 ROCK - MORNING

           30 ROCK glitters in the morning light. 

           MOLLY CHATERJEE (30’s, Indian, nervous) stands in front of 30 
           Rock, looking up at it like a cathedral. 

           She’s wearing a Talbot’s skirt-suit and looks like a 
           paralegal. She closes her eyes and whispers:
                                 MOLLY
                        “I have spread my dreams under your 
                        feet. Tread softly because you 
                        tread on my dreams.”

           It’s from “He Wishes For The Cloths of Heaven” by William 
           Butler Yeats. Molly opens her eyes. She is immediately shoved 
           by an angry commuter. 

                                 ANGRY COMMUTER
                        Out of the fucking way, bitch!

           Molly is knocked out of her moment and scurries into the 
           building. 

           INT. 30 ROCK - ELEVATOR BAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Molly steps into the elevator. She presses the button for 
           32nd floor. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hold the door!

           HAYES CAMPBELL (21, polished, gets everything in the world 
           without ever having to ask for it) enters. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Which floor?

                                 HAYES 
                        Same. 

           She steps back. Looks around the elevator. 

                                 MOLLY
                        So much majesty, isn’t there? 

           He nods and gives a tight smile. 

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        So much history in this building. 
                        I’ve never been in 30 Rock before.  

                                 HAYES
                        I’ve been here several times. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh, like on a tour? I tried to get 
                        on one but they were kind of 
                        expensive. So I tried following a 
                        tour from a few feet behind but the 
                        tour guide figured it out and 
                        yelled at me.  
                                 HAYES
                        Not like on a tour. My brother 
                        works here and my dad worked here. 
                        I’m Hayes Campbell. 

           Molly takes this in, feeling foolish. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh. I’m here for an interview. At 
                        Tonight with Katherine Newbury. 

                                 HAYES
                        Are you going in for Brad’s 
                        assistant? I can put in a good word 
                        for you.

                                 MOLLY
                        No. I’m interviewing to be a 
                        writer. 

                                 HAYES
                        For Tonight with Katherine Newbury? 

                                 MOLLY
                        Yes. 

                                 HAYES
                        So am I.

           They’re quiet for awhile. The door opens. 

                                 HAYES(CONT’D)
                        Sorry I assumed you were going to 
                        be an assistant.

                                 MOLLY
                        It’s fine. 

           They exit. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - OPEN OFFICE AREA - DAY

           Molly and Hayes sit in the waiting room on opposite ends of a 
           sofa. Suddenly, the door opens and writers pour out. They are 
           wearing almost facsimiles of what Hayes is wearing. It’s his 
           brother TOM CAMPBELL (30’s, perfectionist, brilliant, very 
           anxious. He’s the kind of guy whose homework everyone 
           copies), CHARLIE CALDWELL (30’s, good-looking, has too much 
           sex, a stand-up comedian), REYNOLDS (first name Chris, gay, 
           well-dressed, well-liked), SIMMONS (30’s, shy, extremely 
           overweight, no one remembers his first name). Hayes pops up. 
           Tom lights ups. 
                                 TOM
                        There he is. 

                                 SIMMONS
                        Hey, bro, looking good, dude. 

           They hi-five and hug him. Molly is a little crowded. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Timing is great. Gabe got fired 
                        last week. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        He asked to be home for dinner with 
                        his kids. Suicide. 

                                 TOM
                        So, when you go in there: no 
                        commitments, no girlfriend, you 
                        have nothing else going on. Got it?

           Molly is spying and catches the eye of Charlie, who gives her 
           a little grin. She looks away. She looks back at him. He 
           winks at her. She reacts. Charlie turns his attention to 
           Hayes. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Good to see you man. Good luck. 

           They leave, Tom glances at Molly and Hayes sits down. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - BRAD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Molly sits across from Brad. Molly gives him her resume.

                                 BRAD
                        Oh, we don’t usually need... okay. 

           He glances at the resume. 

                                 BRAD (CONT’D)
                        You worked at Chemical Plant? Is 
                        that a cable show?

                                 MOLLY
                        No, it’s a place. It’s a chemical 
                        plant. I still work there. My dad 
                        got me the job, he works there too. 

                                 BRAD
                        I don’t understand. How did you 
                        even hear about this job? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        Your submission came from Human 
                        Resources. Who is your agent? 

           Molly was hoping he wouldn’t ask this. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m currently not represented by a 
                        traditional agency per se. Margaret 
                        Yang at NBC Employment 
                        Opportunities set this up. 

                                 BRAD
                        I still don’t get this. 

           Molly sighs. She really doesn’t want to tell this story. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Well, um... The chemical plant I 
                        was talking about, where I work? It 
                        has a kitchen, where we go for 
                        breaks. And in the kitchen there’s 
                        a corkboard with notices on them. 
                        Blood drives, someone selling a 
                        bike, etc. One day I was in there 
                        and I saw a notice for a company-
                        sponsored essay contest, where the 
                        prize was you got to meet with an 
                        executive.

                                 BRAD
                        An essay contest. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Yes. 

                                 BRAD
                        To meet an executive, like the 
                        president of your plant?

                                 MOLLY
                        I think that’s what you could have 
                        picked. Traditionally. 

                                 BRAD
                        But you didn’t. 

                                 MOLLY
                        No. I picked Vernon Gleason, the 
                        head of Human Resources for all of 
                        Mainline Chemical which owns my 
                        plant, and Comcast, which owns NBC 
                        Universal, which owns Tonight With 
                        Katherine Newbury.
                                 BRAD
                        So you met with an executive at our 
                        parent’s parent company to ask 
                        about this job. And they were fine 
                        with that?

                                 MOLLY
                        They thought it was a little weird. 
                        But the flyer did say any 
                        executive, so. 

           Brad smiles a little at this. 

                                 BRAD
                        That’s very...enterprising. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Anyway! I met Vernon, then Vernon 
                        put me in touch with Margaret. I 
                        gave her my stuff...and that was 
                        last week.

                                 BRAD
                        So you’re here because of an essay 
                        contest. 

                                 MOLLY
                            (defensive)
                        My material is really funny. 
                        There’s a sketch packet in there, a 
                        spec---

                                 BRAD
                        But you have no experience in 
                        comedy. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I have so much experience in 
                        comedy. I’m obsessed with comedy. I 
                        grew up watching every episode of 
                        Saturday Night Live, every book 
                        ever written about it, every 
                        documentary. I do some stand up!

                                 BRAD
                        Oh, you have? Like at Carolines?

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh, no, at this women’s shelter I 
                        volunteer at. I don’t want to be a 
                        stand-up, it’s just that there’s 
                        only one way to find out if my 
                        jokes are working. 
                            (earnest)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MOLLY (CONT'D)
                        I just need to tell you that I’ve 
                        dreamt of this moment my entire 
                        life. I can’t tell you how much 
                        this job would mean to me, 
                        personally. 

           Brad blanches, this is thirsty and not what he wanted to 
           hear. Molly notices. She remembers Tom’s advice to Hayes. 

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        I also wanted to add that I have no 
                        commitments, no boyfriend, I have 
                        nothing going on. This job would be 
                        my life. 

                                 BRAD
                        Well, that is very refreshing to 
                        hear, actually. 

           Brad gets a text. “Did you find a woman yet?” From Katherine. 

                                 BRAD (CONT’D)
                        You know what? I think it’s great. 
                        You’re great, I like this energy. 
                        You’re hired.

                                 MOLLY
                        But you haven’t read my material.

                                 BRAD
                        It’s okay, I have a good feeling 
                        about you. Come with me. 

           Molly is shocked. She stands, Brad takes her by the arm. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITERS’ ROOM - MOMENTS 
           LATER

           Brad opens the door of the writers' room. A table of men look 
           up. The room is musty packed with papers, detritus and the 
           table is stained with ink and years and years of lunches, but 
           there is a ripple of electricity in there too. Molly’s eyes 
           go wide with excitement. 

                                 BRAD
                        Guys, this is Margie. She’s 
                        starting tomorrow. 

                                 TOM 
                            (horrified)
                        As what? 
                                 BRAD
                        A writer, dipshit. 
                            (to Molly)
                        Be here tomorrow at 10.

                                 MOLLY
                        My name is Molly, actually. I’m 
                        honored to meet all of you. This 
                        show has made such an impact on the 
                        person I am---

                                 BRAD
                        See you tomorrow!

           He pushes her out of the room and shuts the door. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - ELEVATOR - MOMENTS 
           LATER

           Molly gets on the elevator. As the doors close, she sees 
           Hayes read a text and stand up from the sofa, shocked. 

                                 HAYES
                            (to himself)
                        You gotta be fucking kidding me.

           The doors close. Molly looks around the elevator, holds the 
           rail, dizzy. She then begins to sob uncontrollably. The doors 
           open. Two office workers get on, a man and woman. They are 
           alarmed. 

                                 MAN
                        Miss, are you okay?

                                 MOLLY
                        No. I’m so happy I feel sick. 

           They inch away from her, very weird-ed out. Molly continues 
           to sob. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - OPEN OFFICE AREA - DAY

           Katherine’s young male assistant, TONY, sits at his desk, 
           peeling an ORANGE. The phone rings. He picks up. 

                                 TONY
                        Katherine Newbury’s office. Yes. 
                        Thank you. 

           He hangs up, springs up, drops his orange on the floor, it 
           rolls away. He picks up a COFFEE on his desk, a bunch of 
           PAPERS and runs to the elevator bay. Katherine appears. 
           He takes her COAT and PURSE and hands her a coffee and some 
           pages and walks with her. 

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        These are the rewritten monologue 
                        jokes from last night. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        These are the same jokes. 

                                 TONY
                        They’re the same set-ups with 
                        different punch lines. 

           Katherine drops them in the trash. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Tony, tell the writers that if they 
                        want to do fifty percent of their 
                        job, then maybe I should cut the 
                        staff by fifty percent.  

                                 TONY
                        Yes, Katherine. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m joking, Tony. 

           Tony laughs nervously in a loud, concerning way. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Stop laughing, it’s gruesome. 

           Katherine bends down to pick up the orange. She puts it in 
           her pocket. 

                                 TONY 
                        Of course. Bonnie Morton’s office 
                        called again. 

           Katherine stops. This is big. 

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        Third time since yesterday 
                        afternoon. Can I connect you before 
                        rehearsal? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Not yet. Let’s make her wait. 

           She goes into her office and closes the door. 
           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - STAGE - DAY

           Katherine finishes the show. MILA KUNIS sits next to her. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        That’s our show, everyone. I hope I 
                        earned the privilege of your time. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Katherine starts unbutton her cuffs, then begins unpeeling 
           the orange.  

           INT. KATHERINE’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Katherine enters. Bonnie is there. 

                                 BONNIE
                        Where did that catch phrase come 
                        from? “I hope I earned the 
                        privilege of your time.”

           Katherine takes her in. She then walks by, sits down and 
           begins to unpeel her orange. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        It came from me. A sign of respect 
                        for my audience. 

                                 BONNIE
                        It’s so proper and old fashioned. I 
                        thought it might be from a 
                        Shakespeare play or something. 

           Katherine laughs. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Did I say something funny?

                                 KATHERINE
                        It’s just, it must be very hard to 
                        balance your contempt for me and 
                        your Anglophilia. 

                                 BONNIE
                        It’s a sweet little send-off 
                        phrase. I doubt most of your 
                        audience knows what the word 
                        “privilege” means anyway. 
                                 KATHERINE
                        That’s a bit insulting to them, 
                        isn’t it?

                                 BONNIE
                        You know what’s insulting? Waiting 
                        twelve hours for one of your 
                        employees to call you back. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I apologize. Some of us have more 
                        to do than go to spin classes and 
                        get our hair colored. 

                                 BONNIE
                        You don’t color your hair?

                                 KATHERINE
                        I do, but I don’t announce it to 
                        the press. 

                                 BONNIE
                        It humanizes me. I’ve found they 
                        don’t write pieces about you if 
                        you’re woman if they don’t think 
                        you’re a human first. 
                            (then)
                        I came to tell you that this is 
                        your last year.

           The room goes still. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        What do you mean?

                                 BONNIE
                        This season is your last season. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        You’re cancelling the show?

           Katherine’s voice is the 20 year old Katherine’s voice, not 
           her own. 

                                 BONNIE
                        No. I’m cancelling you. Tonight is 
                        a valuable asset that I can’t let 
                        you degrade anymore. Your ratings 
                        have been a steady decline the past 
                        two years. I know this is bad news 
                        but on some level you must have 
                        known. We’ll do a big send-off for 
                        you, don’t worry. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BONNIE (CONT'D)
                        You should let your staff know that 
                        in March they should be looking for 
                        new jobs.  

           Bonnie heads towards the door, then: 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        I hope I earned the privilege of 
                        your time. 

           Bonnie leaves and we stay on Katherine. We are tight on her 
           face. Her breathing begins to quicken and become uneven. She 
           grabs her coat. 

           INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Katherine opens the door to her townhouse, very shaken. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Walter. Walter!

           An 8 year old, ANNIE appears and runs down the stairs to 
           greet Katherine. She hugs her tightly.

                                 ANNIE
                        Granny!
                            (calling back to someone)
                        Granny’s here.

           JOAN, early 50’s, Katherine’s step-daughter, follows.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Annie? What are you doing here? 

                                 JOAN
                        We’re here for dinner. 

                                 KATHERINE
                            (under her breath)
                        Shit. 

           Annie is still hugging Katherine. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Granny, you smell like funny. 

                                 JOAN
                        She smells like cigarettes, honey. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Katherine, Annie. You should call 
                        me Katherine. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATHERINE (CONT'D)
                        Your real grandmother wouldn’t like 
                        you to be calling me that. 

                                 ANNIE
                        I’m too young to call you by your 
                        first name. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I would prefer Katherine. 
                            (then, to Joan)
                        Is there any way we could 
                        reschedule? 

           Annie peels off Katherine’s COAT and hangs it up. Katherine 
           begins walking to the kitchen. 

                                 JOAN
                        I’m afraid not. I wanted to have a 
                        serious discussion about getting a 
                        caregiver for Dad. Have you given 
                        it any thought?

                                 KATHERINE
                            (distracted)
                        I don’t think he wants one, though, 
                        does he? 

                                 JOAN
                        Yes, which is why I need your back-
                        up here. Because he is being 
                        stubborn about it and it’s not safe-

                                 KATHERINE
                        You know, tonight is not a good 
                        night for this--

                                 JOAN
                        I understand that you are very busy 
                        but you are not the only one with a 
                        life here. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I know, Joan. 

                                 JOAN
                        This is a matter of my father’s 
                        health. We can’t keep putting it 
                        off.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I understand. 
                                 JOAN
                        I even texted you this afternoon to 
                        confirm. 

           Joan gets out her phone and waves it in Katherine’s face. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I don’t need to look at your 
                        fucking phone right now, Joan! 

           Walter enters the room, looking concerned. 

                                 WALTER
                        What is going on here?

           INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER 

           Katherine paces next to Walter. 

                                 WALTER
                        Who are they replacing you with?

                                 KATHERINE
                        She didn’t say. Why didn’t I go to 
                        her stupid parties? Those wretched 
                        charity events. The one where they 
                        fix children’s faces so they don’t 
                        look hideous? 

                                 WALTER
                        Because you said they were a waste 
                        of time. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        They are a bloody waste of time! 
                            (then)
                        Why do I even care so much? It 
                        hasn’t been fun in years. Hasn’t 
                        felt important, either. 

                                 WALTER
                        You care because, you hate losing, 
                        my dear. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I do. 
                            (then, vulnerable)
                        Maybe the show going away is a good 
                        thing. Maybe she’s right, maybe 
                        I’ve lost it. I can retire. Read. 
                        Learn how to cook. We can spend 
                        more time together.
           Walter reacts viscerally to this. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        What? 

                                 WALTER
                        It’s just...in all my years of 
                        knowing you, I have never see you 
                        lie to yourself before. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I need this show, Walter. I need it 
                        badly. Maybe I’ve been asleep, 
                        maybe I’ve let it slip, but it can 
                        be great. I know it can. 

                                 WALTER
                        Then you must fight. Which you 
                        haven’t done in a long, long, time. 

           Katherine nods, resolute. 

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                            (then, warmly)
                        Also, I don’t need to spend more 
                        time with you. Look at your 
                        behavior tonight, you’re a monster.

           Katherine laughs, in spite of herself. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Do you need someone here, to help 
                        you during the day?

                                 WALTER
                        Believe me when I say that I would 
                        rather you push me off the roof. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        You’re a lovely man, Walter Lovell. 
                        I don’t why you love me. 

           They laugh. She then gets a look of resolve. 

           INT. BRAD’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Brad is in bed, watching TV with his wife, Vanessa. The phone 
           rings, and he picks up.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’ll be in the room tomorrow. 
                                 BRAD
                        The writers’ room?

                                 KATHERINE
                        No, the supply room for some Fedex 
                        slips. Yes, the writers' room. Is 
                        there a problem? 

                                 BRAD
                        No, just... you haven’t been in the 
                        room since 9/11. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m sorry that you think I need a 
                        national tragedy to approach my 
                        writing staff, Bradley.  

                                 BRAD
                        I just think they will be a little 
                        startled. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        If a room of grown men are startled 
                        by my very presence, they are 
                        really not going to like it when I 
                        start screaming at them. I will see 
                        you at 8. 

                                 BRAD
                        The room doesn’t usually start 
                        until 10.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I will be there at 8. 

           Brad’s wife rolls her eyes at the news.

           INT. MOLLY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Molly’s PARENTS Skype with her. Molly is in a room upstairs 
           in her aunt and uncle’s place. 

                                 MOLLY’S MOM
                        Are you going to go out and have 
                        fun and celebrate with your 
                        friends?

                                 MOLLY
                            (lying)
                        Hm-hm. 
                                 MOLLY’S MOM
                        That will be so fun. You deserve 
                        it, sweetheart. 

                                 MOLLY’S DAD
                        We’re so proud of you. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Well, I should head out. I don’t 
                        want to keep my friends waiting. 

           She closes her laptop and then turns on the TV and watches 
           old reruns of Katherine’s show to celebrate. She starts 
           eating pasta straight from a pot. She is content, but it is a 
           strange little depressing scene. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - KITCHEN - DAY

           The clock says 7:45 AM.

           Tom and BURDITT, late 50’s, looks like he survived Vietnam, 
           drink coffee. Charlie enters, extremely grumpy. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why the fuck am I awake this early? 

                                 TOM
                        Don’t look at me. I’ve been up 
                        since six.

           Reynolds enters, perfectly dressed and chipper. 

                                 CHARLIE 
                        I was addressing the normal people 
                        in the room. I’m a comedian, my 
                        night doesn’t even start until ten. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                            (disgusted)
                        Uch, Charlie, you reek of sex. 
                        Heterosexual sex. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I have other pursuits, too. 

                                 TOM
                        I wonder what’s going on. I’m a 
                        little nervous. 

                                 BURDITT
                            (not looking up from paper)
                        You’re nervous? That’s surprising. 
           Tom throws him a look. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Tony said Bonnie Morton was here 
                        yesterday. 

                                 TOM
                            (voice rising)
                        Bonnie Morton? Why would the head 
                        of the network be here?

           Now Burditt is a little nervous too. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Bonnie Morton is a tiny evil doll. 
                        I hate that I love her.  

                                 SIMMONS
                        I hope they’re not laying people 
                        off. Margot and I are going to the 
                        Galapagos for Thanksgiving. 

                                 TOM
                        They did fire Gabe. 

                                 BURDITT
                        They should’ve fired him years ago. 

                                 SIMMONS
                        The Galapagos isn’t even a resort, 
                        but it’s ten times more expensive!

                                 CHARLIE
                        There are a number of reasons 
                        Bonnie could be here. Maybe she 
                        wants to fuck me. 

                                 TOM
                            (to Charlie)
                        Hey man, it’s too early for you to 
                        be this sexually charged. 

                                 KATHERINE (O.S.)
                        Why am I the only person in this 
                        room?!

           INT. MOLLY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Molly tries on hoodies and sweatshirts. She wears a Hard Rock 
           Cafe London sweatshirt and khakis. Her little cousin, PRIYA 
           (12), sits on her bed, watching her. 
                                 PRIYA
                        Why are you dressed like a lesbian?

                                 MOLLY
                        Uh, a) I don’t know that that’s 
                        okay to say, and b) I’m not dressed 
                        like a lesbian! This is what people 
                        dress like at my job. 

                                 PRIYA
                        Is it a room full of lesbians? 

                                 MOLLY
                        No, actually. I think I’m the only 
                        woman. 

           Uch, even more nervous. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITERS’ ROOM - DAY

           Katherine sits at the head of the writers’ room table. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        I just have to say, it’s an honor 
                        to meet you, Ms. Newbury.

                                 SIMMONS
                        I too feel very honored. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I don’t know who any of you are. 
                            (to Brad)
                        I don’t know who any of them are. 

                                 TOM
                        Hi, Katherine. I’m Tom, I write 
                        monologue jokes? I’m by the monitor 
                        during taping. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes. You normally wear glasses. 

                                 TOM
                        ...No. 

                                 SIMMONS
                        My name is Eugene Simmons--

                                 KATHERINE
                        No. No. I’m not going to remember 
                        any of this. Okay, here’s what 
                        we’re going to do. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATHERINE (CONT'D)
                            (pointing to Simmons)
                        One. You’re One. 

           Katherine goes around the room, pointing in order. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Two, Three, Four, Five. 

           She lands on Charlie. They make eye contact for a split 
           second. There’s some history there. She knows his name. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                            (not hesitating, to 
                              Charlie)
                        Six. 

           Charlie flinches. Katherine continues numbering. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Seven, eight. 

           Katherine lands on Burditt. 

                                 BURDITT
                            (gruffly, the only one who 
                              knows Katherine)
                        Hi Katherine.

                                 KATHERINE
                            (smiles, relieved)
                        Burditt. Thank God, Burditt. 
                            (then, all business)
                        Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve. That’s 
                        what I will be calling you from now 
                        on. It’s just easier.

           The writers take this in. Reynolds raises his hand. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Are we allowed to call each other 
                        by our names?

                                 BRAD
                        Learn the numbers, Reynolds. Come 
                        on. 

           People are like “Okay, what the fuck.” And start writing 
           little glossaries down on paper. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I will be joining you in the 
                        writers' room for the foreseeable 
                        future. Now let’s talk about 
                        tonight’s show. Pitch to me. 
           Reynolds texts Tom under the table. 

                                 REYNOLDS 
                            (TEXT)
                        Hey, Four. Why is she here?

           Tom looks at him and shakes his head. He has no idea. 

           INT. SUBWAY - DAY

           Molly carries two large CUPCAKE BOXES on the subway. People 
           bump into her and she’s very protective of the cupcakes.

                                 MOLLY
                        Please, don’t jostle the cupcakes!

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - OPEN OFFICE AREA - DAY

           Molly shows up with her cupcakes. No one is in the open 
           office area, so she goes to the room.

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITERS’ ROOM - DAY

           Molly comes in with her cupcakes. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Who are you?

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m Molly. I’m a new writer.

                                 KATHERINE
                        What are those?

                                 MOLLY
                        They’re cupcakes.

                                 KATHERINE
                        You’re late.

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m so sorry. I actually thought I 
                        was almost two hours early.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Does it look like you’re early? I’m 
                        telling you you’re late.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Brad actually told her yesterday we 
                        start at 10.
           Molly smiles at him gratefully. Molly looks for a seat. She 
           is about to sit in an empty seat. 

                                 SIMMONS
                        That’s where Matt sits. He’s in the 
                        bathroom. 

                                 MOLLY 
                        Oh, okay. 

           She goes to sit somewhere else. 

                                 TOM
                        That’s Martin’s. He’s on a call. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Sit down, please. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I really, really want to. 

           Burditt makes space for her, and Molly finally sits.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        It’s such an honor to be working 
                        here-

                                 KATHERINE
                        You’re 13. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Hm?

                                 BRAD
                        Your name is 13. 

                                 MOLLY
                            (no idea what is happening)
                        My name is Molly.  

                                 KATHERINE
                        You’re fucking 13! Sit down! None 
                        of this is important! Why would any 
                        one care what your name is?! Don’t 
                        any of you understand what is at 
                        stake here? 
                            (then, overwhelmed)
                        I am being replaced. As host of 
                        this show. 

                                 TOM
                        What?
                                 KATHERINE
                        I’ve been told that the show is 
                        being taken away because of 
                        declining ratings and a general 
                        lack of quality in the past few 
                        years of shows.

                                                           TOM
                          CHARLIE
           This is outrageous.
                                              The show is great. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Fuck the network.

                                 TOM
                        The work we’re doing is great. 

                                 BURDITT
                        Lets see them put on three hundred 
                        shows a year. 

           More grumbling. Fuck them. Then: 

                                 MOLLY
                        I feel like there might be some 
                        room for improvement. 

           All eyes turn on her. 

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        I have seen literally every episode 
                        of this show since I was 9 years 
                        old. I would go to the library and 
                        take out old VHS copies of it. And 
                        I do think that the past few years 
                        have maybe fallen into some of the 
                        same...rhythms. 

                                 TOM
                        I’m sorry that the show doesn’t 
                        appeal to the heightened 
                        sensibilities of your friends at 
                        the factory. 

                                 MOLLY
                        It’s a plant not a factory!

                                 KATHERINE
                        Four’s right. You don’t come in 
                        here on your first day and 
                        criticize a room full of people who 
                        have been doing this for years. 
                        It’s bad form. 
                                 MOLLY
                        I was just being honest. I’m sorry.

           Molly is chastened. Tom shoots her an imperious look. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        But I don’t disagree with her. In 
                        fact, she’s being kind. The show 
                        hasn’t just been “not fresh”. It’s 
                        been fucking terrible. There hasn’t 
                        been an exciting moment or comedy 
                        idea in well over a year, if that. 
                        And now, because of the culture of 
                        complacency in this office, I am in 
                        the position of fighting for my 
                        show back. 

           Damn. 

                                 BRAD
                        What do you want us to do? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        From this moment on, no one in this 
                        room has a life. No one has wives, 
                        no one has kids. You have only 
                        this. You live this show. You 
                        breathe this show. When you 
                        masturbate you think about this 
                        show. You’re finally going to earn 
                        that big fat paycheck that’s been 
                        paying for your divorces and 
                        Priuses. Tomorrow I want you to 
                        come in with twelve pitches. Each. 
                        Twelve ground-breaking ways we can 
                        make this show great. Again. 

           Katherine leaves. The writers are like “oh shit.”

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - OPEN OFFICE AREA - DAY

           Everyone trickles out of the room. Molly’s cupcakes go 
           uneaten.

                                 MOLLY
                        Where is everyone going?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Their offices.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh. 
           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - BRAD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Molly pokes her head into Brad’s office. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Brad, you know I hate bothering 
                        you. But, can I ask where my office 
                        is? 

           Brad sighs. Of course. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - CHARLIE AND TOM’S 
           OFFICE - DAY

           Tom, Charlie, Reynolds all gather around Reynolds’ computer. 
           There’s a LinkedIn type page with a dorky picture of Molly 
           and her bio. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Molly Chatterjee. Luzerne County 
                        Community College. Eh. Hobbies and 
                        special skills include “humor and 
                        stand-up comedy.” 

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, it’s too sad. No more.  

                                 TOM
                        I think she’s some kind of 
                        pathological liar. She told my 
                        brother she was here for an 
                        assistant job.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Tom, don’t be stupid.

                                 TOM
                        But why would you tell someone 
                        that?

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Who even cares? We are all going to 
                        be unemployed in four months. 

                                 TOM
                        Don’t talk like that. 

           Tom sits on a bean bag chair. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Guys, it makes sense. Do any of 
                        your friends talk about the show 
                        anymore? 
                                 REYNOLDS
                        She wasn’t asked to host any awards 
                        shows. There’s no buzz on the show 
                        and there hasn’t been in months.

                                 TOM
                        We’re fine. What are they going to 
                        do, fire her? It would take them a 
                        month to remove all her Emmys. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Who knows? Maybe little Miss 
                        chemical plant can help us. 

                                 TOM
                        Don’t even joke. It’s insulting to 
                        me. To my contribution to this 
                        show. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t know. I thought she was 
                        kind of cute. 

                                 TOM
                        You’re insane. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - BURDITT’S OFFICE - DAY

           We hear The Doors through the door. Brad opens the door. It’s 
           spotless and empty except a desk and a sofa, and a nice-sized 
           GLASS BONG. And Burditt. 

                                 BRAD
                        Hey, man.
                            (to Molly)
                        Molly, this is Burditt. You’ll be 
                        sharing this office. 

                                 BURDITT
                        What?

                                 BRAD
                        We’ll get you a desk tomorrow. 
                        Until then, just, kind of make a 
                        space for yourself. 

           He leaves. Molly comes in and starts unpacking framed photos 
           and other tchotchkes from a tote bag. She looks around the 
           office. 

                                 MOLLY
                        So nice that we’re going to be 
                        office mates. Are you new too?
                                 BURDITT
                        I’ve been here twenty-six years.

           Molly looks around the stark room. 

                                 MOLLY
                        You have no stuff. 

                                 BURDITT
                        In case I get fired I don’t want to 
                        get too comfortable. 

           Molly puts her framed photos back in her bag. 

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

           Molly takes a few steps. She then sees Tom on the phone. 

                                 TOM
                        It’s political. Right now it’s 
                        hostile climate to be an educated 
                        white male. No, it’s staggering how 
                        unfair it is. Staggering. 
                            (beat)
                        Her? No, she’s not good. She’s 
                        nothing. 

           Molly steps forward. Are they talking about me?

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        It’s a diversity hire. She’ll only 
                        be here 13 weeks. I think she’s 
                        like a single mom or something. 

           Molly clears her throat. Tom notices. Fuck. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                            (mortified)
                        Oh, hey. 

           The subway pulls up.

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m actually not a mom. I just look 
                        like one. And I’m old enough to 
                        have a kid. But I’m not.  

           Molly turns and walks onto the subway. Tom reacts. 
           INT. 30 ROCK - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Katherine rides the elevator. A GOOD-LOOKING MAN in his 40’s 
           gets on, NATHAN. He is a producer for NBC SPORTS. TWO YOUNGER 
           WOMEN(PAs) also get on, who are starry eyed upon seeing her. 

                                 NATHAN
                        Do you have plans tonight?

                                 KATHERINE
                        I have dinner with my husband.

                                 NATHAN
                        That’s too bad.

           The PAs glance at each other. Katherine shoots him a look and 
           leaves.

           INT. MOLLY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Molly throws her stuff on the floor and falls into bed. She 
           notices several missed calls on her phone from her parents. 
           She texts them back.

                                 MOLLY (TEXT)
                        Great first day! 

           The phone rings, it’s from MOM. Molly hesitates, then presses 
           “ignore”. 

                                 MOLLY (TEXT) (CONT’D)
                        Still at work, late night. I will 
                        call this weekend. 

                                 DAD (TEXT)
                        Okay. We are so excited. We are so 
                        proud of you. Love you. 

           Molly reads the text, her eyes brimming with tears. She puts 
           down the phone and clicks on the TV. 

           She watches an old episode of Katherine’s show. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - KITCHEN - MORNING

           The next day, Charlie, Reynolds, Tom and a few others are 
           eating breakfast. Molly comes in, wearing a skirt and boots. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        You look nice.
                                 MOLLY
                        Thank you. Man, I’m nervous about 
                        pitching. Did you guys come up with 
                        a lot of funny stuff?

           Molly pulls out her notepad. There is silence. 

                                 TOM
                        We don’t really talk about our 
                        ideas before we pitch. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Why? 

                                 TOM
                        Because...I don’t know. They’re our 
                        ideas. So Katherine knows who is 
                        coming up with the best ideas. 

                                 MOLLY
                        But if someone could help your idea 
                        be funnier or if you could help 
                        mine, wouldn’t it make it a funnier 
                        pitch?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah. 

                                 MOLLY
                        And wouldn’t that make the show 
                        funnier? 

                                 TOM
                        Possibly. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Then why would we not---

                                 BURDITT
                            (kindly)
                        Hey. It’s not how we do things 
                        here. 

           Molly is incredulous. Charlie notices her. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WOMEN’S BATHROOM - DAY

           Molly enters. Charlie walks out of the stall. Molly is 
           mortified.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh my god. Sorry! I thought I was 
                        in the women's room.
           She turns on her heel and starts to leave. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Stop! Stop. It is the women’s room. 
                        We’ve just never had any women 
                        here. So, we use it. 
                            (then, sheepish)
                        It’s actually where we come to take 
                        a shit.

           Charlie washes his hands. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t understand anything about 
                        this job. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re right about the way we 
                        pitch. It sucks. And the show would 
                        be better if we worked on stuff 
                        together before we showed 
                        Katherine. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Then why don’t you do that? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Because this job isn’t really about 
                        making the best show. It’s about 
                        making her think you’re the 
                        funniest person in the room and not 
                        firing you. 

                                 MOLLY
                        That’s horrible. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ahhh, I see. You think the feeling 
                        you have watching the show should 
                        be the same as the feeling of 
                        making it. It’s not. And she’s not 
                        the same person you see on TV every 
                        day. 

           Molly looks crestfallen. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        You know who is as good as they 
                        seem? Me. I’m doing stand-up at 
                        Caroline’s tomorrow night. Come see 
                        me. We can get a drink after. 

           Charlie brushes by her to get a paper towel. 
                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I gotta say though. Love this 
                        naivete. It’s hot. 

           Charlie smiles at her and leaves. Molly is a little taken 
           aback. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITERS’ ROOM - DAY

           Reynolds is pitching. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        The Miss America pageant is next 
                        week, I thought we do something 
                        with that. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        The Miss America pageant is 
                        irrelevant and reprehensible. I’m 
                        not glamorizing that. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        You wouldn’t be glamorizing it. 
                        Satirizing it. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m not giving that horrid 
                        competition a second of free press. 
                        It’s an anti-intellectual parade of 
                        women run by a sexist megalomaniac.  
                        These are terrible ideas. No more, 
                        9. Where is John? John Phillips? I 
                        want to hear his pitches. 

           There is a silence. Katherine looks around. What? 

                                 MARTIN 
                        John died in 2012. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        John’s dead?!

                                 BRAD
                        Yes. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        That’s terrible. He was so funny. 

           Molly raises her hand. Charlie shakes his head imperceptibly- 
           “don’t raise your hand”. Molly pulls her hand down. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Yes. 
                                 MOLLY
                        Hi. I just want to say it’s an 
                        honor to even be in this room with 
                        all of you.  

           Katherine puts her head in her hands. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Jesus Christ. I wish I was John 
                        Phillips.

                                 MOLLY
                        I think what you just said about 
                        the Miss American Pageant was 
                        really smart and people should hear 
                        that. I think it’s a great window 
                        into your personality. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        That’s my private opinion, no one 
                        needs to hear that. Next?

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m sorry--but if I may...I don’t 
                        know why you wouldn’t want to share 
                        about yourself and your life, 
                        that’s the most interesting thing 
                        about you. When you get riled up 
                        about something, that’s when you 
                        really come alive as a performer. 

           Everyone looks around: this is not appropriate. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        That’s when I come alive as a 
                        performer?

                                 REYNOLDS
                        I just want to say I am no longer 
                        attached to this idea in any way. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Yes! And from personal experience 
                        onstage? My best shows are when I 
                        talk about my life and personal 
                        stuff.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m sorry, I think I missed your 
                        HBO special. Was it at Carnegie 
                        Hall?
                                 MOLLY
                        No, I mostly perform at the Quik n’ 
                        Klean in the Lower East Side. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        The Quik n’ Klean. I’ve never heard 
                        of it. 

                                 RANNELLS
                        It’s a laudromat. 

                                 MOLLY
                        It has an open mic! And it can fit 
                        up to sixty people not including 
                        the people who are there doing 
                        laundry.  

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m sure at the laundromat you 
                        could kill with those ideas. This 
                        is a nationally broadcast comedy 
                        show that has been around for 
                        seventy years. I don’t need some 
                        rambling hipster who bores people 
                        at an open mic to tell me her 
                        assessment of my comic persona. I 
                        need hard jokes. This room is an 
                        engine and you are a piston. You’re 
                        not the captain. Do you understand 
                        that, 13?

                                 MOLLY
                        Yes. 

           Molly begins to cry. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Don’t do that. Don’t be the only 
                        woman in here and cry. You think 
                        any of these guys cry when I yell 
                        at them? 

           Molly stands up and leaves the room.  

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Next. 7. Next! 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WOMEN’S ROOM - DAY

           Molly runs into the bathroom to cry. Reynolds enters. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        I’m sorry, I really have to go. 
           Molly, overwhelmed, leaves. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - BURDITT AND MOLLY’S 
           OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Molly enters the office, walks by Burditt at his computer, 
           and goes into their closet, shutting the door. She cries. 
           Burditt glances over, then goes back to his computer. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - KATHERINE’S OFFICE - 
           NIGHT

           It’s late, people file out. Katherine walks with Brad to her 
           office. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Who is that, that girl?

                                 BRAD
                        You asked for a girl. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        A normal girl. A girl with 
                        experience in the actual realm of 
                        the entertainment business. How 
                        long is her contract?

                                 BRAD
                        Twelve weeks. Then she’s gone. 
                        She’s the least of your problems. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - KATHERINE’S OFFICE - 
           CONTINUOUS

           They enter and Katherine shuts the door. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Does anyone out there know about 
                        this yet?

                                 BRAD
                        Nothing online yet. But it’s only a 
                        matter of time. 

           He turns to leave. 

                                 BRAD (CONT’D)
                        Go home. You’re tired. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m always tired. 
                                 BRAD
                        Katherine? It shows. 

           He leaves. Katherine pours herself a whiskey. 

           INT. MOLLY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - NEXT DAY

           Molly gets ready to go out. PRIYA sits on her bed again. 

                                 PRIYA
                        Are you guys going to have sex?

                                 MOLLY
                        No, it’s not even a date.

                                 PRIYA
                        Do people like you better at work?

                                 MOLLY
                        Not really. 

           INT. CAROLINE’S - NIGHT

           Charlie does stand-up. It’s killing. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You ever at a bar and you’re making 
                        headway with a girl, and then some 
                        British guy shows up? He opens his 
                        mouth and it is over. And he’s not 
                        even good-looking. He has a 
                        hunchback. He’s literal garbage in 
                        England. All of a sudden he’s 
                        classy here. 
                            (girl)
                        “I loved that British hunchback. 
                        He’s so classy.” 

           Molly smiles. 

           EXT. CAROLINE’S - NIGHT

           After the show, outside, Charlie is crowded by fans, a lot of 
           women. Molly sees, and then, feeling insecure, starts to walk 
           away. She makes it about ten feet when she gets a text. 

                                 CHARLIE (text)
                        You’re not even going to buy me a 
                        drink? 

           She smiles and turns back. He waves at her from a far. 
           INT. BAR - NIGHT

                                 CHARLIE
                        What was your favorite part?

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh, because you assumed I have one?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I was watching you. You liked it. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I did like it. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        What about you? Are you good?

                                 MOLLY
                        At stand-up? Well, I’ve never done 
                        Caroline’s. 
                            (tentative, but then)
                        I am doing a show soon. It’s a 
                        benefit for a women’s shelter for 
                        the town I come from in 
                        Pennsylvania. It’s no one big, just 
                        other aspiring comics. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ll do it. 

                                 MOLLY
                        You’ll do what?

                                 CHARLIE
                            (laughing)
                        I’ll do your show, stupid. 

                                 MOLLY
                            (alarmed)
                        Oh, no. It’s not anyone famous, or 
                        even good. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Great. I’ll be the best one. 

           Molly stops him. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Why are doing this for me? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        ‘Cause I’m a nice guy. 
                                 MOLLY
                        I know you’re not. But why? 
                        Katherine hates me, you barely know 
                        me. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I dunno. I like you. Probably 
                        because you’re the only girl at my 
                        job. You’re also prettier than you 
                        think you are.  

           Molly blushes. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Well, I’m really grateful. I don’t 
                        know how to thank you. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why don’t we go back to your place. 
                        I bet I can come up with some 
                        ideas. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I am staying with my aunt and uncle 
                        in Queens. 

           He smiles. 

           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           Charlie and Molly have sex by a dumpster in the alley behind 
           the bar. They finish.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Wow, I didn’t even have to take you 
                        to dinner first.

           They laugh. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITERS’ ROOM - THE 
           NEXT DAY

           Molly is pitching. 

                                 MOLLY
                        You know how they do all those 
                        terrible holiday-themed movies? 

           Katherine jots down notes. Charlie is next to Molly, his leg 
           is next to hers. Tom, sitting on the other side of Charlie, 
           glances down, and notices. 
           Molly crosses her legs away from Charlie (she’s trying to 
           focus), Tom’s eyes flicker back to Molly’s face. 

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        So the bit is like what if they run 
                        out of other federal holidays? 
                        Like, beyond President’s Day, so 
                        they start doing months? Like what 
                        if he like do it for like, Black 
                        History Month.   

           Molly waits for Katherine’s response. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        You said “like” twenty-two times 
                        just now. Next. 

           Molly’s face crumples. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - MOLLY AND BURDITT’S 
           OFFICE - DAY

           Molly is crying in the closet again. Burditt hears Molly 
           crying, sighs, stands and opens the door. 

                                 BURDITT
                        This has to stop.  

           Molly looks up. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I can cry more quietly. 

                                 BURDITT
                        No. You can’t even be miserable 
                        well. Sit down. 

           Molly sits at her desk. 

                                 BURDITT (CONT’D)
                        People do not like you here.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Really? I feel a real surge of 
                        affection from everyone. 

                                 BURDITT
                        Start with Tom. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Tom? Tom whose brother’s job I 
                        stole? We should stop now I think. 
                                 BURDITT
                        He’s a snob, but he’s not a bad 
                        guy. And he’s respected. And he’s a 
                        damn good writer.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Tell me more nice things about my 
                        mortal enemy.  

                                 BURDITT
                        But he’s also a guy. A horny guy. 
                        You’re technically a woman. So use 
                        that. 

           Molly leans forward, aghast. 

                                 MOLLY
                            (hushed disbelief)
                        You want me to sleep with him?

                                 BURDITT
                        Calm down. No one wants you to 
                        sleep with them. Just, be nice to 
                        him. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITER’S ROOM - DAY

           As Burditt narrates we see the room. 

                                 BURDITT (V.O.)
                        No one is more vulnerable than him 
                        when he pitches. It’s because he 
                        cares. Let him know you think he’s 
                        funny.

           Molly sits across from Tom. 

                                 TOM
                        ...The premise is, if Brexit 
                        happens, it starts a trend of 
                        secession world-wide. Can we leave 
                        North America? 

           It goes over just okay. Katherine frowns. Molly starts 
           laughing. Tom looks at her, surprised.

                                 MOLLY
                        Can we kick states out of the US? 
                        Like, do we really need West 
                        Virginia? 

           Katherine looks at her. 
                                 KATHERINE
                        It’s not anything yet - it’s a 
                        fragment of a thing - but work on 
                        it. 

           Tom nods and glances at Molly, a little grateful.

                                 BURDITT
                        The next one is the harder. Stand 
                        up for yourself. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I do that already! That’s why 
                        everyone hates me!

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITERS’ OFFICE - 
           ANOTHER DAY

           Molly is finishing a pitch. 

                                 MOLLY 
                        And you say you need money, so 
                        you’re now lending your voice to 
                        GPS apps for cars. Then we roll a 
                        clip of people in cars listening to 
                        you scream at them for messing up 
                        your simple instructions. 

                                 BURDITT (V.O.)
                        No, you explain yourself. Standing 
                        up for yourself means you’re 
                        concise. But strong.  

                                 KATHERINE
                        No. Next. 

           Molly takes a deep breath. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I think it’s a good idea and people 
                        will respond to it. 

                                 KATHERINE 
                            (surprised)
                        Excuse me? 
                                 MOLLY
                        It’ll be funny visually and easy to 
                        produce. It would be a mistake to 
                        not do it. 

           Silence. Katherine considers this. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Flesh it out more, and keep it 
                        short.  

           Molly smiles to herself. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - MOLLY AND BURDITT’S 
           OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 BURDITT 
                        This last one is going to be really 
                        hard for you. 

                                 MOLLY 
                        What does that mean? 

                                 BURDITT
                        You need to shut up. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Pardon? 

                                 BURDITT
                        If you hear something you don’t 
                        agree with, you have to resist the 
                        urge to give your opinion. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I will not be marginalized by the 
                        iron fist of white privilege that 
                        pervades this work environment---

                                 BURDITT
                        I’m not trying to silence your 
                        strong female Indian woman of color 
                        spirit blah blah blah. You’re still 
                        a new writer with no experience. I 
                        mean this with respect, but you 
                        have to learn to shut the fuck up. 

           Molly winces. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITERS’ ROOM - DAY

           The room is rapt as Molly shows a clip on her phone. 
                                 MOLLY
                        This is Joseph Mendoza, aka Stupid 
                        Vines, an incredibly popular vine 
                        star whose videos have taken over 
                        every form of social media. He was 
                        on the cover of Rolling Stone. 

           Katherine watches Joseph. He smashes several plates over his 
           head and then pretends to pass out. Molly, Charlie, and 
           Burditt laugh in spite of themselves.  Tom is furious. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Wow, I hate this. 

                                 TOM
                            (disgusted)
                        As do I. As should all of you. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I agree with 4. We can’t have this 
                        man on our show. I’m not Make A 
                        Wish, this is a network television 
                        show.

                                 BURDITT (V.O.)
                        Even when you know you are right...

                                 MOLLY
                        He’s bigger than a network 
                        television show. 

                                 BURDITT (V.O.)
                        And everyone is being a dick about 
                        it....

                                 KATHERINE
                        I don’t doubt that it’s popular, 
                        but it doesn’t mean that it’s good. 

                                 BURDITT (V.O.)
                        You still have to shut the fuck up. 

           Burditt looks to Molly. It’s time to stop talking. She gets 
           it and sits down. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I understand and I respect your 
                        decision. 

           Katherine looks at her: “that was weird to say”. But then 
           continues on. Burditt throws Molly a supportive glance.
           INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

           Katherine sits at her computer. She has her reading glasses 
           on and stares at the Google homepage for a few long moments. 

                                 KATHERINE
                            (muttering)
                        Fuck it. 

           She types in “Katherine Newbury”. Hundreds of hits pop up. 
           She clicks on one. Ice Princess. In quick cuts, we see a few 
           more. “The Queen of No.” “Not The People’s Princess”. She 
           dials her cell phone. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I need a publicist.

                                 BRAD
                        I’ll set it up. 

           She hangs up, unceremoniously, glued to the screen. 

                                 KATHERINE
                            (disgusted)
                        Wankers. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - KATHERINE’S OFFICE - 
           DAY

           Katherine sits across from a very chirpy publicist in her 
           forties, ROBIN. 

                                 ROBIN
                        I think we can do extraordinary 
                        things with your brand. 

           Katherine is nauseated but nods. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Good. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Making you accessible to the 
                        average American is our mission. 
                        You’re not above them, or looking 
                        down at them, you’re one of them. 
                        You’re America’s sweetheart.  

                                 KATHERINE
                            (incredibly difficult)
                        Yes. That is how I’ve always felt. 
                        I’m excited for you to capture 
                        that. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATHERINE (CONT'D)
                            (standing up)
                        I think this is a great start. 
                        Thanks, Robin. 

           Brad sees Robin out. Katherine mimes slitting her wrists. 

           THIS KICKS OFF A MONTAGE: 

           - Molly is about to walk into the women’s room then catches 
           herself and knocks first. Simmons comes out. She’s learning. 

           - Tony helps Katherine with a Twitter page at her computer in 
           her office. Katherine has trouble with it but keeps at it. 

           - In the kitchen, Reynolds and Tom look at a sign for Molly’s 
           stand-up show, featuring Charlie. They look over at Charlie, 
           who shrugs. 

                                 TOM
                        Dude, if you want to sleep with 
                        her, just sleep with her, but you 
                        don’t have to promise you’ll do her 
                        standup show.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Who knows, maybe I’m in love with 
                        her.

           Tom makes a face and turns back to his work. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITER’S ROOM - LATER 

           Katherine sits while Brad runs the room. Molly sits 
           nervously. 

                                 BRAD
                        So we have the monologue, lets move 
                        onto the remote--

                                 MOLLY
                        I have a joke for the monologue.

           Everyone turns and looks at her. 

                                 TOM
                        You don’t write the monologue.  

                           MOLLY
           Well, I wrote a joke for it.  
                                                      TOM (CONT'D)
                                              If you had one it should go 
                                              through me.
                           MOLLY
           I just have one joke, and if 
           you hate it, whatever. 
                                                      TOM (CONT'D)
                                              Again, you should email it to 
                                              me and I will read it---

                                 KATHERINE
                        I cannot listen to this idiotic 
                        conversation anymore!
                            (to Molly)
                        13. Go. For God’s sake, go. 

           Molly looks around the room and clears her throat. 

                                 MOLLY
                        “Oklahoma Senator Martin Davis, a 
                        pro-life Republican, is the sponsor 
                        of a bill which would make abortion 
                        illegal in the state of Oklahoma. 
                        In Alaska, Senator Jerome Ryan has 
                        a similar bill on tap, as does 
                        Senator Henry Rasmussen of 
                        Louisiana. So many white men bent 
                        on stripping reproductive rights. 
                        Kind of depressing, isn’t it, 
                        ladies? Although I have to say, it 
                        was the first time I was happy to 
                        be going through menopause.”  

           Everyone is stunned. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Wow.  

                                 MOLLY
                        No other talk show hosts can make 
                        that joke. It’s brave. And you’re 
                        pro-choice, aren’t you? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I am. 
                            (to Tom)
                        4, what do you think?

                                 TOM
                        My philosophy is that the show is 
                        best without the specter of 
                        abortion. 

                                 BRAD
                        Or menopause. 

                                 REYNOLDS 
                            (excited)
                        I think it’s audacious. 
                                 BRAD
                        No, no. You’ve never made your 
                        political views known on the show. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I haven’t. Maybe it’s not a bad 
                        idea.

                                 BRAD
                        So start with fracking! Let’s work 
                        our way up to abortion! 

           Katherine looks at Burditt. 

                                 BURDITT
                        People would talk about it for 
                        sure. 
                            (then)
                        And, you believe it. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Take out the line about the white 
                        men, and put it in the monologue 
                        tomorrow. 

           Molly gasps, suppressing her excitement. 

           END OF MONTAGE

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - STAGE - NEXT DAY - 
           AFTERNOON

           Molly watches with Tom at the monitor. 

                                 TOM
                        You’re crowding me. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Sorry. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        ...It was the first time I thought, 
                        I’m happy I’m going through 
                        menopause. 

           The audience is shocked, then delighted. There is an 
           explosion of shocked laughter. Molly watches. 
           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - MOLLY AND BURDITT’S 
           OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER

                                 MOLLY
                        Then she said “That’ll do, you’re 
                        hovering over me, now get off the 
                        stage and stand over there.” Which 
                        was amazing for two reasons. One, 
                        “that’ll do” which means she liked 
                        the joke and “stand over there” 
                        which means she wanted me on set. 
                        On set next to Tom. Tom.

                                 BURDITT
                        I’m sure he was happy about it. 

                                 MOLLY
                        He hated it. I could feel the hate 
                        radiating off his body. This might 
                        be the best day of my life. 

                                 BURDITT
                        Wanna smoke? Or are you gonna be 
                        annoying?

                                 MOLLY
                        You’re inviting me to get high? Oh 
                        my god, I’m cool now. 

                                 BURDITT
                        Yup, you’ll be annoying. 

                                 MOLLY
                        No! No! I’m not. I’m cool about 
                        drugs. Let’s do it. 

           Burditt shrugs. That’s good enough for him. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITERS’ ROOM - DAY

           Katherine and Brad enter the room. 

                                 BRAD
                        Announcement. Hey, you fuckfaces, 
                        listen up. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        You are all invited to a Christmas 
                        party at my home.
                                 BURDITT
                        You mean your annual Christmas 
                        party? The one we go to and you 
                        never attend? 

                                 KATHERINE
                            (stiffly)
                        Well, this year I will be there. I 
                        hope to see you there. 

           She turns abruptly and leaves. 

                                 MOLLY
                        This is very exciting.

                                 BRAD
                        Listen up. Press is going to be 
                        there. She hired a publicist. Named 
                        Robin. We are all going to go and 
                        act like we are working in the 
                        golden age of television and she’s 
                        Lucille fuckin’ Ball. this isn’t 
                        just a free meal and a low-rent 
                        date night for you and your wives. 

                                 TOM
                        I’d like to use my plus one to 
                        bring my younger brother. 

                                 BRAD
                        Fine, but no one else can bring 
                        men. You must bring women. And 
                        you’re all gonna say smart shit to 
                        the press! This is important. 
                        Burditt, you need to buy a new 
                        suit, and Simmons...is there any 
                        way...can you lose some weight? 

                                 SIMMONS
                        How much weight?

                                 BRAD
                        I don’t know, like 30 pounds? This 
                        is serious, guys. She’s doing 
                        interviews for the first time in 
                        twenty years.

           They don’t know what to make of this. Exciting. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - MOLLY AND BURDITT’S 
           OFFICE - DAY

           Burditt and Molly enter and sit down. 
                                 MOLLY
                        Why doesn’t she come to her own 
                        party? 

                                 BURDITT
                        NBC made her have that party 20 
                        years ago, and that was the last 
                        one she ever attended. The cleaning 
                        staff arrives at midnight sharp, 
                        that’s how we know to leave. Shit, 
                        I have to look nice. 
                            (vulnerable)
                        What should I wear? I have a belt 
                        with whales on it. 

                                 MOLLY
                            (gently)
                        Here, I’ll help you. 

           She goes over to his side and clicks open a shopping website. 

           INT. MOLLY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Molly brushes her teeth and walks around her room in spanx 
           tights and a bra. She holds up two sparkly dresses in front 
           of the mirror. She hates both. She is nervous. 

           INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Katherine, looking beautiful and festive, puts on her watch. 
           She looks a bit nervous herself. 

           EXT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The townhouse looks gorgeous, lit up with holiday decorations 
           on a snowy winter night. 

           INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           B-roll shots of her fancy holiday party. It’s in full swing. 
           We see cameos of real people at the party. SETH MEYERS, 
           CHARLIE ROSE, SOLEDAD O’BRIEN. Katherine, makes her way 
           through the party, her publicist Robin glued to her side. 

                                 BILL CARTER
                        Your final season has been your 
                        best yet. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Thank you, Bill. 
                                 BILL CARTER
                        Any word about your replacement? 

           Katherine winces. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I wouldn’t be qualified to comment 
                        on that. 

                                 FEMALE JOURNALIST 
                        There’s been a real uptick in your 
                        ratings. It’s almost like you’re 
                        fighting the announcement.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I just want to make a relevant show 
                        and be the best I can be.

           Robin nods, this was clearly a talking point. Robin moves her 
           to another journalist. Charlie watches Katherine, impressed. 
           We see Molly, in a new dress that we didn’t see earlier. She 
           spots Charlie, and pops over to him, grabbing two egg nogs 
           off a tray. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Egg nog? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Is there booze in this?

                                 MOLLY
                        No, I don’t think so. 

           He distractedly puts it on the fireplace. 

                                 CHARLIE
                            (noticing her)
                        Is that a tag?

           Charlie notices a tag hanging off of Molly’s dress. Molly is 
           mortified. She rips it off. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I bought it on the way here. I hate 
                        all my clothes. Does that ever 
                        happen to you?
                            (changing subject)
                        Do you have plans after this?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m gonna do some work. Go over 
                        some new material. 

           He pats her arm and leaves. Molly is disappointed. 
           INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Katherine takes a shot of tequila. Joan comes in. 

                                 JOAN
                        Oh. Do you need a moment?

                                 KATHERINE
                            (yes she does, but oh well)
                        No. Hello Joan. Merry Christmas. 

                                 JOAN
                        Merry Christmas. Did you get a 
                        chance to look at those resumes?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Resumes?

                                 JOAN
                        For the part-time nurses who could 
                        come assist Dad? 

                                 KATHERINE
                            (this again)
                        I haven’t had a chance. 

                                 JOAN
                        That’s what you said last time. I 
                        can’t stress to you how important 
                        this is to me. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I know. I know. But you can’t 
                        possibly think that bringing this 
                        up at our work holiday party is the 
                        best time for this discussion. 

           Charlie appears at the door. 

                                 JOAN
                        That’s the problem, there is never 
                        a good time. 
                            (eyeing Charlie)
                        You know what? I’ll let you get 
                        back to what’s important. 

           Joan leaves. Charlie ambles in. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re incredible tonight. Rare 
                        form.  
                                 KATHERINE
                        I think my step-daughter might 
                        disagree. 

           She pours him a shot and he takes it. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s crazy that you’re the same 
                        age. Is that ever weird? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes, it’s very, very weird. Pretty 
                        much all the time. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s a pity she doesn’t understand 
                        how amazing you are. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m not going to fuck you, Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        If my memory serves me, we both had 
                        a pretty good time of it- 

                                 KATHERINE
                        It was a mistake and it’s never 
                        going to happen again.

           Katherine leaves. Charlie is wounded.

           INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Molly wanders into a room. She looks around, socially 
           anxious. She turns and bumps right into Tom and his brother 
           Hayes. She spills egg nog on Tom. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh, I’m so sorry. 

                                 TOM
                            (annoyed)
                        I just got this blazer. 
                            (then)
                        Is that tag?

           There’s another tag on Molly’s dress, this one by the neck. 
           She rips it off. 

                                 MOLLY
                            (under her breath)
                        Motherfucker. 
                                 TOM
                        Hayes, you remember Molly?

           Hayes nods.

                                 HAYES
                        By the way, I’m so happy you got 
                        the job. It’s cool that they did 
                        that. It’s important. 

           Dick. Molly perceives this comment for what it is. 

                                 MOLLY
                            (frosty)
                        Thanks. I think it’s important to 
                        hire the funniest and most talented 
                        people, too. 

           She leaves, cool. 

                                 TOM
                        She won’t last past next month. 

           INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - PARLOR - SAME TIME 

           Molly walks into the parlor. Walter is playing the piano. He 
           stops when he sees her. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh! I’m so sorry. I didn’t think 
                        anyone would be in here. 

           She begins to leave. 

                                 WALTER
                        That’s a very nice dress. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Really? Thank you. I just bought 
                        it. 

                                 WALTER
                        I can see that. There’s a sticker 
                        on your breast. 

           Indeed, there is a clear round sticker with an “L” on it. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Dammit!

                                 WALTER
                        I’m Walter Lovell. 
                                 MOLLY
                        I know who you are. You were 
                        Katherine’s manager and then became 
                        her husband. You were one of the 
                        greats. 

                                 WALTER
                        Were. Yes. “Were.” 

           Molly realizes she made a mistake. 

                                 MOLLY
                        And you’re still very accomplished! 
                        Aren’t you a professor emeritus at 
                        NYU?

                                 WALTER
                        “Emeritus” is what they call you 
                        when you’re not dead yet but they 
                        don’t want you to come in.

                                 MOLLY
                        I can relate to people not wanting 
                        you to come in. I write on the 
                        show. 

                                 WALTER
                        She has never mentioned you. 

                                 MOLLY
                        That doesn’t surprise me. She 
                        doesn’t actually like me that much. 

                                 WALTER
                        Sounds like her. What do you do 
                        that annoys her the most?

                                 MOLLY
                        That’s hard to pinpoint. I think... 
                        everything? Just my whole deal? 

                                 WALTER
                        Here’s a word of advice: Be useful. 
                        Make it so that even if she hates 
                        you, she needs you. 

                                 MOLLY
                        “Be useful”. I like it. Simple. A 
                        little difficult to know how to 
                        apply to my current situation, but 
                        I think if I just-- 
                                 WALTER
                        And don’t talk more than you need 
                        to.

           Molly nods, emphatically. 

           EXT. KATHERINE’S BROWNSTONE GARDEN - SAME TIME

           A female JEZEBEL REPORTER is now talking to Katherine. Robin 
           stands with Katherine. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        And I’ve always stood for that. 
                        Excellence is the only important 
                        thing. 

                                 JEZEBEL
                        And you have made that the central 
                        premise of your career. Believing 
                        in a meritocracy. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I might venture to say that the 
                        only true meritocracy is in comedy. 
                        It doesn’t matter what you look 
                        like, where you’re from, what your 
                        parents do, funny is funny. 

           There is a smattering of applause. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Thanks so much, Katherine needs to 
                        talk to other journalists-- 

           Jezebel interrupts. 

                                 JEZEBEL
                        Or in the case of your show, all 
                        white men from elite colleges.  

           Katherine reacts. Jezebel consults her phone. 

                                 JEZEBEL (CONT’D)
                        On your show, people are selected 
                        on the basis of their ability, as 
                        long as they are white men. 

                                 ROBIN
                        I said, that’s enough questions--

           Other journalists notice this. Molly too. 
                                 KATHERINE
                            (caught)
                        I--I think that is a gross 
                        characterization. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m not a white man. 

           People turn and look. 

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Hi, I’m Molly. Chatterjee. I write 
                        on this show. 

           Jezebel turns her phone on her. 

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m actually not that great. But I 
                        have this job because Katherine 
                        specifically asked for a woman of 
                        color. Her show was my favorite 
                        show growing up and all I wanted 
                        was to be able to work for her one 
                        day.

                                 JEZEBEL
                            (patronizing)
                        That’s a very sweet story. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t know if it’s sweet, but 
                        it’s true. I mean, in this culture 
                        of exceptionalism for women, where 
                        most shows have this attitude of 
                        “there can only be one”, Katherine 
                        really didn’t want to have anything 
                        to do with that. 

                                 JEZEBEL
                        Does she even know your name? I 
                        heard she refers to the writers by 
                        number. 

           Katherine looks caught. Molly jumps in. 

                                 MOLLY
                        “Molly!” She says, “You’re a very 
                        promising new writer.”  

                                 KATHERINE
                        It’s true. Molly is definitley 
                        making an impression. 

           Katherine pats her awkwardly. Molly surges with confidence. 
                                 MOLLY
                        I told her she was my hero during 
                        the interview. She was so touched. 
                        She offered to let me be her 
                        protegee. 

           Katherine shoots her a look. Don’t get carried away. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        It was a nice moment. I’m going in 
                        to talk to my guests, please feel 
                        free to ask my writers questions. 

           Katherine steps away, people swarm Molly, who is animated and 
           chatty. Brad steps in line next to Katherine. 

                                 BRAD
                        That was good.

           Katherine sighs, annoyed. Angle on Tom and Hayes, who 
           witnessed the whole thing.

                                 HAYES
                        I don’t think she’s going to be 
                        gone in a month.

           INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           Katherine and Walter talk and are pleasantly buzzed. It is a 
           great night. Daniel Perkins sees them, across the room, and 
           walks over, a little nervous. 

                                 PERKINS
                        Katherine?

           Katherine turns. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Daniel Perkins. 

           Katherine takes him in. He looks great, he is smiling widely. 
           She hates him. 

                                 PERKINS
                        I was hoping to get a chance to 
                        talk to you. You were such an 
                        inspiration for me growing up. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Thank you. I hope you didn’t take a 
                        shit in someone’s shoes?
                                 PERKINS
                        Excuse me? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        From your stand-up routine? You 
                        take a shit in someone’s shoes when 
                        you’re asked to take them off? 

                                 PERKINS
                        Ah, yes. Well, we’re not all 
                        exactly the way we come off in our 
                        acts. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I disagree with you. I am exactly 
                        as advertised. 

                                 PERKINS
                        Well, it’s an honor to be the one 
                        replacing you, then. 

           This hits her like a ton of bricks. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Replacing me?

                                 PERKINS
                        On the show. My god, did the 
                        network not tell you? 

           A knife in her heart. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Excuse me. 

           She leaves, shaken. 

           INT. BONNIE’S OFFICE - THE NEXT MORNING

           Katherine opens the door of Bonnie’s office. She is with two 
           EXECS. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        With Perkins? You’re replacing me 
                        with Perkins?! 

                                 BONNIE
                            (to the execs)
                        We’ll pick this up in a hour. 

           The execs head to the door. 
                                 EXEC
                            (to Katherine)
                        I’m such a fan. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Oh, fuck off.

           The execs leave. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Our ratings are up, we are being 
                        written about in every magazine. 
                        You can’t do this. 

                                 BONNIE
                        Yes, that surprised me. You 
                        actually don’t seem like a corpse 
                        out there. You’re actually earning 
                        your salary. Sorry if I’m not 
                        waxing more ecstatic about it. Your 
                        final year will be a swan song. Now 
                        this can be easy for you, you can 
                        welcome him, make it seem like you 
                        were part of the decision making, 
                        be his mentor, or it can be hard. 
                        The choice is entirely up to you. 
                        It’s your legacy.  Would you like a 
                        cup of coffee? Or, maybe tea? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I don’t think you want me to 
                        holding a hot beverage right now. 

                                 BONNIE
                        I’ll take that as a “no.” 
                        Katherine, do you ever wonder if I 
                        think you are funny? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        No.  

                                 BONNIE
                        Do you think I should think you’re 
                        funny, as the president of the 
                        network you are on? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I have seen six presidents of this 
                        network come and go while I have 
                        been here. Somalian warlords have 
                        had more job stability.  

                                 BONNIE
                        You didn’t answer my question. 
                                 KATHERINE
                        If you’re asking me if I have ever 
                        respected your taste, then the 
                        answer, Bonnie, is no.  

                                 BONNIE
                        You don’t think it matters if I 
                        think you’re funny. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        If you want to replace me with a 
                        meme, whose hatred of women and 
                        minorities is so plainly apparent 
                        it makes me want to move back to 
                        England, to make yourself seem 
                        relevant, then by all means, give 
                        it a try. But there’s no obligation 
                        that I need to respect you. 
                            (then)
                        To answer your question, I think it 
                        is important that America thinks I 
                        am funny, and since you are an 
                        American, then technically, I care 
                        if you think I am funny. The 
                        tiniest fraction of an amount.

           She turns and leaves. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITERS’ ROOM - A 
           LITTLE LATER

           Katherine enters, slamming the door behind her. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Book that internet idiot. 

                                 BRAD
                        That could mean any number of 
                        people. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        The stupid fellow. 

           Molly looks up excitedly. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Stupid Vines?! Are you serious?! 
                        That’s awesome!

                                 KATHERINE
                            (cringing)
                        Yes. Is that really his name?
           Molly nods.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I want Stupid Vines. 

                                 TOM
                        Absolutely not. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        He hasn’t been on network 
                        television yet?

                                 MOLLY
                        No. He’s been holding out. He has a 
                        lot of integrity actually. His 
                        parents are immigrants and they 
                        love that about you. He talks about 
                        it a lot on his vines--

                                 TOM
                        I can’t believe I have to say this, 
                        but I did not go to Harvard to work 
                        on a show that--

                                 KATHERINE
                        This is exactly why you went to 
                        Harvard. To look down your nose at 
                        people like this. Please just book 
                        him before I hit someone.

           Tom shakes his head. Molly is excited. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITERS’ ROOM

           Molly gets up. She takes her coffee cup and throws it in the 
           trash. She is half-way out the door when-

                                 KATHERINE
                        Where are you going? 

                                 MOLLY
                        Me? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes, you, the person I am looking 
                        at. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m just using the bathroom. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Why did you bus your area and push 
                        the chair back in?
                                 MOLLY
                            (busted)
                        I’m going to a comedy show. I’m the 
                        host. It’s a benefit for domestic 
                        abuse. I said yes to it before I 
                        got this job. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Who is performing?

           Molly looks to Charlie, who looks down. He’s not going. Molly 
           takes this in, disappointed. 

                                 MOLLY
                        No one big. No one you’ve heard of. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Then you can miss it. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I can’t. 

           The room stills. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        What? 

                                 MOLLY
                        I have to go. I’m so sorry.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Did you explain to them that we are 
                        in here fighting to save the very 
                        institution that pays for all of 
                        our livelihoods?

                                 MOLLY
                        I did not tell them that, I think 
                        that would stress them out.

                                 KATHERINE
                        As it should. This is a very 
                        stressful situation. Please get out 
                        of it and don’t tell me how you did 
                        it.

                                 MOLLY
                        I gave my word. It’s a benefit for 
                        women and I need to be there. And 
                        as a woman in comedy--

                                 KATHERINE
                        “Woman in Comedy”? Look around this

                        It’s all men and they’re all 
                        staying. Women your age, you want 
                        to be respected the same as men, 
                        paid the same as men, so what do 
                        you do? You leave work early to go 
                        to rallies and panels and moderated 
                        discussions to shout empowerment 
                        from the rooftop. While the men 
                        stay at work. Doing all the work. 
                        This is how you help women? By 
                        being the only person to leave when 
                        everyone else is working a late 
                        night?

                                 MOLLY
                        I made a commitment to these people-

                                 KATHERINE
                        You made a commitment to me!

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m really torn right now--

                                 KATHERINE
                        You shouldn’t be torn! And you 
                        shouldn’t let me know you’re torn! 
                        You can’t just download your 
                        emotional state and assume your 
                        honesty will exonerate you.

           There’s a pause. 

                                 TOM

                                 KATHERINE
                        What?

                                 TOM
                        Upload your emotional state. 
                        Download is when you take something 
                        off the internet, upload is when 
                        you put something on there. So if 
                        this conversation is the internet, 
                        then she was uploading her 
                        emotional state-

                                 BRAD
                        Shut up.

                                 TOM
                        Yes.
                                 MOLLY
                        I will come straight back, I 
                        promise.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Molly, I need you here. If you 
                        leave, don’t come back.

           Writers are shocked. This is the first time Katherine has 
           called any of them by their name. 

           She then turns and leaves. Everyone is shocked. This kind of 
           defiance has never happened here. It is silent. Tom clears 
           his throat. 

                                 TOM
                        You should know, she told me she 
                        would have to leave early, and 
                        submitted a packet of jokes to me 
                        already. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Throw them out. And come up with 
                        new ones. 
                            (pointed)
                        Download them from your brain and 
                        upload them into the show.

           INT. PS 122 - NIGHT

           A small black-box comedy theater in the East Village. Molly 
           arrives for the show, shaken up. A STAGE MANAGER finds her 
           and hugs her. 

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Are you okay?

           Molly nods, on the verge of tears. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Give me the line-up. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITERS’ ROOM - NIGHT

           Someone is pitching a long joke. Katherine’s distracted, and 
           she walks out in the middle of the pitch without explanation.

                                 SIMMONS
                        What do we do?
                                 BRAD
                        I don’t know, but we’re all 
                        staying. We’re all just gonna sit 
                        here.

           They sit back, annoyed and puzzled. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Katherine grabs Molly’s flyer off the wall.

           INT. KATHERINE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Katherine reads the flyer in her town car. Crumples it up 
           angrily.

           INT. PS 122 - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           A dorky looking STAND UP COMEDIAN is shaking nervously. 
           They’re about to announce her. Katherine walks up to her.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Do you mind if I go before you?

           The comedian is speechless.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take that as a “no.”

           INT. P.S. 122 - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           While another stand up is on stage, Molly turns to the stage 
           manager.

                                 MOLLY
                        Who’s next?

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Katherine Newbury.

                                 MOLLY
                        What?

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        The next performer is Katherine 
                        Newbury. Do you not know who she 
                        is? 
                                 MOLLY
                            (shocked)
                        No, I do. She’s here?

           INT. P.S. 122 - STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Molly walks out to stage. 

                                 MOLLY
                        The next performer is, um, a really 
                        big deal? And she’s my boss. It’s 
                        Katherine Newbury. 

           Katherine comes out. The audience goes crazy, there are 
           shocked reactions and loud applause.  

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITERS’ ROOM - NIGHT

                                 TOM
                        Are we seriously just gonna sit 
                        here and wait? We don’t even know 
                        where she is.

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Holy shit. She’s at the show.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What show?

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Molly’s show. 

           Everyone gets out their phones and checks Twitter.

           INT. THEATER - STAGE - NIGHT

           Katherine is out on stage. It is a small black box, much 
           smaller than her theater. But she is nervous. The light feels 
           brighter. The applause dies down. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Thank you, thank you very much. How 
                        are you guys? I’m doing well. I 
                        would be better though if I didn’t 
                        get so many emails every day. It 
                        never ends. Every morning I wake up 
                        and I look at my phone and there 
                        are more emails. Dozens more 
                        emails, all saying the same 
                        bullshit I don’t care about. And 
                        it’s a marvel, actually. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATHERINE (CONT'D)
                        I know that writing each of those 
                        emails is the most nerve-wracking 
                        thing that person will do that day. 
                        “Wow, I’m sending an email to 
                        Katherine Newbury”. And their 
                        greatest fear - that I won’t read 
                        it - comes true every time. 

           There is a silence. No one knows what to make of this rant, 
           which is neither funny nor likable. Katherine looks out at 
           the crowd. A few people are filming this with their phones, 
           most are staring at her, waiting for something wonderful, 
           anything but this. 

           She is bombing. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                            (aloud but to herself)
                        So that’s not very relatable I 
                        guess.  That’s not working. 

           Katherine paces the small stage in silence. The audience is 
           witnessing this famous comedian processing failure live, on 
           stage, and it’s a stunning and horrifying thing. 

           We see Molly backstage, panicked. Katherine paces in silence. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Well shit, I don’t know, guys, I 
                        just don’t know. Guess I know now 
                        why they’re taking my show from me. 
                        But if I can’t kill in this room 
                        full of comedy nerds and unemployed 
                        hipsters, then I don’t know who 
                        should hire me. 

           People laugh. She holds up the flyer for the show.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe don’t put “money goes to the 
                        domestic abuse shelter” on a comedy 
                        show flyer. Nothing says “I love to 
                        laugh” like the phrase “domestic 
                        abuse”. Or “shelter”. Actually, 
                        this is remarkable, you’ve taken 
                        the two least funny concepts in the 
                        world and put them on a flyer for a 
                        comedy show. 

           She is killing. 
                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never had experience being 
                        beaten, but then again my husband 
                        is in a wheelchair.

           INT. P.S. 122 - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

                                 KATHERINE (O.S.)
                            (to the audience)
                        Thank you. I hope I’ve earned the 
                        privilege of your time. 

           The audience goes nuts. Katherine walks offstage after her 
           set. 

                                 MOLLY
                        You were incredible.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Get in the car. 

           Molly runs on stage.

                                 MOLLY
                        That’s the show, everybody, 
                        goodnight!

           Molly and Katherine leave together.

           INT. KATHERINE’S CAR - NIGHT

           The ride back is mostly silent.

                                 MOLLY
                        I think some of your strongest 
                        stuff was towards--

                                 KATHERINE
                        Shut up.

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The writers are hanging out in the kitchen. Burditt gets a 
           text from Molly that they’re coming back.

                                 BURDITT
                        They’re coming back, they’re coming 
                        back.

           Everyone runs back to the room.
           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITERS’ ROOM - NIGHT

           Katherine’s invigorated after the stand up show.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I am the only woman in late-night 
                        television. The only woman. And we 
                        haven’t even been using it. I’ve 
                        been doing the same old format, the 
                        same jokes, hell, the same cadences 
                        as these other guys. You don’t take 
                        three apples and a banana and paint 
                        the banana red and hope people 
                        don’t notice it doesn’t have seeds. 
                        I’m different than them and we 
                        should be taking advantage of that.

                                 TOM
                        How? More jokes about female 
                        issues?

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m not asking you to write me a 
                        tight five on menstruation. I just 
                        don’t want any more jokes that 
                        could be uttered by any road comic 
                        making a stop at Yuks Yuks in San 
                        Antonio. I don’t want any more of 
                        the jokes that you reject from your 
                        own stand up. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I use the jokes that you reject for 
                        my own stand up.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I want shit that only I can say. 
                        This is the last they might ever 
                        hear from me, so they might as well 
                        hear from me. 
                            (To Tom, pointing at Molly)
                        She’s writing monologue jokes with 
                        you now.

           Tom is stunned.

                                 TOM
                        She has literally no experience. I 
                        would prefer to choose a writer to 
                        train. In a month or so of 
                        shadowing me I could bring them 
                        into the fold. 
                                 KATHERINE
                        What “fold”? In a month or so there 
                        isn’t going to be any “fold”.

                                 TOM
                        This isn’t a screen writing course 
                        at the JFK Marriott. I can’t teach 
                        joke writing to a total novice 
                        overnight.

                                 KATHERINE
                        You won’t have to. You’re not 
                        teaching her anything because I 
                        want someone who doesn’t think 
                        exactly the same way as everyone 
                        else in the goddamn room. She’s 
                        writing monologue jokes with you, 
                        Tom.

           End of discussion. Tom is pissed - Molly is excited.

           This kicks off a MONTAGE:

           INT. UP LATE STAGES - NEXT DAY

           Katherine delivers a monologue about a show with a political 
           bent. It’s visceral and funny. She’s alive, on a roll. 

           INT. COMEDY CELLAR - NIGHT

           Katherine in a t-shirt and jeans work-shopping a joke 
           onstage. The young crowd is packed, kids are sitting on the 
           floor of the stage. She is loving it. 

           INT. CHARLIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Molly and Charlie go at it in bed, Charlie pulls off his 
           sweater. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - BRAD’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Tony drops off a newspaper. Brad opens to the LIVING/ARTS 
           section. There’s a picture of Katherine. Bill Carter, NY 
           Times headline: “WHAT WILL SHE SAY NEXT?”

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - STAGE - AFTERNOON

           Tom and Molly go over monologue jokes with Katherine.
           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - REYNOLDS’S OFFICE - DAY

           The guys are in there. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        “Up Late with Katherine Newbury has 
                        become a must-watch again.”

           The writers high-five as he reads it aloud.  

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - STAGE - AFTERNOON 

           Tom and Molly stand by Katherine at her desk during 
           rehearsal. She’s agitated. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        This Central Park carriage horse 
                        joke isn’t working. It’s too New 
                        York, people don’t care. 

                                 TOM
                        Maybe we add a little more pipe at 
                        the top, it will work. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Making it longer won’t make it 
                        funnier. 

                                 TOM
                        Just enough to give them a frame of 
                        reference. “In New York, we have 
                        these horse drawn carriages, like 
                        Cinderella--”

                                 KATHERINE
                        Then they’re going to think of 
                        fucking pumpkins, Tom. It’s not 
                        going to work. Kill it. What else 
                        do you have?

           Tom is caught. He doesn’t have anything else. 

                                 TOM
                        Uh, just give me a few minutes and 
                        I can come up with-- 

           Molly senses an opening. 

                                 MOLLY
                        “According to a recent poll in USA 
                        Today, 50% of male viewers find me 
                        to be “cold” and “stuck-up”. That’s 
                        terrible! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MOLLY (CONT'D)
                        I’m not cold and stuck-up. It’s 
                        just my accent. If I spoke like a 
                        Yank you’d think I was Taylor 
                        Swift.” Then maybe you can do your 
                        American accent to announce the 
                        guests. 

                                 TOM
                        She doesn’t do an American accent. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’ll do it. That’ll work. 

           Tom looks dejected and leaves. Molly glances over at him, 
           smirking. Katherine notices. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        He’s not terrible just because he’s 
                        privileged, you know.

                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t know, I think when your 
                        father worked on the show and 
                        you’re fourth-generation Harvard...

                                 KATHERINE
                        I went to Cambridge. I’m not the 
                        person to whom to complain about 
                        elitism. 

                                 MOLLY
                        He’s a dick. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        That’s not kind.

                                 MOLLY
                        If you’re my barometer for 
                        kindness, I’m fucked. 
                            (then, immediately)
                        Sorry. 

           Katherine laughs, in spite of herself. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        We’re done here. Go. 
                            (then, as Molly leaves)
                        If his very worst qualities are 
                        elitism and snobbery, that’s not 
                        really all that bad, is it? 

           Molly takes this in, unsure why Katherine added this. 
           END MONTAGE

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - KATHERINE’S OFFICE - 
           NIGHT

           Katherine is smoking a joint. There is a knock at the door. 
           She ignores it. The knocking continues. She ignores it for as 
           long as humanly possible. She wafts the air a bit and opens 
           the window. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        What? What is it?

           Brad enters. 

                                 BRAD
                        Hey. 
                            (sniffs)
                        Oh, come on. You’re worse than the 
                        guys. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        It’s Walter’s. To deal with pain. 
                        Or to deal with me. 

                                 BRAD
                        Well, in that case, maybe I should 
                        get a prescription. 

                                 KATHERINE
                            (frost)
                        What do you need, Bradley? 

                                 BRAD
                        It’s not good news. For sweeps they 
                        want you to introduce Perkins as 
                        your replacement. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        And have him as a guest on the 
                        show?!

                                 BRAD
                        Exactly. Make it really official. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        So nothing makes a difference?! 
                        Nothing I’m doing, no amount of 
                        hard work can make a difference 
                        here.

           She throws her Emmy out the window. Katherine grabs her coat 
           and leaves. 
                                 BRAD
                        Jesus Christ, Katherine! There are 
                        people downstairs!

           INT. 30 ROCK - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Katherine is sullen and steps into the elevator. The doors 
           close. The doors open. Nathan is there, and steps into the 
           elevator. 

                                 NATHAN
                        Busy tonight?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Meet me in the garage.

           INT. KATHERINE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Katherine comes home from her tryst. Walter is asleep. She 
           peels off her coat and shoes and climbs into bed. She hates 
           herself. 

           INT. 30 ROCK - ELEVATOR - NEXT DAY

           The next day, Brad gets on the elevator with Tom and Molly. 
           Simmons also tries to get on. 

                                 BRAD
                        Get the next one. 

           Door closes. Molly and Tom look at each other, what is going 
           on?

                                 BRAD (CONT’D)
                        Network wants Katherine to 
                        introduce Perkins as her 
                        replacement on the show today. 

                            TOM
           What?! 
                                                          MOLLY
                                              Are you serious?! 

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Are you fucking kidding me? That is 
                        the biggest load of bullshit I have 
                        ever heard, Brad!

                                 TOM
                        I would not have put it like that, 
                        but I agree. 
                                 BRAD
                        Well, guess what? There’s nothing 
                        we can do about it. Okay? So don’t 
                        rile her up, it’s happening. Just 
                        go in there, do your jobs, be 
                        quiet, and do not. Rile. Her. Up. 

           They nod, dismayed. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - KATHERINE’S DRESSING 
           ROOM - DAY

           Katherine is getting her makeup done, very withdrawn. 

                                 TOM
                        And then end on the Supreme Court 
                        joke if it kills. If not, there’s 
                        two more on cards. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Fine. 

                                 BRAD
                        Okay, well, you guys can go to 
                        stage, now. 

           Molly and Tom start to head out. Molly stops and turns back. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I just wanna say - no, I just need 
                        to say - you don’t have to do this.

                                 BRAD
                        Molly. Go. 
                            (to Katherine)
                        Don’t listen to her. You need to do 
                        this. 

                                 TOM
                        I think introducing him is the 
                        classy thing to do. Look like this 
                        was your decision. It’s the best we 
                        can do. 

                                 MOLLY
                            (to Tom)
                        No it’s not! 
                            (to Katherine)
                        This is your show. Who you are 
                        means something, it meant something 
                        to me. That’s why I work here. So 
                        show everyone it’s your show. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOM
                        There are no “pillars” in a 
                        “handbook”, get your metaphors 
                        straight. If she followed your 
                        advice, she would have made a fool 
                        of herself. And she’s not you, she 
                        can’t afford to do that. That’s not 
                        how things work, Molly. 

                                 MOLLY
                        You know what, Tom? Fuck how things 
                        work. If I cared “how things work” 
                        I wouldn’t even have this job. 

                                 TOM
                        Which would be great!

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh, fuck you, Tom.

           Molly turns and leaves. Tom is about to shout something at 
           her, but stops himself. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - STAGE - LATER

           Katherine interviews Perkins onstage. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Now, there are some rumors out 
                        there. That you might be replacing 
                        me. 

                                 PERKINS
                        You’re a legend. The first late 
                        night female talk show host. I 
                        would be beyond honored. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Thank you. But... I don’t want to 
                        go.

           The audience laughs, and so does Perkins. 

                                 PERKINS
                        I get it. Who would want to leave 
                        this place? Katherine Newbury, 
                        everyone. Let’s make some noise. 

           There is riotous applause. Katherine narrows her eyes at 
           Perkins. That’s her crowd, not his. 
                                 KATHERINE
                        Thanks for the noise. So, I find 
                        myself in a strange position. 
                        Because, I don’t want to go. 
                            (to audience)
                        Do you think I should go?

           The audience boos. Perkins is a little weirded out but tries 
           to gain control of this. 

                                 PERKINS
                        Don’t we wish she could stay?

           The audience cheers.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Do you really think I should stay?

           The audience reaction gets bigger and bigger.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Well.. Maybe I’ll consider staying. 
                        You know what? I’ll stay. 

           The audience goes nuts. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        We have to take a break, we will 
                        see you back here shortly. 

           They break for commercial. Perkins rips off his mic and 
           stands. Brad, Robin and other producers swarm around 
           Katherine. 

                                 PERKINS
                        Nice little stunt. Fucking bitch. 

           He stalks off stage, his manager and publicist filing in next 
           to him, anxiously. He walks right by Molly and Tom. 

                                 TOM
                        Holy shit. 

           Katherine looks over at Molly and nods.

                                 MOLLY
                        Whoa.

           INT. BONNIE’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Bonnie watches the feed. She slaps her mug of tea off her 
           desk.
           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - PERKINS’S DRESSING ROOM 
           - SAME TIME

           Perkins angrily leaves with his entourage.

                                 PERKINS
                            (to his manager)
                        I’m gonna fucking destroy her.

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - BACKSTAGE

           Katherine walks backstage. Everything comes to a stop. She 
           looks up. After a long moment, the crew and writers start to 
           applaud her.

           INT. 30 ROCK - ELEVATOR

           Molly and Tom stand in the elevator, shocked. 

                                 TOM
                        I was wrong. That was awesome. And 
                        I’m sorry.

           Molly takes this in, still too stunned to gloat. 

                                 MOLLY
                        It’s okay. 

           INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Katherine comes home late, tipsy, and walking on air. Walter 
           is waiting up for her. He is quiet and he looks worried. 

                                 KATHERINE
                            (excited)
                        Did you see it? Did you hear about 
                        it? He was so smug. He was so 
                        certain I would play ball. It was 
                        glorious, Walter. 

                                 WALTER
                        You were good.

                                 KATHERINE
                        But?

                                 WALTER
                        I’m worried.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Worried? 
           She sits by him. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I thought you said I should be 
                        confident.

                                 WALTER
                        This isn’t confident. This is 
                        dangerous. You’ve never made 
                        enemies before. You humiliated 
                        Perkins and he’s powerful.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I haven’t felt like myself in ten 
                        years. I feel alive, Walter. I 
                        won’t be bullied. 

           She leaves to change, and we stay with Walter, still very 
           concerned. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - STAGE - DAY 

           Katherine sits with the STUPID VINES STAR, JOSEPH MENDOZA. He 
           is nervous and sweating through his Hawaiian shirt. We see a 
           clip rolling of one of his vines, where he is throwing and 
           catching a frisbee in his mouth with low-tech editing. 
           Katherine clearly hates this, and Joseph can tell. 

                                 STUPID VINES GUY
                        I was inspired to make this one 
                        from playing frisbee with my dog. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes, I can see the correlation. 

           The audience laughs. 

                                 STUPID VINES GUY
                        It has over eighty million views. 

                                 KATHERINE
                            (amazed)
                        That has eighty million views?

                                 STUPID VINES GUY
                        Yes. More people watched that than 
                        voted in the last election. 

           Katherine glances over to Molly, who gestures vehemently to 
           her: “Be nice!” Katherine turns back to him. 
                                 KATHERINE
                        Well, I must admit, I think it is 
                        quite stupid. But it has its charm. 

           Stupid Vines breaks out into a wide grin. 

                                 STUPID VINES GUY
                            (psyched, chanting)
                        Yeah! Stupid Vines! Stupid Vines! 

           He high-fives Katherine. He starts a chant of “Stupid Vines! 
           Stupid Vines!” with the audience. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        So, you immigrated here from Laos 
                        when you were fourteen. 

           Stupid Vines is caught off guard for a second. He has never 
           been asked this type of question. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        That must have been quite a 
                        transition for you. I admire that 
                        you have made so much for yourself 
                        in that time. 

           Stupid Vines is now very moved. 

                                 STUPID VINES GUY
                        Thank you. Yes, I bought my mother 
                        a house and a Hummer. She had never 
                        even owned a car. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I think you could’ve split the 
                        difference there. There’s a huge 
                        jump from “no car and walking” to 
                        “Hummer”. 

           Audience laughs again, as does Stupid Vines. They love 
           Katherine with this guy. She’s being very appealing. 

                                 STUPID VINES GUY
                        That is why I admire you so much. 
                        We’re both immigrants who it made 
                        it big in entertainment. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes, almost identical in every way, 
                        you and I. 
                            (then)
                        I will admit, my show is fairly 
                        stupid as well. 
           This kills. Molly smiles. She gets a text from Charlie. 

                                 CHARLIE (TEXT)
                        You coming to see my show tonight?

                                 MOLLY (TEXT)
                        I have a dinner with two agents. 

                                 CHARLIE (TEXT)
                        That’s too bad. I was looking 
                        forward to fucking you later. 

           Molly blushes. Tom glances over at her phone, and she hastily 
           puts her phone away. They stand in silence, watching the 
           interview. 

                                 TOM
                        Don’t let the agents know you’re 
                        impressed by them. 

                                 MOLLY
                            (frosty)
                        Thanks, I think I’ll be fine. 

           He leaves. She thinks this advice over. 

           INT. MASA RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           We see this fancy midtown restaurant. 

                                 ENTHUSIASTIC AGENT (V.O.)
                        This is where my wife and I had our 
                        anniversary.

           Molly sits stone-faced with two agents, both male, in the 
           very fancy Masa. One is the older, polished SENIOR AGENT and 
           the other is the younger very ENTHUSIASTIC AGENT that will 
           certainly be representing Molly when the Senior Agent dumps 
           her on him. 

                                 SENIOR AGENT
                        No kidding. Matt Damon’s over by 
                        the window, we should say hi to him 
                        before we leave. 

           They check to see if she’s impressed. She is, but she hides 
           it well. She clears her throat. 

                                 SENIOR AGENT (CONT’D)
                        We think what you’re doing is 
                        amazing. 
                                 ENTHUSIASTIC AGENT
                        We represent most of your staff. 
                        They say the nicest things about 
                        you. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Really? I’m not very well liked. 

                                 SENIOR AGENT
                            (ignoring this)
                        We think you have a huge future. 
                        And we want to be a part of that 
                        future. 

                                 MOLLY
                        That sounds really cool. May I ask 
                        how much you commission?

           They are startled by this. 

                                 ENTHUSIASTIC AGENT
                        Ten percent. That’s standard. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Is that negotiable? 

                                 ENTHUSIASTIC AGENT
                        The percentage? No. 

           They laugh, a little uncertain. 

                                 MOLLY
                        If I sign with you, I’m not going 
                        to pay commission on this job. I 
                        found it on my own.

                                 SENIOR AGENT
                        That’s not how it works, 
                        sweetheart. You know, when I first 
                        signed Tina Fey, she had a similar 
                        energy to you--

                                 MOLLY
                        That’s how it will work with me, 
                        though. 

                                 SENIOR AGENT
                        What?

                                 MOLLY
                        That’s how it will work if you 
                        represent me. 
                                 ENTHUSIASTIC AGENT
                        Are you serious? 

                                 MOLLY
                        I am. I mean, I don’t really need 
                        an agent. I have a job. 

           The agents look at each other. 

                                 SENIOR AGENT
                        Okay, fine. We won’t take 
                        commission on Tonight.

                                 MOLLY
                        Thank you. Also. I want a car.

                                 ENTHUSIASTIC AGENT
                        What? 

                                 SENIOR AGENT
                        You want us to buy you a car. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Yes. It doesn’t have to be a fancy 
                        car, but I want a car.

                                 SENIOR AGENT
                        We can’t just give you a car. We’re 
                        a talent agency.

                                 MOLLY
                        Well, that’s what I want. No 
                        commission, and I need a car. Did 
                        Tina Fey ask for that?  

           The agents look at each other, considering.

           EXT. CAROLINE’S - LATER - NIGHT

           Molly walks down the street, jubilant. She pulls out her 
           phone. 

                                 MOLLY (TEXT)
                        We finished early, I’m around the 
                        corner--

           While walking, she then sees Charlie, arm around a woman, 
           hailing and getting into a cab. Molly’s face crumbles. 

           ONE WEEK LATER
           INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Katherine and the writers are at her house working in the 
           living room. Molly comes into the room, there is an empty 
           seat by Charlie. She goes out of her way to sit next to 
           Reynolds on the other side of the dining room. Charlie and 
           Tom notice. 

                                 BRAD
                        Okay, let’s get started. 

           People buckled down. Molly opens a notebook, ignoring 
           Charlie, who is looking at her. 

           INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - FOYER - LATER - NIGHT

           Katherine answers the door. It’s Joan. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Joan. What a nice surprise. 

                                 JOAN
                        It’s not a surprise. It’s Annie’s 
                        birthday. We’re having her birthday 
                        dinner here?
                            (then)
                        You forgot. Of course. 

           The writers’ attention flickers over to them. Katherine, self-
           conscious, pulls her into the living room. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I love your hair, did you cut it?

                                 JOAN
                        I cut it nine months ago. You ask 
                        me that every time I see you and 
                        it’s always the same length.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Well it’s a great length on you.

                                 JOAN
                            (re: staff)
                        Are they going to be here all 
                        night?

                                 KATHERINE
                        They need to be here. 
                                 JOAN
                        It’s Annie’s birthday. She was 
                        excited to have dinner with you 
                        two. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        With all due respect, what 10 year 
                        old girl wants to spend her 
                        birthday with her grandparents?

                                 JOAN
                        We told her you wanted to spend it 
                        with her.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Well look, if none of us wants to 
                        do it, why don’t we just call it 
                        off?

                                 JOAN
                        Did you know that my dad fell last 
                        week?

           Katherine flinches. The answer is obvious. 

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        I guess he doesn’t want to be the 
                        old husband telling his young wife 
                        that he has health problems. I’m 
                        sure you understand. You certainly 
                        keep things from him.

           Joan’s glances over at the dining room, where we can see 
           Charlie. Her insinuation is clear. 

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Nevermind. I’ll take Annie out to 
                        dinner. I hope you have a wonderful 
                        night. 

           She leaves. Katherine reacts. 

           INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Katherine enters. The writers all look up. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        We’re done. Please leave. 

           She leaves. 
                                 BRAD
                        That was unexpected. But we’ll pick 
                        this up in the morning. Everyone 
                        out. Simmons, hurry up, don’t take 
                        forever.  

           People start getting their things. Charlie finds Molly. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Trouble in paradise. 

                                 MOLLY
                        You don’t know that. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Things have a way of catching up 
                        with you. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Don’t talk about her like that. 

           Charlie reacts. What has gotten into her?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Defending her now, huh? That may be 
                        a bit of a one-sided friendship. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Screw you. 

           Charlie, pissed, grabs his stuff and leaves. 

           EXT. COMMERCE STREET - NIGHT

           Molly walks, angry. Tom catches up with her, and walks with 
           her. She glances at him but says nothing. 

                                 TOM
                        That’s the other shoe. 

                                 MOLLY
                        What?

                                 TOM
                        That’s the other shoe dropping. 
                        With Charlie. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I really don’t want to talk about 
                        this with you. 
                                 TOM
                        You like him ‘cause he’s kind of a 
                        dick. Now you see what being a dick 
                        is really like. 

                                 MOLLY
                            (annoyed)
                        You ran up to me to tell me “I told 
                        you so?”

                                 TOM
                        Not “I told you so”. “Join the 
                        club”. Our freshman year we both 
                        saved up to go see Pearl Jam in 
                        Chicago, where his parents live. It 
                        was going to be this whole road 
                        trip. And the drive there was like 
                        the best three days of my life. We 
                        laughed, and got high every day, 
                        shared motel rooms, and got these 
                        tattoos of compasses on our thighs. 

                                 MOLLY
                        That’s pretty homo-erotic. 

                                 TOM
                        It was! In that awesome way that 
                        two stupid 18 year old straight 
                        guys don’t understand yet. But in 
                        Chicago, at the concert, I went to 
                        buy a t-shirt at the merch stand, 
                        and he met a girl. He left with her 
                        and I never saw him again. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Until you met him back at his 
                        parents house that night?

                                 TOM
                        He didn’t go back to his parents 
                        house. I didn’t see him again that 
                        summer. He took the car and spent 
                        two weeks with her. I hitchhiked 
                        back to his parents place, and his 
                        dad put me on a bus back to Boston. 
                        That’s when I learned about the 
                        other shoe. 

                                 MOLLY
                        That’s awful. Why are you still 
                        friends with him?
                                 TOM
                        I guess when you work with someone 
                        you’ve known for eighteen years you 
                        have to decide if you’re mortal 
                        enemies or best friends. You can’t 
                        be lifelong acquaintances. And 
                        mortal enemies felt like a lot of 
                        work. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Also, I bet you have a hard time 
                        making friends.  

                                 TOM
                            (smiling)
                        I deserved that.  

           They smile. 

                                 MOLLY
                        You still have that tattoo?

                                 TOM
                        Oh yeah. It’s horrible. 

           Molly laughs. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - MOLLY AND BURDITT’S 
           OFFICE - MORNING

           Molly sits on the ground, reading a newspaper with a high-
           lighter, looking for jokes. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Burditt, is there anything with 
                        Anthony Weiner? Is that clammy now? 
                        I’m obsessed with Huma. I think she 
                        would like me.  

                                 BURDITT
                            (distracted)
                        Jesus Christ. 

                                 MOLLY
                        She’s way too cool to like me, 
                        you’re right. 

                                 BURDITT
                        No. Come here. 

           Molly comes over, they see on the NY Daily News, an article 
           called “Woman Of The Night”, with photo of Katherine going 
           into a hotel with NATHAN. 
           There are also photos of other men, like the Banker and 
           others. Molly and Burditt are taken aback.  

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - STAGE - DAY

           Katherine is interviewing a guest, STEPHEN KING. She throws 
           to commercial. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        When we come back, more from our 
                        guest, Stephen King. 

           The band plays and we go to commercial. Robin walks briskly 
           over to Katherine’s desk. Brad whispers in Katherine’s ear. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        I would love to get a photo with 
                        you-

           Stephen tries to take a selfie but Katherine bolts from her 
           chair. We SMASH CUT TO: 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - BRAD’S OFFICE - EVENING

           Katherine and Brad read Gawker. They scroll through a report, 
           “KATHERINE’S AFFAIRS”. Katherine sits in disbelief.  

           INT. BONNIE’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Bonnie watches a news report on EXTRA. Same headlines, same 
           news story. 

           INT. EQUINOX - SAME TIME

           Perkins does crunches at the gym. He sees the same report on 
           a TV and stops for a moment, smiling. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - REYNOLDS’S OFFICE - 
           SAME TIME

           The writers all pore over their phones. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Holy shit. This is insane. 
                                 TOM
                        There are so many of them. Some 
                        banker from Georgetown on the night 
                        Mark Twain thing. Nathan Turner, 
                        that producer from the Today Show? 

           Charlie is especially panicked. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Who else did they say?  

                                 REYNOLDS
                        It’s all coming out now. 
                            (re: Charlie at his 
                              computer)
                        Why are you googling yourself? This 
                        is a way bigger deal. 

           Charlie nods, worried, and closes out of the screen. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - KATHERINE’S DRESSING 
           ROOM - DAY

           Brad paces while Katherine sits in a daze.  

                                 BRAD
                        This is fucking Perkins. This is 
                        some Anthony Pellicano shit.

                                 KATHERINE
                        So many people corroborated this. A 
                        housekeeper at The Four Seasons. My 
                        driver. They must’ve known for 
                        years... they just didn’t care 
                        until now.

           Brad pats her arm, trying to be console her. 

                                 BRAD
                        Hey, it’s bad for all of us. 
                        Vanessa called me worried that 
                        someone you and I...

                                 KATHERINE
                            (incredulous)
                        You and I what? 

                                 BRAD
                        She wanted to know if there’d been 
                        anything between the two of us.
                                 KATHERINE
                            (disgusted)
                        Oh for fuck’s sake, Brad. Tell 
                        Vanessa she has nothing to worry 
                        about. 

                                 BRAD
                        Okay, okay.  

                                 KATHERINE
                        I mean, these are young, handsome 
                        men. I would never, ever, ever--

                                 BRAD
                        I get it! I’m just saying it’s hard 
                        on all of us!

           Brad and Katherine sit, both very upset. 

           EXT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Katherine gets out of her town car. Joan is helping Walter in 
           a different car. Katherine runs to Walter, panicked. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Walter! Where are you going? 

                                 JOAN
                        He’s going to stay with me. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Walter, please. Let me explain---

                                 WALTER
                        I knew it was happening. I just 
                        thought you’d protect me. I’m sad 
                        for you. I’m sad for me for feeling 
                        sad for you.

                                 KATHERINE
                        My love, no. Please, no. Walter--

                                 JOAN
                        Stop it. He doesn’t want to talk to 
                        you. 

           Walter gets into the car while Katherine struggles to keep 
           the door from closing. Suddenly she slips on an icy patch and 
           falls to the ground. 

                                                          WE FLASH BACK 
                                                                    TO:
           EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT - 1980

           Katherine, 19, has slipped on the snowy ground on the street 
           near the Comedy Store. She stands up, and has a bloody knee. 
           She looks like she is about to cry. 

                                 JOAN (V.O.)
                        Get a hold of yourself. 

           EXT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - PRESENT DAY

           Joan closes the door, then helps Katherine up. Katherine has 
           a bloody, skinned knee. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Thank you. 

           Joan opens the passenger seat of the car. But then stops and 
           turns to face Katherine. 

                                 JOAN
                        You know, I forgave you. I forgave 
                        the twenty year old you who got 
                        swept up by a 50 year old. Even 
                        though it tore apart my family and 
                        I was a the girl whose father 
                        abandoned his whole life for a 
                        twenty year old English girl. I can 
                        forgive her because she didn’t know 
                        what she was doing. But you know 
                        who I can’t forgive? This version 
                        of you. Because you know what 
                        you’re doing.

           Joan walks around to the front of the car, gets in, and the 
           car drives off. Katherine stands watching. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITERS’ ROOM - NEXT 
           DAY 

           Molly comes into the empty room with a note pad. 

                                 BRAD
                        We’re dark. Didn’t you get the 
                        email?

                                 MOLLY
                        I got it but I disagreed with it. 
                                 BRAD
                            (I give up)
                        Sure, anyone can just do whatever 
                        they want. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Is Katherine not coming in?

                                 BRAD
                        No, we are dark. No one’s coming 
                        in. 

                                 MOLLY
                        We have to go on and address this. 

                                 BRAD
                        Well, she doesn’t want to.

                                 MOLLY
                        Brad, we must. This is like The 
                        Crucible. We are confronted with 
                        the very face of sexism in 
                        Hollywood. 

                                 BRAD
                        Molly, this isn’t your American 
                        studies class at Luzerne State. 
                        You’re exhausting me. Leave. 

           Molly turns and leaves, incensed. 

           INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Katherine is alone. Tons of paparazzi are outside.

           EXT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Molly arrives, gets past the paparazzi.

                                 PAPARAZZI
                        Hey, we’ve been out here for hours, 
                        you can’t just push your way in. 

                                 MOLLY
                        You think I’m...
                            (disgusted)
                        ...one of you?

                                 PAPARAZZI
                        You ain’t Miss America. 

           Molly is appalled and pushes her way through. 
           INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A housekeeper opens the door. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Lo siento. Esto es muy urgente.

           Molly pushes by her and walks down the hallway.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                            (calling out)
                        Katherine? Katherine! 

                                 HOUSEKEEPER
                        I speak English. You can’t go in 
                        there!

           It’s too late. Molly is down the hallway and opens the door 
           of the parlor. 

           INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

           Katherine sits polishing Walter’s piano and smoking, inside.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Katherine?

           Molly starts coughing. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Do you see any smudges on this? 

                                 MOLLY
                        Are you insane? Open a window for 
                        God’s sake. 

           Molly opens the window, a bitter wind comes in. Molly wraps 
           her sweater around her tighter. 

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Look, I know this is bad. But I 
                        have a plan. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        He played this piano for years and 
                        I never listened. Not really.  

                                 MOLLY
                        What? Look, are you going to come 
                        back to work? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes. 
                                 MOLLY
                        Great. I’ve been working on the 
                        monologue, I think we have an 
                        opportunity to really say something 
                        here. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m not addressing it. 

                                 MOLLY
                        What?

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m not addressing it. We’ll be 
                        dark this week, then when we come 
                        back on, we won’t mention it, and 
                        then in two months I’ll be gone. 
                        I’m going to finish this season and 
                        end the show. 

                                 MOLLY
                        When did you decide that?!

                                 KATHERINE
                        Not long after I was outed publicly 
                        for being an adulterer. But 
                        hopefully sometime before my 
                        husband officially files for a 
                        divorce? 

                                 MOLLY
                        Why are you doing that? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I think because of my total and 
                        complete humiliation in the eyes of 
                        the American public? The fact that 
                        I’m a national punchline? At first 
                        I thought maybe I was being too 
                        hard on myself. I’m an American 
                        icon, I’ve broken barriers for 
                        women. This past year, I opened up 
                        a little bit about my personality, 
                        showed them I still had it! But you 
                        know the American public. One 
                        little sex scandal that involves me 
                        fucking over a dozen men for more 
                        than two decades. Somehow, they 
                        can’t see past it. Like it doesn’t 
                        matter that I had a Vine star on my 
                        show. 
                                 MOLLY
                        You have an opportunity to 
                        vindicate yourself.

                                 KATHERINE
                        No. 

                                 MOLLY
                        You have to fight this. You are 
                        being demonized and it’s not right. 
                        A man would never have to deal with 
                        this! 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I should be demonized. The flip 
                        side of me saying extolling the 
                        virtues of excellence is that when 
                        you fuck up, you face the 
                        consequences. I fucked up. I don’t 
                        deserve the show. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I think you’re wrong. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        And you have over four months of 
                        experience in television! 

                                 MOLLY
                        You’re ashamed of what you did and 
                        you don’t want to face it. But you 
                        must. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        “I must”? You know what’s 
                        fascinating about people in your 
                        generation? You’re obsessed with 
                        catharsis. It’s so narcissistic. In 
                        fact, catharcissism, you should 
                        call it -- where for some reason, 
                        because you choose to discuss 
                        something publicly, you get 
                        redemption. I’m not going to use 
                        that trick. I owe it to him and I 
                        owe it to me. It’s called having a 
                        backbone. It’s called grit.  

                                 MOLLY
                        You want to talk to me about grit? 
                        I don’t have any friends. I’m not 
                        pretty. I didn’t come from a rich 
                        family or have a man whisk me away 
                        when I was twenty years old and 
                        tell me I was a genius. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MOLLY (CONT'D)
                        And guess what? I’m probably not a 
                        genius! But I’m pretty fucking good 
                        at my job. And this? This show? 
                        This is my life. This is all I 
                        have. So fuck you for giving it up, 
                        because it’s not all about you. If 
                        you give it up, you destroy what I 
                        am living for. You’re selfish and 
                        you’re scared and you’ve deluded 
                        yourself into thinking that that’s 
                        the moral high ground somehow. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Well, you don’t have to worry about 
                        it, because you’re fired.

                                 MOLLY
                        God, you’re such a bitch!

                                 KATHERINE
                        I know! That’s what everyone has 
                        been saying. Why has it taken you 
                        so long to figure it out?

           Molly leaves.

           INT. MOLLY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Molly paces. Calls someone -- we don’t see who.

                                 MOLLY
                        Can you talk?

           INT. MOLLY’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Tom is with Molly in her bedroom. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Thanks for coming here. I didn’t 
                        want to cry in public. 

                                 TOM
                        I’m just happy I’m not the one 
                        making you cry. 

           Molly wells up and sits on the bed. Tom drops his messenger 
           bag on the floor and sits next to her. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Hey, hey. Stop. You’re going to be 
                        fine. 
                                 MOLLY
                        I just got fired after less than a 
                        year of working on the show of my 
                        dreams. Now I have to go back to 
                        Pennsylvania and work in a factory. 

                                 TOM
                        I thought it was chemical plant. 

                                 MOLLY
                            (inconsolable tears)
                        It’s basically the same thing. 

                                 TOM
                        Don’t be silly, you’re not going 
                        back to the plant. You need to keep 
                        working.

                                 MOLLY
                        Who will hire me? I’m such a 
                        fucking loser and I make the worst 
                        first impression on people. 

                                 TOM
                        There is some truth to that, but, 
                        look, go to Los Angeles. 

                                 MOLLY
                        LA?! That place is crazy! Have you 
                        not even heard the song “Midnight 
                        Train To Georgia”? “Hm, LA, proved 
                        too much for the man”!!

                                 TOM
                        You could stay with my parents. 
                        Above our garage in Pasadena. 
                            (then)
                        They already know about you. 

           Tom immediately regrets saying this. Molly takes this in. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh. Probably said terrible things. 

                                 TOM
                        Hey, listen to me. If you can’t 
                        work on this show, you still need 
                        to work. You’re good. I don’t know 
                        how you did it because you were 
                        terrible for a while, but 
                        now...you’re good. And who knows? 
                        Maybe I’ll be joining you there in 
                        a year.  
           Molly considers this. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - MOLLY AND BURDITT’S 
           OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

           Molly packs up her side of the office. Charlie is there. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Where are you going to go? 

           We see Burditt is about to step into the office and overhears 
           this conversation.

                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t know. Maybe LA? Tom’s 
                        parents have a room over a detached 
                        garage? Which is I guess normal 
                        there?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m going to work for Perkins on 
                        his new show. I know him from stand-
                        up and he asked me who the best 
                        writers are, who’s worth keeping, 
                        and I just said me and you.

                                 MOLLY
                        Thanks, but I could never do that.

           Charlie is stung but covers. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t even know why I tried. 

                                 MOLLY
                        And I don’t think you should work 
                        for him, either, Charlie. You know 
                        he sucks. 

           Charlie looks at her long and hard. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        It must get so tiring for you. To 
                        only want things that are 
                        unrequited. 

           He leaves.

                                 BURDITT
                        He’s a dick. 
                                 MINDY
                        Yeah. He’s kind of right, though if 
                        you think about it. 

                                 BURDITT
                        Don’t think about it, then. 
                            (after a moment)
                        I guess this is goodbye, huh? 

           Molly nods. They stand in their empty office.

                                 BURDITT (CONT’D)
                        If I had anything I would give it 
                        to you. 

           She hugs him. 

           MONTAGE OF TIME PASSING

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITERS’ ROOM - DAY

           The writers are back at work (but no Molly). 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Are we going to address this?

                                 BRAD
                        No.

           There is a long silence. 

                                 BRAD (CONT’D)
                        Let’s talk about the monologue. 
                        Senate has that HB2 bathroom stuff--

                                 TOM
                        Brad?

                                 BRAD
                        Yeah. 

                                 TOM
                        It might be a good idea to address 
                        it.

           Some others nods. Brad looks around the room, then gets a 
           steely look in his eyes we have not seen yet. There is a long 
           pause. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Brad? Are you okay? 
                                 BRAD
                        Everyone here thinks I just follow 
                        orders like I’m fucking Eichmann at 
                        the Nuremberg Trials. But I’m not 
                        Eichmann. I’m a producer. I produce 
                        a vision. And the vision I produce 
                        is that brilliant woman who has 
                        given us our entire livelihoods for 
                        the past five, ten, twelve, twenty 
                        years. I don’t not question her 
                        because I’m lazy, or scared of her, 
                        or just don’t give a damn. Guess 
                        what? My wife questions her. My 
                        agent questions her.  America 
                        questions her. But I don’t question 
                        her because I trust her. That’s my 
                        job. And your job is to make her 
                        the funniest fucking version of 
                        herself. So I would stop worrying 
                        about what I need to do and start 
                        doing your fucking job. 

           They take this in, shocked. 

                                 BRAD (CONT’D)
                        So, back to HB2. I think we can do 
                        something with that. 

           They pick up again. 

           INT. BARNES & NOBLE UNION SQUARE - DAY

           Molly stands in the travel section, leafing through a Los 
           Angeles guide book. She is reading a section on Pasadena. She 
           stops and looks around for a second, a little sad, then goes 
           back to reading. 

           TV SCREEN

           Jimmy Kimmel does his monologue: 

                                 JIMMY KIMMEL
                        My competitor, Katherine Newbury, 
                        is in the paper for alleged several 
                        affairs with men. I guess she took 
                        the advice to get the male 
                        demographic to heart. 

           This joke kills. 
           EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT

           Paparazzi follow Nathan from outside of 30 Rock. 

           INT. MOLLY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Priya helps a gloomy Molly pack. 

           INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Katherine sits in bed, in her nightgown. She glances over to 
           the empty side of her bed. She then reaches over to the lamp 
           and turns it off. 

           INT. MOLLY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Molly packs up her room. It’s empty. She leaves and her 
           Tonight poster is still there.

           EXT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - NIGHT

           Paparazzi follow Katherine outside her town car.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - VARIOUS

           We see a passage of time of about a month. It’s not pretty 
           winter anymore. It’s ugly winter. Snowy, dirty, too cold and 
           too dark, all the time. 

           INT. JOAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           In a cozy living room, Walter sits, watching the news: 

                                 LESTER HOLT
                        Tomorrow, the speculation is that 
                        Katherine Newbury will announce her 
                        retirement after weeks of not 
                        commenting on her alleged sex 
                        scandal. This caps off one of the 
                        most interesting seasons in late 
                        night television in recent years. 

           There is a photo of Katherine onscreen. Walter winces. 
           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - WRITERS’ ROOM - SAME 
           TIME

           Katherine comes to the writers’ room. The writers look up, 
           surprised. Katherine sits. 

                                 TOM
                        Do you need help with your speech?

                                 KATHERINE
                        No. 
                            (then)
                        I’m sure you’ve all lined up 
                        something after this. 
                            (then, after a beat)
                        I wanted to say thank you. 

           Katherine looks around the room. The writers are shocked. 
           Then, slowly, tentatively: 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Simmons, Pat. Alex. Lee. Reynolds. 
                        Burditt. 

           They each nod when they hear their name, incredibly 
           surprised. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Charlie... Thomas. And you two went 
                        to college together.
                            (off their nods)
                        You’re best friends.

           They nod.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        And you hate each other.

                          CHARLIE
                                                           TOM
           Yeah. 
                                              Yes. 

                                 KATHERINE
                            (very emotional)
                        How did John Phillips die?

                                 BURDITT
                        Esophageal cancer.

           Katherine begins to tear up. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        He always wore that one t-shirt 
                        that didn’t fit him right. With the 
                        dog on it? 
           Katherine begins to cry. Burditt jumps up and hands her a box 
           of tissues. 

                                 BURDITT
                        It was a Black Dog Nantucket t-
                        shirt. 

           Katherine nods. 

                                 TOM 
                        Don’t worry, you sent flowers to 
                        the funeral. It was really nice.

                                 PAT 
                        John’s family really liked it.

                                 KATHERINE
                        They did? I remember being so hard 
                        on him. 

                                 REYNOLDS 
                        You gave him a job. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        But I wasn’t nice to him. 

                                 TOM
                        We’re not here because you’re nice. 
                        We’re here because you’re good. 

           They sit in a strange, but not unhappy silence. After a 
           moment Katherine gets up and leaves.

           INT. MOLLY’S CAR - NIGHT

           Molly drives in her new, small, completely packed car. She is 
           driving cross-country to LA. Tom’s in his office, on the 
           phone with her. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Holy shit, she cried?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah. I didn’t understand what was 
                        happening at first. 

                                 MOLLY
                        It was probably fake. 

                                 TOM
                        I don’t think it was. 
                                 MOLLY
                        Did anyone notice I was gone? 

                                 TOM
                        Of course. Burditt was extra 
                        grouchy.  

           Molly smiles. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I gotta go, she’s gonna 
                        announce tonight. Are you gonna 
                        watch?

                                 MOLLY
                        No. I’ll be somewhere in the 
                        Ozarks, trying not to get murdered. 
                        Most of this country is basically 
                        backdrop for “In Cold Blood”.  

                                 TOM
                        Molly. I really think you should 
                        watch the show. You worked so hard--

                                 MOLLY
                        Tom, go to work. Talk to you later. 

           He hangs up. Molly takes this in and takes a deep breath.  

           EXT. P.S. 122 - NIGHT

           Katherine sits in the back of her town car. She is asleep, 
           but wakens when the car stops. She looks out the window. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Why are we here?

           INT. P.S. 122 - MOMENTS LATER

           Katherine walks out onto the stage of the theater. It’s empty 
           and the house lights are up. Walter is there, in his chair. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Walter?

                                 WALTER
                        It’s a little theatrical, I know. I 
                        just needed to see you. Someplace 
                        those people weren’t camped out. 

           He gestures out at the empty seats. 
                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t this a funny life we’ve 
                        chosen? That this is what we 
                        sanctify. So much work, so much 
                        sacrifice, for seconds of laughter. 
                        Moments of connection that 
                        disappear so quickly. We want that 
                        connection so badly. 

           Katherine stands, eyes brimming with tears. Weeks of his 
           absence from her life comes out in this moment. She begins 
           sobbing and kneels before him in his chair, embracing him.  

                                 KATHERINE
                        Forgive me. 

           Walter holds her. They sit in a silence for a moment. 

                                 WALTER
                        I am not here as your husband, I am 
                        here as a man who has advised you 
                        your entire adult life. Are you 
                        sure you are making the right 
                        decision? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        If the show ends in one year or 
                        ten, what’s the difference? It will 
                        be over. And what did I leave 
                        behind? No friends, no children, no 
                        husband. 

                                 WALTER
                        Anyone can have those things. You 
                        didn’t want them. You wanted 
                        excellence, which almost no one 
                        gets in their lifetime. You craved 
                        it. You cannot live without it. And 
                        now you have it again. Just make 
                        sure you’re ready to give it up. 

                                 KATHERINE
                            (vulnerable)
                        I don’t know if I’m strong enough 
                        for excellence. 

           Walter kisses her head. 

                                 WALTER
                        Katie, my Katie. 

           They sit on the empty stage in silence. 
           EXT. VARIOUS NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

           The night turns into morning. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - KATHERINE’S DRESSING 
           ROOM - NIGHT

           Tom and Brad go over the monologue with Katherine. There’s a 
           KNOCK at the door. It’s Bonnie. 

                                 BONNIE
                        I hope I’m not interrupting. 

           Katherine nods to Tom and Brad, who sail out of the room, 
           dutifully. Bonnie walks around the room and gestures to the 
           paper in front of Katherine. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Is that the speech?

           There’s a moment. Katherine hands it to her. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes. 

                                 BONNIE
                        I got into this business because I 
                        wanted to make relevant television. 
                        Yes, I know when I say “relevant” 
                        you think I mean “pandering” or 
                        “lowest common denominator” because 
                        I’m stupid and don’t know the 
                        difference. But I do know the 
                        difference. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I need to prepare for my show.  

                                 BONNIE
                        I was nothing more than a fan of 
                        yours, and you pushed me away, 
                        belittled me. Even when I became 
                        your boss. I’ve dreamed of this 
                        day. 
                            (then)
                        Unfortunately, you are relevant 
                        now. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        What are you saying?
                                 BONNIE
                        You have something to say. I was 
                        listening Daniel Perkins on Stern 
                        this morning. He was killing. 
                        Talking about how you’re cougar and 
                        a sex addict. 

                                 KATHERINE
                            (flinty)
                        I don’t have time to defend myself-- 

                                 BONNIE
                        -And I realized I didn’t care what 
                        he was saying about you. I don’t 
                        care about what he’s saying about 
                        anything. I wanted to know your 
                        take. And it’s because you’re the 
                        one that everyone wants to hear 
                        from now. 
                            (then)
                        So, it’s yours. The show is yours 
                        for as long as you hold up your end 
                        of the bargain. Be relevant. Give a 
                        damn. You don’t even have to 
                        respect me. 

           Bonnie hands back the speech and leaves. Katherine sets down 
           her speech on the dressing table, taking this all in. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           We follow Katherine as she walks backstage. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - STAGE - NIGHT

           Katherine walks by Brad and Robin who are by the stage at a 
           monitor, and stops. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Tell them to turn off the 
                        teleprompter.

                                 ROBIN 
                        What?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Turn off the teleprompter. 

                                 BRAD
                            (stunned)
                        Okay.  
           She continues to walk backstage. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Katherine stands by the curtain. She is announced. 

           INT. TONIGHT WITH KATHERINE NEWBURY - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Katherine enters through the curtain. She makes her way to 
           her mic. 

           She stands in front of her audience, as she has done hundreds 
           of times before this, but this time it feels different. The 
           theater is at once dark and blindingly bright light. 

           We FLASH BACK for a moment to the stage in 1980 at the Comedy 
           Store in London when Katherine stood nervously in front of 
           her first real audience. 

           We hear Katherine’s breathing. It’s loud and it is scared. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Thank you. Thank you. What a boring 
                        few weeks it’s been, huh? 

           The crowd laughs and applauds. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Nothing like a public sex scandal 
                        during sweeps, is there? I would 
                        say my employers have never been 
                        happier with me despite that fact 
                        that they are trying to fire me. 
                        Very confusing for them, I bet. My 
                        heart goes out to them. 

           More applause. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Until a few minutes ago, I told 
                        myself I wasn’t going to talk about 
                        this. Why? Because I’m Katherine 
                        Newbury, and to me, my privacy is 
                        sacred. Read any profile of me and 
                        that’s the take-away. “She’s so 
                        very cold. So very English.” 

           The audience does not know what to make of this. 
                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        A month ago, four separate media 
                        reports came out saying I’d cheated 
                        on my husband. And, I will be the 
                        first to admit: it’s true. I’ve 
                        been sleeping with men who are not 
                        my husband. 

           Angle on: 

           Brad by the monitor. 

                                 BRAD
                        Holy shit. 

           Back to Katherine: 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I learned an interesting term this 
                        week, “slut shaming.” Supporters of 
                        me have said that men do this kind 
                        of thing all the time and that this 
                        is a double standard and that I 
                        should hold my head high. Well, 
                        here’s what I think: if a man my 
                        age were doing this it would be 
                        reprehensible, and guess what? I’m 
                        a woman who’s doing it and it is 
                        also reprehensible. And none of 
                        this would even matter if I was not 
                        Katherine Newbury, who is so very 
                        hard on everyone, whose standards 
                        are so high she has defined her 
                        career by it. The truth of the 
                        matter is, my family is my husband. 
                        In fact, he is my everything. So 
                        when this happened, I thought 
                        “Well, I don’t deserve these things 
                        anymore. Him, the show.” But now, 
                        at the ripe old age of 56, I have 
                        learned something else. What I’ve 
                        realized is that even if Daniel 
                        Perkins calls me a slut and a sex 
                        addict on national television, I 
                        still need to do this. It’s not 
                        because I deserve it anymore, it’s 
                        because I need to do it, and I’ll 
                        do it wherever I can. If they keep 
                        me here, I’ll do it here, or I’ll 
                        do it in a ninety-nine seat theater 
                        in the East Village, but I will be 
                        doing it one way or another, 
                        because that’s who I am. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATHERINE (CONT'D)
                        Because it’s not about what you 
                        deserve, it’s about what you need. 
                        I met a young comedian who told me 
                        I needed to talk about this because 
                        people needed to hear me. Maybe 
                        she’s right. But I know one thing: 
                        I need to be heard.

           INT. MOLLY’S CAR - NIGHT

           We see Molly crying as she watches the speech on her phone.

           The audience is on its feet. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Thank you. I hope I earned the 
                        privilege of your time. 

           She sits down at her desk.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES - DAY

           We see various shots of Los Angeles: downtown, Hollywood. 

           INT. SHRINE AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           Molly is at the Emmy Awards with Tom. They are in black tie. 
           She grabs his program. 

                                 TOM
                        Where’s yours?
                                 MOLLY
                        My hands were too sweaty and I made 
                        mine wet. 

           Tom hands her his program and kisses the side of her head. He 
           reacts.  

                                 TOM
                        Wow, you’re sweaty all over. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I shouldn’t have come, this was a 
                        mistake. I thought she didn’t come 
                        to these things!

                                 TOM
                        You’re gonna have to deal with the 
                        fact that you’re gonna run into 
                        her.

           Molly spills her wine on herself. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Dammit. I’m going to the bathroom. 
                        When I come back let’s try to keep 
                        a low profile.

                                 TOM
                        We’re not famous, so I think that 
                        will be very easy. 

           She throws him a look, like “you know what I mean.” He smiles 
           at her. Molly leaves. 

           INT. SHRINE AUDITORIUM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Molly goes to the bathroom to clean up a stain. Katherine 
           comes out from a stall. They look at each other for second, 
           not speaking. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Hi.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Hello.

           There is another long pause. This is Molly’s living 
           nightmare. It’s interrupted by a woman coming into the 
           bathroom and going into a stall. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m sorry I called you a bitch. You 
                        know, the last time I saw you. 
           Katherine moves to the sink next to Molly and turns on the 
           water to wash her hand. She is icy. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I had forgotten. Thank you for 
                        reminding me. 

           That went badly. Katherine moves to get a towel. Molly knows 
           this is one opportunity to ask her this. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Was I the young woman in your 
                        speech?

                                 KATHERINE
                        What? 

                                 MOLLY
                        The young woman in your speech. The 
                        night you said you needed to stay. 
                        You said there was a comedian who 
                        made you think about things 
                        differently.  

                                 KATHERINE
                        I don’t think that was in it.  

                                 MOLLY
                        It was. I have it memorized. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Of course you do. No. The answer is 
                        no. People just make that stuff up. 
                        You have to personalize it or 
                        people don’t care. 

           Molly is disappointed.

                                 MOLLY
                        That makes sense. 
                            (then)
                        I hope you win tonight.

                                 KATHERINE
                        That would be nice.  

           She turns to leave. Then turns back. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Molly?

           Molly turns. 
                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I hope we win tonight.  

           Katherine leaves. Molly looks in the mirror, then smiles, 
           stained dress and all. 

           THE END.
