                               inspired by the work of

          The Gotham Group
           OVER BLACK, WE HEAR: MAJESTIC BELLS of CATHÉDRALE NOTRE-DAME 
           routinely striking the morning hour. 

           And one man’s RASPY VOICE apprehensively counting along:

                                 CLOPIN (OFF)
                        Un. Deux. Trois. Quatre. Cinq. Six.  

           INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT. ÎLE DE LA CITÉ. EARLY MORNING.

           A FINAL BELL resounds before reverberating back into SILENCE.

                                 CLOPIN
                        Sept. 

           CLOPIN TREMBLAY, 40, sits in the dark, fully clothed, pack on 
           his shoulders, prepared for an excursion. 

           A hint of the day’s first sunlight reveals his face: his left 
           eye milky white, half-blind, a large scar on his eyelid. With 
           an unkempt beard, and expression betraying hidden melancholy, 
           a well-worn soul is sketched into his appearance. 

           One final self-motivating breath. And Clopin is out the door. 

           EXT. THE DAMP STREETS OF PARIS. DAY.

           Clopin moves with purpose studying the early-rising PARISIANS 
           milling about. It’s drizzling and depressing, and their faces 
           unapologetically reflect that.

           A bench broadcasts, in French and English: a NATIONAL CURFEW 
           and OUR DUTY TO REPORT SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY AND ILLEGITIMATES.

           SUPER: PARIS, FRANCE - ONE HEARTBREAK AFTER TOMORROW.

           Clopin descends slick stairs to the Métro station, passing a 
           gang of OFFICERS gripping service rifles, warily watching as 
           he shuffles by, hands in pockets.

           France is a police-state. And Paris is its capital. 

           INT. MÉTRO STATION. DAY.

           Eluding the heavy MILITARY PRESENCE, Clopin stealthily breaks 
           into a locked service door, darts down more stairs, and comes 
           upon a concealed track for the HIGH-SPEED INDUSTRIAL-LINE. 

           He approaches a STERN CONDUCTOR, slipping him an envelope of 
           unusual drab currency, and slinks on board the train. 
           INT. GRAFFITIED FREIGHT TRAIN. DAY.

           Clopin forges a makeshift seat, settling in for a long trek. 

                                 CLOPIN (V.O.)
                        My loves, there aren’t many trips 
                        left. The borders are dangerous. I 
                        promised to help beat this system, 
                        but not to die in the fight. 

           He stares out a small window covered in metal mesh, and Paris 
           speeds by. He glances at his watch: the eighth hour of today. 

           And, faintly, EIGHT FAMILIAR CHIMES of Notre Dame’s BELLS.

                                 CLOPIN (V.O.)
                        When I hear the bells, I hear hope. 
                        If only for a new hour. A new day. 
                        Hope changes the world. People kill 
                        because they lose it. Some survive 
                        because they find it.  

           Clopin pulls out a SLEEK ELECTRONIC DEVICE, a large crack on 
           its screen. It easily connects to signal and bursts to life: 

                                 GRINGOIRE
                             (on the device)
                        Bonjour, Paris! Pierre Gringoire at 
                        your service with today’s chatter! 

           ON THE SCREEN: the primped and polished PIERRE GRINGOIRE, 27, 
           his hair almost too perfect, his teeth almost too white. Very 
           clearly the public face and personality for a troubled time. 
           He speaks in a mannered ARISTOCRATIC ACCENT: 

                                 GRINGOIRE (CONT’D) 
                        This morning’s fashion segment is 
                        sponsored by GENEXX. Très chic!

           Clopin recalibrates the frequency, scanning for new channels, 
           yet each one has Gringoire’s all-too-idyllic mug on it.

                                 GRINGOIRE (CONT’D) 
                        GENEXX insemination eliminates the 
                        risk of diseased genes, so parents 
                        can start a healthy, happy family! 
                        Au revoir illegitimate births! The 
                        French future is through GENEXX. 

           Clopin rests the gadget in his lap as he begins to doze off, 
           garnering strength for the journey ahead. Train speeding. 

           As he slips into slumber, his device slips into STATIC. Then, 
           the screen flashes: DISCONNECTED. RECONFIGURING.
           And begins picking up earnest REAL-WORLD NEWS, now outside of 
           France’s media blackout:

                                 NEWSCASTER VOICE
                        ...the Pacific confederation of the 
                        United States will commence an army 
                        draft, the first of its kind since 
                        1972, in effort to regain territory 
                        lost as their border war rages on--

           The train hurtles through armed, wired fences until reaching 
           a DECAYING SUBURB. 

                                 NEWSCASTER VOICE (CONT’D)
                        ...world health officials announced

                        on three continents, infected women 
                        give birth to deformed offspring--

           The romanticism of Paris has quickly evaporated. 

                                 NEWSCASTER VOICE (CONT’D)
                        ...the disbanded E.U. continues its 
                        suspension of migrant processing as 
                        a staggering amount of refugees are 
                        turned around-- 

           Clopin stirs momentarily at REBEL YELLS from YOUNG ANARCHISTS 
           in hoodies, setting BOOKS and the EUROPEAN FLAG on fire. 

           One of many reasons Clopin has grown exhausted with living. 

           Pushing off his device, and through ROARING FLAMES, over the 
           anarchists, we begin moving...

           RAPID-FIRE: away from the train, soaring above France, flying 
           over rooftops, the Eiffel Tower on the Seine in the distance, 
           through the impoverished countryside, over seas, as daylight 
           shifts to dark, across black water, until we stop... 

           LOST IN THE EMERALD EYES OF: a ROMA WOMAN just shy of thirty, 
           dark features, clutching the hand of her daughter, beautiful, 
           a teenager with those same emerald eyes, GUDULE, inside... 

           INT. A REFUGEE DINGHY. NIGHT.

           Gudule huddles beside her MOTHER for warmth, traveling with a 
           dozen REFUGEES, in the close quarters of a small boat shakily 
           parting the dark sea. 

           Gudule’s emerald eyes close, exhaustion weighing on them.

                                 CLOPIN (V.O.)
                        It begins and ends with us gypsies. 
           QUICK CUT: VILLAGES BURN, and ROMA FAMILIES flee as RELIGIOUS 
           EXTREMISTS tear through streets firing off assault rifles and 
           automatic weapons. Unlucky ones left behind are slaughtered. 

                                 CLOPIN (V.O.)
                        Homelands ravaged by civil war. An 
                        end to our freedom. Forcing people 
                        west, and praying for sanctuary.

           QUICK CUT: a GYPSY CHILD lies face down in the dirt.  

                                 CLOPIN (V.O.)
                        Many died. And those who made it to 
                        Europe found persecution waiting. 

           QUICK CUT: Gudule and her mother embrace an OLDER MAN, crying 
           as they’re forced to disassemble their family. 

           BACK IN THE DINGHY, Gudule wakes up from that nightmare, in a 
           panic, and tears, horrified. Her mother whispers gently:

                                 GUDULE’S MOTHER
                        It was only a dream. 

                                 GUDULE
                        I dreamt we did it all over. That 
                        we were being hunted. 

                                 GUDULE’S MOTHER
                        Just a dream.

                                 GUDULE
                        Will it ever get better?

                                 GUDULE’S MOTHER
                        We call one another mother, father, 
                        brother, daughter. They call us --

                                 GUDULE
                        -- gypsies.

                                 GUDULE’S MOTHER
                        But they are no more flesh, blood, 
                        and soul than us, Gudule. They can 
                        take our pride, our homes, but they 
                        cannot take our memories. All those 
                        stories we pass down. Our history. 
                        About the people who loved us. And 
                        when you have a daughter, you will 
                        tell her these stories. About me. 
                        And our people will live -- I will 
                        live -- forever in your hearts. 
           She removes her TRINKET BRACELET fastening it around Gudule’s 
           wrist, kissing her forehead, and sweetly HUMMING.

           EXT. A DARK JETTY. NIGHT.

           Their boat has safely reached shore. Some TRAVELERS hug, cry 
           and curse obscenities across the sea at the land they fled. 

           Our family, Gudule and her mother, are far more pragmatic. 

           They patiently wait for information. 

           LATER THAT NIGHT, smoke billows from fires across the beach. 
           Our refugees are burning all they have to keep flames alive, 
           and themselves warm, until morning. 

           Gudule glances at a photograph of her father, struggles hard 
           with the decision. 

                                 GUDULE’S MOTHER
                        There’s nobody alive to go back to.  

           Gudule tosses the picture into the dwindling flame.

                                 GUDULE’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        We need to move forward. With love. 
                        And with that love we’ll defeat the 
                        people who choose hatred.

           AMONGST THE REFUGEES: ONE MAN messages for their next steps.

           QUICK CUT: PING! A SECOND MAN receives the text, and crafts a 
           response, sitting in his car by a railway somewhere. 

           QUICK CUT: PING! A THIRD MAN, in another country, drinking at 
           a café, is looped into the chain, discloses his location.

           INT. AN ITALIAN HOSTEL. NIGHT.

           QUICK CUT: PING! And a FOURTH MAN, OUR CLOPIN reclined at his 
           hostel, scrolls through the chain of these Guardian Angels on 
           his cracked device. 

                                 CLOPIN (V.O.)
                        We’re driven off by fire and death. 
                        Or kept as slaves. Churches do not 
                        bury our bodies, nor christen our 
                        children. We starve in the streets.

           Clopin begins SPEAKING OUT LOUD now...
                                 CLOPIN
                        I’m dedicated to our cause. To defy 
                        that establishment, so everyone has 
                        freedom for a better life.  

           Clopin holds a CRUMPLED PHOTOGRAPH at his side.

                                 CLOPIN (CONT’D)
                        To live in this world I couldn’t 
                        save you from, my loves... 

           We realize Clopin has been wavering between thoughts in his 
           head and his spoken word, as he speaks down to a PICTURE of 
           his WIFE AND SONS. 

           He recites his self-assuring mantra:

                                 CLOPIN (CONT’D)
                        I need another chance to do good.

           EXT. ITALY. TRAIN STATION. DAY.

           Clopin stands with an ITALIAN COMRADE on a station platform.

                                 THE COMRADE
                             (in Italian)
                        Some skinny fucker tried mugging me 
                        for my passport. Begging to get to 
                        Berlin for his brothers. Refused to 
                        believe when I told him that -- 

                                 CLOPIN
                             (also Italian)
                        Right. There’s nobody left. 

           INT. HIDDEN GYPSY COMMUNE. NIGHT.

           Gudule and her mother share a blanket on a cold, wooden floor 
           of the attic. Gudule is awake staring at the trinket bracelet 
           on her wrist, again listening to her mother:

                                 GUDULE’S MOTHER
                        They say in Paris, there are bells 
                        ringing through the city. The most 
                        beautiful music you will ever hear 
                        in your life. And Roma women are 
                        free to work. To make a life. Fall 
                        in love. Start a family. A world 
                        away from any bloodshed.  

                                 GUDULE
                        I can’t wait to get there, Mamma. 
                                 GUDULE’S MOTHER
                        And I can’t wait to see your face 
                        when you hear the bells, Gudule. 

           A FEW HOURS LATER: Gudule awakes to chaos. ITALIAN POLICEMEN 
           storm their hidden Romani commune. A RAID. Women SCREAM. Men 
           FIGHT. Gypsies are arrested. 

           Children are yanked from the hands of their parents. Gudule’s 
           mother is dragged to her feet by her hair, and removed. 

                                 GUDULE
                        MAMMA!!--

           Gudule is last. She catches eyes with AN OFFICER, who flashes 
           a filthy smirk, while unbuttoning his trousers.  

           THE NEXT DAY: Gudule wakes up, finding herself alone. Crying. 
           Her body in pain, violated, she stares down at the trinket on 
           her wrist. And prays.

           A door CREAKS OPEN revealing CLOPIN, shocked at the mess, and 
           finding Gudule the last refugee left in the ransacked room.  

                                 CLOPIN
                             (in Italian)
                        Come with me, child.

           A communication barrier. Gudule can’t decipher, scared. 

                                 CLOPIN (CONT’D)
                             (in French)
                        Please. Trust me.

           And still nothing.

                                 CLOPIN (CONT’D) 
                        You have to trust me. Please. 

           He extends a hand. Gudule hesitates, but the kindness in his 
           eyes convinces her to accept it. 

           EXT. ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE. DAY.

           A PASSENGER BUS travels through Italy’s lush spring country.

           INT. PASSENGER BUS. ITALY. DAY.

           Gudule sits by Clopin on a long journey. Through windows, she 
           witnesses JAILED ROMANI in forced labor on the fields. Shaved 
           heads, simple frocks, numbers branded on their shirts.  
                                 GUDULE
                             (in Romani)
                        I miss my mother humming. I miss my 
                        grandfather’s laugh.    

           Sadly, to himself, under his breath:

                                 CLOPIN 
                        I’m so sorry I couldn’t save all of 
                        you. I’m only one man.

           INT. COMMUTER TRAIN DEPOT. ITALY. DAY.

           Clopin and Gudule, holding FAKE PASSPORTS trying to blend in, 
           nervously move through a security queue.   

           INT. COMMUTER TRAIN. FRENCH BORDER. DAY.

           OUT THE WINDOW: in the distance Gudule witnesses mass graves. 
           Nameless victims of these conflicts. 

           Then, they pass a graffitied billboard: BIENVENUE À FRANCE! 

           Entering French borders should be idyllic, but bleak sunlight 
           bleaches their sullen afternoon. 

           It’s all so hollow. Echoing Gudule’s now-empty existence.

           EXT. SOME FILTHY ARRONDISSEMENT. PARIS. DAY.

           Clopin escorts Gudule through a maze of alleyways, and into:

           INT. A ROMA BOARDING HOUSE. DAY.

           Gudule is met by a kind FRENCH MATRON. Clopin pays the woman.

           INT. GUDULE’S ROOM. ROMA BOARDING HOUSE. DAY.

           Gudule is shown her room. Teary-eyed, and feigning strength, 
           she pretends to settle in. 

                                 THE MATRON
                             (in French)
                        Do you speak French?

           Another communication barrier. 

                                 THE MATRON (CONT’D)
                        English?
           Gudule still just stares blankly. 

                                 THE MATRON (CONT’D)
                             (in Romani)
                        Learn to speak their languages, or 
                        they’ll make sure you don’t speak 
                        at all. 

           Then, Gudule hears the most beautiful sound in the world -- 

           THE BELLS OF CATHÉDRALE NOTRE-DAME. 

           Moved, she darts outside, ducking down the alleys, to find:

           EXT. CATHÉDRALE NOTRE-DAME DE PARIS. DAY.

           The Notre-Dame Cathedral. Our first glimpse. This sacred spot 
           has barely withstood the test of time. The man-made traces of 
           destruction litter its once pristine facade, although most of 
           its architecture still breathtaking: gargoyles keeping guard, 
           flying buttresses, stained glass. A Gothic icon.

           Every stone of its surface is a page of Parisian history.

           Hearing its CHIMES, Gudule admires her mother’s bracelet, and 
           collects her courage.  

                                 CLOPIN (V.O.)
                        All emotions in the world are heard 
                        in those bells. 

           INT. GUDULE’S ROOM. ROMA BOARDING HOUSE. DAY.

           A NEW DAY: Gudule at her window, listening to HOURLY MUSIC.

                                 CLOPIN (V.O.)
                        They speak for the gypsies. Give us 
                        a voice since we are silenced. The 
                        tolls of life. The reasons to live.  

           ANOTHER DAY: Gudule, with a baby-bump, listens at the window.

           AND ANOTHER DAY: Gudule on her bed, the Matron at her side as 
           she gives birth to HER DAUGHTER.

                                 CLOPIN (V.O.)
                        And the life we create gives us one 
                        more reason. To keep fighting.
           EXT. CATHÉDRALE NOTRE DAME DE PARIS. DAY.

           Gudule sits outside the splendid building cradling a newborn, 
           her gorgeous BABY GIRL, blessed with the same EMERALD EYES.

                                 GUDULE 
                        Agnes. You have your grandmother’s 
                        name. Names, and memories, are the 
                        history we pass down. About people 
                        who loved us. The people who live 
                        forever in our hearts.

           The baby grasps for the trinket bracelet on Gudule’s wrist.

           INT. ROMA BOARDING HOUSE. NIGHT.

           Gudule quietly opens the front door, revealing A STRANGE MAN.

           INT. GUDULE’S ROOM. ROMA BOARDING HOUSE. DAY.

           Gudule writhes in faux-ecstasy in bed with A SECOND STRANGER.

                                 CLOPIN (V.O.)
                        Selling ourselves to build a better 
                        future. Suffering today so there is 
                        none left for tomorrow.

           ANOTHER DAY, with ANOTHER STRANGER. As time goes by, the men 
           have decreased in status and looks. This one finishes, pulls 
           up his jeans, and leaves money near her on the mattress. 

           SOME NOT-SO-SPECIAL DAY: Gudule and a GYPSY MAN tumble on the 
           sheets, atop a tarot reading, growing distracted by the sound 
           of her BABY CRYING. 

           Gudule, fearing the financial duress of losing a client, runs 
           to the closet where her child sleeps. She dangles her trinket 
           bracelet over the crib, leaves it, for the baby’s adoration. 

           It calms the girl. 

           Gudule returns to her suitor. He lends her a GENEROUS SWIG of 
           his flask, and the two fall into bed undressing the other.

           THE NEXT MORNING: Gudule rises with the worst headache of her 
           entire life, hazy. She was drugged. Her door wide open.

           Panicked, Gudule runs to her child’s crib and moves aside the 
           blanket revealing the baby... 

           And the hideous, deformed face of someone else’s child.
           Her baby girl, so rosy and fresh, a gift from Heaven, swapped 
           for some diseased little monster, crippled, and one-eyed. 

           Gudule recoils, uncontrollably weeping. The cruelest crime.

           INT. ROMA BOARDING HOUSE. DAY.

           Gudule stumbles down the stairs into the common room, holding 
           the baby away from her heart, unable to look at it.

                                 GUDULE
                        Who has taken my baby from me?

           She suddenly realizes how little she trusted the GYPSIES that 
           shared the home with her, as they stare at her blankly: faces 
           sun-burnt, silver rings in ears, tattered clothing.  

           EXT. THE DAMP STREETS OF PARIS. DAY.

           Gudule scurries down streets, now maniacally beating her head 
           against her own fist, breathless, disheveled.  

                                 GUDULE
                        My child! My beautiful little girl! 
                        What have you done with her?!  

           People move aside, frightened, as she searches every door, in 
           every window, growing mad. 

           INT. CATHÉDRALE NOTRE-DAME DE PARIS. DAY.

           Gudule, cheeks wet, enters the cathedral, setting the monster 
           infant upon the altar steps.

           Turning, she is startled at the sight of CLAUDE FROLLO, 30’s, 
           the ARCHDEACON. Angular features, though a hint of ambiguous 
           kindness in his eyes masks his scowl.

                                 GUDULE
                        Please don’t report me, sir. 

                                 FROLLO
                        You can’t abandon your child. 

                                 GUDULE
                        But he is not mine. He’s a monster. 

           Frollo catches glimpse of the baby’s deformities.

                                 FROLLO
                        A monster?
                                 GUDULE
                        He’s one of the diseased.

                                 FROLLO
                        You have to hide him, then. They’ll 
                        kill the boy. He’s criminal.

                                 GUDULE
                        But it is not my crime! The gypsies 
                        stole from me. My sweet baby girl.  

                                 FROLLO
                        Have a heart. 

                                 GUDULE
                        I have no heart in my body. 
                             (a final whimper:)
                        They have taken it.

           Gudule flees into the night. 

           Frollo picks up the baby. And though he grimaces at its half-
           formed face, he is inspired by the grace of God to spare him. 
           To secretly adopt him as his own. And he names him: 

                                 FROLLO 
                        Quasimodo.

           EXT. THE DAMP STREETS OF PARIS. NIGHT.

           Gudule stumbles out of the cathedral, sprinting through brisk 
           night, she hears the BELLS CHIME. And pauses. To absorb them. 
           Her only symbol of hope. 

                                 CLOPIN (V.O.)
                        As long as those bells ring we must 
                        not lose our faith that better days 
                        will come for all of us. 

           We flash forward in time: different days, different seasons, 
           Gudule staring up at the cathedral wide-eyed, growing older, 
           wiping away tears, faith fading, but never gone. 

                                 CLOPIN (V.O.)
                        These bells are the songs of life. 
                        Hope. Love. Anger. Defeat. Faith.  

           TITLE: “THE HUNCHBACK”

                                 CLOPIN (V.O.)
                        And heartbreak. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:
           EXT. OPEN-AIR MARKET. A DILAPIDATED GREEK CITY. DAY.

           The remnants of a Mediterranean shopping district. Buildings 
           falling apart. Ground littered with debris. Tents are strewn 
           along the sidewalk. Whether war or natural disaster tore the 
           place apart is anyone’s guess. And yet life goes on.

           SUPER: TWENTY-OR-SO YEARS LATER.

           SOLDIERS WITH GUNS are positioned around this ruined market. 
           The same uniforms from our opening: the men are French, and 
           its military occupies this region. 

           One soldier is a handsome fellow to whom all the women take a 
           liking: CAPTAIN PHOEBUS CROSIER, 35. Large eyes, blonde hair, 
           strong jaw, devastating charm, ego for days.  

           And there’s a beautiful GREEK WOMAN’S hand on his torso: 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Come on just feel. 

                                 GREEK GIRL
                        No!
                             (totally into it:)
                        You’re ridiculous.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Just feel them. 

           Phoebus guides her fingers over his abdomen.

                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D)
                        Through the jacket, right?

           He pulls aside clothing to reveal his well-honed six-pack. 

                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D)
                        I take it by your red cheeks that 
                        you’re impressed?

           Phoebus suddenly senses something is off. The bustling square 
           eerily has FALLEN SILENT. A hair-raising concern. 

           Windows that were prior open have closed. Everybody has left. 
           A SHADOWY MAN stands in a second-story window on the phone. 

                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D)
                             (to the girl)
                        Get behind me.

           He grips his service rifle.

           Phoebus signals down to a SECOND LIEUTENANT.  
                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D)
                        Something’s--

           BOOM! Before he finishes his sentence a PARKED YARIS near the 
           soldier EXPLODES sending shrapnel dicing through the wind and 
           knocking Phoebus back. 

           A hole in the ground under the charred car. No physical sign 
           of that second soldier.  

           The soldiers recalibrate and shoot at the SHADOWY WINDOW MAN. 

           Gunfire is returned. The square chaotic. People running and 
           screaming. Others bleed, crying in pain, over loved ones.

           Instincts kick in. Phoebus dodges bullets. Repositions. Gets 
           his shot. And PELTS the window man between the eyes. 

           BOOM! A second VEHICLE EXPLODES further down the street. More 
           bullets erupt from other windows, showering the soldiers. 

           This is a coordinated attack. 

                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D)
                             (to panicked locals)
                        Off the road - OFF THE ROAD -- 

           BOOM! A third EXPLOSION sends Phoebus hurtling to the ground 
           so quickly he can’t trace the source. Skin burnt. Shattered 
           femur. Leg mangled and horrific to look at. 

           He closes his eyes, wishing he could wake up from this:

           INT. PHOEBUS’ APARTMENT. MORNING.

           And he does. Phoebus jolts upright from his nightmare, sweat 
           mixing with tears. Eyes haunted. A textbook case of PTSD.  

           His vision blinks back into focus. His ears stop ringing. He 
           angles his head at his PHONE ALARM BLARING. 

           Phoebus reaches for anxiety medication. Chases the pill with 
           a sip of beer his drunk-self left out for his hungover-self.

           His morning routine begins. 

           MOMENTS LATER: Phoebus pivots himself to step out of bed. His 
           left foot rests on the tile floor. His right foot does not.

           Phoebus pulls a device from under the bed that straps tightly 
           above his right knee. 

           And with it, he stands. 
           EXT. THE STREETS OF PARIS. DAY.

           Phoebus weaves through pedestrian traffic, a confident walk. 
           His red eyes locked ahead of him in a distant gaze, avoiding 
           any human connection until his lips touch caffeine. 

           Walls and bus terminals are plastered with PROPAGANDA POSTERS 
           of French children with bruised, dirty faces standing amongst 
           dead bodies and smoldered buildings: SAVE OUR FUTURE.  

           Phoebus struts by a newsstand, lined wall-to-wall with A BOOK 
           bearing Claude Frollo’s ANGULAR FACE on its cover: MY LEGACY. 
           Since we last saw him, Frollo has become a public figure. 

           Most PARISIANS sneer at his portrait on the book jacket. Some 
           man spits at the cover. Another puts out his cigarette on it. 

           Clearly, Claude Frollo is only liked in certain circles.   

           INT. A CHIC CAFÉ. DAY.

           Phoebus squeezes through a SMALL CROWD that gathered to watch 
           a LARGE TELEVISION hung above the register. Phoebus routinely 
           exchanges money for a large cup of coffee. 

           ON THE SCREEN: is media personality PIERRE GRINGOIRE, now 52. 
           We remember him from our opening. Time has been very kind to 
           him, hardly aged, thick hair now gray. A total silver-fox. 

           He still speaks in that AFFECTED ARISTOCRATIC ACCENT: 

                                 GRINGOIRE 
                        You went from Archdeacon to one of 
                        the single most prominent political 
                        figures of modern French history. 

           Gringoire is interviewing CLAUDE FROLLO, now 55, and France’s 
           MINISTER OF JUSTICE. That ambiguous kindness in his eyes lost 
           over the past two decades. The pair sits comfortably in a...

           WARM, NEWS STUDIO: Gringoire excitedly displaying a hardcover 
           copy of FROLLO’S BOOK.

                                 GRINGOIRE (CONT’D)
                        Your new autobiography, MY LEGACY, 
                        chronicles your fascinating career, 
                        but doesn’t shy from those personal 
                        tragedies you faced. 

                                 FROLLO
                        Indeed. My parents were murdered in 
                        the Marais bombing. My brother died 
                        last spring.
                                 GRINGOIRE
                        Just awful.

                                 FROLLO
                        So you can imagine, I have a deep, 
                        personal commitment to the safety 
                        of this country. 

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        And, as such, your legacy launched.  

                                 FROLLO
                        I never aspired for the public life 
                        of a politician. It found me.

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        Claude Frollo. ‘The Chosen One?’

                                 FROLLO
                        When I published my first book, the 
                        people hoisted me into a spotlight. 
                        I was a voice they wanted to hear. 
                        A voice with power to change minds, 
                        and the Prime Minister recognized 
                        that. So I realized it was my duty. 
                        I was placed on this earth to serve 
                        our country. To protect its values. 
                        France belongs to the French. It’s 
                        a pretty, simple concept to me. Why 
                        should we put our families at risk? 
                        I invested the greater part of my 
                        life building this movement. It’s 
                        what the people want.

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        One might argue some of the people, 
                        at least. 

                                 FROLLO
                        Half is all you really need. That’s 
                        how the game is played.  

           BACK IN THE CAFÉ: Phoebus shakes his head, speaking aloud to 
           nobody in particular:

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Snarky bastard.

                                 SOME WAITRESS NEARBY
                        I hate him. But I think he’s kind 
                        of hot, you know?

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Small talk’s really not necessary.
           EXT. NOTRE DAME. DAY.

           Phoebus approaches NOTRE DAME. The military presence stronger 
           than ever. Doors to the cathedral are retrofitted with steel. 
           He flashes credentials. GUARDS respectfully let him pass. 

           INT. NOTRE DAME. DAY.

           The iconic cathedral is used as a WAR ROOM, but the beauty of 
           the church is still breathtaking. The vivid colors of stained 
           glass windows, candelabras, magnificent vaulted ceilings.  

           Phoebus finds our Claude Frollo amidst a busy work afternoon, 
           but he halts the agenda to greet him. Phoebus turns on a fake 
           smile. Uses sarcasm and charm as a disarmer.  

                                 FROLLO
                        Captain Phoebus Crosier. Pleasure.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Fabulous offices you got here! They 
                        came with that fancy title?

                                 FROLLO
                        As Minister of Justice, the Prime 
                        Minister felt I should continue...

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Working from home?

                                 FROLLO
                        Where I was most inspired.
                             (a smirk:)
                        A war hero with personality.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        You’ll get sick of stroking my ego 
                        soon enough.

                                 FROLLO
                        Sooner than you might expect.

           Phoebus follows Frollo as they walk upstairs to his office:

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        You have done truly incredible work 
                        leading our city guard.  

                                 PHOEBUS
                        With my medical discharge it’s been 
                        mainly a paperwork position. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PHOEBUS (CONT'D)
                        But as long as it’s simple, mostly 
                        small words, couple boxes to check, 
                        yes, no, maybe, some doodles in the 
                        margins, and I’ll get by fine.

                                 FROLLO
                        Thank you for your service. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Don’t thank me yet. I’ve seen every 
                        side of humanity on the front and 
                        have yet to see a side I like. 

                                 FROLLO
                        You see what people are made of. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        It’s never what you would hope.  

           REACHING FROLLO’S OFFICE, the conversation continues: 

                                 FROLLO
                        I wanted to meet face-to-face since 
                        the Festival begins tonight, and I 
                        cannot stress how important it is 
                        that your men monitor and report, 
                        Captain. France is on the verge of 
                        greatness, and we cannot afford any 
                        fantasy of revolution --

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Revolution?

                                 FROLLO
                        -- from the illegals -- 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        The gypsies? I personally just call 
                        them scapegoats.

                                 FROLLO
                        Any anti-political dissent must be 
                        pursued and punished.  

                                 PHOEBUS
                        With respect, sir, refugees barely 
                        speak the same languages let alone 
                        conspire. And classifying them all 
                        gypsies doesn’t help identify which 
                        culture to surveil. Plus it’s a bit 
                        insulting, I mean, at the gym last 
                        week some Spaniard called me Welsh.
                             (dryly)
                        So I called him an ambulance.
                                 FROLLO
                        They invited themselves in and it’s 
                        time to weed them out. If we lead, 
                        Europe will follow. The borders are 
                        closed now so our nationalism is on 
                        the line. Anyone without paperwork 
                        should be deported or jailed.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Paris already is an open-air jail. 

                                 FROLLO
                        In fifty years those of us who have 
                        known Paris any differently will be 
                        gone. That’s what we do. We die but 
                        life keeps on. Children don’t think 
                        the world’s falling apart. It’s the 
                        only world they are born knowing.

           Phoebus bites his tongue.

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        That’s all, Captain. 

           Lost for words, Phoebus bows his head politely and exits.

           STARING OUT THE WINDOW: Frollo spies a governmental billboard 
           littered with graffiti, in LARGE RED LETTERS: SANCTUARY.  

           Frollo fumes at its sight. Revolution is his growing concern.

                                 JEHAN (O.S.)
                        Claude, it’s just once a year.

           Frollo turns to see his younger brother JEHAN, 30, miscreant, 
           gluttonous, charming, and wild. Everything Frollo is not.  

                                 JEHAN (CONT’D)
                        The Festival happens once a year, 
                        you can’t ask me to sit it out.

                                 FROLLO
                        I plan to feast on civility, Jehan. 

                                 JEHAN
                        While I feast on wine and women. 

                                 FROLLO
                        That diet will kill you someday.

                                 JEHAN
                        Our parents died from much less. We 
                        owe ourselves our right to the only 
                        days of sin. It’s liberating. 
                                 FROLLO
                        Authorizing forty-eight hours of 
                        vile debauchery does not free us 
                        from God’s judgment.

                                 JEHAN
                        Religion was invented to keep the 
                        simple-minded in line. Look around. 
                        Any god forgot we were here. Might 
                        be why this world is shit. Without 
                        sin the devil doesn’t have release 
                        other than total destruction.  

                                 FROLLO
                        If we can’t fix the world, then it 
                        is God's fault for not making man 
                        and devil of equal strength. We’re 
                        on high alert and I forbid you --

                                 JEHAN
                        It’s my right as a citizen -- 

                                 FROLLO
                        Then I’m begging you, Jehan, please 
                        not this year. 

           Frollo stands, stern and annoyed:

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        If you’ll excuse me --

           But Jehan has already gone, seemingly vanished. 

           INT. THE BELLTOWER. NOTRE DAME. DAY. 

           Frollo ascends the extensive spiral staircase to the tower. 

           INT. THE BELLCHAMBER. NOTRE DAME. DAY.

           Frollo unlocks the door and enters the chamber, warmly lit by 
           the sun. He finds QUASIMODO sitting cross-legged, his back to 
           us. Grotesquely hunched. He needs very little introduction. 

           The infant from our opening is now twenty-five. And Frollo is 
           two-and-a-half decades more senior. 

           One grew older. The other grew old. 

           A tray of food sits on a ledge by the door, untouched. 

                                 FROLLO
                        Quasimodo. You need to eat.
           But Quasimodo doesn’t see, consumed with his PAD OF PAPER and 
           CHARCOAL PENCILS, passionately drawing. 

           Frollo glances around, admiring the CHARCOAL SKETCHES hanging 
           from the beams: portraits of the bells, the gargoyles, bird’s 
           eye views of Paris, its citizens, Frollo and Jehan.

           Notre Dame is Quasimodo’s entire world, his sanctuary, hidden 
           away from intolerance. His existence etched across the Gothic 
           architecture. And now, quite literally, it is sketched. 

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        Your artwork has become quite good. 

           Frollo steps closer, eyeing what Quasimodo draws in his lap: 
           his self-portrait. A wildly deformed monster. Scorned with a 
           forlorn, ashamed expression trapped on his face.  

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        Quasimodo. 

           Quasimodo turns. Our first look. Not an exaggerated malformed 
           young man like the picture but still: hunchbacked, ugly, sad.

           Yet despite his over-pronounced brow we can see his eyes. His 
           kind eyes. The windows to his soul. And that’s all we need to 
           see he is capable of beauty. An inner purity radiates.  

                                 QUASIMODO
                             (garbled)
                        I felt your footsteps. 

           The moment he opens his mouth, we sense that he communicates 
           differently. His tongue is stiff and awkward, like a door on 
           rusty hinges as he speaks. He is mostly deaf.  

           Quasimodo lost much of his hearing due to his bells. One more 
           door his existence left open for him now closed forever as he 
           plunges further into internal darkness.   

                                 FROLLO
                        Can you see my lips?

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Yes. 

                                 FROLLO
                        Why are you drawing those pictures? 
                        I told you not to think of yourself 
                        that way. 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        They’re not of me. They’re just of 
                        my friend, Emmanuel. 
           Quasimodo rushes up to the biggest bell: EMMANUEL.

                                 QUASIMODO (CONT’D)
                        It’s who she is when I’m with her. 

           He smiles into the bell, a distorted reflection smiling back. 

                                 FROLLO
                        Do you know what tonight is?

                                 QUASIMODO
                        The Festival. Emmanuel and I talked 
                        all day. At five I ring her for the 
                        holiday. 

           A nervous beat as Quasimodo rings his hands. 

                                 QUASIMODO (CONT’D)
                        And you’re going?

                                 FROLLO
                        It’s my job, but I don’t enjoy it.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Then I should go this year also. To 
                        look after you. 

                                 FROLLO
                        It’s far too dangerous for you out 
                        there. Everything is legal at that 
                        festival. You don’t know what man 
                        is truly capable of until they let 
                        their inner-beast free. 

           Quasimodo struggles to understand Frollo. Or perhaps he’s too 
           anxious. He attempts to SIGN WITH HIS HANDS to better express 
           himself, but Frollo SMACKS his wrists. 

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        With words! I taught you to speak. 
                        And write, and read, the languages 
                        that are the law of our country.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        But Jehan taught me my hands are 
                        able to--

                                 FROLLO
                        Jehan isn’t here. You said you see 
                        my lips? Read them then. 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Yes, sir.
                                 FROLLO
                        When our guards and servants notice 
                        you do they not run away? These are 
                        the people at the Festival. And the 
                        people are hateful.   

                                 QUASIMODO
                        But I need to protect you. I should 
                        have protected Jehan. If I disguise 
                        myself, nobody will see my face. 

           Frollo loses his temper and SLAMS his hands down on the table 
           HARD. Quasimodo shamefully lowers his head. 

                                 FROLLO
                        The world won’t understand you. God 
                        cursed women with deformed children 
                        as a penance for our sins. The cost 
                        of globalization: viruses on every 
                        continent, tearing humanity apart. 
                        And you scare them. You remind them 
                        what’s outside our borders. A world 
                        we keep out so we’re safe in here.  

           Frollo picks up Quasimodo’s chin, encouraging. 

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        And you are safe in here. This is 
                        your home.  

                                 QUASIMODO 
                        I’d be lonely if something happened 
                        to you. If I lost you --

           Quasimodo lulls. His attention is now pulled to the commotion 
           outside: EXCITED PEOPLE traveling in packs, dressed in garish 
           attire, metallic chic, for the annual festival. 

                                 FROLLO
                        You are inherently good because you 
                        haven’t been corrupted by them. I 
                        protected you from this evil world. 
                        In their eyes you are illegitimate. 
                        You are illegal. Refugees. Muslims. 
                        Homosexuals. And the diseased. They 
                        must be kept off of these streets. 
                        France is stronger with perfection. 

           He pivots Quasimodo’s face so he can see him say...

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        You will never lose me, Quasimodo.
           As Frollo exits, Quasimodo turns back to Emmanuel and studies 
           his reflection again, contemplating something.

           EXT. NOTRE DAME. DAY.

           Frollo leaves, flanked by BODYGUARDS. A public figure in such 
           desolate times gets an infantry on taxpayers’ dimes. His gang 
           ducks into a caravan of UNMARKED TOWN CARS. 

           ABOVE THE CARAVAN: a FIGURE spies from the cathedral rooftop. 

           It is our Quasimodo, misty-eyed, concerned and anxious. 

           INT. THE BELLCHAMBER. NOTRE DAME. DAY.

           The clock hits five and after a pre-programed ELECTRONIC BELL 
           SYMPHONY, Quasimodo thrusts his weight behind Emmanuel’s rope 
           to rhythmically RING HER CHIMES. 

           Overjoyed and SIGNING TO HER with his hands, she reverberates 
           back into SILENCE:

                                 QUASIMODO
                             (overjoyed)
                        Thank you, Emmanuel. Beautiful! 

           He spots his sketches of Jehan and Frollo. A final incentive.

           EXT. THE STREETS OF PARIS. NIGHT.

           Concealed in a cloak, Quasimodo moves through the streets. He 
           closely trails TWO YOUNG MARRIED COUPLES, holding hands, they 
           laugh and chat, ecstatic, dressed in bright festival garb. 

           INT. MÉTRO. NIGHT.

           On the train, ELECTRONIC BILLBOARDS flash government warnings 
           of TERRORISM and ILLEGALS BREEDING ILLEGITIMATES. 

           Quasimodo lurks near those two young couples in a crowded car 
           of Parisian FESTIVAL GOERS.   

                                 WIFE
                        He wants a kid, but a society where 
                        we can only have a baby by draining 
                        our savings to manufacture it isn’t 
                        a society to raise one in.
                                 HUSBAND
                        Well if our option is fake baby or 
                        no baby at all, I pick fake baby. 

                                 WIFE
                        God’s telling us to stop trying. I 
                        am not a test tube.  

           EXT. FESTIVAL GATES. NIGHT.

           As the Métro doors open, people exit directly into a station 
           on sand dunes, at the lip of the festival’s entrance. 

           Quasimodo follows the two young couples out, entering a crowd 
           shuffling through METAL DETECTORS and past MILITARY PERSONNEL 
           cradling service rifles. 

           An intoxicating POUNDING BASS of LIVE MUSIC is faintly heard. 

           This is the FESTIVAL OF FOOLS.

           EXT. FESTIVAL OF FOOLS. NIGHT.

           Quasimodo follows the young couples through security and into 
           the festival where TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE flood the dry, 
           pebble beaches bordered by barbed-wire fences.  

           The young couples un-link hands with their significant others 
           and coyly swap partners. The men head off together. The women 
           share a kiss, lace fingers, and strut the opposite direction. 

           The festival does not reflect our time. It is in fact, almost 
           a reversion back to a raw, primitive state. 

           If the world came to an end these are the survivors. Creating 
           a new community. Rules of society changed. There are no laws. 
           The tight bonds of society shattered to expose the bleak side 
           of existence we long forgot about. 

           Disconnecting from the civilization they were born into, this 
           new populace is built. Real estate is carved into sand. Tents 
           erected as small businesses: tarot readings, fortune tellers, 
           tattoo parlors, brothels, bathhouses, drug dispensaries. 

           All pleasures are now legal.  

           But only for these two days. 

           On sensory overload, Quasimodo gets a startling look at these 
           eclectic people. Many nude. Others wear avant-garde dystopian 
           fashions. Some are costumed: Women in bikinis with gas masks. 
           Men in singed shorts and Gladiator helmets.  
           Meanwhile, peaceful protests surround the fun: GYPSIES parade 
           with muzzles over their mouths, symbolically displaying their 
           forced silence by the government.

           Elsewhere, YOUNG PARISIANS “play dead” in a Die-In, as twelve 
           naked bodies, painted blue, form a circle with their heads at 
           the center, yellow stars on chests, littered with fake bullet 
           holes and blood. A morbid depiction of the EUROPEAN FLAG. 

           Quasimodo gets lost in the disorienting fun of it all, caught 
           in a throng of people, dancing and laughing. Connecting. 

           Quasimodo feels the GROUND VIBRATE. The PULSATING BASS of the 
           music moves his feet. 

           He looks up into the large...

           LCD SCREEN: finding the too idyllic face of PIERRE GRINGOIRE. 
           Primped and polished, his hair almost too perfect, his teeth 
           almost too white, he is still the face for troubled times.  

           Dozens of these WIDE ELECTRONIC SCREENS line the perimeter of 
           the festival so everybody has a vantage point. 

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        Paris, je t'aime! Pierre Gringoire 
                        at your service with the latest 
                        chatter: that tonight is for you!

           The heavily intoxicated crowd around Quasimodo CHEERS WILDLY. 

                                 GRINGOIRE (CONT’D)
                        This weekend any pleasure is legal. 
                        Your vices. Your dreams. Ton amour!  
                        We thank you for behaving during 
                        the governing year.  

           Gringoire’s suspenders hug his bald chiseled torso as topless 
           CAN-CAN DANCERS begin their risqué routine beside him while a 
           grimy PUNK BAND strums instruments. 

           Quasimodo scurries between the stages featuring local ARTISTS 
           and MUSICIANS. 

           One stage has a marionette performance of a WOMAN DRESSED AS 
           HITLER dangling a puppet-inspired CLAUDE FROLLO on strings. 

           The sight is hard for Quasimodo to watch, but reminds him to 
           resume his search to protect his Master.

           NOT FAR OFF: it is equally hard for our real FROLLO to watch, 
           escorted through civilians by PHOEBUS and his BODYGUARDS.

           Festival attendees HISS and BOO while Frollo is paraded by. 
           Frollo spies a tent where VAGRANT ADDICTS shoot heroin. 

           CLOSE ON: FROLLO’S EYES as we see from his perspective --

           FLASHBACK... ONE YEAR PRIOR, Jehan struts into Frollo’s Notre 
           Dame office. This scene that we witnessed moments earlier was 
           actually just a memory replayed (again) in Frollo’s head:

                                 JEHAN
                        It’s my right as a citizen -- 

                                 FROLLO
                        Then I’m begging you, Jehan, please 
                        not this year. 

           QUICK CUT... Jehan partakes in an orgy with gypsies, smoking, 
           shooting up, a blend of Woodstock and witchcraft. 

           Suddenly, he clutches his chest, convulsing rapidly, foaming. 
           His oversized drug-addled heart finally giving out for good. 

           One GYPSY WOMAN rushes to help Jehan, crying for assistance.

           QUICK CUT... Frollo is helpless as his brother’s limp, dead, 
           body is carried out of the festival by apathetic officers. 

           SMASH BACK TO: our reality. And Frollo snaps out of it --

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Everything alright, sir?

                                 FROLLO
                        This place is filled with pests. 
                        Too many bad memories. 

           Frollo swallows the ghosts of his imagination. 

           That living nightmare he’s doomed to remember forever. 

           BACK TO QUASIMODO: still searching for Frollo among the faces 
           in the crowd, when he notices:

           ESMERALDA, 25, a gorgeous, raven-haired, olive-skinned beauty 
           with PIERCING EMERALD EYES, mesmerizing and confident.  

           The one-and-only. She dances with her TAMBOURINE, on a raised 
           platform allowing her clear sight lines to the entire arena.

           Ogling her body, the MEN around her throw money at the stage. 
           Their jealous WOMEN, on the other hand, make barbed comments, 
           scathing racial remarks, and spit.

           But Esmeralda’s attention seems to be focused elsewhere...
           ON PHOEBUS: who doesn’t let it go unnoticed that she noticed 
           him standing guard. The sight of her stirs something inside. 
           A familiar smile. He offers a smug tip of his hat. 

           Both Quasimodo and Phoebus stare at Esmeralda, smitten.  

           And ANOTHER GUARD, OLIVIER, 30, Phoebus’ closest friend and 
           confidante, moves beside him, also gawking, jaw-dropped:

                                 OLIVIER
                        I’d love to get into trouble with 
                        that one. 

                                 PHOEBUS  
                        When you’re on my clock, let’s keep 
                        your pants zipped, Olivier. Already 
                        have one snake to worry about, and 
                        his name’s Claude Frollo.  

                                 OLIVIER
                        Well done!  

           The two share a laugh, continuing along with Frollo’s rank.

           BACK ON THE SCREENS: Frollo steps on stage next to Gringoire, 
           flanked by the officers. The MUSIC CEASES. 

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, it’s time to 
                        crown the Pope of Fools! Presiding 
                        over the coronation, let’s hear it 
                        for our Minister of Justice!

           A less than enthusiastic response of hands. 

                                 FROLLO
                        Your sacrifice doesn’t go unnoticed 
                        by me, or your government, and with 
                        that sacrifice and your patience we 
                        are able to build a better France. 
                        Restore France to the great country 
                        it once was. Our world can be ugly. 
                        But France is beautiful. And it is 
                        with my great honor that you help 
                        us crown the next Pope of Fools. 

           Quasimodo pushes through the crowd, drawing nearer to Frollo.

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        Bear your ugliest expression, your 
                        foulest mask, wear the hideousness 
                        of sin on your skin so that we all 
                        remember, for one more year, why we 
                        must live without it -- 
           THE CAMERAS CUT TO: Pierre Gringoire moving through the mass 
           of patrons surrounding the stage. 

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        Our contest begins! Who can repulse 
                        us enough for the title?

           Flirting with a cute, but totally UNDERAGE GIRL, who scowls:

                                 GRINGOIRE (CONT’D)
                        Ugly faces need only apply. But you 
                        can find me after the contest. Just 
                        don’t tell my wife.

           He kisses her on the cheek. The crowd LAUGHS. 

           The festival’s extensive CAMERA CREW moves like a well-oiled 
           machine, and Quasimodo gets caught in the middle. 

           MEN and WOMEN line up with their lurid costumes, and homemade 
           masks, as Gringoire travels the line pulling off their cloaks 
           to reveal intricate designs of their faux-faces, broadcast on 
           those large screens. 

           Quasimodo, confused, claustrophobic, can’t get himself out of 
           their way. 

                                 GRINGOIRE (CONT’D)
                             (revealing one mask:)
                        Horrifying! Well done.
                             (and the next:)
                        Reminds me of my mother-in-law’s 
                        plastic surgery. Poor thing.
                             (onto another:)
                        And you: my father-in-law. 

           Finally, Gringoire reaches Quasimodo, pulls off his hood, and 
           reveals to the crowd: his horrific, fleshy, mangled face.

           A MURMUR OF SHOCK echoes along the festival as he’s displayed 
           on each electronic screen of the amphitheater. 

           The FESTIVAL GOERS back away in horror, keeping at a distance 
           forming a circle. 

           Even Gringoire is frightened at first, stepping to the side. 

           BACK ON THE STAGE: Frollo sees Quasimodo on the screens. Then 
           in the crowd. He silently seethes. Phoebus smirks widely. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        That’s certainly a face you’d wanna 
                        be drunk to stare at.
           ELSEWHERE, Esmeralda studies Quasimodo, an empathy behind her 
           gaze, yet wheels actively turning in her head. 

           BACK ON QUASIMODO, Gringoire apprehensively steps forward to 
           him again, holding out the POPE OF FOOLS CROWN.

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        Do you have a name?

           WE FADE INTO QUASIMODO’S POV: briefly, the festival’s SOUNDS 
           become MUTED as Gringoire attempts to interact with him. 

                                 GRINGOIRE (CONT’D)
                        (Can you speak?)

           BACK TO THE CAMERAS, Quasimodo, scared, does not respond. 

                                 GRINGOIRE (CONT’D)
                        Paris, we are here to mock the vile 
                        face of the world and I don’t think 
                        we’ll find anyone else’s face quite 
                        as -- unique. This is the rarest 
                        ugliness any of us have beheld in 
                        our born days. And the boy deserves 
                        to be our Pope of Fools! 

           Gringoire places the crown on Quasimodo, but, disoriented, he 
           aggressively LASHES OUT at Gringoire. Startling the crowd.

                                 MAN IN CROWD
                        He’s a monster! Arrest him!

                                 WOMAN IN CROWD
                        The devil himself. 

                                 ANOTHER WOMAN
                        Let all pregnant women beware!

                                 ANOTHER MAN
                        As wicked as he is ugly.  

           ANOTHER QUICK FLASH TO QUASIMODO’S POV: their SHOUTS fade in 
           and out. Truly frightening for one whose world is silent, to 
           be suddenly ambushed. 

           The men move in with rope, tackling him, stripping off parts 
           of his clothing, trying to tie him down. Quasimodo, startled 
           and fearful, becomes hostile. He grows savage. 

           The faces we earlier saw celebrating life, love, and ecstasy, 
           are now the faces of anger, rage, and hate. 

           How quickly we can turn on each other.  
           And, sickeningly enough, they’re proud of what they tap into.  
           Quasimodo looks out onto a whirlpool of faces laughing at him 
           and giddily smiling, having fun. 

           They succeed in tying him down. Quasimodo YELLS, foams at the 
           mouth, bites them. Though he’s not usually violent, his face, 
           ugly enough as it is, is even uglier with the flavor of rage. 

           Quasimodo looks up to Frollo on the arena stage: 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Master --

           But Frollo turns his back on him, walking off with his guard.

                                 FROLLO
                        More than enough excitement for one 
                        day. Take me back.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        We should stop this cruelty before 
                        it gets out of hand.

                                 FROLLO
                        No. There is a lesson to be learned 
                        here. For everyone. Your guard will 
                        bring this monster boy to me in the 
                        morning. I will handle him. 

           ON THE SCREENS: Quasimodo, failing to break free of the ropes 
           that bind him, is showered with stones and garbage. 

           The festival cameras PUSH IN on his teary, pleading face:

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Forgive me!! --  

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           LATER THAT NIGHT: Quasimodo is still tied, left in the cold, 
           covered in piles of trash. Crowds around him have parted. 

           He WHIMPERS, a heartbreaking, exhausted cry. He looks around 
           for somebody to free him. Most people are asleep now. Others 
           off in the distance still party, but ignore him. 

           Suddenly, Esmeralda appears, tilting a canteen of water into 
           his mouth. He ravenously drinks. 

           She raises her fingers to her lips:

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Don’t make a sound. And don’t be 
                        scared. I’m your friend. 
           In a matter of seconds Quasimodo is released from his ropes.

           And a BURLAP SACK thrown over his head.

           THROUGH THE DARKNESS: we can hear WHISPERED VOICES:

                                 CLOPIN (OFF)
                        We’ll drop him off in the suburbs. 

                                 ESMERALDA (OFF)
                        He’s harmless. 

                                 CLOPIN (OFF)
                        Everyone is until they’re not.  

           The BURLAP SACK is YANKED off of Quasimodo’s head. 

                                 CLOPIN (OFF) (CONT’D)
                        I said no! 

           INT. CLOPIN’S RICKETY JEEP. NIGHT.

           Quasimodo squints to refocus sight on his captors. Perched in 
           the back of a jeep, he glances out at sand dunes speeding by. 
           Festival lights growing distant behind them.  

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I promise you he’s not dangerous.  

                                 CLOPIN
                        Let’s leave him. Treat him with the 
                        kindness we’ve been given. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        He’s a disabled young man. You used 
                        to stand for more than that. 

           The CLOPIN from our prologue, half-blind, his left eye milky 
           white, scar on his eyelid, is now 65, with a full gray beard, 
           and drained, hardened expression. He steers the vehicle.

           Quasimodo WHIMPERS. Esmeralda lovingly touches his hand.  

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry for what happened.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        I have to go back for my Master.

           Esmeralda is surprised by the sound of his speech noticing he 
           strains to study her lips. 
                                 ESMERALDA
                        Clopin, give us light so he can see 
                        my face.  

           Clopin flicks on the dash brights. 

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        Can you understand me now?

           Quasimodo nods. His breath flees him at the sight of her face 
           illuminated, beautiful, almost an angelic halo. The prettiest 
           thing he has ever seen. 

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        You read lips but cannot hear?  

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Not well. The bells took my ears.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Bells?

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Notre Dame. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        That’s your home?  

                                 CLOPIN
                        The Minister's pet. So it’s true? I 
                        imagined that was all myth.

           Intrigued, Esmeralda delicately wipes Quasimodo’s tears.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I’m Esmeralda. What’s your name? 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Quasimodo.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        That means ‘partly-made.’

                                 CLOPIN
                        Fucked up. Witty, though.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Do you know how important you are?

           Quasimodo honestly doesn’t, shakes his head, frazzled.

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        Quasimodo, you can save us. You can 
                        save all of France.
           EXT. DECAYING SUBURB. GAS STATION. NIGHT.

           Quasimodo remains in the jeep, cloaked, as Clopin pumps gas. 
           Nearby, Esmeralda argues with her surrogate father, pacing, 
           displaying her rebellious passion --  

                                 ESMERALDA
                        History repeats. We’ll be ambushed, 
                        jailed, murdered. You just want to 
                        wait in the shadows?

                                 CLOPIN
                        I promised to beat this system, but 
                        not to die in the fight. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Exactly why we need him. Ten years 
                        ago assaulting a gypsy was a major 
                        offense. And now it’s a pastime. 
                        We’ve been waiting for our symbol. 
                        And he found us. 

                                 CLOPIN
                        It’s not the moment we planned.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Clopin, you’ve saved so many lives. 
                        Show them the establishment has fed 
                        them lies. Fueling their panic of 
                        illegitimates, yet raising them as 
                        family behind closed doors. 

           Clopin holsters the gas-pump, more resolute:

                                 CLOPIN
                        Thousands of people saw his face. 
                        They’re going to talk. 
                             (admitting:)
                        And now he has seen ours.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Sometimes it’s not the failure that 
                        scares us the most. What happens if 
                        we succeed. To be heard. Then what?

                                 CLOPIN
                        Then we can’t turn back.

           EXT. HIGH-RISE CONDOMINIUMS. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT. 

           Clopin texts on his device. PING! And moments later, a window 
           opens and a CARD-KEY is thrown down to the street. 
           INT. HIGH-RISE CONDOMINIUMS. HALLWAY. NIGHT.

           After climbing the stairwell to the top floor, out of breath, 
           our trio reaches their destination. Clopin quietly KNOCKS. 

           The apartment door opens, revealing:

           PIERRE GRINGOIRE, the government drone, holding his finger to 
           his lips, checking the hallway, then letting them inside.

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        Who’s your friend?

           Quasimodo steps into view. Gringoire’s eyes widen recognizing 
           and understanding. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        We needed to be somewhere safe. 

           INT. GRINGOIRE’S PENTHOUSE CONDO. NIGHT.

           Gringoire pops open a bottle of champagne as our three settle 
           into his luxurious living room. In this environment we notice 
           Pierre Gringoire loses his FAKE ARISTOCRATIC ACCENT: 

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        You should stay through dawn. The 
                        guard changes just after. Not many 
                        eyes will be on the road if anyone 
                        is looking for him.

           Gringoire obliges Clopin and Esmeralda with a glass.

                                 CLOPIN
                        You think they’d kill him?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        They won’t if Paris knows his name. 
                        If we inspire them.

                                 CLOPIN
                        Revolution isn’t peaceful. Those of 
                        us who understand what is happening 
                        are dangerous to them. 

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        I can help. To fear death, you have 
                        to have a life of value. Not one as 
                        fake as mine.    

           LATER THAT NIGHT: Esmeralda brings water and medication to an 
           ailing Clopin, hitting his laptop keys in Gringoire’s office, 
           focused, but coughing up blood, choking back pain. 
                                 ESMERALDA
                        Take your pills.

                                 CLOPIN
                        My cancer isn’t killing me any more 
                        than this cheap medication. 

           Through the cracked door Quasimodo watches Esmeralda care for 
           Clopin. He registers the beautiful humanity in this world.  

           MOMENTS LATER: leaving Clopin to his work, she sees Quasimodo 
           staring, leads him back to Gringoire in the living room. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        We can’t find him proper care since 
                        it’s illegal to treat illegals.

           Esmeralda briefs her new friend:

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        Clopin created the underground. The 
                        Guardian Angels who rescued orphans 
                        like me and families torn apart by 
                        the war. He brought sanctuary to so 
                        many but is still haunted by faces 
                        of the ones that he couldn’t save. 
                        He may seem gruff, but he’s filled 
                        with so much good. 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        What happened to your family?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I’d give anything to know that. 

           She holds up her wrist, flashing that TRINKET BRACELET:

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        My mother’s. The only piece of her 
                        that I have.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Then my Master’s my guardian angel. 
                        He’s the only family I have.

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        But how could you want to return to 
                        a man so cruel? 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        He let you be tied and beaten.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        I’m just a beast. 
                                 ESMERALDA
                        Claude Frollo is the actual beast. 
                        You just haven’t heard him yet.

           Gringoire holds up his ring finger, flashes his WEDDING BAND.

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        This ring is only for show. I was 
                        fifteen when my father sent me away 
                        after he found me under sheets with 
                        my tutor. Marcus. Spent the rest of 
                        my youth in conversion therapy. He 
                        called it a boarding school. It was 
                        an asylum. To cure me of my godless 
                        sins. And by the time they released 
                        me, the law had changed. Marcus was 
                        one of the unlucky ones. Ironically 
                        enough so was my father. This apple 
                        didn’t fall far from the tree. 

           Gringoire takes another swig of champagne, CLINKS his ring on 
           the glass:

                                 GRINGOIRE (CONT’D)
                        This ring was my means of survival.
                        Believe me when I say I understand 
                        what it’s like to be thought of as 
                        a monster. Every day I look down at 
                        this band and am reminded of it. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Three orphans. Three criminals. 

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        We’re a sad bunch.

           Stepping from the other room, Clopin summons Esmeralda:

                                 CLOPIN
                        Breached the system. We’re in. Time 
                        to prep the video.

           Gringoire and Esmeralda excuse themselves from Quasimodo. 

                                 CLOPIN (CONT’D)
                        You really sure about this?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Yes.

           As she closes the door, she SIGNS with her hands:

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        Good night.
           Excited to respond, BY SIGNING, finally understood:

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Good night. 

           His friends retreat behind closed doors. Quasimodo eases into 
           these new surroundings, now comfortable. And rests.

           INT. CLOPIN’S RICKETY JEEP. DAWN.

           Esmeralda drives through empty city streets. Quasimodo is her 
           shrouded passenger. She clocks the time: 8:30AM.

           Esmeralda unclasps her TRINKET BRACELET, hands it to him. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I want you to hold onto this. I’ll 
                        get it next time I see you. That's 
                        how you know to not be afraid.

           EXT. FESTIVAL OF FOOLS. DAWN.

           THE NEXT MORNING, the festival folk arise, hungover and hazy, 
           untangling themselves from their orgies, gossiping, gathering 
           awestruck near where Quasimodo was tied and abandoned.

           Now, around the loose ropes, painted in LARGE RED LETTERS, is 
           the graffitied anthem of this revolution:

           SANCTUARY. SANCTUARY. SANCTUARY. 

           CUT TO NEWS FOOTAGE: the shock upon Quasimodo’s deformed face 
           spliced with those scrawled words of anarchy.

           PEELING BACK: we see Frollo fuming, watching the newscast, in 
           a meeting led by PRIME MINISTER LOUISE DEETE, 60’s, hardened, 
           wiry, focused, and intense, sitting inside...

           INT. THE PRIME MINISTER’S BOARD ROOM. DAY.

           The Prime Minister at the head of the table, Frollo her right 
           hand man, and the COUNCIL OF MINISTERS are neatly assembled. 

           The CITY GUARD, including Phoebus, at attention behind them. 

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        This is mutiny.

                                 FROLLO
                        A blatant attempt to spark rebels. 
           CLOSE ON: GRAINY SECURITY FOOTAGE of Esmeralda, rescuing and 
           untying Quasimodo, as Clopin sprays the words on the ground. 
           We can’t quite make out any of their faces.

           But Phoebus’ uneasy expression tells he recognizes the woman:

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Madam Prime Minister, my guard will 
                        track them. Let’s not cause panic.

           ANOTHER CLOSE UP: the trio climbs into a jeep. Pulling out of 
           the festival, Clopin clicks a DEVICE and pole-mounted cameras 
           around them go offline. Cutting to STATIC.

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        They hacked the network. 

                                 FROLLO
                        And will be arrested at once.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        We can’t arrest them for behavior 
                        at the Festival. 

                                 FROLLO
                        Then you smoke them out of whatever 
                        hole they hide in. Sedition doesn’t 
                        stop at the gates to the party. 

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        We need a preemptive strike.

                                 PHOEBUS 
                        We can find them discreetly.

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        I don’t care about discretion. Make 
                        an example out of them. 

           Her eyes still locked on the security footage, icily:

                                 PRIME MINISTER (CONT’D)
                        Keep Paris in line by reminding our 
                        nation that the threat of terrorism 
                        is still very real.

                                 FROLLO
                        I suggest that we extend our state 
                        of emergency: authorize the guard 
                        to exercise judicial discretion in 
                        national security.  

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        Approved. Seek and eliminate.
           INT. COURT OF MIRACLES CYBER DEN. DAY.

           In a boarded-up, defunct laundromat, Clopin sits at a desktop 
           behind three monitors, his eyes red, worked through the night 
           alongside his fellow HACKER ACTIVISTS. Fervently coding while 
           drinking wine, he eyes the progress of a HEFTY FILE UPLOAD.

           Ethernet cables, monitors, and HUMMING SERVERS stretch across 
           the den, a bleak contrast to the Prime Minister’s War Room. 

           EXT. FESTIVAL OF FOOLS. DAY.

           Gringoire stands before his skeleton CAMERA CREW, perspiring 
           from nerves, takes calming breaths. He catches the time. Ten 
           seconds to 11:00AM. Then seven. Then six.

                                 CAMERA OPERATOR
                        We’re live in five-four-three-two--

           Gringoire flips into his character:

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        Bonjour, Paris! Pierre Gringoire at 
                        your service with today’s chatter!

           INT. COURT OF MIRACLES CYBER DEN. DAY.

           Just as the file finishes the upload, the clock hits 11:13AM. 
           Clopin pounds ENTER. It’s done. 

           He glances down at a PHOTO of his WIFE AND SONS at his side. 
           Sadly smiling. Waiting. 

           EXT. FESTIVAL OF FOOLS. DAY.

           Back in the festival, all of the ARENA SCREENS cut to STATIC.  

                                 CAMERA OPERATOR
                        We lost input signal.

                                 DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY
                        The authentication changed.

                                 GRINGOIRE
                             (playing his part:)
                        What’s going on? I swear you’re all 
                        a bunch of bloody amateurs. What is 
                        this a non-union show?

           Then, each screen bursts to life with ESMERALDA. Silhouetted, 
           preserving her identity, against a GREEN BACKGROUND...
                                 ESMERALDA (ON SCREEN)
                        Citizens of Paris. We are blind. We 
                        are lame. But we can see and run if 
                        we fight our real enemy. This is a 
                        broadcast of the Court of Miracles. 
                        And, together, we are the miracles 
                        for our future.

           LINING THE FESTIVAL: these WIDE ELECTRONIC SCREENS across the 
           perimeter shower THOUSANDS OF ATTENDEES with her message. And 
           her audience doesn’t stop there...

                                 ESMERALDA (ON SCREEN) (CONT’D)
                        Yesterday, a boy with the ZK7 virus 
                        was crowned Pope of Fools. His name 
                        is Quasimodo. He lives inside Notre 
                        Dame as the adopted son to Minister 
                        of Justice, Claude Frollo. The man 
                        who tells us by day to loathe the 
                        human he cares for at night.

                        Frollo gains power because we spill

                        Look where hatred blindly leads us. 
                        Remember our families, who died for 
                        their country, not knowing this was 
                        the France they’d bleed for.

                        It is the Festival of Fools because 
                        we’ve been fooled into believing we 
                        are the enemy. To hate our friends. 

           MOBILE DEVICES: of YOUNG PEOPLE, lulling in the streets.

                        Let Quasimodo be a reminder of the 
                        monsters they have made of us all. 
                        Twisting our hope for survival into 
                        a fear of living. Making us believe 
                        we are only as worthy as death.

           THE SITUATION ROOM TELEVISION: as Frollo, the Prime Minister, 
           and Ministry Council stare daggers. Phoebus shakes his head. 
                                 ESMERALDA (ON SCREEN) (CONT’D)
                        We can restore power to the people. 
                        Restore our right to vote. Or else 
                        we will resist. And we will fight. 

           THE CYBER DEN: as Clopin silently views, dirgelike. 

                                 ESMERALDA (ON SCREEN) (CONT’D)
                        We will no longer beg for liberty. 
                        We demand sanctuary! Sanctuary.

           BACK IN THE FESTIVAL: Esmeralda’s message clearly resonates. 
           A group of REFUGEES push forward, compelled to chant along:

                                 THE CROWD (WITH ESMERALDA)
                        Sanctuary! Sanctuary!

           And PARISIANS join. All ages and races. A show of solidarity.

                                 THE CROWD (CONT’D)
                        Sanctuary! Sanctuary! Sanctuary!

           Gringoire shuffles away, a nervous wreck, just as GUARDS move 
           in to defuse the mayhem. Displaying a lawless authority, they 
           push into the PROTESTERS, whip out BATONS, and discipline the 
           unruly masses. The protesters fight back, a domino effect, as 
           those officers are quickly outnumbered: 

                                 THE CROWD (CONT’D)
                        SANCTUARY! SANCTUARY! SANCTUARY!

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           Clopin removes the external hard drive from his port, feeding 
           it to the shredder, destroying data, and powering down.

                        There’s no turning back now.

           INT. THE PRIME MINISTER’S BOARD ROOM. DAY.

           The Situation Room has turned chaotic, with Ministers arguing 
           while INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS desperately scan data.

                        These are outright lies!

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Who is approving overtime? This is 
                        feeling like an overtime scenario.
                                 INTELLIGENCE AGENT
                        The Court of Miracles has a history 
                        of hacktivism and vandalism. Never 
                        anything of this sophistication. 

                                 SECOND INTELLIGENCE AGENT
                        Traced the firewall breach to an IP 
                        address in Montmartre.

                                 FROLLO
                        Scan the plates on that car. 

                                 INTELLIGENCE AGENT
                        There aren’t any.  

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        And the woman?

                                 SECOND INTELLIGENCE AGENT
                        Unclear. Running vocal recognition.

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        This bitch wants a witch hunt, I’ll 
                        give her one.   

                                 FROLLO
                        Fight the devil with fire. 

           Another guard SLAMS a phone down...

                                 SECOND GUARD
                        Madame, we just received reports of 
                        a suspicious vehicle parked outside 
                        Notre Dame. Matches our description 
                        of the suspects’ jeep --  

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           EXT. PARIS STREETS. DAY.

           Police cars breeze down boulevards with SIRENS WAILING.

           EXT. NOTRE DAME. DAY.

           Once peaceful streets are now frantic. Police vehicles lined 
           up with lights flickering, OFFICERS hiding behind open doors, 
           rifles drawn, aimed at:

           CLOPIN’S RICKETY JEEP, abandoned, on the sidewalk. We vaguely 
           discern, through tinted windows, A HUNCHBACKED FIGURE slumped 
           in the passenger seat, blindfolded by a scarf. 
           The CITIZENS stand behind barricades with morbid excitement.

           A government van SCREECHES into the scene. Phoebus and Frollo  
           jump to the asphalt, SLAMMING their doors behind them.

           Frollo recognizes Quasimodo’s silhouette, suddenly panicking 
           that his boy’s life may be at risk, and loses composure.

                                 FROLLO
                        I demand you stand down at once.  

                                 LEAD OFFICER
                        No, sir. We have higher authority.

           A SECOND OFFICER inches forward with his MEGAPHONE:

                                 MEGAPHONE OFFICER
                        Step out. Hands in the air.

           There is no response. Quasimodo is as still as stone. 

                                 MEGAPHONE OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Exit the vehicle. 

           Several OTHER OFFICERS raise their firearms, primed to shoot. 

                                 YOUNG OFFICER
                        He’s resisting arrest. 

                                 MEGAPHONE OFFICER
                        STEP OUT OF YOUR VEHICLE NOW!

           Frollo eyes SNIPERS on rooftops, hearing their muffled VOICES 
           through the troop’s two-way TRANSMITTERS:

                                 ROOFTOP SNIPER (OFF)
                        I have a clear shot.

                                 SECOND SNIPER (OFF)
                        Copy. Clear shot here also.

           Raising his fingers, the armed officers await their go: 

                                 MEGAPHONE OFFICER
                        You have five seconds. Three. Two --

           Frollo pushes through the ranked officers, hysterical: 

                                 FROLLO
                        THE BOY CAN’T HEAR! THE CHILD CAN’T 
                        HEAR YOU!! HE IS INNOCENT.

           The arched officers stand down, conflicted by what they see.
           Frollo runs to the car, yanks open the passenger door, pulls 
           the blindfold off to reveal:

           QUASIMODO, tears fill his eyes, clutching Esmeralda’s trinket 
           bracelet in his palm so hard it has broken his skin. 

           The crowd at the barricades have grown visibly upset. Filming 
           on MOBILE DEVICES: the prophecy of the speech they heard this 
           morning has come true. Their government is corrupt. 

           And Quasimodo with Frollo is the proof. Lured into the open.

           The officers shove spectators along, but they refuse to move. 
           Standing their ground. Rebelliously. Angered by this blatant 
           display of violent aggression.  

                                 FRENCH WOMAN
                        He didn’t have a weapon. 

                                 BRITISH MAN
                        He wasn’t even a threat. You had no 
                        reason to draw guns, you pussy.

           SMACK! A guard busts the man in his jaw, throws him down, and 
           arrests him.

                                 BRITISH MAN (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you! Miserable cock.  

           People at the scene SHOUT. Mobile phones capture this entire 
           incident. Other officers traipse through the crowd with guns 
           raised, hurling people to the ground, into handcuffs. 

                                 GYPSY MAN
                        Lower your weapons. Lower them.

           Frollo, embarrassed, escorts Quasimodo through the chaos, up 
           the cathedral stairs, and into Notre Dame.  

           And THREE SHOTS ARE FIRED. People SCREAM, scattering. Crying.

           The GYPSY MAN crumples, bleeding from his chest. Shot dead. 

           QUICK CUT... A CLOSE UP on Phoebus’ HAUNTED EYES brings us to 
           that dilapidated Greek City: SHOTS ARE FIRED. THE EXPLOSION. 
           Phoebus falls to the ground wounded. We’ve seen this before. 

           SMASH BACK TO... REAL LIFE, as Phoebus shakes himself of that 
           brief day-terror. He fumbles for his anxiety medication, then 
           follows Frollo into Notre Dame. Trying to numb himself to the 
           horrible mayhem around him.

           BUT MEANWHILE, A RIOT ENSUES. And it’s filmed. By the people.  
           INT. NOTRE DAME. DAY.

           SLAM. Frollo bursts through the cathedral door, Quasimodo few 
           paces behind, followed by the guard and Phoebus. Frollo halts 
           them all before he and Quasimodo climb the belltower. 

           INT. THE BELLCHAMBER. NOTRE DAME. DAY.

           Reaching the chamber, Frollo is so relieved they brought him 
           back safely, that he allows tears to escape.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        I disobeyed you. I will never do it 
                        again, I’m so sorry.

                                 FROLLO
                        You’re back. I wasn’t sure.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Of course I’d come back. This is my 
                        home. It’s my sanctuary.

           Frollo stops. Mood turns on a dime. Eerily cold now.

                                 FROLLO
                        Where did you learn that word?

           Something in him snaps. 

           Frollo SLAPS Quasimodo, a brutal pain he’s not accustomed to. 

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        My parents were torn from this life 
                        by those gypsies. Jehan was next. I 
                        will not have you follow. Don’t you 
                        realize the trouble you caused us?

           He HITS him again. Quasimodo WHIMPERS. An incredibly visceral 
           reaction to this abuse. Never having seen this side of Frollo 
           before, Quasimodo feels utterly betrayed. 

           Frollo notices Quasimodo is gripping the TRINKET BRACELET and 
           yanks it from his hands, studying its facets, before throwing 
           it across the chamber. To him, a repulsive foreign symbol.

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        I protect you! And for what?!

           INT. NOTRE DAME. DAY.

           Phoebus is surprised by Frollo’s wet cheeks as he wanders by, 
           never having witnessed this man bear any emotion before.  
                                 PHOEBUS
                        We need to take him into custody. 

                                 FROLLO
                        I’m handling the boy. You will find 
                        the group responsible and burn them 
                        until they’re underground.

           EXT. NOTRE DAME. DAY.

           Phoebus approaches a huddle of guards near the FORENSICS TEAM 
           cautiously conducting the analysis of CLOPIN’S JEEP. The BOMB 
           SQUAD with their SNIFFER DOGS investigate the block. 

                                 LEAD OFFICER
                        No explosives found.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Any identification?

                                 FORENSICS TECH
                        Not a hair. Not a fingerprint.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        And the vehicle?

                                 FORENSICS TECH
                        Never registered. They’re ghosts.

           NOT FAR OFF: the GYPSY MAN who earlier perished is placed in 
           a body bag. The people continue to film on their devices, an 
           unforgiving authority of public documentation. 

           EXT. DAMP STREETS OF PARIS. DAY AFTER DAY.

           DAYS LATER: RIOTS ERUPT. Impassioned PROTESTERS parade signs. 
           CHANTING outside government buildings. 

           ARROGANT OFFICERS fight back. After a brief bout with CHAOS: 
           another innocent UNARMED GYPSY is attacked in the streets.  

           ANOTHER DAY: and, yet, ANOTHER INJURED MAN forcefully cuffed.

           ONE NOT-SO-SPECIAL DAY: we find those FRENCH OFFICERS cockily 
           pacing in the tenements, spitting at CHILDREN playing ball as 
           GYPSY WOMEN stand by, helplessly watching the abuse.

                                 COCKSURE OFFICER
                        Show your papers. Or we deport you.

           A TEENAGER steps up to the officers defensively. Immediately 
           he is beaten. Then SHOTS ring out. He falls to the ground.
           EXT. SOME FOGGY ALLEYWAY. NIGHT.

           Our Phoebus, in his street clothes, struts down the alleyway. 
           A LONELY WOMAN stands in a doorframe, watching him closely. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I can feel your eyes. 

                                 LONELY WOMAN
                        I have more to feel.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        And I’m an officer. 

                                 LONELY WOMAN
                        An officer who knows exactly which 
                        street he walked down. 

           Phoebus reaches a nondescript door. KNOCKS. A peephole opens.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Code word: DJALI. With a ‘D.’

           Phoebus flashes his winning, wide and toothy grin. 

           INT. UNDERGROUND TAVERN. NIGHT.

           Phoebus descends narrow stairs into this dank basement pub. A 
           sea of ODD-CHARACTERS populate the smoky joint, all eyes upon 
           him, met with SILENCE. His aristocratic looks out of place.

           Phoebus moves to the bar, takes a stool, and the room returns 
           to their conversations.

           Next to him at the bar, we recognize: OUR ESMERALDA.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I come down here every other night 
                        looking for you.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I’m not a creature of habit.  

                                 PHOEBUS
                        We loved this place.

           Phoebus signals to the BARTENDER for a drink. Make that two. 
           Returns with a few tumblers of whiskey. 

           Esmeralda quickly swallows hers. Phoebus is slower.

                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D)
                        You’re good. 
                                 ESMERALDA
                        Not sure what you mean. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        How did you know that Frollo would 
                        intervene before they’d kill him?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I didn’t. Was a happy accident. 

           It takes her a somber beat. Then it surprises her: 

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        You knew it was me?

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I recognize every last inch of you.

           Now Phoebus takes a sobering pause. 

                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D)
                        It’s really good to see you. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Don’t say that. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        That’s more than I should say. You 
                        were the one who disappeared.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Look at my baggage. You wanted to 
                        put yourself at risk?

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I did. Yes.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        And I knew better. You’ll thank me.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Maybe just a silly fantasy of mine. 
                        The happiness we’d have on Earth if 
                        you were not born a gypsy. And if I 
                        weren’t a daft soldier.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        And if war did not exist.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        And if true love had.
                                 ESMERALDA
                        Didn’t take you long to propose to 
                        another girl. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I was getting deployed. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Didn’t take you long.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Well, it ended when I came back in 
                        pieces. War is cruel. And marriage 
                        is the worst war of all. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Why are you here?

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I’ve been ordered to arrest you. On 
                        the charges of sedition, terrorism, 
                        and murder: which brings an instant 
                        sentence of death.  

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Bastard.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Just doing my job.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        You’re going to detain me?

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I didn’t say I was good at my job.

           Esmeralda scoots her fingertips over to grip his hand:

                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D)
                        Remember the day we met?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        That was four years ago.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        So you don’t?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        The rally at the mall. Police came. 
                        We ran like cowards. Hiding in the 
                        bathroom stalls. Our first kiss.
                                 PHOEBUS
                        And then vowed to never be cowards 
                        again.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I held up my end of the bargain.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        But I didn’t. 

           Esmeralda’s gorgeous green eyes meet his.

                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D)
                        And I feel guilty every day. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        You’re a good man. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Maybe. But everyone else isn’t. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        What did they think would happen if 
                        we raised little white boys to hate 
                        gypsy boys? Then we promote them to 
                        officers, give them power, and give 
                        them guns --

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I thought I could be the change we 
                        needed. But I’m not. 
                             (beat)
                        You are. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        If only.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I still care about you.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        And I think about you.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I missed your fire.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I miss yours.

           She grabs her jacket, taking his hand:

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        Follow me.
           EXT. VACANT PARIS STREETS. NIGHT.

           Esmeralda and Phoebus stealthily navigate a series of alleys, 
           duck through a hole in a fence, and descend into an abandoned 
           Métro station. 

           INT. ABANDONED MÉTRO TUNNELS. NIGHT.

           Esmeralda leads Phoebus along the deserted subway tracks, mud 
           sloshing beneath their boots.  

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Where are you taking me?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        When we were forced off the street, 
                        we created our own arteries. After 
                        all, immigrants are the heartbeat 
                        of Paris.  

                                 PHOEBUS
                        How extensive is the underground?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Depends. People or place?

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Both?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        You have no idea. The revolution is 
                        only beginning.

           SOME TIME LATER: they reach a SERVICE DOOR. Esmeralda enters 
           a code into the KEYPAD. The dead bolt unlocks. 

           They climb stairs back to surface level, another KEYPAD, then 
           Esmeralda pushes open the steel door, revealing:

           A WARM AND INVITING LIVING ROOM: eclectic mix-and-match decor 
           with TOYS and CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS strewn about... 

           INT. THE UNDERGROUND FOSTER HOME. NIGHT.

           Esmeralda has led Phoebus into their underground group home. 
           Their hidden orphanage for undocumented children.  

                                 ESMERALDA
                        If the Court of Miracles was a real 
                        place, this would be it. 

           An ELDERLY MATRON fondly acknowledges her. 
                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        We give young lives their chance.

           A few CHILDREN run around playing, in pajamas. One young girl 
           with a LARGE PINK BOW, hops into Esmeralda’s arms. 

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        My way of giving back to children 
                        like myself. Who don’t know where 
                        they came from.

           Her compassion further stirs all of Phoebus’ old feelings. 

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        When the people you work for babble 
                        about illegitimates: here are their 
                        faces. This is who they’re scared 
                        of. Without GENEXX papers, without 
                        citizenship, born to gypsies. These 
                        children are made outlaws once they 
                        take their first breath. 

           As she speaks the weight of this world bears down on her. And 
           Phoebus wipes her tears with a gentle flick of his thumb.

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        They are just somebody’s child. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        They’re looking for these hideouts. 
                        To raid and destroy them.  

           Phoebus moves in to kiss her, tenderly. Then, pulls away.

                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D)
                        Sorry --

           Pressing hands on his shoulders she looks at him intently, as 
           if hypnotized by his handsome face:

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I’m not.

           INT. AN INTERROGATION ROOM. DAY.

           Frollo stands on the transparent side of a two-way mirror, a 
           furrowed brow, dark bags under his eyes, hardly slept.  

           THROUGH THE GLASS: Quasimodo is examined in an interrogation 
           room, sitting cross-legged on his chair, eyes lowered to the 
           table, nervously sketching. 
           Pacing around the room is an INTERROGATION OFFICER, elderly, 
           wearing a hearing aid, who speaks down at Quasimodo, getting 
           very little in response. 

           PULLING BACK: Frollo is joined by Madam Prime Minister. 

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        It’s never ending, Claude.

           She holds PRINTED PROPAGANDA: “STEP DOWN! - FREE THE VOTE!”

                                 PRIME MINISTER (CONT’D)
                        They’re everywhere. They’re in our 
                        network. All our printers have been 
                        spitting this garbage out on loop.   

                                 FROLLO
                        Quasimodo is just their pawn.  

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        The pawn that turned France against 
                        their government.

                                 FROLLO
                        I told you he knows nothing. It’s 
                        not his fault.  

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        No. It’s yours for harboring him.

                                 FROLLO
                        I took Quasimodo in before this was 
                        written into law. I was Archdeacon 
                        of Notre Dame. It was my chore. 

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        And now you’re above the law?

                                 FROLLO
                        Don’t we make it? 

           A beat. Then a smile. Touché.  

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        Unless you find the gypsy or Court 
                        of Miracles, I expect your signed 
                        resignation. Don’t let everything 
                        you worked so hard for fall apart. 
                        Tick. Tick. Tick.

           The interrogation officer bursts into their room, red-faced, 
           huffy, and frustrated.
                                 INTERROGATION OFFICER
                        It’s impossible to get any answers 
                        out of him! He ignored every other 
                        word, making a fool out of me.  

                                 FROLLO
                        He’s deaf. 

                                 INTERROGATION OFFICER
                        He’s infuriating.

           MOMENTS LATER: Frollo steps in to collect Quasimodo. His mood 
           has very clearly negatively shifted against Frollo.  

                                 FROLLO
                        Quasimodo.

           Quasimodo barely looks up, concealing HIS BLACK EYE from when 
           Frollo struck him earlier.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        I told that man. I don’t even know 
                        their names.

           Trying to earn back his trust, Frollo SIGNS WITH HIS HANDS:

                                 FROLLO
                        I believe you. Let’s go home.

           Frollo notices the small sketch Quasimodo drew to pass time: 
           roughly resembling the silhouette of ESMERALDA. Hatred burns 
           in his eyes at the lascivious art. He snatches it.

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        You are just the moth. And when she 
                        returns to the Hell she came from, 
                        you must not follow her flame. 

           He backs away. Another icy mood shift. Commands his guards:

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        Lock the boy back up. Sleeping with 
                        the rats ought to remind him where 
                        his true loyalty lies.

           EXT. HÔTEL MATIGNON. DAY.

           YOUNG PARISIAN PROTESTERS erupt, wearing shirts branded with 
           caricatures of Quasimodo and the silhouetted Esmeralda. 

                                 PROTESTERS
                        FREE THE VOTE! FREE THE PEOPLE! 
                        FREE THE HUNCHBACK! FREE PARIS!
           POWER-HUNGRY OFFICERS elbow through the crowd arresting these 
           disrupters where they can, forcing them onto military busses.  
           Aggressively. And quite visibly enjoying themselves.

           A GOVERNMENT AD on the bus reminds, in French and English, of 
           a BOUNTY ON THE COURT OF MIRACLES. 

           Officers are heard plotting through two-way TRANSMITTERS:

                                 OFFICER (OFF)
                        We’re about full--

                                 SECOND OFFICER (OFF)
                        Sending in the next bus.

           Suddenly, the officers lurch in pain, scrambling to yank out 
           their ear pieces, transmitters now BLASTING LOUD PUNK MUSIC, 
           the frequencies-hacked, psychological warfare.  

           And then, from an open doorway: GUNFIRE ERUPTS. THWAP. THWAP.

           The protesters run for their lives. Scrambling. SCREAMING. 

           But it’s the officers who fall lifeless onto the street, like 
           the gypsies that died before them. A targeted retaliation. 

                                 OFFICER
                             (into his radio)
                        Backup. Shots fired.

           But their RADIOS don’t work. Still playing that LOUD MUSIC.

                                 SECOND OFFICER
                        Radio’s offline! 

                                 OFFICER
                             (still trying)
                        Officers down. Repeat, offi-- 

           THWAP. In a quick instant he’s taken from this world. 

           One GUARD, the last to survive, raises his hands, frightened: 

                                 PLEADING OFFICER
                        Please! I was just doing what I had 
                        been told. It’s my job. PLEASE.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. PHOEBUS’ APARTMENT. NIGHT.

           Phoebus lies in bed with Esmeralda, their bare skin brushing 
           against the linens. And each other. 
                                 ESMERALDA
                        We shouldn’t be doing this. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Why not? It’s fun.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        It’s dangerous. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Don’t you trust me?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I can’t trust anybody. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Every year, I looked forward to the 
                        Festival. I thought, maybe, this is 
                        the one you’ll see her again.  

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Lucky you. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I also love seeing those beaches. I 
                        was raised by my grandparents along 
                        that coast. They would tell me the 
                        stones on those sands took hundreds 
                        of years to wash ashore. Slowly 
                        pushed along by the current. Yet, 
                        with one simple toss: you can throw 
                        that all away. Back to the waves. 

           Phoebus sits up, allowing the sheets to fall, cascading over 
           his torso. Esmeralda kisses his muscular shoulders.

                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D)
                        And that’s what we’ve done to our 
                        history. To our own people. Threw 
                        everything back.  

                                 ESMERALDA
                        A stone hitting the water causes a 
                        ripple. It’s a fight for survival. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        And I fought hard, believe me. Ten 
                        thousand times over I should have 
                        died on the front. But we do what 
                        we can to be the lucky ones.

           He repositions his body: revealing his legs. We may remember 
           from his introduction that he requires a device to stand.
           On his right leg, he wears that ARTIFICIAL LIMB. Amputated at 
           the knee. His personal sacrifice to the cost of these wars. 

                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D)
                        Better to be judged by twelve than 
                        carried by six.  

           Phoebus confidently admits: 

                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D)
                        They’ve arrested Quasimodo. And I 
                        want to finally do my part.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Then I have another favor to ask. 

           INT. A GOVERNMENT HOLDING CELL. NIGHT.

           Quasimodo huddles for warmth under a small blanket on a stiff 
           cot. He HUMS to himself, frightened and cold.

           Suddenly his cell door clicks and swings open. Quasimodo sits 
           up, curious, as Phoebus enters, wearing all-black, cloaked to 
           the best of his ability. With a kind wink, he raises a finger 
           to his lips, speaks in a HUSHED WHISPER:

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Follow me. 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Why should I trust you?

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Your friend Esmeralda sent me.  

           INT. A DIMLY LIT STAIRWELL. NIGHT.

           Quasimodo quietly follows Phoebus down the service stairwell. 

           AT THE BOTTOM: Phoebus forces open a door. The security wall 
           panel beside it BLINKS IN GREEN: DISARMED.

           EXT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING. NIGHT.

           Phoebus and Quasimodo dart across the property, right through 
           a loading gate where another guard, OLIVIER, loyal to a fault 
           for his friend Phoebus, anxiously waits.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Olivier. You’re always there when I 
                        need you most. You’re a gem.
                                 OLIVIER
                        You almost didn’t make it-- 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Piss off! Fifteen seconds to spare. 

                                 OLIVIER
                        Nothing to brag about.  

                                 PHOEBUS
                             (eying his watch:)
                        Five-four-three-two...

           On the final count the SECURITY GATE reactivates, electronic 
           locks trigger, and the surveillance panel is armed again. 

                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D)
                        Pays to have friends in low places. 

                                 OLIVIER
                        You need to go. I’ll hold them off 
                        as long as playing stupid can buy. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        You were always great at that. 

                                 OLIVIER
                        Take care of yourself. 

           Olivier takes his friend in a long embrace.  

                                 OLIVIER (CONT’D)
                        They’ll kill us if they find out.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Well, then we shouldn’t let them.

                                 OLIVIER
                        Goodbye, Phoebus.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        ‘Til next time, Olivier. 

           As Phoebus leaves, Olivier calls out one last time: 

                                 OLIVIER
                        You have more courage inside of you 
                        than generations of men. I hope you 
                        find what you’re looking for. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I found her.

           Quasimodo follows Phoebus down the dark street and into...
           INT. AN UNMARKED VEHICLE. NIGHT. 

           Phoebus jumps into the SUV. With Quasimodo as his passenger. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Buckle up. 

                                 ESMERALDA (OFF)
                        He’s really the worst driver. 

           WE REVEAL: Esmeralda in the backseat, leaning forward to kiss 
           Quasimodo’s cheek (who can barely contain his excitement).

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Esmeralda!

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I’m sorry I couldn’t come sooner.

           She smiles blithely, then brushes his bruised eye, from where 
           Frollo hit him. 

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        Frollo did this to you?

                                 QUASIMODO
                        I disobeyed.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        You deserve so much better. 

           Quasimodo presents her with the TRINKET BRACELET he borrowed. 
           Hidden in one of his pockets. 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        I have this for you. Was waiting to 
                        give your bracelet back.

                                 ESMERALDA
                             (truly touched:)
                        You remembered. 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Of course. We’re friends.  

           INT. A GOVERNMENT HOLDING CELL. NIGHT.

           LATER THAT NIGHT: Frollo enters as FORENSIC AGENTS check for 
           prints. OLIVIER, the officer-on-duty, paces the jail cell. 

                                 FROLLO
                        Get me the security footage. 
                                 OLIVIER
                        The cameras went dark for an hour 
                        while this happened. 

           Frollo fumes. Turns to see, above the door, the one word that 
           seers his soul: SANCTUARY.

                                 FROLLO
                        So they’ve stolen him. My poor boy.

                                 OLIVIER
                        There’s a bounty on anyone involved 
                        with the crime --

                                 FROLLO
                        It’s not enough. Forget the others.
                             (a hard decision:)
                        Put a bounty on Quasimodo instead. 
                        The people at least recognize him. 
                        Let him lead us to the gypsies.

                                 OLIVIER
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 FROLLO
                        And who was the officer responsible 
                        for guarding the cell? 

                                 OLIVIER
                             (covering his tracks:)
                        Lieutenant Pascal, I believe.

                                 FROLLO
                        He is wildly incapable. 

                                 OLIVIER
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 FROLLO
                        Put a bullet in his head. And never 
                        make his same mistakes.

           EXT. PARIS STREETS. NIGHT.

           Phoebus drives their nondescript unmarked vehicle cautiously. 
           Police cars lurk on street corners. Scattered checkpoints.

           IN THE SUV: Phoebus calls to Quasimodo and Esmeralda, huddled 
           flat under blankets in the back. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Streets are closing. I thought we’d 
                        have more time. They’re everywhere.
                                 ESMERALDA
                        Get off the road.  

           Phoebus makes a left turn, driving RIGHT INTO THE CHECKPOINT. 
           The avenue barricaded. OFFICERS poised with flashlights.  

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Shit. Stay down.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Be discreet.

           Phoebus approaches the line. A pudgy officer approaches.  

                                 STOUT OFFICER
                        Where you heading tonight?

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Home, sir.

                                 STOUT OFFICER
                        There’s a fugitive situation on our 
                        streets. You aware?

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Straight home, then.  

                                 STOUT OFFICER
                        It’s not that simple. The city is 
                        on lockdown. I need to ask you to 
                        step out of your vehicle.

           His lean partner illuminates the back of the SUV, draped with 
           piles of linens that the others hide beneath.  

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I’m a hoarder.

           The officer catches glimpse of Quasimodo curiously peeking.

                                 LEAN OFFICER
                        You need to step out of the vehicle 
                        with your hands on your head. Now! 

           Phoebus shifts the gear into REVERSE. And FLOORS IT. Swerving 
           around the cars behind him in the lineup. 

           SHOTS ARE FIRED piercing their windshield but Phoebus doesn’t 
           lose focus. Steering backwards. 

           The officers rush to their car. DOORS SLAM. TIRES SQUEAL. 

           And the chase is on. 
           IN REVERSE: Phoebus navigates the SUV onto the sidewalk, then 
           flips it around, careening down a tight alleyway. The mirrors 
           on both sides knocked clean off. DING. Sparks fly. 

           BEHIND THEM: LIGHTS FLICKER, the officers nearing.  

           BACK IN THE CAR: Esmeralda rises from her hiding spot. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Remember when I said be discreet?

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I’ll lose them. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Get us to the crypt and we can go 
                        underground. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        If I don’t get to the crypt, we’ll 
                        be underground anyway.  

           Phoebus tries another major avenue. Again barricaded by cops. 
           He veers down a second tight alleyway. The officers still on 
           their tail, gaining. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        A few blocks east.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Behind this building? 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Yes. Just don’t turn left-- 

           But Phoebus’ mind can’t catch up with his hands on the wheel.

           He turns left. 

           And they’re met with concrete walls. A complete dead end. 

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        You are just no help tonight. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        If we can’t go under, then--

                                 QUASIMODO
                        --we go up. 

           MOMENTS LATER: the officers SCREECH on the scene, DOORS SLAM, 
           guns are drawn, approaching, to find their now-empty SUV. 

           They inspect the area. Only one direction left to go.
           The officers look up to spot our trio SCALING THE BUILDING. 

           Quasimodo climbs with Esmeralda laced around his neck, moving 
           quickly. Years of scaling the Notre-Dame towers have built up 
           his strength. Phoebus is not far behind, though less agile.  

           The officers FIRE IN THE AIR. Quasimodo yanks Esmeralda up to 
           safety. Then lends Phoebus a hand. Before the cops can better 
           their aim, our heroes are on the roof, and out of range.

           ON THE ROOFTOP: Esmeralda recalibrates her sense of direction 
           leading them east to the crypt.

           Dozens of police cars have now arrived on the scene, tinting 
           the evening with their flickering blue. 

           Our trio traverse along LATIN QUARTER rooftops, dodging stray 
           bullets from officers on the street.  

           Hopping the final rooftop: Phoebus’s luck runs out. He lulls. 
           Shot in the side. But he makes the last leap and keeps on. 

           The others don’t notice. A few yards away, Esmeralda halts--

           She points to the ground, then shimmies down the gutter pipe. 
           Quasimodo follows suit. Phoebus a few paces behind. 

           ON THE STREET BELOW: Quasimodo yanks open a MANHOLE COVER as 
           the three descend into... 

           INT. PARISIAN CATACOMBS. NIGHT.

           The underground tunnels are coated in death: skulls and bones 
           of the vintage deceased painted over by layers of graffiti.

           Knee deep in city sludge, Esmeralda keeps leading their way. 
           They scurry through this dark and dreary labyrinth.

           Phoebus visibly struggles to continue.  

           Without skipping a beat, Quasimodo hoists him into his arms, 
           effortlessly cradling him, like a damsel-in-distress. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I got it. I got it-- 

           But Quasimodo doesn’t listen, keeps running for their lives.

           INT. THE UNDERGROUND FOSTER HOME. NIGHT.

           LATER THAT NIGHT: very out of breath, and worse for wear, our 
           heroes have reached their safe haven.
           As Quasimodo sets Phoebus down, he notices that his hands are 
           covered in Phoebus’ blood. 

           Phoebus has been shot, straight through his left leg. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        It’s fine. Just a scratch. Nothing 
                        a glass of bourbon won’t fix.

           But his squirming and discomfort suggest otherwise.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I need to get you out of these. Let 
                        me stitch it up. 

           Esmeralda removes Phoebus’ trousers, then hurries away --

           Quasimodo goes wide-eyed when Phoebus’ right leg is revealed 
           to be capped with THAT ARTIFICIAL LIMB. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I told you. You can trust me ‘cause 
                        I’m just like you. Half-formed. But 
                        you’re better than me. You’re brave 
                        enough to wear it on your face. 

           Quasimodo isn’t sure what to say. He somberly smiles. 

           Phoebus motions towards Esmeralda:

                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D) 
                        You really like her don’t you?

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Nobody ever looked at me the way 
                        she does. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Like what?

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Like I deserve to be loved. 

           Esmeralda returns, tending to Phoebus’ open wounds. Something 
           about their shared connection, and intimate moment, similarly 
           wounds our Quasimodo. His eyes lower in jealousy.

           INT. UNDERGROUND TAVERN. NIGHT.

           Esmeralda, Phoebus and Quasimodo congregate among the couple 
           of ODD-BUT-FRIENDLY FACES in the hidden speakeasy. Everybody 
           in the joint either a distant friend or like-minded outlaw. 
           Phoebus fumbles with his crutches as he stands, bandaged, on 
           the mend, near a GYPSY FELLOW with a mostly-toothless grin. 

                                 GRINNING FRIEND
                             (re: his injury)
                        Brother, you’re really driving that 
                        body hard. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I aspire to have no limbs when I’m 
                        done with this life. 

                                 GRINNING FRIEND
                        That’s how y’know you did it right.

           Phoebus motions to the BARTENDER. Three fingers raised. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Lady’s choice. The usual. 

           She obliges him with tumblers and his routine whiskey pours. 

           A FEW STEPS AWAY, Esmeralda and Quasimodo are immersed in the 
           other’s company. Quasimodo absolutely captivated.  

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Where are all the places you’d love 
                        to see? When the world is restored. 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        I -- don’t know. I’ve never thought 
                        of life outside my towers before. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        It’s called daydreaming. 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        I’m happy in Paris. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Nobody’s happy in Paris. Come on. 
                        No wrong answers here. Where?

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Where the sea turns into the sky. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Or does the sky turn into the sea? 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        I heard there are cities outside of 
                        France with -- people like me.  
                                 ESMERALDA
                        There might be.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Then I’d also like to see that.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        That would be beautiful. 

           He cracks a smile at the thought.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        What about you?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Oh, I’m never good at planning. 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        That’s not fair--!

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Sunlight. 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        We have sunlight.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Not real sunlight. The clouds might 
                        part but the rain stays. You see it 
                        on all of our faces. 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Maybe down here on the streets. But 
                        not from above. I can bring you, up 
                        to Notre Dame, and you’ll see. From 
                        my tower you see everything. In the 
                        clouds, even if the streets are in 
                        shadow, you can feel the sun.  

                                 ESMERALDA
                        You’ll take me?

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Yes. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        You have to promise. We’re family 
                        now. And family keeps promises.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Yes. Yes. Cross my heart.

           Phoebus returns with the tumblers of whiskey. One for each of 
           them. Quasimodo looks concerned. 
                                 PHOEBUS
                        There are too many things you’ve 
                        never tried.  

           Phoebus sips his. Then Esmeralda. Then Quasimodo. He chokes. 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        --like fire. 

           Phoebus and Esmeralda share a smile. 

           LATER THAT EVENING: Quasimodo is dancing near a reconditioned 
           JUKEBOX playing POP CLASSICS. Traded from partner to partner. 
           Making friends. Experiencing the beauty of connection. 

           Esmeralda finishes a conversation with the grinning toothless  
           man before she returns to Phoebus at the table, shoveling his 
           food into his mouth.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        How bad is it? Our faces must be 
                        all over Paris by now. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        They’re not. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        That can’t be. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Only his. 

           Esmeralda motions at Quasimodo:  

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        They’re turning Paris against him. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        They made him the whipping boy?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Yes. And preying on our compassion. 
                             (beat)
                        Which really fucking works on me.  

           Their body language and uninterrupted gaze are all we need to 
           see. These two have fallen in love again.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        What if we left here then? 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        How?
                                 PHOEBUS
                        There’s a colony outside of London. 
                        Near Dartford. We can go and start 
                        everything over. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        And then what?

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Take a stab at a life. We never had 
                        that chance together. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Run off. Get married. Own property. 
                        Be totally ordinary.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        How wonderful does that sound?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        We’d bring Quasimodo?

                                 PHOEBUS
                        He could scare the crows.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Phoebus--

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Sorry.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        And we would have children?

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Yes. Three. Because we can. Because 
                        it’s our right. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I really hope they’d have my sense 
                        of direction.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        And my temperament.  

                                 ESMERALDA
                        And your swagger. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        And your everything else. 

           She smirks, but clearly dismisses the notion before he wanted 
           her to. Disappointment melts Phoebus’ smile.
                                 ESMERALDA
                        It’s fun to daydream. Another life 
                        maybe. Give me a call. I promise I 
                        won’t forget about you.

           EXT. DAMP PARIS STREETS. NIGHT.

           Phoebus moves through the dark streets, his face concealed as 
           he swerves through aimless human traffic. 

           On every street corner: ELECTRONIC ADVERTS display footage of 
           Quasimodo from the Festival, yelling, biting, enraged. 

           And below it: DEAD OR ALIVE. INFORMATION IS REWARDED.

           INT. PHOEBUS’ APARTMENT. NIGHT.

           Phoebus hurries around his ransacked apartment, gathering his 
           belongings as silently as possible. In the doorway, a YOUNGER 
           WOMAN slinks in, taking him by surprise. 

           They share a comfortable familiarity. This is his EX-FIANCÉE.

                                 FIANCÉE
                        Some officers came looking for you. 
                        Scared me. Where have you been?  

                                 PHOEBUS
                        They think I’ve gone missing?

                                 FIANCÉE
                        Gone rogue. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        If only it were so black and white.

                                 FIANCÉE
                        Why would you throw your life away 
                        like this? We were happy. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Lilian, we really weren’t. 

                                 FIANCÉE
                        But you were alive. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        You sent them away?

                                 FIANCÉE
                        I told them I hadn’t seen you since 
                        the breakup. 
                                 PHOEBUS
                        But they asked you to stay here and 
                        notify them next time you did.

           She sadly nods. 

                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D)
                        And so you just did---?

                                 FIANCÉE
                        I thought you should know.  

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Class act.

                                 FIANCÉE
                        Phoebus, if you’re in trouble, then 
                        turn yourself in. They’re pardoning 
                        anybody with information--

                                 PHOEBUS
                        You need to promise me you’ll tell 
                        them you never saw me. 

                                 FIANCÉE
                        I can’t lie to them. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Here’s the thing, Lilian. I’m going 
                        to walk out that door and get away 
                        from this. I have before. And will 
                        again. And they’ll take that out on 
                        you. If you ever loved me, you have 
                        to believe me. 
                             (beat)
                        You saw a ghost. A burglar. A stray 
                        dog. Anything but me. These men are 
                        unhinged. They will make sure that 
                        was the last call you’ll ever make.  

           Phoebus pushes by her. One last kiss. Then is out the door.

           INT. NOTRE DAME. NIGHT.

           IN THE WAR ROOM: Frollo is eclipsed by A DOZEN MONITORS. His 
           INTELLIGENCE STAFF scrolls through SECURITY FOOTAGE from the 
           car chase with Quasimodo. Freezing on IMAGES of the outlaws.

           Zooming in, they focus on PHOEBUS’ face. 

           Frollo recognizes him. And CACKLES a bit to himself. 
                                 FROLLO
                        Of course. Vermin on a salary. I’m 
                        now employing the terrorists. 

           Then, they focus in on Esmeralda. 

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        Who is this? Who is that girl?

           The AGENTS clicks through different pictures of her. All the 
           security footage. Each one displaying her undeniable beauty. 
           Her raven hair. Her emerald eyes. Her enticing body. 

                                 SERVICE AGENT 
                        Not a citizen. A gypsy. They call 
                        her Esmeralda.

                                 FROLLO
                        Give me a minute. Leave.

           His staff obliges. In a second, they’re all out the door.  

           And Frollo remains, standing amongst a DOZEN PICTURES of the 
           haunting Esmeralda. His siren. Suddenly thoroughly obsessed. 

           Frollo focuses in on them. Infatuated by her body, her eyes, 
           her beauty, and the alluring, carnal effect she has on him. 

           He snaps himself out of it:  

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        She is the devil! Born to make men 
                        weak in the knees. Driven mad!  

           LATER IN THE EVENING: Frollo kneels at the altar, consumed in 
           his prayers. Panning around him we are reminded again of the 
           BREATHTAKING BEAUTY of Notre-Dame Cathedral. 

           That glowing stained-glass rose window. Majestic grand organ. 
           The vaulted ceilings. Faded Renaissance artwork.  

           Frollo creases his eyes closed, tight, as if he is trying to 
           lock out his prior sinful thoughts. 

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        Holy Mary, Mother of God. Pray for 
                        us sinners, now and at the hour of 
                        our death--

           Or unwanted, painful memories: 

           QUICK CUT: our younger FROLLO and JEHAN, as teenagers, watch 
           through tears as TWO CASKETS are lowered into fresh dirt.
           QUICK CUT: Frollo soothes his sobbing brother, sitting in the 
           chapel of Notre-Dame. New orphans awaiting a new direction in 
           their lives. Frollo filled with hope. Jehan with rage. 

           QUICK CUT: Frollo with GUDULE, taking in the deformed infant, 
           and with the grace of God, deciding to adopt him. 

           QUICK CUT: Frollo and Jehan with a growing QUASIMODO, raising 
           the boy as their own. A new bond for the brothers. 

           QUICK CUT: Frollo in his office, begging Jehan not to attend 
           the Festival of Fools.

           QUICK CUT: Frollo watches in horror as Jehan is carried dead 
           from the Festival.  

           AND FROLLO IS FINALLY PULLED FROM THAT TRANCE. 

           Tears brim his eyes as he stands, arms-wide, screaming at the 
           altar and crucifix. Descending into an internal madness. 

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        Why do you test me with this life?! 
                        Why must I stay alive when everyone 
                        I love dies?!

           Frollo catches his breath, collecting himself. Then sneers.  

           INT. THE BELLTOWER. NOTRE DAME. DAY.

           Frollo climbs the spiral staircase of Notre Dame. 

           INT. THE BELLCHAMBER. NOTRE DAME. DAY.

           Frollo inspects, now despises, the CHARCOAL SKETCHES swinging 
           from the beams: portraits of the bells, gargoyles, bird’s eye 
           views of Paris. Quasimodo’s self-portrait. And Jehan.

                                 FROLLO
                             (touching the portrait)
                        It was a fool’s mission trying to 
                        save you both.

           Frollo recognizes a new detailed portrait: one of the radiant 
           ESMERALDA, a stunning specimen. Frollo crosses to Quasimodo’s 
           bed. Sifting through drawings. Picture after picture, sketch 
           after sketch, of the gypsy fugitive. Hatred clouds his eyes. 

           Then one familiar face appears in a drawing. Frollo registers 
           it: a PORTRAIT of PIERRE GRINGOIRE drinking champagne sitting 
           on his sofa. 
           Another clue. Frollo flashes a wicked grin.

           Off the sketch, we TRANSITION INTO--

           INT. GRINGOIRE’S PENTHOUSE CONDO. NIGHT.

           CLOSE ON: a TELEVISION SCREEN playing ESMERALDA silhouetted 
           against a RED BACKGROUND...

                                 ESMERALDA (ON SCREEN)
                        We demand the immediate resignation 
                        of Prime Minister Louise Deete, and 
                        her Cabinet of Ministries including 
                        Claude Frollo. In their place, the  
                        citizens will elect new leadership.  

           PULLING BACK: Gringoire watches in his luxurious condominium.

                                 ESMERALDA (ON SCREEN) (CONT’D)
                        Leadership that is not appointed. 
                        Leadership not afraid to eliminate  
                        the criminality of gypsy families, 
                        and that, with open arms, embraces 
                        illegitimates including Quasimodo: 
                        the Hunchback of Notre Dame.  

           Gringoire restlessly paces, in his robe, drinking his nightly 
           bottle of champagne. A routine well tended to. 

                                 ESMERALDA (ON SCREEN) (CONT’D)
                        Frollo’s only ambition is the glory 
                        of war in his name. His greed stole 
                        our government from us. So what are 
                        we going to do? Take it lying down? 
                        No. Help us take France back. They 
                        won’t listen. Let them suffer.

           The broadcast CUTS OUT. Then the REGULAR PARISIAN PROGRAMMING 
           returns to his television. 

           Suddenly, there is a LOUD CRASH. Gringoire drops his glass on 
           the floor. SHATTERING IT. Startled. 

           IN THE LIVING ROOM: Gringoire finds Claude Frollo, flanked by 
           Olivier and his guard, who obliterated the locked front door. 

           A deliciously evil smirk kisses Frollo’s lips. 

                                 FROLLO
                        Sorry to let myself in. You must 
                        understand it isn’t safe outside 
                        anymore for government officials. 
                                 GRINGOIRE
                        What do I owe the pleasure, sir?

                                 FROLLO
                        Please, Pierre. Call me Claude. 

           Frollo throws down, onto the coffee table, A FEW PHOTOGRAPHS. 

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        I need to know what you know about 
                        the underground. 

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        Nothing.

                                 FROLLO
                             (prying:)
                        The Court of Miracles.

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        I don’t know anything. Claude.

           Frollo holds up ONE PICTURE of a lovely REDHEAD woman kissing 
           an equally lovely BRUNETTE in public. 

                                 FROLLO
                        This is?

           Caught, Gringoire drops his ARISTOCRATIC ACCENT:

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        Marion. 

                                 FROLLO
                        Your wife. 

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        My wife. 

           Frollo pulls out A SECOND PHOTOGRAPH. This time of Gringoire 
           himself, huddling lips near ANOTHER MAN. 

                                 FROLLO
                        And this -- this is not your wife. 

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        No.

                                 FROLLO
                        I could go on? 

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        No need. I spent enough time bowing 
                        my head in shame about it. 
                                 FROLLO
                        A man of your celebrity maintaining 
                        this masquerade leads me to believe 
                        that you are, in fact, aware of the 
                        underground. Now you have a choice. 
                        They can kill you. Or I can pardon 
                        you. If you tell me where--

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        I said I don’t have information. 

                                 FROLLO
                        I really liked you, Pierre. Perhaps 
                        even respected you. And that’s why 
                        I turned a blind eye to all this. 
                        You think there’s anything in this 
                        city that I don’t know about? 

                                 GRINGOIRE
                        Clearly not the Court of Miracles. 

           And off Gringoire’s defiant expression, we SMASH TO: 

           INT. THE UNDERGROUND FOSTER HOME. DAY.

           Esmeralda cares to a bedridden Clopin. Struggling to breathe. 
           Not an encouraging scene. His time very clearly running out. 
           Their eyes are red, witnessing BREAKING NEWS about:

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON SCREEN)
                        Pierre Gringoire, Parisian treasure 
                        and adored television personality, 
                        was found murdered in his home. 
                             (sadly:)
                        Pierre was 52 years young. 

           QUICK CUT: footage of Gringoire on the tile of his condo, dry 
           blood sticks to his colorless forehead. A bullet wound. 

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON SCREEN) (CONT’D)
                        The terrorist organization known as 
                        the Court of Miracles has turned on 
                        the media--

           Esmeralda’s eyes moisten. Emotionally helpless. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        This isn’t the people. 

                                 CLOPIN
                        No. This means they know.  

           ON THE SCREEN: Quasimodo’s WANTED MUGSHOT again appears. 
                                 NEWSCASTER (ON SCREEN)
                        The Hunchback of Notre Dame and his 
                        gypsy fugitives are armed. And very 
                        dangerous. Illegals may be rewarded 
                        and pardoned for their crimes if 
                        they come forward with intelligence 
                        leading to the Court of Miracles-- 

           BACK IN THE BEDROOM: Clopin has a COUGHING FIT. He endeavors 
           to find the energy to stand.

                                 CLOPIN
                        They’re getting warmer. It’s only a 
                        matter of time before they find us.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Then we need to get the children to 
                        safety. 

                                 CLOPIN
                        There’s a bunker in Belleville that 
                        Pierre never knew about.

           ELSEWHERE, Quasimodo and a recovered Phoebus sit with a pair 
           of TWIN BOYS. Quasimodo is touched by their kindness towards 
           him as he sketches NOTRE-DAME and tells a story:

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Emmanuel’s the oldest. And one of 
                        my closest friends. She plays the 
                        most beautiful music. 

                                 TWIN ONE
                        You watch the city from up there? 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Yes. And when the clouds part, it’s 
                        an amazing view. The Seine sings as  
                        beautifully as the bells!

                                 TWIN TWO
                        In the daylight?

           Quasimodo lulls. Nodding, and sadly reminiscing:

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Yes. Especially then.

           INT. ROMA BOARDING HOUSE. NIGHT.

           An elderly HOUSE MATRON is weeping on her knees, a gun placed 
           against her sweaty forehead.
           PULLING BACK: Olivier holds the weapon, with conflicted eyes, 
           standing with Claude Frollo and the CITY GUARD. 

           Frollo displays a device with FOOTAGE OF THE FUGITIVES.

                                 FROLLO
                        This gypsy’s name is Esmeralda. And 
                        we can spare your life. If you tell 
                        us where she is hiding.

                                 HOUSE MATRON
                        I don’t know who she is. 
                             (desperate)
                        I promise.

           Frollo struts the lengths of the hallways, wood floors CREAK 
           beneath his boots. Doors lead to rooms on both sides of him. 
           He peeks in their frames at neatly-tucked beds.

                                 FROLLO
                        Not the best business you run. If a 
                        perfectly respectable hotel doesn’t 
                        have any patrons.

           IN ONE ROOM: Frollo spots a CHILD’S SHOE dropped on the floor 
           carelessly. And on closer inspection, a bookcase which seems 
           to be slightly slanted. 

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        A glass of water would be nice. 

           The matron enters with a glass, followed by the guard. Frollo 
           places it on the bookcase. It slides, SCRAPING ALONG the top, 
           until it reaches the edge, and SHATTERS on the floor. 

           On Frollo’s cue, the guards SHOOT THROUGH THE BOOKCASE.

           The house matron bursts into tears, part-mourning, part-fear, 
           as blood seeps from underneath. 

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        You will let me know where the rest 
                        are, or my men won’t stop. 

           MOMENTS LATER: GYPSIES are pulled from hiding places. Men are 
           beaten. Women are manhandled. Olivier looks disgusted. 

                                 OLIVIER
                        Easy. That’s enough. Enough.

           But his guard doesn’t listen. The gypsies are dragged outside 
           and thrown into LARGE MILITARY BUSSES, bars on the windows. 

           Who knows where they’ll be disposed of.  
           INT. A SEEDY, UNDERGROUND DISCO. NIGHT.

           Debauchery and happiness as CLUB PATRONS grind on each other. 
           All races. All genders. All sexualities. 

           Without warning, the MILITARY, led by Olivier, bursts inside, 
           guns drawn, thrusting panicked people into handcuffs. 

           SHOTS ARE FIRED by some heartless guards, taking down people 
           desperately trying to flee them. 

           Despite his best efforts, Olivier fails to restrain his men.   

           EXT. DAMP PARIS STREETS. NIGHT.

           More PRISONERS are loaded into LARGE MILITARY BUSSES, shipped 
           out of the country or jailed.  

           EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE. NIGHT.

           Exhausted GOVERNMENT WORKERS fling DRAPED BODIES into graves. 

           INT. A RUNDOWN CAFÉ. DAY.

           Olivier, in his street clothes, slides a MANILA ENVELOPE over 
           to a very incognito Phoebus.  

                                 OLIVIER
                        Dozens of hideouts. Set to raid. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I don’t know how to repay you.  

           Phoebus smiles, appreciative. Olivier somberly nods back.   

           INT. UNDERGROUND TAVERN. NIGHT.

           BURSTING through doors of our speakeasy, Frollo and his guard 
           are surprised to discover the gypsies are one step ahead. 

           The stench of spilt alcohol is fresh. Beer mugs on the tables 
           perspire. SANCTUARY sloppily scribbled on coasters.

           Frollo can hardly conceal his disappointment.

                                 FROLLO
                        Good for them. It’s almost cute.

           And a relieved smile graces Olivier’s lips. 
           INT. COURT OF MIRACLES CYBER DEN. NIGHT.

           The guard shatters through the door of the defunct laundromat 
           turned cyber-studio, fire arms raised only to find:

           There is no equipment. The servers, monitors, and cables have 
           been removed. Instead, words of the revolution are graffitied 
           on every wall: SANCTUARY. SANCTUARY.

           Frollo’s lips contort grotesquely in anger.

           INT. THE UNDERGROUND FOSTER HOME. NIGHT.

           Frollo wanders around our underground foster home, empty and 
           recently vacated, other than some strewn children’s toys and 
           clothes abandoned in a haste. 

           Words again mock them upon the walls: SANCTUARY. SANCTUARY. 

                                 FROLLO
                        I know gypsies are fortune tellers.  
                        But something tells me they’re just 
                        not this good at it.

           Suspicious, Frollo sneers at his guard. Olivier numb to him. 

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        I will find out which one of you is 
                        responsible. Mark my words. 

           INT. A STUFFY MANSION. NIGHT. 

           CLOSE ON: a moustached PORTLY MAN’s horrid orgasm face.

           He removes himself from his bed, climbing off of a young and 
           battered GYPSY WOMAN. She forces a smile as he moves to the 
           bathroom, ripping off the condom, and relieving himself. 

                                 PORTLY MAN
                        Oh don’t pout, chicken. As long as 
                        you’re keeping my bed warm, nobody 
                        will find out you’re here.

           He washes his hands, looks up into the mirror--

           And written on the SHOWER CURTAIN opposite him, reading in a 
           reflection, is our rebel yell: SANCTUARY. 

                                 PORTLY MAN (CONT’D)
                        --fuck me.
           BURSTING FROM BEHIND THE CURTAIN is a MAN IN A QUASIMODO MASK 
           quickly pulling wire around the portly man’s fat neck. 

           His eyes go wide. Blood vessels pop. He stops breathing. 

           EXT. MÉTRO STATION. NIGHT.

           CLOSE ON: a MOBILE DEVICE streaming a BREAKING NEWSCAST...

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON SCREEN)
                        Leon Tan, Minister of the Interior, 
                        is the seventh from our Council of 
                        Ministers to be assassinated by the 
                        Court of Miracles. And the eleventh 
                        French diplomat.  

           PULLING BACK: the device is held by a SLIM WOMAN waiting for 
           her train. She suddenly realizes she’s alone. 

           She hears a rustle in the distance and moves further down the 
           platform. Another rustle, and she yanks a knife from her bag.

                                 SLIM WOMAN
                        I’m armed. I’m warning you. 

           Nobody is there. The train SCREAMS in and she hurries into an 
           empty car. The doors close behind her. 

           She sighs a breath of solace. 

           A short-lived calm. Turning to her left, approaching her, she 
           spots a MAN IN A QUASIMODO MASK. 

           She leaps to her feet and darts to the right, finding another 
           MAN IN A QUASIMODO MASK. Cornered by her assailants. 

                                 SLIM WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t ask to be appointed to the 
                        council. I’m still a patriot--

           INT. THE NEW UNDERGROUND SOMEWHERE. DAY.

           IN A DIM OFFICE: Phoebus hovers with Clopin over a FLOOR PLAN 
           of Notre Dame. Red checks signify where guards are stationed. 

           Behind them, Esmeralda is occupied by the TELEVISION:  

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON SCREEN)
                        Minister of Foreign Affairs, Cindy 
                        Moreau taken too soon--  

           Clopin smirks. Phoebus and Esmeralda aren’t as delighted.
                                 CLOPIN
                        And then there were eight.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        But still the Prime Minister isn’t 
                        stepping down. 

           Clopin refocuses their attention back to the floor plan.

                                 CLOPIN
                        The citizens see Notre Dame as our 
                        symbol of oppression. Frollo’s hub.  
                        They’ll stand beside us and fight. 
                        We can take it back for the people 
                        or we’ll burn it to the ground.  

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Burn it?

                                 ESMERALDA 
                        We inspire people to preserve our 
                        past not destroy it. 

                                 CLOPIN
                        I’m dying, Esmeralda. But I sure as 
                        Hell am not going before I see the 
                        change we fought for. If Notre Dame 
                        is the casualty for the future then 
                        I can go peacefully knowing that.

           IN THE OTHER ROOM: Quasimodo watches the same fear-mongering 
           NEWSCAST and ‘The Hunt for the Gypsy Fugitives.’ 

           His picture is displayed on the television:

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON SCREEN)
                        Quasimodo is a national threat. At 
                        risk of spreading disease, fueling 
                        terrorism, and capable of murder. 
                        Paris is on lockdown --  

           ON THE SCREEN: are flashes of death and war. The underground 
           found and destroyed. Gypsies dragged from their homes. Taken 
           into custody. Killed. A horrific new array of information.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Me. It’s me. Because of me.

           Quasimodo, nervously wrings his hands. He peeks into...

           THE OFFICE: where a now fiery argument between Esmeralda and 
           Clopin runs its course. 
                                 CLOPIN
                        This is going to sound crazy to you 
                        but hear me out. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Great start to win me over.

                                 CLOPIN
                        It’s only a matter of time before 
                        somebody gets to Quasimodo. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Your point?

                                 CLOPIN
                        Let’s embrace that. Put him at the 
                        front of the battle.  

                                 ESMERALDA
                        And our human casualty.

                                 CLOPIN
                        What did you think the cost would 
                        be to change the world?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I’d rather my life than his.  

                                 CLOPIN
                        You’ve always been special. Even at 
                        birth I saw you for what you were: 
                        a beautiful soul. A fighter. 
                             (beat)
                        History remembers the fighter that 
                        falls. Let them remember Quasimodo 
                        as the martyr that restored France.
                        We can’t afford that to be you. 
                             (honest:)
                        You’re too important. You can help 
                        us rebuild. 

           Esmeralda looks down at her TRINKET BRACELET.  

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I won’t let Quasimodo die for the 
                        choices I’ve made. 

                                 CLOPIN
                        Esmeralda.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        My mother would’ve wanted me to--
                                 CLOPIN
                        Gudule. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        What?

                                 CLOPIN
                        Your mother’s name was Gudule. You 
                        were stolen, Esmeralda. As a child. 
                        Don’t forget that.

           Eyes-moistening, knowing for the first time:

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Gudule? My mother--

                                 CLOPIN
                        She couldn’t care for you.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        You said you never knew her name.

                                 CLOPIN
                        Because I couldn’t let you go back. 
                        That wasn’t your destiny. This is. 
                        You were meant for so much more.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        That wasn’t your decision to make.

                                 CLOPIN
                        No. And that decision changed your 
                        life. But we’re just going to have 
                        to live knowing that.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Is she dead now? My mother--

           Clopin doesn’t respond. And now Esmeralda has her answer. 

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        Then I refuse to let Quasimodo die 
                        for the choices you’ve made.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Listen. Guys-- 

           Phoebus motions over at the door, and all three spy Quasimodo 
           eavesdropping, quickly piecing everything together.

           Conflicted, Quasimodo turns around and darts out of the room. 

           Esmeralda chases after him, following up the stairs, through 
           the upper hallways, right up to--
           THE FRONT DOOR: where Quasimodo throws his weight behind its 
           rusty latches, peeling them open, tears brimming his eyes.  

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Quasimodo, calm down! Wait--

                                 QUASIMODO
                        I’m the reason everyone is dying. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        That’s not true.  

                                 QUASIMODO
                        You promised me a better life. You 
                        promised I deserved more than what 
                        my Master gave me. Now you hide me 
                        under the streets. No sunlight. No 
                        beauty. No music. It’s no better 
                        than my prison at Notre-Dame.  

           Esmeralda can’t argue with him. 

                                 QUASIMODO (CONT’D)
                        You said that I would save Paris. 
                        But who will save me?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        We will. Fighting right beside you.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        You made me do the wrong thing! You 
                        made me turn my back on Frollo. MY 
                        FAMILY. You said you were family. 
                        And you lied to me.   

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I didn’t!

                                 QUASIMODO
                             (teary-eyed:)
                        There is so much I’ve never lived. 
                        Never felt. I don’t want to die.   
                             (resolute:)
                        But I don’t want you to die for me.  

           Quasimodo flings open the front door, and runs outside into:

           EXT. SOME FILTHY ARRONDISSEMENT. PARIS. DAY.

           Quasimodo storms through the alleys. He struggles to pull his 
           cloak over his face. Then discards it. Enjoys the feel of the 
           day’s sunlight on his skin. 
           Esmeralda is directly behind, right on his tail, panicking.   

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Stop! Wait. Please don’t--  

           She reaches him, a hand on his arm, but he flings her away.

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do this!

           Quasimodo abandons her, happening into a BUSY INTERSECTION.  

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        Come back--!

           But it’s too late. Traffic SCREECHES to a halt. DRIVERS HONK, 
           nearly colliding with him, swerving around each other. 

           The motorists, gradually, notice the face of the disrupter.

                                 DRIVER ONE
                        It’s the Hunchback! 

                                 DRIVER TWO
                        Call the police. 

                                 DRIVER THREE
                        Hide your children!!--  

           It’s a panic. Many people flee in all directions at sight of 
           their monster. Fearing for their lives. Believing the media.

           And Quasimodo, calm, just remains still, non-confrontational. 
           Standing in the traffic. Revealed in public. 

           Waiting for anything. To be taken down. Or taken back. 

           Police cars speed into the square, doors SLAM, weapons out:

                                 OFFICER
                        Don’t move! Don’t move!

           But of course, Quasimodo can’t hear them.

           IN A MATTER OF MINUTES: their BACK-UP arrives, with military 
           vehicles. The guard poised, guns drawn. Helicopters circling 
           in the air, searchlights aimed. 

           And Quasimodo still remains tranquil. An inner peace. 

           A LARGE CROWD has gathered, encircling the scene. As officers 
           try to clear the area, passionate protests erupt amongst the 
           witnesses on the street. 
                                 PEDESTRIAN
                        The Hunchback is innocent! 

                                 PEDESTRIAN TWO
                        Arrest him. He’s a walking plague. 

                                 PEDESTRIAN THREE
                        He’s just as human as any of us. 

                                 PEDESTRIAN TWO
                        He’s a disgusting monster.

                                 PEDESTRIAN
                        No more than you, asshole.

           Fists fly. Officers are quick on the scene to intervene. 

           BACK IN THE ALLEY: Phoebus arrives, tries to escort Esmeralda 
           further back into the shadows. Away from the chaos. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Please, just let him go.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        They’ll kill him. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Maybe not. We’ve gotten ourselves 
                        out of worse messes.

           She turns. Meets his eyes. Hers are incredibly determined. 

                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do this. I know what you’re 
                        thinking. And I beg you. Don’t.  

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I hoped I’d live to see that day of 
                        change. As long as those bells rang 
                        I had faith. Maybe I was wrong--  

           Phoebus leans in and kisses her deeply...

                                 PHOEBUS
                        In case I don’t get another chance 
                        to do that.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        What would happen if we could live 
                        forever?

                                 PHOEBUS
                        We’d melt into each other’s arms.
                                 ESMERALDA
                        Love is only a tree blooming green 
                        leaves over ruined hearts. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        But leaves eventually fall. And the 
                        heart is left in ruins again.

           Esmeralda unclasps her TRINKET BRACELET, hands it to him: 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I want you to hold onto this. I’ll 
                        get it next time I see you. That's 
                        how you know to not be afraid.

           A long, sad moment. They break hands. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Esmeralda, I--

           But she leaves him, elbowing through the CROWD OF SPECTATORS:

           ONTO THE CHAOTIC STREET, to protect Quasimodo, shielding him 
           with her own body. Her back is to him so he cannot understand 
           what she requests. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I am the gypsy fugitive, Esmeralda. 
                        Of the Court of Miracles. 

           Around her, the spectators FILM ON THEIR MOBILE DEVICES.

           Meanwhile, the perplexed, but fascinated, guard watch as she 
           extends her hands outwards, peacefully asking to be cuffed.  

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        I am exchanging my life for that of 
                        Quasimodo. Turning myself in.

           A buzz of excitement reverberates among the crowd.

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        You promised any illegals bringing 
                        the Court of Miracles into custody 
                        merited a pardon. And, in front of 
                        the eyes of all of Paris, Quasimodo 
                        brought me forth. And I expect your 
                        decency to honor those words.

           The officers inch forward, service rifles expertly aimed, but 
           timid and unstable on their feet, fearful, quite the contrast 
           to Esmeralda’s confident posture. 

           Her wrists still exposed. 
           She is quickly handcuffed and taken without any struggle. Our 
           Quasimodo is next. And dragged in the opposite direction. 

           No words are exchanged or spoken between the two as they go.

           INT. ESMERALDA’S ISOLATION UNIT. DAY.

           A LONG BUZZ. The cell door slides open. Rifles are trained on 
           Esmeralda, the guards protecting and covering--

           CLAUDE FROLLO as he struts inside. He can hardly believe the 
           sight of her. Overcome with joy to have her finally arrested. 
           And, at first glance, completely intoxicated by her beauty.

           Esmeralda sits in the corner of her cell, on the cold floor, 
           stripped mostly bare. Still, all grace, even in danger.

                                 FROLLO
                        I’m surprised. I really thought you 
                        had more fight left in you.

           He chuckles to himself.

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        How sad that we all have hearts. An 
                        unfortunate fate to have compassion 
                        kill you. And for some monster.

           She refuses to take his bait. Remains confidently aware. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Your men have tortured us. Beat us. 
                        Murdered our families. Destroyed my 
                        people. But the fight is not over.

                                 FROLLO
                        You think you are miserable, gypsy? 
                        You don’t know misery. My parents 
                        were ripped to shreds by your kind. 
                        My brother. My sanity. 

           He lulls closer, menacing, yet deeply taking in her scent.

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        Do you know what it’s like to pray 
                        to trade their lives for your own? 
                        Your salvation? Your immortality? 
                        To sell your soul to some god that 
                        can not bring them back?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I’ve known more loss, and love, in 
                        my lifetime than you ever will. 
                                 FROLLO
                        You know love? The affection that 
                        ugly hunchback feels for you? You 
                        call that -- love?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        You are the ugly one. I know every 
                        person on our streets. And you are 
                        the only monster among them. 
                             (venomous:)
                        You are a murderer. You are ugly. 
                        And old. And will die alone.

           Frollo hasn’t removed his eyes from her body. Wheels turning 
           in his head:

                                 FROLLO
                        And to think, I was about to offer 
                        to spare your life. The body they 
                        carry away in the casket doesn’t 
                        have to be yours. Lead me to the 
                        rest of them. You can be hidden. 
                        With me. Just like Quasimodo was. 

           She spits in his face. Frollo, actually, smiles at this.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        Death horrifies me less than you. 

                                 FROLLO
                        Suit yourself. Let’s put on a show. 
                        Let them see you die tomorrow.
                             (proudly:)
                        Then no one will have you. 

           Frollo removes himself. The jail cell SLAMS SHUT behind him. 
           His bodyguard on his tail. 

           Esmeralda is left alone with her final thoughts. 

           INT. THE NEW UNDERGROUND SOMEWHERE. NIGHT.

           Clopin’s reclined in the dark, with a dim lamp light his only 
           source to catch Phoebus entering, head bowed respectfully. 

           Clopin grimaces at his company. Mourning Esmeralda’s capture.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I can’t believe that I never told 
                        her how much I loved her.

                                 CLOPIN
                        Why would you let her go?
                                 PHOEBUS
                        There wasn’t a thing that either of 
                        us could have done to stop her.

                                 CLOPIN
                        You have balls coming back here.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Tomorrow at noon. Place du Parvis.  
                        They’re executing her. 

                                 CLOPIN
                        I won’t bring myself to watch.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I don’t plan to. I plan to stop it. 
                        I plan to take back Notre Dame like 
                        you and I designed. I have a group 
                        of men ready to fight with us.

           Clopin notices Phoebus gripping onto her TRINKET BRACELET:

                                 CLOPIN
                        It’s all my fault. All of her pain. 
                        I’m just a foolish man that tried 
                        rewriting fate. Maybe France wasn't 
                        meant to be saved. Maybe Esmeralda 
                        was destined to survive. 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Maybe.

                                 CLOPIN
                        And I’m just a coward.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        I know a way you can fix that.  

           INT. BELLTOWER. NOTRE DAME. DAY.

           Quasimodo’s legs and arms are shackled to the balcony of his 
           belltower. Frollo paces around him. Then lulls, right in his 
           line of sight, unavoidably smiling wide.

           Frollo motions to a GUARD, who swings up a LEATHER WHIP, and 
           CRACKS IT DOWN HARD. Lashing Quasimodo. He barely winces.

                                 FROLLO
                        It really does pain me that you’ve 
                        lost your way, my sweet boy.

           Quasimodo doesn’t meet his eyes. Another LASH. And ANOTHER. 
                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        Your punishment. For disobeying me. 
                        Is watching your friend die.

           He is LASHED again. Quasimodo numbly WHIMPERS.

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        May that inspire you, Quasimodo, to 
                        choose a more righteous path.

           EXT. PLACE DU PARVIS. NOTRE DAME. DAY.

           It is the day of reckoning. In the square outside Notre Dame, 
           a RAISED WOODEN STAGE was erected to present this execution. 
           Several LARGE WIDE ELECTRONIC SCREENS line the perimeter, so 
           everybody has a vantage point, much like at the Festival.

           THOUSANDS OF CITIZENS are crammed into every available space. 
           It seems as if all of Paris has come out to witness the gypsy 
           revolutionary be executed. Is it out of morbid fascination? 

           Or is it out of respect? 

           Many have their MOBILE DEVICES out, filming, posting on their 
           private pages. Above them, a drone flies, darting in and out,  
           filming the spectator event from the skies. 

           UP IN THE TOWER: Quasimodo remains chained, doomed to witness 
           the death of his friend. Emotionally exhausted. Helpless. 

           NOT FAR AWAY: in a secure government viewing booth, the Prime 
           Minister has an unobstructed sight line. 

           DOWN IN THE PLAZA: Esmeralda is escorted out of a police van, 
           hands cuffed behind her back. She is shepherded to the stage, 
           and bound, tightly, to a post. 

           IN THE CROWD: we spy Phoebus, veiled, a tear gently contours 
           his cheek, nervous but slyly tranquil. Oddly still. 

           Elsewhere, we spot Clopin. Wheels steadily turn in his head. 
           Something up their sleeves.

           BACK IN THE PLAZA: Notre Dame’s doors lurch open, and Frollo 
           sweeps down the steps, flanked by Olivier, and his guard. 

           Frollo grabs Esmeralda’s jaw, sensually, taking an unusually 
           close inspection of her, whispering in her ear:

                                 FROLLO
                        Any last words?
           He means her acceptance for his offer. But instead, she frees 
           her face from his grip, and addresses her final crowd:

                                 ESMERALDA
                        My name is Esmeralda. Of the Court 
                        of Miracles. I am a gypsy, like so 
                        many of you and our parents before 
                        us. My blood will be spilled today. 
                        Let that be symbolic of the blood 
                        of our people who fought for this 
                        country. For our future.

           Her face is BROADCAST LIVE onto the LARGE ELECTRONIC SCREENS.

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        We cannot allow this to be the end 
                        of the fight. That better day will 
                        come, for all of your children, as 
                        long as we never let them win. So, 
                        think of me. Think of Quasimodo. As 
                        the faces of civil war. The faces 
                        of displaced families and children 
                        everywhere. We must fight for our 
                        justice. Until we are no longer a 
                        country that marks our friends as 
                        our enemies because of the color of 
                        their skin, their religion, or the 
                        hunch in their back. We are human. 
                        And that is our one shared truth.

           UP IN THE TOWER: Esmeralda’s speech energizes Quasimodo. He 
           pulls at the chains that bind him, flailing, trying to free 
           himself with his brute strength. 

           DOWN IN THE PLAZA: the people of Paris are equally inspired. 
           They RAISE THEIR FISTS. A silent protest. In solidarity.  

           Frollo rolls his eyes. Firmly addressing his guard. 

                                 FROLLO
                        Captain Olivier.

           Olivier and his officers spread out: forming a FIRING SQUAD. 
           Their rifles aimed at Esmeralda. 

           Another tear escapes Phoebus’ eyes. Heavily breathing. Clopin 
           also chokes back emotion. Though they both do not move. 

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        On your call, Captain. 

           ABOVE THEM: Quasimodo BREAKS FREE OF THOSE CHAINS. His wrists 
           sore and bloody. 
           He throws his leg over the balustrade of the gallery, fastens 
           a rope upon a column, and shimmies down the Cathedral’s side, 
           like a raindrop. 

           DOWN IN THE PLAZA: Esmeralda stares straight into the barrels 
           of the guns, unwavering, wide-eyed. 

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        I will not ask again. Captain.

           Olivier pauses. Glances around at the CROWD OF PARISIANS who 
           stand in unity with this revolutionary. 

           He locks eyes with Phoebus in the audience, who nods at him. 
           Olivier nods back. A kind wink.

           And he lowers his weapon. He ejects the magazine from his gun 
           and empties the rounds from their chambers as they CLINK onto 
           the pavement.

           Olivier then raises his fist into the air. 

           One after another, his fellow guards do the same. Ammunition 
           on the ground. Fists in the air, rebellious. Standing down. 

           Esmeralda smiles, relieved. 

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        How dare you disobey a direct order 
                        from your government. Such a shame. 
                        You would have had a fine career.  

           Frollo pulls a HANDGUN from a holster beneath his jacket, and 
           aims at ESMERALDA’S CHEST. 

           Quasimodo hits the ground, darts to the stage, and pounces on 
           Frollo, overpowering him as the GUN FIRES. 

           THWAP. 

           Reflexively, some guards move to defend Frollo, but Quasimodo 
           quickly debilitates them with terrific blows of his fists. 

           Quasimodo flings Esmeralda on his back, carrying her past the 
           firing squad, and straight through the doors of Notre Dame. 

           Just past the threshold, he SHOUTS OUT AT THE CROWD:

                                 QUASIMODO
                        SANCTUARY! SANCTUARY! SANCTUARY! 

           This was all so rapidly accomplished, Frollo barely has time 
           to register the events. Not until he notices the crowd riled 
           up and roaring does he realize Quasimodo’s effect on them. 
                                 CROWD
                        SANCTUARY! SANCTUARY! SANCTUARY! 

           On that cue, Clopin and Phoebus lead forward their GYPSY ARMY 
           to storm Notre Dame in revolution: 

                                 CLOPIN
                        Attack! Save Esmeralda! Save Paris! 

           The gypsy army charges into the Place du Parvis, pouring onto 
           the steps of Notre Dame. Some revolutionaries pull over their 
           faces the now-iconic QUASIMODO MASKS. 

           Some officers try defending Notre Dame though, realizing they 
           spilled their bullets on the ground, are mostly helpless. The 
           people attack. Bloodying them. Tying up those who resist. 

           Frollo FIRES OFF A FEW SHOTS at the crowd before successfully 
           retreating with a couple members of his guard back into Notre 
           Dame, shutting its LARGE REINFORCED STEEL doors loudly. 

           Clopin provides the rebels and tramps with weapons. Some they 
           were able to smuggle into the scene. Others they forge out of 
           heavy items lying around.

                                 CLOPIN (CONT’D)
                        Kill the Minister! Save Quasimodo!

           Proving their loyalty to the cause, the MUTINOUS GUARDS strip 
           off their uniforms, joining the REVOLTING CROWD, and pounding 
           on the now-sealed Cathedral door.  

           NOT FAR AWAY: Madam Prime Minister is led away, to safety, by 
           her private infantry. 

           INT. NOTRE DAME. DAY.

           Frollo starts to trail Quasimodo and Esmeralda up the towers, 
           but Quasimodo has deadlocked those doors behind him.

                                 FROLLO
                        Quasimodo! Open these doors now!

           POUNDING ON THE CATHEDRAL DOOR terrifies Frollo. That massive 
           steel door is the only thing preventing his certain death.

           Frollo spins around to the cowardly guards that followed him 
           inside the church. 

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        Are you going to just stand there, 
                        and allow them to rip us apart? Or 
                        do you plan to escape?
           The soldiers reluctantly help Frollo try to break through the 
           sealed belltower doors. 

           INT. BELLTOWER. NOTRE DAME. DAY.

           HIGH IN THE BELLTOWER: Quasimodo gently rests Esmeralda down. 
           He discovers her blood has painted his hands red. 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Oh, Esmeralda -- 

           She reveals she was shot in her torso, choking back her pain, 
           and tears, but still demonstrating incredible strength. 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I’m fine. Quasimodo. You need to 
                        make sure that you’re safe. 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        I need to protect you. Protect us!

           Quasimodo runs to the balcony edge, horrified to find:

           IN THE PLAZA BELOW: the MOB has advanced to the main entrance 
           of the church, ascended the stairs, and started to dismantle 
           the steel doors with their levers and makeshift weapons.

           FIFTY STRONG-LIMBED MEN, with hammers and crowbars over their 
           shoulders, step from their ranks to destroy the front door. 

                                 CLOPIN
                        If the church is sacred, our people 
                        are also. If our people are not 
                        sacred, then neither is the church!

           But Quasimodo cannot hear any of it!

           BACK ON THE BALCONY: Quasimodo panics, assuming the GYPSY MOB 
           exists to harm Esmeralda and him. In his desperate moment, he 
           eyes the TWO LONG STONE RAIN-GUTTERS which discharge over the 
           front entrance. 

           This sparks an idea.  

           He rushes into the south belfry, which has been used to store 
           some FRENCH MILITARY ARMORY, and finds a LARGE VAT to light a 
           fire under, throwing in the vat any lead ammunition he finds.

           Quasimodo returns to the balcony edge, glancing over, nervous 
           to see that the mob is making progress, and has begun peeling 
           off pieces of metal. 
                                 QUASIMODO
                        We’re running out of time! TIME!

           His brute strength multiplied tenfold by the consciousness of 
           danger, he sprints back to the belfry, finds a long and heavy 
           loose beam, and drags it outside to the balcony edge. 

           Quasimodo heaves the beam over the balustrade surrounding the 
           platform, allowing it to drop into the abyss below. 

           CLOSE ON: its two-hundred foot fall. The enormous beam grazes 
           the cathedral wall and obliterates sculptured figures on its 
           gravity-fueled journey to the pavement. 

           IN THE PLAZA BELOW: only a FEW LUCKY PEOPLE glance up in time 
           to see a growing shadow cover them and safely move out of the 
           way before-- 

           SMASH. CRUNCH. CRACK. 

           TWO DOZEN MEN are FLATTENED ON THE STEPS of the church by the 
           heavy beam, which doesn’t lose momentum, and rebounds off the 
           steps into the LOITERING CROWD, mauling and breaking the legs 
           and arms of OTHER VAGABONDS retreating in all directions with 
           gut-wrenching CRIES OF TERROR. 

           Phoebus glances up alarmed, realizing only one man is capable 
           of such strength:

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Quasimodo doesn’t know it’s us. He 
                        thinks we’re attacking them. 

                                 CLOPIN
                        We have to get to him before Frollo 
                        does. Keep going.

           Clopin stays at the front. The mutinous guards have reloaded 
           their weapons, and SHOOT at the reinforced shut steel doors, 
           destroying the facade of the Cathedral, but bullets ricochet 
           away wildly. 

           PING. PING. PING.

                                 PHOEBUS
                        The beam over there --

                                 OLIVIER
                        Yes. Help me.

           The rebels pluck up their courage and hoist the weighty beam, 
           like a feather with one hundred vigorous arms, and thrust it 
           into the door furiously.
           As the beam strikes the door it DRONES like an ENORMOUS DRUM. 
           Notre Dame shakes top to bottom, rumbling echoes reverberate 
           from its deepest depths. 

           SUDDENLY FROM ABOVE: a SHOWER OF BRICKS begin assaulting upon 
           our REBEL ASSAILANTS. One by one, very specifically targeting 
           them. Pelting arms. Shoulders. Heads.   

           Now lies a heap of dead and wounded. Bleeding and panting. As 
           every eye now is directed to the top of the cathedral.  

           BACK ON THE BALCONY: Quasimodo pivots to check on Esmeralda, 
           who has propped herself up, bandaging her own wound. 

           Devoted to saving her life, Quasimodo further descends into a 
           state of panic and chaos. He sprints along the gallery, for a 
           minute, looking for other weapons to throw.

           Then he remembers: the MELTING LEAD IN THE BELLCHAMBER. 

           Quasimodo races to grab the vat of boiling metal, then brings 
           it across the towers to the TWO LONG STONE RAIN-GUTTERS. 

           BELOW IN THE PLAZA: the rain of bricks has ceased. Our REBELS 
           crowd again at the battering ram. Each man holds their breath 
           and gathers their strength to give ONE FINAL DECISIVE BLOW.

           They jolt the door hard enough to loosen its hinges, allowing 
           a small opening.

                                 CLOPIN
                        Phoebus!!-- 

           The men use their remaining strength to peel the opening wide 
           enough for Phoebus to squeeze his way inside. 

           Just as Phoebus extends a hand for Clopin to join him--

           Clopin and the rebels surrender HEART-RENDERING SHRIEKS, and 
           HOWLS more agonizing than any we have ever heard.  

           Those who were not screaming, lucky enough to be alive, stare 
           up to find TWO STREAMS OF MOLTEN LEAD pouring from the top of 
           the edifice onto the crowd. 

           Once the lead ceases, the SCREAMS SUBSIDE and, laying on the 
           steps, burned and dying, are our fallen revolutionary heroes. 
           MOANING IN AGONY from the red-hot hailstones that penetrated 
           their bodies.

           Throwing down weapons and the heavy beam by the dead bodies, 
           many of the survivors flee Notre Dame in a complete panic. 
           Phoebus spies, through a sliver in the door, Olivier rushing 
           to the aid of the wounded, stepping over his friend, Clopin, 
           lifeless on the steps. His final resting place.

           BACK IN THE BELLTOWER: Quasimodo is overjoyed that they won. 
           He rushes to Esmeralda’s side.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Esmeralda, we did it! They’re gone. 
                        Are you alright? 

                                 ESMERALDA
                        You are so brave, Quasimodo. Truly. 
                        You’re the savior of Paris.

           Behind Quasimodo, she spies that BREATHTAKING VIEW of Paris 
           he mentioned to her. 

           Esmeralda can hardly stand its splendor, totally misty-eyed.

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        Look at that view! You were right. 

                                 QUASIMODO
                        The sunlight.

                                 ESMERALDA
                        It’s enchanting. You really can see 
                        everything from up here.

           Quasimodo helps prop her up, angle her to see our lovely city 
           unadulterated. The Seine glistening in this daylight. Traffic 
           crawling along. Majestic rooftops. The distant Eiffel Tower.

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        You kept your promise to me.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        You love it?

                                 ESMERALDA
                        I’ve never seen anything. Anything 
                        this beautiful. 

           Amongst the splendor are patches of darkness. Areas destroyed 
           by fires. By rebellions. Scars on the face of Paris much like 
           scars on the face of Quasimodo. Obstructing so much beauty. 

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry we couldn’t spend more 
                        time together.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        We won. We can be here forever.
                                 ESMERALDA
                        When you look out at our city every 
                        morning. Walk in our streets. Don’t 
                        forget that I’m out there. Even if 
                        you don’t see me. I am thinking of 
                        you. I am so blessed I got to call 
                        you my friend. My family.

           She sadly reaches out, SIGNING WITH HER HANDS:

                                 ESMERALDA (CONT’D)
                        It’s not goodbye that way. 

           She raises her lips to kiss his cheek. Then brushes his hair, 
           gently, with her fingertips. 

           Her strength fades and, after a breath: her hand is lifeless.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Esmeralda? Esmeralda, please!--

           He shakes her. Tears fills his eyes. Her blood on his hands. 

                                 QUASIMODO (CONT’D)
                        Please wake up. Esmeralda?

           Quasimodo’s own strength fades. Breaks down. CRIES. WHIMPERS. 

           ENTERING FROM THE BELLTOWER: Frollo charges out, gun prepped. 
           Ready to defend himself. Ready to attack.

           But he lulls. He is pleased to learn Esmeralda, the fugitive 
           gypsy, is dead. Lying motionless at last after all the havoc 
           she caused. His mission is complete. He is satisfied.  

           And in this moment, a DEMONIC LAUGH escapes. A laugh that can 
           only come from a man who lost all semblance of humanity.

                                 FROLLO
                        Well there you have it, my boy. 

           Quasimodo can’t control his weeping.

                                 FROLLO (CONT’D)
                        All that fighting. And you’re left 
                        with nothing. You turned your back 
                        on me. On your country. And you’re 
                        repaid with death.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        I loved her.

                                 FROLLO
                        Gypsies are not capable of love.  
           Raising his furious eyes at him:

                                 QUASIMODO
                        Neither are you.

           Enraged, Quasimodo rushes at Frollo, gun flung to the ground, 
           hoists him into the air, and with hands upon his back dangles 
           him over the edge:

                                 FROLLO
                             (panicked)
                        Quasimodo. Don’t. You don’t want to 
                        hurt me. I took you in. Raised you. 
                        Tried to spare you from this pain.  

                                 QUASIMODO
                        You don’t know what man is truly 
                        capable of until they let their 
                        inner-beast free. 

           And with that, Quasimodo thrusts Frollo furiously, into the 
           abyss below. 

                                 FROLLO
                        Damnation! DAMNATION!

           A stone gargoyle under the balustrade breaks his fall. Frollo 
           clings to it with a frantic grip, begging for help. Quasimodo 
           peers over the edge, seething. A tear descends his cheek.

           Frollo desperately scrambles to climb on the gargoyle, making 
           incredible efforts to gain his footing, but his hand slips on 
           the smooth granite. 

           And Quasimodo watches him plummet.  

           Frollo falls, head downward with arms outstretched, spinning 
           several times, until he hits the pavement. Barely resembling 
           his evil self, like a crushed insect on the ground.

           There, Frollo is motionless at last.

           Quasimodo’s eyes move from the Notre Dame steps, and Frollo’s 
           body in a shapeless heap, to the beautiful eternally-sleeping 
           Esmeralda on the balcony.

                                 QUASIMODO
                        All that I ever loved lies on the 
                        ground before me.

           To the gargoyle nearby:

                                 QUASIMODO (CONT’D)
                        Why was I not made stone like you?
           ENTERING FROM THE BELLTOWER: our Phoebus reaches the balcony. 
           Sets eyes upon his dead love, Esmeralda, for the first time. 

           Phoebus inches over to her body, crumpling on top of her. His 
           SOBS are a painfully guttural sound.  

           Quasimodo moves to comfort Phoebus. Holds his hand tightly.

           EXT. NOTRE DAME. DAY.

           MOMENTS LATER: the steel doors of Notre Dame Cathedral swing 
           open. Stepping out, squinting in the sunlight are our heroes: 
           Phoebus. And Quasimodo, who cradles Esmeralda. 

           Quasimodo, carrying Esmeralda’s limp, body is displayed upon 
           the LARGE ELECTRONIC SCREENS lining Place du Parvis. 

           Phoebus and Quasimodo carefully step over the bodies of their 
           fallen comrades, the litter of destruction in the plaza. 

           THOUSANDS OF CITIZENS witness the scene. Some survivors from 
           the gypsy army. Some spectators. Some officers. Some gypsies.

           All are human. And that is their shared truth. 

           As Esmeralda had so eloquently inspired in them.

           The CROWD parts, making way for Quasimodo to carry Esmeralda 
           through, with Phoebus a few steps behind. As they part, they 
           gradually begin to kneel. Bowing their heads in reverence. 

           Again, they RAISE THEIR FISTS into the air. Showing the fight 
           is not over. But this battle has been won. 

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK:

           OVER BLACK, WE HEAR: MAJESTIC BELLS of CATHÉDRALE NOTRE-DAME 
           routinely striking the morning hour. 

                                 PHOEBUS (V.O.)
                        It begins and ends with the bells. 
                        A gypsy. And a hunchback.  

           EXT. CATHEDRALE NOTRE-DAME DE PARIS. DAY.

           CLOSE ON: Phoebus’s LARGE EYES, staring up at the Notre-Dame 
           Cathedral. Thoroughly enjoying the CHIMES as they sound. 

                                 PHOEBUS (V.O.)
                        The bells are our hope. If only for 
                        a new hour. A new day.  
           PULLING BACK: Phoebus is as handsome as ever. Just wiser now. 
           Worldlier. A well-worn soul is sketched into his appearance. 

           Phoebus is among a SMALL THRONG of people who have stopped to 
           listen to the BELLS. Almost paying a respect, before keeping 
           on with their days. 

           SUPER: A FEW TOMORROWS THEREAFTER.

                                 PHOEBUS (V.O.)
                        A new Paris. And our new France.

           As Phoebus continues down an avenue of Île de la Cité, behind 
           him, we earn a crisper view of the Notre-Dame wreckage, under 
           an extensive restoration to its former glory. 

           Its architecture is wounded, but still, undeniably stunning. 

           EXT. DAMP STREETS OF PARIS. DAY.

           Phoebus wanders through the bustling streets of Paris. A warm 
           day. He wears shorts, proudly revealing his artificial limb.  

           GYPSY AND PARISIAN KIDS laugh and safely play together in the 
           streets. OFFICERS stand on each corner, positioned with their 
           service rifles, but their judicial aggression abandoned.  

                                 PHOEBUS (V.O.)
                        Hope changes the world. Gives us a 
                        reason to fight. To survive. Build 
                        a better future. 

           On every street corner: ELECTRONIC ADVERTS display footage of 
           Quasimodo from the attack on Notre-Dame, hurling objects down 
           to the streets below, delivering fatal blows. 

           And below it: THE HUNCHBACK. WANTED FOR MURDER.

           Quasimodo is still considered an active fugitive. 

           INT. A CHIC CAFÉ. DAY.

           Phoebus squeezes through a CROWD that has gathered to watch a 
           LARGE TELEVISION hung above the register...

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON SCREEN)
                        Our open election was scheduled for 
                        the first Tuesday of next month. We 
                        will elect the first Prime Minister 
                        after Louise Deete who was arrested 
                        for treason and sentenced to death. 
           Men and women, Parisians and gypsies alike, smile with hope. 

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON SCREEN) (CONT’D)
                        Polling shows Socialist Kent Marcus 
                        with a sweeping lead, whose popular 
                        platform promises opening borders, 
                        advancing paths to citizenship, and 
                        dismissing the controversial GENEXX 
                        insemination process-- 

           Phoebus buys a large cup of coffee. And continues on his way. 

                                 PHOEBUS (V.O.)
                        As long as those bells ring we must 
                        not lose our faith that better days 
                        will come for all of us. 

           The recognizable sound of CHILDREN LAUGHING pulls us into...

           INT. A PARISIAN FOSTER HOME. DAY.

           A WARM AND INVITING LIVING ROOM: eclectic mix-and-match decor 
           with TOYS and CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS strewn on the floor. As our 
           Phoebus emotionally, and sweetly, tells his stories to...

           A GROUP OF ORPHANS gathered at his feet. We recognize some of 
           the children from our journey. From the underground home: the 
           TWIN BOYS, and THE GIRL WITH THE LARGE PINK BOW. Now older. 

           We realize Phoebus has been wavering between thoughts in his 
           head and his storytelling: 

                                 PHOEBUS
                        Those bells gave a gypsy courage to 
                        change the world. The gypsy moved a 
                        Hunchback to inspire the people.

           The future of Paris now given the chance to build a life for 
           themselves. Above ground.

                                 PHOEBUS (CONT’D)
                        And the Hunchback rang the bells.

           EXT. MONTMARTRE. DAY.

           Phoebus stands on Montmartre, top of their world, overlooking 
           this glorious city. And just how far his people have come.

                                 PHOEBUS (V.O.)
                        Nobody has seen the Hunchback since 
                        the day Esmeralda died.
           Looking down, he holds Esmeralda’s TRINKET BRACELET. Twirling 
           its facets between his fingertips.

                                 PHOEBUS (V.O.)
                        Quasimodo became our great legend. 
                        A symbol of peace.

           Phoebus takes it all in, enjoying warm sunlight on his face. 

                                 PHOEBUS (V.O.)
                        Some people say the groundskeepers 
                        found Esmeralda’s crypt unsealed. 
                        Inside, two skeletons were clasped 
                        in the arms of the other. One: the 
                        gypsy Esmeralda. The other: a man 
                        with a crooked spine, who crawled 
                        in to spend eternity holding hands 
                        with his lost love. 

           Quasimodo steps up next to Phoebus. A fond smile exchanged.

                                 PHOEBUS (V.O.)
                        When they pulled their hands apart, 
                        the Hunchback’s skeleton is said to 
                        have turned to dust.

           The two revolutionary friends marvel at the view. Misty-eyed. 

                                 PHOEBUS (V.O.)
                        But that’s a story for another day.

           PULLING OFF OUR HEROES RAPID-FIRE: we’re soaring above Paris, 
           flying over rooftops, stalled traffic, parks, Champs-Élysées, 
           the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and off in the distance, on the 
           Seine, our Cathedrale Notre-Dame watches over it all. 

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.
