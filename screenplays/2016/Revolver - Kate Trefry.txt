           TICKING. And the sound of GUITARS being TUNED.

           INT. WEST HIGH SCHOOL MUSIC ROOM - DAY

           A 7 inch RECORD is slid out of a red and white SLEEVE and 
           onto a battered RECORD PLAYER. 

           A SWITCH is flipped. The record spins. NEEDLE drops. Static, 
           then SHE LOVES YOU by The Beatles begins to play.

                                 RECORD PLAYER
                        You think you lost your love/Well I 
                        saw her yesterday...

           A hand turns up the volume. 

                                 RECORD PLAYER (CONT’D)
                        It’s you she’s thinking of/And she 
                        told me what to say...

           A WOMAN’S FIGURE moves around the class room, visible only in 
           glimpses as she organizes RECORDS, SHEET MUSIC, INSTRUMENTS. 
           She passes in front of a CHALKBOARD. Written on it: “Music is 
           the silence between notes” -Mozart 

                                 RECORD PLAYER (CONT’D)
                        She said she loves you/And you know 
                        that can’t be bad....

           The figure pauses at a PIANO and PLAYS ALONG. Her face is 
           hidden by hair falling from her black ribbon tied bun.

                                 RECORD PLAYER (CONT’D)
                        She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah...

           On the wall above her, a clock TICKS, the second hand 
           sweeping forward. 

                                 RECORD PLAYER (CONT’D)
                        Y-Yeah y-yeah y-yeah y-yeah

           The RECORD SKIPS. The piano playing pauses. Suddenly, the 
           entire room QUIVERS violently. GUITARS CLATTER to the floor. 
           CRACKS bloom on the walls.

           The ticking gets LOUDER. 

           The record JUMPS, the needle SCRATCHING, distorting the song.

                                 RECORD PLAYER (CONT’D)
                        Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...
           Something hulking moves in the edge of the window. The woman 
           turns to look outside.

           A small ELEPHANT walks slowly past. 

           Her feet leave BLOODY stamps in the dirty snow. A MASS lays 
           motionless on the ground nearby. The TICKING is deafening.

           The room LURCHES again--

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           A teenage girl JERKS awake beneath flannel BLANKETS pulled up 
           over her head. This is JANE (17). Static BUZZES from the 
           1960’s CLOCK RADIO pressed against her face. She looks at the 
           time: 6:45. She pulls the blankets down. 

           Her room is a mess of BEATLEMANIA and black and white PHOTOS.

           She sits up, rubs her eyes. She fiddles with the dial of the 
           radio, singing quietly, like she’s memorizing something. 

                                 JANE
                        Eight stars of gold on a field of 
                        blue/Alaska's flag, may it mean to 
                        you...

           A DJ’s voice suddenly breaks through static.

                                 RADIO
                        ...it’s another strange Monday in 
                        Anchorage on this June 27 in our 
                        year of the lord 1966. 

           Jane sorts through a pile of WATCHES in a BOWL. She picks one 
           and straps it to her wrist, still murmuring.

                                 JANE
                        The gold of the early sourdough's 
                        dreams/The precious gold of the 
                        hills and streams...

                                 RADIO
                        We ended last night with a final 
                        request from our mystery caller, 
                        going out, as always, to Marilyn. 

           Jane digs through her UNDERWEAR DRAWER. She pulls out a pair 
           of PANTIES and holds them up: GEORGE is written on the 
           waistband in pink.
                                 RADIO (CONT’D)
                        So how bout we start today with a 
                        different beat from the same group.

           Jane shoves the underwear back in, past a thick ENVELOPE with 
           a UC BERKELY EMBLEM and pulls out another PAIR, also with 
           GEORGE written, but in purple. 

                                 RADIO (CONT’D)
                        This is Max Best saying good 
                        morning, pretty babies, and 
                        remember: wherever you are, 
                        whatever you’re doing...

           Jane pulls the underwear on.

                                 RADIO (CONT’D)
                        ...this is only the beginning.

           I SAW HER STANDING THERE by The Beatles plays. Jane sings 
           along as she puts on a knee length SKIRT and BUTTON UP with 
           MEL’S ARCTIC FURRIER on the pocket.

                                 JANE
                        Well she was just seventeen/You 
                        know what I mean...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        TURN THAT SHIT OFF NOW.

           Jane sighs and CLICKS the radio off.

           She looks at herself in the MIRROR for a moment, smoothing 
           her hair, humming under her breath. 

                                 JANE
                        The brilliant stars in the northern 
                        sky: the Bear, the Dipper, and 
                        shining...

           She falters. She glances at piece of PAPER taped to the wall.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        High.

           She smiles at the mirror broadly, falsely. 

           INT. ELI’S ROOM - DAY

           Jane enters what looks like a mad scientist’s lab: BATTERIES, 
           PERIODIC TABLES, JARS of unrecognizable powders and slimes.
           One wall is badly burned. She passes an empty BED and goes 
           straight to the closet and opens the door. A pile of BLANKETS 
           is on the floor.

                                 JANE
                        Daylight in the swamp, kid.

           The pile GROANS.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Can’t hide from the day. 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY 

           CALIFORNIA DREAMING on the radio. Jane hums along as she 
           serves eggs with the ease of an experienced waitress. FRANK 
           (43, looks like he hasn’t slept in 2 years) doesn’t look up 
           from his NEWSPAPER, but ELI (15), stares at his plate.

                                 ELI
                        When are you going to start making 
                        bacon again?

                                 JANE
                             (from the kitchen)
                        When it doesn’t require the taking 
                        of sentient life.

           Frank snorts, turns the page of his paper. 

                                 FRANK
                        You ready for your brunch?

                                 JANE
                        Yeah.

                                 FRANK
                        Got your song memorized, know what 
                        you’re gonna say? 

                                 JANE
                        Yep.  

           Jane starts packing lunches. She clears her throat.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        So, um, Patty leaves next weekend 
                        for flight attendant school. 

                                 FRANK 
                        Huh.
                                 JANE
                        So a bunch of us were going to the 
                        park for a Midnight Sun Party...

                                 FRANK
                        Doesn’t sound like something that 
                        squares with a ten o clock curfew. 

                                 ELI
                        You know, Jim was riding his bike 
                        through the park last weekend? Saw 
                        a bunch of weirdoes camped out. 

           Jane shoots him an incredulous look. He points at his plate 
           and mouths “BACON.” Frank shakes his head, not looking up.

                                 FRANK
                        Goddamned draft dodgers creeping to 
                        Canada, while that pansy Johnson...

           He COUGHS aggressively.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Noise is giving me indigestion. 
                        Sounds like the end of the world. 

           He switches the radio station to the NEWS.

                                 RADIO
                        ...American forces are still 
                        holding the city of Hue...

                                 FRANK
                        You can take Patty to lunch like a 
                        regular person. Have a little mercy 
                        on your reputation.

           A car HONKS in the driveway. Frank stands and looks at Jane 
           for the first time. He points at her skirt.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        That a joke? 

           She sets her jaw, glaring. He glares back. She holds out his 
           lunch bag.

                                 JANE
                        I’ll change. 

           He grabs the bag and leaves, slamming the door. Eli looks up.

                                 ELI
                        What an asshole.
           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Jane drops a needle on a RECORD. I SAW HER STANDING THERE 
           picks up right where it left off, and plays very, very loud. 

                                 RECORD PLAYER
                        And the way she looked was way 
                        beyond compare...

           Jane slips on a WAY SHORTER SKIRT, pea coat, and go-go boots. 
           She undoes her hair, draws cat-eyeliner across her lids and 
           lights a cigarette, fully transformed.

           EXT. TRUCK - DAY

           Jane tries to start the truck, Eli sits shotgun, staring out 
           the window glumly.

                                 JANE
                        C’mon girl. C’mon, goddamnit...

            Eli shakes his head. 

                                 ELI
                        Sometimes I really just can’t 
                        believe this is my life.

                                 JANE
                        Well, if you didn’t want to spend 
                        the summer doing community service, 
                        you shouldn’t have blown up the gym 
                        lockers

                                 ELI
                        If they didn’t want me to blow up 
                        the gym lockers, they should’ve 
                        locked up the sodium before trying 
                        to force me to play badminton.

           The truck CHOKES, SPUTTERS. Eli looks hopeful.

                                 ELI (CONT’D)
                        Looks like you just can’t take me 
                        today...

           The truck ROARS to life, Elvis BLASTS. Eli sighs. Jane SLAMS 
           on the gas and a RATTLE comes from behind. She looks back: a 
           BIKE slides around the truck bed.

                                 JANE
                        Goddamnit, Eli, you don’t take that 
                        thing out of there, I’m chucking it 
                        in the inlet. 
           She glances at her watch and speeds up as she takes a corner.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           The music continues as the truck passes through the 
           earthquake scarred town: collapsed houses, construction, 
           whole forests dead, bogged in brackish water. 

           EXT. TRUCK - DAY

           PATTY (18, big hair, pure sex) bounces down the driveway, 
           nearly bursting out of her red hot pants and tiny BUN DRIVE-
           IN T-shirt. She slides into the truck.

                                 PATTY
                        Well if it isn’t the Future Miss 
                        Fur Rondy, tardy as usual. You 
                        ready for the Big Brunch?

                                 JANE
                        Can it.

           Jane hands her a piece of toast. Patty throws it out the 
           window.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        What the hell, Patts?

                                 PATTY
                        What the hell yourself? I almost 
                        ate that. You know I’m reducing. 
                        Gotta make weight for Delta. 

                                 JANE
                        It’s really sick they make you do 
                        that. 

                                 PATTY
                        Tell me about it. I’m not supposed 
                        to drink beer, either.

                                 ELI
                        Hi Patty. 

                                 PATTY
                        Hey firebug. How’s the National 
                        Defense racket? 

                                 ELI
                        Working on a self-guiding missile. 
                                 PATTY
                        I bet you are. 

           She puts red lipstick on expertly as Jane pulls up to

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           BARBARA (18, a thick redhead, tougher than she looks) jogs to 
           the truck in a cannery uniform. 

           INT. TRUCK - DAY

           Barbara slides onto Patty’s lap, grabs a piece of toast and 
           starts eating.

                                 BARBARA 
                        Good morning your highness. You get 
                        fitted for your fur bikini yet?

                                 JANE
                        You know, they can’t make me wear 
                        that thing. First amendment makes 
                        it illegal. It’s against everything 
                        I believe in. 

                                 PATTY
                        Oh Jesus, loosen up. No one’s 
                        asking you to lie, steal, fuck, 
                        fight, eat meat or have fun. An 
                        hour with a little beaver on your 
                        beaver won’t kill you.

                                 JANE
                        Be more disgusting.

                                 PATTY
                        I think it’s righteous. Hell, I’ll 
                        wear it. Bring it to the park, I’ll 
                        wear that thing tonight.

           Jane says nothing.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Oh no. You’re shitting me.

                                 JANE
                        I just have to be back by curfew.

           Patty snorts.
                                 PATTY
                        Curfew. What a load of fascist 
                        bullshit. Hey Eli, have you ever 
                        had a curfew?

                                 ELI
                        Uh, no.

                                 PATTY
                        Exactly. You’re fifteen, convicted 
                        arsonist, possible sociopath, never 
                        had a curfew. You know why? 

           He shakes his head. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Because the man isn’t afraid of 
                        you. He’s afraid of us. Of our 
                        power. The power of these. 

           She reaches around and grabs Barbara’s boobs.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        And he’s really fucking scared of 
                        this--

           She starts to reach for Barbara’s lap. Jane SMACKS her hand. 

                                 JANE
                        Thanks for the gross lesson, Pat!

                                 PATTY
                        It’s true, Janie, and you know it. 
                        It’s like he thinks can control you 
                        as long as he keeps you a virgin.

           Jane screeches to a stop at a random stretch of road.

                                 JANE
                        Out, Eli.

                                 ELI
                        This is like half a mile away--

                                 JANE
                        Out! 

           He sighs and gets out. Jane keeps driving.  

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        My dad has nothing to do with my 
                        virginity. 
                                 PATTY
                        God I hope not. 

                                 JANE
                        You know what I mean.

                                 PATTY
                        Sure. You’re just saving yourself 
                        for George Harrison, which is way 
                        more healthy and normal.

                                 BARBARA
                        I think it’s romantic.

                                 JANE
                        I’m not saving myself for anyone. I 
                        just think that over the course of 
                        our lives, we could sleep with 
                        dozens of guys, or in your case, 
                        hundreds-- 

           Patty flips her off. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        --and the only one you’re 
                        guaranteed to remember is the 
                        first. 

                                 PATTY
                        See, that’s your problem. He’s got 
                        you totally brainwashed with all 
                        that “your cherry is a fancy gift 
                        for a special man” horseshit. Like 
                        your body is just on loan from a 
                        mythical future husband, and your 
                        job is to keep it clean for him.

           Beat. 

                                 BARBARA
                        What the hell are you talking 
                        about?

                                 JANE
                        Seriously Patty, ever since your 
                        sister got back from college you’ve 
                        been like fucking professor 
                        suffragette. 

                                 PATTY
                        My point is, we got the Pill now. 
                        Balling doesn’t have to bond you to 
                        someone forever anymore. And thank 
                        God. I mean, hell my first was-
                                 BARBARA
                        Marty Berkins. 

                                 PATTY
                        Marty goddamn Berkins! Fourth of 
                        July. Disaster. He got scared by a 
                        firework and went off like a pop 
                        gun after twenty seconds. And 
                        that’s just how it is. It doesn’t 
                        have to be the guy you marry. 
                        Right, Barb?

                                 BARBARA
                        Well, I mean, I’m pretty sure I’m 
                        going to marry Ted--

                                 PATTY
                        Ugh, shut up.

                                 JANE
                        Look, it’s not about the Pill, I 
                        just don’t want be thirty or fifty 
                        or something and think back to 
                        moment I lost it and be stuck with 
                        Marty Berkins’ sweaty face grunting 
                        over me. No offense. 

           Jane stops outside THE GREAT ALASKAN SALMON CANNERY.

                                 PATTY
                        Offense fucking taken, Jane. Jesus. 
                        But if you spend your sex life 
                        waiting for a Beatle to swoop in, 
                        you’re going to die a virgin. And 
                        there’s already too much tragedy in 
                        the world for that. 

                                 BARBARA
                        I’m not saying she’s right, Janie, 
                        but you’ll never meet anyone if you 
                        stay locked in with your dad. 

           Barbara jumps out.

                                 BARBARA (CONT’D)
                        So see you tonight!

           Jane continues driving.

                                 JANE
                        I can’t believe she’s marrying Ted.
                                 PATTY
                        I want you to think about coming to 
                        Delta with me. 

           Jane laughs.

                                 JANE
                        You just don’t want to be the only 
                        one on a diet. 

                                 PATTY
                        I’m serious, Jane. Think about it: 
                        fly all over the world, meet new 
                        people, see new things. I mean, if 
                        you’re not going to Berkley--

                                 JANE
                        I can’t just run away, Patty.

                                 PATTY
                        You’re almost 18! It’s called 
                        growing up! Look, I know you worry 
                        about them, but what else are you 
                        gonna do? Stay? Go to state school, 
                        marry fuckin Muffy D the furrier, 
                        have kids, die? 

           EXT. THE BUN DRIVE-IN - DAY

           The truck pulls up to a red and white building. The first 
           story is painted with dancing hamburgers. The second story 
           has KFQD stenciled above a window where a DJ booth is 
           visible.

                                 PATTY
                        You gotta get out of here, Jane. 
                        This place is killing you. And the 
                        freakiest part is you don’t even 
                        realize it. 

           Jane stares out the windshield. A shred of black trash bag 
           flutters down the sidewalk like a ribbon. She looks suddenly 
           at her watch.

                                 JANE
                        I gotta go. I can’t--

                                 PATTY
                        Be late. Yeah. I know. 

           Patty slams the door. Jane leans out the window.
                                 JANE
                        Hey and quit teasing Eli! 

           Patty doesn’t look back.

                                 PATTY
                        Who says I’m teasing?

           EXT. DOWNTOWN - DAY

           Jane jogs past construction, debris. Everything around her is 
           healing, blooming. She sings under her breath.

                                 JANE
                        The Bear, the Dipper, and 
                        shining...

           EXT. MELS ARCTIC FUR FACTORY - DAY

           A brick building. On top is a huge STATUE of Atlas holding up 
           a GLOBE painted streaky brown (supposed to look like “a world 
           of fur.” Actually looks like a ball of shit.) Jane enters 
           through a back door.

           INT. MELS ARCTIC FUR FACTORY (BACKROOM) - DAY

           Bleakly lit, crammed with PELTS, SEWING MACHINES and tortuous 
           looking tanning TOOLS. Jane CLOCKS IN and hurries into

           INT. MELS ARCTIC FUR FACTORY (SHOWROOM) - DAY

           A faux log cabin packed with FURS, SOUVENIRS, and startled 
           looking TAXIDERMIED ANIMALS. SINATRA on the radio.

           MUFFY D (20, thick neck, bad hair), wearing a fur trimmed 
           VEST and HEADBAND, rings up a BONE HANDLED KNIFE for a chunky 
           TOURIST WOMAN. 

                                 MUFFY D
                         Gorgeous taste, ma’am. This here 
                        is an authentic uusik, hand carved 
                        by genuine Eskimos. Very special 
                        bone, from the male walrus only, if 
                        you catch my meaning...

                                 TOURIST WOMAN
                             (giggling hysterically)
                        Oh my! 

           Jane rolls her eyes as the woman exits. Muffy turns to her.
                                 MUFFY D 
                        Yessir, those walrus dicks just 
                        about sell themselves. Speaking of 
                        which, when you gonna let me take 
                        you out for a burger, Jane?

                                 JANE
                        Never.

                                 MUFFY D
                        Your loss, honey. You know why they 
                        call me Muffy D, right? 

           Jane ignores him. He leans in.

                                 MUFFY D (CONT’D)
                        It’s short...
                             (Whispering)
                        For Muff Diver.

                                 JANE
                        Guess it’s true what they say, you 
                        really are what you eat. 

                                 MUFFY D
                        You think you’re so cool because 
                        Mel nommed you Miss Fur Rondy? News 
                        flash, Jane, the only reason he 
                        hasn’t fired you is ‘cuz he feels 
                        sorry for you. 

           She stares at him for a moment.

                                 JANE
                        You know why people really call you 
                        Muffy D? Because that dumb fucking 
                        haircut makes it look like you’ve 
                        got earmuffs on.

                                 MEL (O.S.)
                        Jane, can I see you in my office?

           She walks out. Muffy D immediately turns to a mirror and 
           starts smoothing down the hair around his ears. 

           INT. MEL’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Jane sits across a desk from MEL (43), who wears an 
           elaborate, slightly gruesome FOX HEAD HAT. 

           Behind him, an antler CLOCK hangs above a row of framed 
           cheesecake POSTERS. Jane tries not to stare at the clock. Mel 
           studies her a beat, then sighs.  
                                 MEL
                        What do you see when you look up 
                        there, Jane?

           He points to one of posters: a winking, rosy cheeked girl in 
           a fur bikini and a banner reading MISS FUR RONDY 1955.

                                 JANE
                        Um...Your wife?

                                 MEL
                        Because most people look at Miss 
                        Fur Rondy, they see the fur bikini, 
                        the free carton of Lucky Strikes, 
                        the glamor of the Miners and 
                        Trappers ball and think that’s what 
                        its about, but it’s not.

           He leans back in his chair. 

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        In the early days, dozens died 
                        every winter from exposure and 
                        disease. So in 1933, Fur Rendezvous 
                        was started to boost morale and 
                        celebrate life. And Miss Fur Rondy 
                        part of that tradition. 

                                 JANE
                        Right.

                                 MEL
                        She’s a symbol of all the good 
                        things about our town. Pluck and 
                        gumption and overcoming the odds!  
                        It’s a lot of responsibility. But 
                        the most important part is a fun 
                        attitude. Making people smile. 
                        Being an inspiration. And that goes 
                        double since this is our first 
                        Rondy after the quake. Now, it’s no 
                        secret Debra has...feelings about 
                        me picking you for this. 

           Misinterpreting her look of dismay, he continues.

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        And I know it’s been hard couple 
                        years for your family. Just awful. 
                        But I nominated you for a reason: I 
                        think this will be a good thing. 
                        For everyone. So. 

           He pushes his chair back and stands. 
                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        You’ve worked real hard to prepare, 
                        so use today’s brunch to show 
                        everyone you’re ready. Especially 
                        Debra. And when you look at that 
                        poster, you know what I want you to 
                        see?

                                 JANE
                        Gumption?

                                 MEL
                        Yourself. Just be yourself. 

           Mel opens a drawer, takes out an OTTER SCARF (head attached) 
           and tosses it to her. 

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        Take Lucky Sam.

                                 JANE
                        Oh...Thanks. 

           Jane attempts a smile. Mel winks heartily at her. 

                                 MEL
                        You look good in fur, Queen Jane. 

           INT. TRUCK - DAY

           Jane lights a cigarette and starts the truck.

                                 RADIO
                        ...We’re ten hours into another 
                        work week; but I don’t want to talk 
                        about it, and I know you don’t want 
                        to hear about it, so let’s just 
                        leave it at this... 

           Music Cue: MONDAY, MONDAY by the Mamas and Papas.

           Jane turns it up.

           INT. DJ BOOTH - DAY

           A pair of two-tone blue VANS HIGH TOPS with red laces tap to 
           the beat next to an “ON AIR” sign. 

           MAX BEST (23) slips off his headphones. His outfit is 
           meticulously cool: military jacket, those sneakers, a T SHIRT 
           reading THE WHITE SPOT CAFE above an elephant silhouette. He 
           lights a cigarette and pushes his chair back. 
           The booth bears scars of the earthquake: shoddily patched 
           cracks, makeshift reinforcements. Full ashtrays, empty coffee 
           cups, unpaid BILLS. This is not a thriving radio station.

           But Max SINGS as he scoots along shelves of 45s, scribbling a 
           PLAYLIST. Suddenly OTTO (40), the mustachioed station manager 
           busts in.

                                 OTTO
                        Nice shoes. 

                                 MAX
                        Thanks. Got ‘em special from 
                        California. They call them “Vans”--

                                 OTTO
                        They make you look like a 
                        cheerleader.

           He tosses a slim packet of PAPER onto Max’s lap. 

                                 OTTO (CONT’D)
                        We need to talk. 

           A RED PHONE by the turntable rings. Max holds a finger up and 
           picks up the phone. 

                                 MAX
                        KFQD Anchorage, the only way to 
                        rock in the great white north.

           Max looks pointedly at Otto.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Sorry honey, we don’t play Dylan. I 
                        know. Blame it on the man, baby.

           Max hangs up. He turns back to Otto.  

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Did you see that? What just 
                        happened?

                                 OTTO
                        Don’t.

           Max turns away and pulls a 45 off the shelf: WILD THING (THE 
           TROGGS). Otto picks up the playlist and reads, shaking his 
           head.

                                 OTTO (CONT’D)
                        See, this is what I’m talking 
                        about: The McCoys, The Who, The 
                        Blue Chips...what are you, high? 
                                 MAX
                        Not yet. Why, are you holding? 

           Otto takes The Troggs and hands him I’M A BELIEVER (THE 
           MONKEES). 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Look, I’m not trying to spin Blowin 
                        in the Wind. I’m not talking about 
                        political Dylan, I’m talking about 
                        electric Dylan, Highway 61, Blonde 
                        on Blonde. The kids want-

                                 OTTO
                        I don’t care what the kids think 
                        they want. Elmendorf Airforce Base 
                        employs twenty percent of this 
                        godforsaken town, we’re at war, and 
                        he’s a fucking pinko. Basies hate 
                        Dylan. You know what Basies love?

           Max tosses THE MONKEES in the trash.

                                 MAX
                        I’m not playing the Green Beret 
                        Song. 

                                 OTTO
                        KWHL plays Green Beret.

           Max pulls out MY GENERATION (THE WHO).

                                 MAX
                        Otto, it’s a fucking shitty song 
                        and I don’t play shitty songs.

                                 OTTO
                        Yeah, cool morals, cool guy. 
                        Meanwhile, KWHL’s shitty song 
                        selection is eating us alive, one 
                        sponsor at a time.

                                 MAX
                        We have sponsors!

           He gestures at a wall of weirdo local business SIGNS.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Betty’s Records, Great Alaskan Bush 
                        Company (your personal favorite), 
                        The White Spot...

           Otto nods at the packet on Max’s lap.
                                 OTTO
                        Not any more, champ. 

           Max finally looks down at the papers: TERMINATION OF 
           SPONSORSHIP. He struggles to keep his cool. 

                                 MAX
                        Jesus. Guy wins one elephant in a 
                        paper products sweepstakes and 
                        thinks he’s big time. 

                                 OTTO
                        Yeah well, I’m headed there now to 
                        beg for mercy and kiss Skip’s fat 
                        ex-marine ass, but don’t hold your 
                        breath. 

           Max takes off his WHITE SPOT shirt and turns it inside out.

                                 MAX
                        Well, fuck ‘em. We still got Bush 
                        Company, and that’s what’s really 
                        important. 

                                 OTTO
                        Great. You’ve got cute nipples. 
                        Maybe they can give you a job when 
                        KWHL buys us in about ten minutes. 

                                 MAX
                        Don’t worry so much, Otto. The kids 
                        are alright.

                                 OTTO
                        Right. The kids. What is it they’re 
                        saying these days? 

                                 MAX
                        Take it easy?

           Otto shakes his head.

                                 OTTO
                        Whatever.

           Otto shuffles back out. Max lays his head down on the papers. 
           The request line RINGS. He picks it up. 

                                 MAX
                        KFQD Anchorage, the only way to 
                        rock in the great white north-

           Beat. Max lifts his head, eyes huge.
                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        WHAT?

           INT. 4TH AVENUE THEATER RESTAURANT - DAY 

           I GOT YOU BABE by Sonny and Cher plays quietly in the oddly 
           opulent, art deco room. The walls are painted with gilded 
           Alaska-themed MURALS: the big dipper, Denali, and of course, 
           FUR RONDY GIRLS. On the marquee is “HELP!”

           Jane sits at a table across from DEBRA (30, i.e. Miss Fur 
           Rondy 1955, razor-edged sweetness), a guy in GLASSES and a 
           HUGELY BEARDED MAN wearing a pin reading “MR. FUR FACE 1961”. 
           The men look bored. Jane fidgets with her otter scarf’s sad, 
           empty little eye sockets.

                                 DEBRA
                        Well?

                                 JANE
                        Sorry, what was the question?

           Debra sighs, reads from her notes.

                                 DEBRA
                        Miss Fur Rondy is a beacon of 
                        wholesome fun for our community. 
                        What is your idea of wholesome fun? 

                                 JANE
                        Oh...right.

           Jane sweats. The murals near her are earthquake damaged, 
           rendering them creepily warped. Jane looks away. Out the 
           large windows she can see traffic, people running. The tinny 
           SONG drones on: “Cause you got me, and baby, I got you...”

           Debra studies Jane pointedly, frowns, and looks at her notes

                                 DEBRA
                        If you’re elected, what will be the 
                        ultimate goal of your reign?

                                 JANE
                        I, um...I...

           I GOT YOU BABE finally ends. A slippery DJ voice comes on: 

                                 RADIO
                        Okay guys and gals, it’s Dick Moby 
                        at KWHL with your news bulletin: 
                        Looks like there’s some serious 
                        traffic backing up Fourth Avenue...
                                 DEBRA
                        How about an easy one: Where do you 
                        see yourself in five years?

           A Fur Rondy Girl painting seems to WINK hideously at Jane. 

                                 JANE
                        I...

           BANG! Everyone turns to see wide-eyed PATTY outside, pressed 
           against the window. She BANGS on the glass with her fists. 

                                 PATTY
                        JANE! JANE! I NEED YOU!

           Jane is frozen for a moment in speechless horror.

                                 JANE
                        Uh. I’m so sorry. I’ll be right 
                        back.

           EXT. 4TH AVENUE THEATER - DAY

           Jane stands in an ALLEY with a sweaty and breathless Patty.

                                 JANE
                        What the fuck-- 

                                 PATTY
                        THEY’RE HERE. THEY’RE HERE.

                                 JANE
                        What? 

                                 PATTY
                        ONE OF THE DELTA GIRLS CALLED FROM 
                        THE AIRPORT. THEY JUST LANDED. 

                                 JANE
                        Who? 

                                 PATTY
                        THE BEATLES, JANE! THE FUCKING 
                        BEATLES ARE HERE. 

           Jane goes pale. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        They were flying from Berlin to 
                        Tokyo and some typhoon grounded 
                        them. RIGHT HERE! At the fucking 
                        Westward Hotel!
                                 JANE
                        No.

                                 PATTY
                        YES.

           Jane starts hyperventilating. She leans over. Patty puts a 
           hand on her shoulder and looks her square in the eye.  

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Jane. Listen to me. I’m taking you 
                        to that hotel and you’re going to 
                        fuck George Harrison until he begs 
                        for mercy. 

                                 JANE
                        What? 

                                 PATTY
                        Don’t you get it? The Beatles are 
                        on their way to Japan and a typhoon 
                        forces them to land here, right 
                        fucking here? It’s fate, Jane! It’s 
                        destiny, it’s an act of fucking 
                        God. 

                                 JANE
                        This is insane. 

                                 PATTY
                        That’s the point! I mean, if random 
                        horrible things can happen, why not 
                        random wonderful things too?

           This hits Jane hard. She starts hyperventilating again.

                                 JANE
                        Oh my god. Oh my god. 

           Slowly Jane starts LAUGHING. Patty SCREAMS. They jump up and 
           down, dissolving into laughter.

                                 PATTY
                        I know, I know. Stand up, baby, we 
                        gotta go. Where’s the truck?

           Patty starts pulling her hand. 

                                 JANE
                        Wait! 

           Jane looks at her watch. 
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Eli gets out at 5:15. We have to be 
                        back by then. 

                                 PATTY
                        Fine, then let’s get there already!

                                 JANE
                        Hang on, man! I have this asshole 
                        Rondy brunch, I can’t just leave--

           Patty struggles not to show her impatience. 

                                 PATTY
                        Jane. Don’t be stupid. Put a 
                        cigarette out on your hand. Throw 
                        up on someone. Say you’re on your 
                        period. Just hurry, we gotta get 
                        the fuck out of here. 

                                 JANE
                        Right. Right. Okay, I’ll be right 
                        back. 

           INT. 4TH AVENUE THEATER - DAY

           Jane sits back down at the table. Debra is clearly pissed.

                                 DEBRA
                        Everything all right, dear?

                                 JANE
                        Yes. I mean, no. Actually, I have 
                        to go. 

                                 DEBRA
                        Excuse me?

           Her eyes bug. Jane tries to suppress a shit-eating grin.

                                 DEBRA (CONT’D)
                        Something funny, young lady? You 
                        think this is a joke?

           Jane gathers her coat and bag.

                                 JANE
                        Actually, yeah. 

           The men look up, mildly interested. 
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I mean, we’re all adults, this is 
                        the inner circle, we can talk about 
                        how insane this is, right? “The 
                        ultimate goal of my reign”? What am 
                        I supposed to say? World peace? 
                        Come on. How about getting rid of 
                        that foul fur bikini no self-
                        respecting Alaskan woman would ever 
                        wear? We can make Mr. Fur Face wear 
                        it instead. 

           Mr. Fur face chuckles. 

                                  MR. FUR FACE
                        That’s actually hilarious.

                                 JANE
                        And in five years, I don’t know. 
                        Hopefully I’ll be the hell out of 
                        here, but probably not. This town 
                        has a way of hanging onto freaks 
                        and weirdos, so I reckon I’m 
                        doomed. 

           Beat.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Also, I’m on my period.

           She stands and unwinds the otter scarf from her neck. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        So in conclusion, ah, I believe 
                        honesty and giving your all and I 
                        need to go home now. Because of the 
                        blood. 

           She drops the scarf and goes. The table is silent for a beat.

                                 MR. FUR FACE
                        I like her. 

                                 GLASSES
                        Great legs.

                                 MR. FUR FACE
                        Sounds like a majority vote to me. 

           Debra looks incredulous.

                                 DEBRA
                        You’re kidding, right? 
           Shrugs all around. Debra gathers her things, muttering.

                                 DEBRA (CONT’D)
                        Unbelievable.

           EXT.  4TH AVENUE THEATER - DAY 

           Jane runs into parking lot and stops in her tracks. The 
           truck’s hood is popped and SMOKE pours from the ENGINE. Patty 
           stands nearby, frantically fanning with her APRON.  

                                 PATTY
                        I think something exploded! 

           Jane peers through the smoke and pulls out half a broken PING 
           PONG BALL.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        What is that?

                                 JANE
                        Fucking Eli.

           She leans her head on the door, wracking her brain.

                                 PATTY
                        If we can get back to the Bun, I 
                        can get us a ride. But he’s leaving 
                        any second now...

           Patty SLAMS the hood shut. A metal RATTLE issues from the 
           truck bed. Jane slowly lifts her head...In the back of the 
           truck is ELI’S BICYCLE.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Jane pedals madly down the street on Eli’s BIKE. Patty stands 
           on PEGS behind her.

           INT. ANCHORAGE WESTWARD HOTEL - DAY

           Inside a BREAK ROOM. VLAD (38), a small, potbellied man, 
           chain smokes as he paces in front of a crowd of STAFF. He 
           speaks in Russian accented English. 

                                 VLAD
                        Okay so. Elevator is still broken. 
                        Is get fix tomorrow. Today is 
                        Eskimo meeting, keep close eyes on 
                        liquor. And...
           He takes a deep breath. 

                                 VLAD (CONT’D)
                        We have Beatles here.

           The staff erupts into CHATTER. Vlad raises a hand for 
           silence.

                                 VLAD (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me. These guys do 
                        something to the women. They are no 
                        longer girls next door. They 
                        are...kamikaze. They will use 
                        anything: distraction, seduction, 
                        blackmail, bribe. But we will be 
                        ready, right? Because we will be 
                        running Maskirovka. The Straw Cat 
                        Maneuver. 

           The staff looks blank. Vlad points his cigarette at DENNIS 
           (24), a shaggy haired BELLHOP.

                                 VLAD (CONT’D)
                        Dennis, you will be The Straw Cat.  
                        Leo is The Rotten Tooth. The suite 
                        will be the Elbow Room. Secondary 
                        maneuver is The Charlie Chaplain. 
                        Ronald, James, Marty, and Bart will 
                        be Charlies. You come with me after 
                        meeting. 

           Vlad hands out WALKIE TALKIES. Dennis and company glance 
           nervously at each other, completely lost. 

                                 VLAD (CONT’D)
                        We begin in one hour. Until then, 
                        we protect with closed lips. 

           Vlad lights a new cigarettes with his burning one.

                                 VLAD (CONT’D)
                        They will starve on our words.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MONTAGE:

           -The entire hotel staff stands in line for the PHONE. 

           -Girls all over town answering the phone and screaming and/or 
           fainting. 
           -Jane and Patty ride through town past increasing traffic 
           jams, police setting up barricades, etc. 

           EXT. THE BUN DRIVE-IN - DAY

           The parking lot is packed with parked CARS. CAR HOPS in 
           uniforms identical to Patty’s hustle to and fro with trays of 
           food. 

           Jane swerves into the lot. Patty and Jane jump off the bike, 
           letting it crash into a bush. Patty marches to the center of 
           the sea of cars, steps onto a random bumper and YELLS.

                                 PATTY
                        HAS ANYONE SEEN MAX?

           INT. DJ BOOTH - DAY

           Max talks rapidly to an extremely young, pimply DISHWASHER as 
           he packs a box of portable recording equipment.

                                 MAX
                        It’s like, I know, right? It’s the 
                        fucking Beatles. They’ll do 
                        whatever they want. They only want 
                        to give one interview? Fine. Here, 
                        put these on. 

           He claps HEADPHONES on the bewildered dishwasher.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        And I don’t care if they scheduled 
                        with KWHL, I’m gonna get it, 
                        goddamnit. I’m gonna get that 
                        exclusive shit and then we’ll be 
                        writing our own checks, friend. I 
                        might even hire you full time, as 
                        an assistant or something. Anyway, 
                        This button lets you talk on air. 
                        DON’T press it. DON’T TALK ON AIR. 

           He loads a 45 onto the turn table. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Play whatever you want from this 
                        stack. This is the request line. If 
                        it rings, DON’T ANSWER IT, it could 
                        be Otto. He’s getting fucked up 
                        with Skip, he shouldn’t be back 
                        today, but just I’ll lock you in 
                        just in case.
           Max presses a button, the disc starts spinning.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Break a leg. See you in eleven 
                        hours.

                                 DISHWASHER
                        Eleven?

           Max puts a finger to his lips and points to a red ON AIR sign 
           that has just lit up. He mouths “You’re doing great!” Then 
           gives a thumbs up, grabs his recording equipment and leaves, 
           locking the door behind him.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Max turns and is face to face with Jane and Patty, standing 
           aggressively close. 

                                 MAX
                        Jesus, Patty!

                                 PATTY
                        Hey Maxy. Going somewhere? 

                                 MAX
                        Depends on who’s asking.

           He continues past them, hauling his gear towards the 
           staircase. The girls follow. 

                                 PATTY
                        Just lil ol me. Oh, and Jane. Jane, 
                        Max Best. The DJ.

           He glances back, sizing her up, playing aloof (badly).

                                 MAX
                        Charmed.

                                 JANE
                        You sound taller on the radio.

                                 MAX
                        Airwaves add a few inches. 

                                 JANE
                        And here I thought it was just the 
                        fancy shoes.

                                 MAX
                        They’re Vans. Special from 
                        California--
                                 PATTY
                        Sure, listen, our car’s busted, can 
                        we roll downtown with you? 

                                 MAX
                        Sorry girls. I’m on a mission. No 
                        excess baggage. 

           He jogs down the stairs and pushes a door into

           INT. THE BUN DRIVE-IN KITCHEN - DAY 

           Flames, bubbling grease, flying hamburgers, deafening ROCK 
           MUSIC. They speed walk through, dodging cooks, shouts of 
           “Hey, Max!” and loud WOLF WHISTLES

                                 PATTY
                        C’mon Max, it’s for a good cause. 
                        Jane is going to lose her virginity 
                        to George Harrison tonight. 

           Jane hits her. Patty LAUGHS. 

                                 JANE
                        She’s joking. 

                                 MAX
                        Didn’t he just marry Pattie Boyd? 

                                 PATTY
                        Don’t be so square, Max. Besides, 
                        Jane’s way foxier than Patty Boyd. 

           Max pushes through another door and steps outside.

           EXT. THE BUN DRIVE-IN - DAY

           Max pushes sunglasses on and heads to his gleaming BLACK 
           CADILLAC.

                                 PATTY
                        Look, we’ll make you a deal: I’m 
                        taking John and Paul, but you can 
                        have Ringo. 

           He POPS his trunk and starts loading equipment in. 

                                 MAX
                        That’s very generous of you ladies. 
                        Sadly, I’m a Stones girl myself. 
                        But maybe I’ll see you out there. 
           He slams his trunk. The seduction is failing. Patty looks 
           panicky. Jane steps in front of him.

                                 JANE
                        Wait. Just think about this for a 
                        second. We can help each other. I 
                        mean, what gives you a better 
                        chance of getting in, you all 
                        alone, or you with your two lovely 
                        assistants--a Delta stewardess AND 
                        Miss Fur Rondy 1966?

                                 MAX
                        I already got a guy getting me in. 

                                 JANE
                        Oh, great. Then you just need to 
                        get the room number and talk your 
                        way past security, media, groupies--
                        all before the typhoon clears up 
                        and they leave.

                                 PATTY
                        Ugh, so many steps.

                                 JANE
                        Might be nice to have someone 
                        around who knows the hotel layout 
                        by heart, maybe someone who’s dad 
                        did the earthquake retrofit.

                                 PATTY
                        Yeah. And I’ve dated like, half the 
                        kitchen staff. 

                                 MAX
                        “Dated”?

                                 JANE
                        “Half”? 

                                 PATTY
                        Whatever, I can help. 

                                 JANE
                        Think about it. You look cool, we 
                        seem official, everybody gets what 
                        they want. It’s perfect. 

           Max considers them. They have a point. He sighs.

                                 MAX
                        No deflowering until after the 
                        interview. 
           INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

           Frank stands on the third floor a half-built building: no 
           windows or walls, just floors and scaffolding. He marks up a 
           blue print with a grease pencil.

                                 FRANK
                        I want double isolation bracing on 
                        all remaining beams, load bearing 
                        or not. That means here, here, all 
                        of these...Bill, did you get the 
                        first floor reinforcements done? 

           No answer. He glances up. His CONSTRUCTION CREW stares out 
           the open wall of the building behind him. He turns around. 

           Across the street and three stories down, 40 scantily clad 
           TEENAGE GIRLS loiter outside THE ANCHORAGE WESTWARD HOTEL. A 
           few are painting a BEATLES 4EVER BANNER. 

           Frank turns back to the group, SMACKS his clipboard.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Dickheads! Double iso bracing, 
                        got it? Focus the fuck up. 
                        Earthquakes don’t kill people. 
                        Buildings do. 

           Eye rolls. They hear this a lot. They shuffle off. 

           Frank turns back to his blueprints, then looks out again at 
           the girls and frowns. Worried.

           Muffy D and stands with a couple of Basies, sharing a flask. 

                                 BASIE 1
                        What should we do tonight? 

                                 BASIE 2
                        We could get drunk and try to 
                        capture the one eyed goose.

                                 MUFFY D
                        Fuck that. Let’s crash the Midnight 
                        Sun Party in the park.

           Debra storms through. Muffy shoves the flask under a stuffed 
           BEAVER wearing a miniature FUR COAT.

                                 MUFFY D (CONT’D)
                        Hey Mrs. Melvin--
           Debra GRABS Muffy’s ill-concealed FLASK, drains it, slaps on  
           the counter, and keeps walking.

           The Basies stare after her. 

                                 BASIE 1
                        Holy shit.

           Muffy shakes his head. 

                                 MUFFY D
                        There she goes, boys. The truly 
                        perfect woman.

           She strides into the BACK ROOM and SLAMS the door. 

           INT. MELS ARCTIC FUR FACTORY BACKROOM - DAY

           Debra follows a stretched PHONE CHORD around the corner and 
           into an open VAULT. 

           MEL is deep between the racks between of carefully preserved 
           premium furs, talking on the phone as he counts BILLS out of 
           a metal LOCK BOX.

                                 MEL
                        ...That’s right, The Beatles, the 
                        rock group. At the Westward.

           Debra freezes, listening. 

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        Their manager called, some Jewish 
                        fellow, Einstein or something, 
                        wants furs, but we’re gonna bring 
                        the whole shebang: put Jane in the 
                        bikini, get the group in knee 
                        length fox—-maybe bear—-front page 
                        photo. Yeah. “How the Beatles Stay 
                        Warm in Alaska.” How’s that for a 
                        headline?

           A smirk builds on Debra’s lips, rage sharpening into a plan.

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        I know. Jane’s bonkers for them, 
                        she’s gonna go crazy when she finds 
                        out. Great tie in. It’s perfect. 

           She backs out.
           INT. MAX’S CAR - DAY

           Max drives wildly. Jane sits shotgun, Patty in the back. He 
           offers them cigarettes. Jane takes one. Max glances at her.

                                 MAX
                        So. she’s a superfan, looking to 
                        give it all up on the altar of rock 
                        music. Every parents worst 
                        nightmare come true—-Look out! The 
                        British are coming! And it’s all 
                        Jane’s fault! 

           Jane rolls her eyes. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Well? what’s the deal. Why George?

                                 JANE
                             (shrugging)
                        I love him.

                                 MAX
                        That’s the stupidest thing I’ve 
                        ever heard. 

                                 JANE
                        Don’t be jealous. 

                                 MAX
                        You don’t know anything about him.

                                 JANE
                        I know everything I need to know. 

                                 MAX
                        Like what, his dog’s name, favorite 
                        color, and whatever other crap is 
                        in the intimate interviews of 
                        Seventeen Magazine?

                                 JANE
                        I know he’s different. He’s lonely. 

                                 MAX
                        George Harrison is lonely. 

           She just stares out the window. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        And how do you know this?
                                 JANE
                        Haven’t you ever felt alone at a 
                        party, in a room full of your 
                        friends, and the more people there 
                        are, and the better you’re supposed 
                        know them, the lonelier you feel? 
                        Imagine that, but the party is the 
                        biggest one in history. The room is 
                        a stadium, the people are 
                        thousands, and every single one 
                        thinks they know you. And it’s 
                        every single day. How do you think 
                        that would feel? 

                                 MAX
                        I think it would be a rush.

                                 JANE
                        Maybe for some people. 

                                 MAX
                        You’ve thought about this way too 
                        much--

           Patty suddenly leans forward and jerks the wheel.

                                 PATTY
                        Turn here!

                                 MAX
                        What are you doing!

                                 PATTY
                        We gotta pick up Barbie. Don’t 
                        worry though, she’s real cute. Just 
                        be nice to her. She’s got kind of a 
                        temper.

                                 JANE
                        Shit, I forgot Barbara! Her floor 
                        manager’s a monster, we’ll never 
                        get her out.

                                 PATTY
                        Already took care of it.

           They pull up to

           EXT. GREAT ALAKSAN SALMON CANNERY - DAY

           Barbara stands in a filthy APRON, GLOVES, and HAIR NET, her 
           face red and tear stained. She wipes her nose with a fish egg 
           coated glove.
                                 MAX
                        Jesus, what’s wrong with her?

                                 PATTY
                        I called her boss and said her 
                        boyfriend got hit by a car. 

           Patty rolls down the window.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Hop in, Red!

           Barbara looks up, confused. 

                                 BARBARA
                             (choking)
                        Patty...Ted’s dead!

                                 PATTY
                        Who cares? THE BEATLES ARE HERE.

                                 BARBARA
                        What?

                                 PATTY
                        WE’RE TAKING YOU TO SEE THE 
                        BEATLES.

           Beat. 

                                 BARBARA
                        Let me get my purse.

           INT. MAX’S CAR - DAY

           Barbara sits in the back beside Patty, trying to compose 
           herself.

                                 BARBARA
                        You could have just said his legs 
                        were broken or something.

                                 PATTY
                        He never would have let you out if 
                        it was just the legs. 

                                 BARBARA
                        I have to shower, my hair--

                                 PATTY
                        We don’t have time. Just spray some 
                        perfume.
           Barbara smooths her hair, one hand still gloved and covered 
           in fish. Jane fiddles with the radio. She pauses.

                                 RADIO
                        ...it’s KWAL the WHALE, comin live, 
                        and folks, do we have a scoop for

                        are true, THE FAB FOUR are HERE in 
                        Anchorage...

           The girls SCREAM in unison.

                                 RADIO (CONT’D)
                        Our whale about town Dick Moby will

           Max clicks to a different station. 

                                 MAX
                        Goddamned Dick Moby, bandwagon, top 
                        forty phony, gutless, ball-less, 
                        tasteless, Red Rubber Ball playing 
                        motherfucker.

                                 JANE
                        So that’s the big rush? Gotta get 
                        the scoop before old Dick?

           Max shakes his head.

                                 MAX
                        I was the first one to play the 
                        Beatles up here, man. Just like I 
                        was the first one to play the 
                        Stones, and the Beach Boys and 
                        every other good act since 1963, 
                        while they were still crying Elvis 
                        was too nasty for the radio. And 
                        now this sponsor poaching pervert--

                                 JANE
                        Ugh, you sound like a high school 
                        girl. Who cares who has more fans? 
                        You’re still stuck in this frozen 
                        anus of a town. You’re just king of 
                        the turds. 

           He looks at her sideways. 

                                 MAX
                        That’s very depressing. 
                                 JANE
                        Tell me about it. 

           Max makes a sharp turn onto a residential road. Patty leans 
           forward. 

                                 PATTY
                        What are you doing? I thought we 
                        were going to the hotel?

                                 MAX
                        Gotta make pit stop. If we’re gonna 
                        get past the handlers, we need a 
                        competitive edge, and Alaskan dope 
                        is worth its weight in gold.

           The car winds through increasingly destroyed terrain. Patty 
           and Barbara glance at each other. 

                                 PATTY
                        No way, man. We don’t have time for 
                        this shit--

                                 MAX
                             (sharp)
                        Then get out. 

           The car falls silent. Max sighs. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Just trust me, all right? This is 
                        important.

           EXT. EARTHQUAKE PARK - DAY

           The Cadillac pulls up to a former neighborhood transformed 
           into jumble of destruction: wrecked houses, dead trees, 
           broken asphalt. Someone has painted on a jagged piece of 
           concrete: WELCOME TO EARTHQUAKE PARK.

                                 MAX
                        You girls can stay in the car if 
                        you want. 

           They glance at Jane. 

                                 JANE
                        I’ll go. 
           EXT. EARTHQUAKE PARK - DAY

           Max leads the clutch of pretty girls into the woods like a 
           pied piper. They walk quietly, looking around.

                                 BARBARA
                        Can you believe it’s been two 
                        years? 

           Patty intertwines her fingers in Jane’s and glances at her, 
           but Jane’s face betrays nothing. The trees finally open into

           EXT. MEADOW - DAY

           Ragged makeshift tents make a semicircle around two dozen 
           lounging HIPPIES. The girls looks stunned. 

                                 PATTY
                        This is some far out shit.

                                 MAX
                        You guys never been out here? 

           They shakes their heads. He shrugs. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        There’s all kinds of things going 
                        on if you know how to look for em.

           On cue, a BEARDED GUY laying in a hammock with a couple GIRLS 
           sits up and waves.

                                 BEARDED GUY 
                        Hey, it’s The Voice!

           Max heads to the hammock, leaving the girls to fend for 
           themselves. 

           EXT. TEEPEE - DAY

           Jane wanders over to a TEEPEE where a guy in a floppy STRAW 
           HAT holds court with a group of HIPPIES:

                                 HAT GUY
                        ...San Diego’s just as bad. 
                        Oakland, too. Things didn’t really 
                        start getting better until we hit 
                        the Yukon.

           A girl with a see-through top (NIPPLES), nods sagely as she 
           draws in the dirt with a BABY SPOON.
                                 NIPPLES
                        Cali’s over. 

                                 JANE
                        Wait, sorry. You left California to 
                        come here? 

                                 HAT GUY
                        Had to. It’s been tainted. Turned. 

                                 JANE
                        Tainted?

           EXT. MEADOW - DAY

           Max haggles over a BAG of WEED with The Bearded Guy.

                                 MAX
                        ...Come on man, don’t bust my 
                        balls, last time it was five bucks—

                                 BEARDED GUY
                        Supply and demand, brother. 

                                 MAX
                        I thought you were supposed to be 
                        communists.

                                 BEARDED GUY
                             (shrugging)
                        You can pay later if you leave 
                        collateral. 

                                 MAX
                        Like what?

           Bearded Guy’s glance drifts to Jane.  

                                 BEARDED GUY
                        Who’s the supernova?  

           Max follows his gaze.

                                 MAX
                        What? Oh, Jane. I don’t know. Some 
                        girl. 

           The Bearded Guy laughs. 

                                 BEARDED GUY
                        That’s not a girl, brother. That’s 
                        an atom bomb in girl’s clothing.
           EXT. TEEPEE - DAY

           Jane looks increasingly bewildered by Hat Guy’s ranting.

                                 HAT GUY
                        ...But this spot is very truth. 
                        Good vibrations. Treasure 
                        everywhere. Like Marigold’s spoon.

           NIPPLES holds up the baby spoon.

                                 NIPPLES
                        It was in a bush. And Sunny found a 
                        doorknob yesterday. It’s our own 
                        secret garden. No one else’s ever 
                        here.

                                 JANE
                        That’s because the land is still 
                        settling. It’s pretty dangerous, 
                        actually. 

                                 HAT GUY
                        See, that’s what I’m saying! That’s 
                        what’s so far out about this place. 
                        It’s like the earth actually shook 
                        down the status quo, blew up the 
                        infrastructure. We need more of 
                        that. Revolution, upheaval. Change.

                                 JANE
                        Yeah well. A lot of people died.

           He shrugs.

                                 HAT GUY
                        That’s the future for you, man. 
                        Makes ghosts out of us all.

           Jane looks at her watch and walks off, brooding. 

           EXT. MEADOW - DAY

           A barefoot Max sighs heavily as Bearded Guy laces up his blue 
           Van high top sneakers. Jane approaches. 

                                 JANE 
                        Hey, you done? We gotta get out of 
                        here before Patty goes native.

           She nods to where Patty is dancing with two guys at once, 
           brandishing a wand of burning sage and a jug of wine.
           Nearby, Barbara sits with a woman crocheting a blanket, 
           animatedly explaining how to gut a fish. 

           The Bearded Guy hands Max a battered pair of EMBROIDERED 
           SLIPPERS. 

                                 MAX
                        Yeah, we’re done.

           As they start to walk off, the Bearded Guy grabs Jane’s hand. 

                                 BEARDED GUY
                        Hey. Why don’t you hang? Let the 
                        missionaries go on their mission. 
                        Do something strange for a change. 

           Jane laughs uncomfortably.

                                 JANE
                        I’m good. 

                                 BEARDED GUY
                        You don’t have to be.

           He leans closer. 

                                 BEARDED GUY (CONT’D)
                        I know it hurts. I see the shadow 
                        on you, lost sun. It’s a white 
                        elephant, unwanted gift, always in 
                        the room, never forgets.

           He stares into her eyes. Jane is frozen, rattled.

                                 BEARDED GUY (CONT’D)
                        I can show you another life.

                             (Screaming)
                        Pigs! 

           Everyone turns. A handful of COPS come through the trees. 
           Hippies SCATTER with shouts of “We don’t recognize your 
           authority!” Jane and her crew RUN for the woods. 

           Behind her, Jane hears YELPS as her friends stumble on the 
           uneven ground and are caught.

                                 COP (O.S.)
                        Okay, kids, hands up. Party’s over. 

           But she keeps running. Suddenly, out of the corner of her 
           eye, she sees a MAILBOX standing surreally among the trees. 
           Distracted, she TRIPS and falls. 
                                 COP  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You! Don’t move!

           She stays down, defeated. BOOTS step into her line of vision. 
           She looks up. The cop squints down at her. 

                                 COP (CONT’D)
                        Jane?

           He takes off his SUNGLASSES.

                                 JANE
                        Oh. Hey Mr. Ayers.

           He offers her a hand and she stands up. 

                                 COP
                        What are you doing? You’re 
                        not...with those people?

                                 JANE
                        No, I’m with these people.

           Patty, Barbara and Max still stand with their backs turned 
           and hands up. He shakes his head, but looks relieved.

                                 COP
                        Your dad would have a fuckin heart 
                        attack if he knew you were out 
                        here. 

           He looks around. All the other cops are chasing hippies 
           through the woods. 

                                 COP (CONT’D)
                        Just go.

                                 JANE
                        Seriously?

                                 COP
                        Yeah. 
                             (To the rest of them)
                        Go. Get out of here.

                                 JANE
                        Thanks.

           They start off, confused. The cop touches Jane’s arm. He 
           looks profoundly sad.

                                 COP
                        Hey. Take care of yourself, Jane.
           She turns away and takes off into the woods. Max looks at her 
           curiously as they run towards the car.

                                 MAX
                        What was that?

                                 JANE
                        Just lucky, I guess.

           INT. CAR - DAY 

           Max speeds away from the park.

                                 PATTY
                        I can’t believe that was all for 
                        some weed.

                                 MAX
                        Believe it, baby. This is our 
                        ticket in. I have it on good 
                        authority Epstein loves exotic pot. 

                                 BARBARA
                        Who?

                                 JANE
                        Brian Epstein. Their manager. 

                                 MAX
                        No. Not just the manager, he found 
                        them and took them all the way, 
                        even after being rejected by 
                        everyone: Columbia, Phillips, 
                        Decca. Shit, EMI only signed ‘cause 
                        Epstein fucking blackmailed them. 
                        Because he believed. Because he had 
                        vision.  He didn’t just follow the 
                        herd and sign a bunch of performing 
                        seals like everyone else--

           Patty suddenly lurches forward and points out the windshield 
           at a figure on the side of the road. 

                                 PATTY
                        A hitcher!

           Everyone ignores her.

                                 MAX
                        I mean, The Beatles are great, 
                        don’t get me wrong. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        But without Epstein, they’d still 
                        be playing lunch gigs at the Cavern 
                        Club, and poor Jane would be stuck 
                        picking between Simon and Garfunkle-

                                 PATTY
                        Come on, let’s pick him up!

                                 JANE
                        Shut up, Patty...

           Jane squints as they get closer to the hitcher. Something 
           about that hair, the posture...

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god. 

                                 BARBARA
                        Oh shit...

                                 JANE
                        Pull over.

                                 MAX
                        What? 

                                 JANE
                        PULL OVER!

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Jane rolls the window down. ELI bends into view: one side of 
           his face is dusty, flecked with burned hair. Patty leans over 
           from the backseat.

                                 PATTY
                        Hey firebug. Need a lift? 

           INT. MAX’S CAR - DAY

           Jane stares straight ahead. Eli babbles from the back seat.

                                 ELI 
                        ...pack the kitty litter in black 
                        powder, seal your fuse in the ping 
                        pong ball, and boom. Homemade 
                        cherry bomb. But my ratio was off. 
                        It was supposed to just set off the 
                        smoke alarm...
                                 PATTY 
                        Hey, now you don’t have to worry 
                        about picking him up!

           Jane shakes her head.

                                 JANE
                        We have to take him home.

                                 MAX
                        Honey, I’m not taking him anywhere. 
                        We’re on a schedule. I don’t think 
                        you’re appreciating what’s at stake 
                        here for me. 

                                 JANE
                        I don’t think you’re appreciating 
                        the troubled child in the back seat 
                        who’s now my responsibility.

                                 MAX
                        What child? He’s a man. Look at 
                        him. 

           They glance back. Eli sits on a drunk Patty’s lap, chatting 
           while Barbara picks singed hairs out of his eyebrow.

                                 ELI
                        ...see, most people underestimate 
                        the value of shock and awe. The 
                        situation with Charlie, for 
                        example. Time to blow that place to 
                        smithereens. Destruction as 
                        solution. 

                                 MAX
                        Huh.

           Beat.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        He’ll be fine. 

                                 JANE
                        Yeah? How?

                                 MAX
                        Look, this isn’t actually my 
                        problem. If you’re so worried about 
                        it, I’ll drop you both at the next 
                        stoplight.

           A traffic light looms ahead. Jane looks at her watch. She 
           takes a deep breath. 
                                 JANE
                        Eli. We’re going to the Westward to 
                        see the Beatles. You’re going to be 
                        absolutely silent and stay by 
                        Barbara. AND you’re going to fix 
                        the truck engine--

                                 BARBARA
                        Watch out!

           Max SWERVES to miss a parked car abandoned haphazardly in the 
           middle of the road. Ahead are a dozen more. Max weaves 
           carefully around them.

                                 JANE
                        You hear that?

                                 MAX
                        What?

                                 JANE
                        Listen.

           A muffled ROAR. Jane rolls her window down. It gets LOUDER. 

                                 ELI
                        What is that?

           Just then, they crest the hill to the hotel...

                                 MAX
                        Holyyyy shit...

           The parking lot is sea of WOMEN OF ALL AGES, talking, 
           singing, dancing and crying. Cars with their doors open blast 
           MUSIC. It’s a massive, all-female tailgating party. 

                                 ELI
                        What’s wrong with them?

                                 MAX
                        They’re in love. 

           Max parks among the other ABANDONED VEHICLES.

           EXT. ANCHORAGE WESTWARD HOTEL - DAY

           The five fight towards the hotel, passing strange sights:

           -Teenage girls in trees trying to toss their bras at the 
           upper level windows. 
           -An older woman clutching John Lennon’s book of poetry IN HIS 
           OWN WRITE, reciting:

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        “I’m looking up and at the sky,
                        To find a wondrous voice.
                        Puzzly puzzle, wonder why,
                        I hear but have no choice.”

           -Pre-teens painting signs, each other’s faces, clothing. One 
           just sits on the ground, crying hysterically.

           -An angry FATHER yells, shaking his fist at the building. 

                                 FATHER
                        They just want you to wave at them! 
                        Just wave at them, damn you!

           Eli bumps into A sour-faced SPINSTER carrying a banner 
           reading: NO ONE IS MORE POPULAR THAN JESUS.

                                 ELI
                        Sorry.

                                 SPINSTER
                        You’ll burn in hell for worshipping 
                        the devil’s music!

           Jane shoves the woman away.

                                 JANE
                        Back off, doomsday. 

                                 SPINSTER
                        DON’T TOUCH ME WITH YOUR FILTHY 
                        HARLOT’S HANDS!

           They finally hit a solid wall of frustrated females straining 
           against barricades. Jane jumps in vain. 

                                 JANE
                        Where’s your guy? 

                                 MAX
                        I don’t know! I can’t goddamned see 
                        anything! 

           Max gets down on one knee and taps his shoulders.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Get on. I’ll get you above the 
                        crowd. Look for a guy in a blue 
                        service uniform. 
                                 JANE
                        Your “guy” is a janitor? 

                                 MAX
                        Just look!

           Jane gets on his shoulders. Max stands unsteadily. Patty 
           clocks this and puts her hands on Eli’s shoulders and 
           LEAPFROGS onto his back without warning. 

                                 ELI
                        Ah! What the hell?

           Patty clambers on, squeezing his head in her bare thighs. 

                                 PATTY
                        Shut up and embrace your fantasy. 

           Now above the crowd, the girls spot the HOTEL DOORS. Thick 
           necked BOUNCERS with high and tights stand, arms folded. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Jane! Look at those bouncers. Is 
                        that Don Shumpert? AND JAMES COOK?

           Jane squints.

                                 JANE
                        They’re seriously using the Basie 
                        hockey team for security? 

                                 PATTY
                        Well, this’ll be easy. James! Hey! 
                        James!

           James looks up, spots the girls and WAVES.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Legs! Go forward!

           Barbara shoves WOMEN out of the way as Max and Eli struggle 
           toward the front. 

           The crowd suddenly shifts around them. DICK MOBY (32, thin 
           hair, baby faced) stands in a circle of FANS broadcasting on 
           a portable set up. 

                                 MAX
                        Oh Christ.
                                 DICK
                        ...Don’t touch that dial because 
                        we’ll be back, broadcasting live 
                        and remote at fifty thousand watts, 
                        on KWHL, with me, Dick Moby. 

           Dick clicks his MIC off. Max tries to turn away but is too 
           late. Dick swoops in, flanked by his two BASIE SIDEKICKS 
           (20’s, big arms, blank looks, high and tights)

                                 DICK (CONT’D)
                        Hey, there he is! Best in name 
                        only. 

                                 MAX
                        Dick, in every sense of the word. 

                                 DICK
                        Ha! Oh gosh, look at you down 
                        there! You all right, pal? I can 
                        have one of the boys help you out. 
                        I can only imagine the pressure.

           Max strains to appear casual.  

                                 MAX
                        You kidding? I’m a beast of burden. 
                        I can carry this weight a long 
                        time. 

           He SMOOCHES Jane’s leg. She SMACKS his face. He forces a 
           laugh.

                                 DICK
                        Hey, that’s great. You know, Coca 
                        Cola should be by soon, maybe you 
                        can get a free pop. They wanted to 
                        tag along for the interview. Gotta 
                        love a new sponsor, right? That 
                        reminds me, heard about The White 
                        Spot. Tough break.

           He CLAPS Max on the back, throwing his balance a little. 

                                 DICK (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, you here as a fan? Because 
                        you know they’re only giving one 
                        interview...
           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

           Frank eats lunch alone, still going over blueprints. Nearby, 
           BILL (40, the foreman) and the rest of the crew stare at the 
           girls while they eat. 

                                 WORKER
                        What the hell is this, anyway? 

                                 BILL
                        Who cares? 

           He waves to a cluster of girls. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Maybe the scaffolding collapsed and 
                        we all went to heaven. 
                             (yelling to the girls)
                        HEY HONEY! I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND! 

           EXT. ANCHORAGE WESTWARD HOTEL - DAY

           James talks up to Patty, flirting.

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah, Vlad’s all right, he’s just a 
                        little wound up. But he’s like, 
                        really organized... 

           Distracted, Jane turns towards Bill’s yelling. She looks up 
           and immediately ducks her head.

                                 JANE
                        Oh fuck fuck fuck.

                                 PATTY
                        What?

                                 JANE
                        I think that’s my dad’s crew.

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY 

           Bill squints. His eyes widen and he suddenly drops his hand. 

                                 BILL
                        Oh fuck. 

                                 WORKER 1
                        What? 
                                 BILL
                        I think that’s Frank’s kid. 

           EXT. ANCHORAGE WESTWARD HOTEL - DAY

           Jane kicks Max, screaming over the din of the crowd.

                                 JANE
                        Max! Put me down! Max! 

           Below her, Max and Dick are in each other’s faces, rage 
           barely veiled. 

                                 DICK
                        ...You’re not unpopular because 
                        you’re a rebel. You’re unpopular 
                        ‘cause your show is a drag. 

           The basies LAUGH loudly.

                                 MAX
                        That what you tell yourself while 
                        you play the Pledge of Allegiance 
                        on loop and work on that hellacious 
                        combover?

                                 DICK
                        I’m a damn patriot--

                                 MAX
                        You’re a fucking stooge!

           Dick SHOVES Max who stumbles backward. Jane TOPPLES from his 
           shoulders, but is caught by Barbara. Her face darkens. 

                                 BARBARA
                        What the fuck, man!

                                 BASIE SIDEKICK
                        Stay out of it, tubs--

           Barbara takes one step and PUNCHES the Basie in the face. 
           James lunges forward and GRABS Barbara, who jerks forward.

                                 BARBARA
                        Come on, pussy, let’s go!

           The whole crowd turns it’s focus onto Barbara and the BASIES. 
           From Eli’s shoulders, Patty points toward the empty doorway. 

                                 PATTY
                        Jane! Run! 
           Max GRABS Jane’s hand and sprints toward the door. 

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

                                 FRANK (O.S.)
                        All right breaks over, put your 
                        dicks away...

           The crew scatters guiltily, avoiding eye contact. Puzzled, 
           Frank glances out at the crowd. His face falls.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        What the...

           EXT. ANCHORAGE WESTWARD HOTEL - DAY

           Jane opens the door, looks back quickly--and makes direct eye 
           contact with her dad.

                                 JANE
                        Fuck.

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

           Frank sets his tool box down and starts for the door. 

                                 FRANK
                        Everybody go home. We’re done for 
                        today.

           EXT. ANCHORAGE WESTWARD HOTEL - DAY

           James frantically talks into his walkie as he tries to 
           restrain Barbara.

                                 JAMES
                        Come in, uh, Napoleon two, I got 
                        a...uh, a double bogie...over?

           Crackling silence. 

                                 WALKIE
                        What the fuck does that mean, over.

                                 JAMES
                        Two assholes just got inside. Guy 
                        and a girl. Over.

                                 WALKIE
                        Copy that. 
           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

           Jane and Max RUN into the lobby of 1960’s lodge-chic hotel 
           and stutter to a halt...

           It’s more of a zoo as the parking lot, packed with flustered 
           merchants comparing gifts like competing Magi:

           -THE BLUE CHIPS, a local band, holds a STACK OF RECORDS.

           -A man bedecked in GOLD NUGGET jewelry grips a small SAFE.

           -A woman nervously grooms a stack of woven MUSK OX SCARVES.

           -A guy holding an ORNATE RIFLE argues with Vlad:

                                 VLAD
                        You cannot bring gun to Beatles. 

                                 GUN GUY
                        Then why does Mertaugh get to give 
                        them his shitty ulus? This is a 
                        hand carved stock! It’s gorgeous!

           The noise is deafening. Jane grabs Max’s hand.  

                                 JANE
                        Follow me!

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAYS - DAY

           Max and Jane sprint through winding corridors. Jane rounds a 
           corner and suddenly dodges through a SIDE DOOR. Max follows. 

           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

           A smoky ballroom packed with Alaska Natives. A hanging banner 
           reads: FIRST ANNUAL ALASKA NATIVE FEDERATION MEETING.

           A slide show is up showing a MAP of Alaska divided up, but no 
           one pays attention; they’re all yelling. One man BANGS on a 
           tumbler with a knife, trying to call order. 

           Jane and Max sit at the back. Jane drops her head into her 
           hands. 

                                 JANE
                        This is so, so bad. 
                                 MAX
                        What are you talking about? That 
                        was so fucking righteous. That left 
                        hook--BAM! And we’re in!

                                 JANE
                        It doesn’t matter. My dad saw us. 

                                 MAX
                        So?

                                 JANE
                        He’s going kill both of us and bury 
                        our bodies in monopile concrete 
                        foundation.

           Max laughs. Jane doesn’t. She winds her watch anxiously.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I should just go out and surrender.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Who are you? 

           The room suddenly goes silent. Jane looks up. On stage, a 
           Native man in a turtleneck and horned glasses stares at her.

                                 NATIVE MAN
                        What do you want? 

           He shifts his gaze around the room, but Jane is hooked. 

                                 NATIVE MAN (CONT’D)
                        The land asks all who tread on it 
                        the same questions. Russians, 
                        Americans, the world. Fur. Gold. 
                        Oil. It’s been hunted, torn apart, 
                        cracked open. But before all the 
                        change, before the pain and 
                        struggle and division, before 
                        anyone wanted anything from it, 
                        this land had a purpose. This land 
                        had a soul. Today we reclaim it. 
                        Today we answer. Who are you? What 
                        do you want? 

           The audience is silent for a beat. A drunk man stands 
           unsteadily. 

                                 DRUNK
                        I want to talk about the elephant 
                        that asshole diner guy is keeping 
                        in the horse barn on Spenard.
           The room devolves back into loud arguing. 

                                 MAX
                        Jane. 

           She turns back to him.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        If it’s really gonna be that bad, 
                        we might as well make it count, 
                        right? 

           He searches her eyes. 

                                 JANE

                                 MAX
                        What?

                                 JANE
                        That’s the only suite in the hotel, 
                        1310. That’s where they’ll be.

                                 MAX
                        Hell yeah. Let’s lose some 
                        virginities and save rock and roll.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANCHORAGE WESTWARD HOTEL - DAY

           A COOK tosses garbage bags into an ALLEY behind the hotel, 
           then turns and goes back in. Just before the door shuts 
           behind him, a sneakered FOOT jams it open. Patty looks 
           around, then signals Eli over. They slip inside.

           INT. HOTEL KITCHEN - DAY

           Patty and Eli walk into the kitchen in ill-fitting uniforms. 
           Patty whispers as she struggles to button her top.

                                 PATTY
                        Start with room service tickets. 
                        Look for a big order, anything with 
                        cheese, Paul loves cheese. Or 
                        chocolate, that’s what Ringo always 
                        gets. Cheese and chocolate. If you 
                        find anything, yell FIRE and run. 

                                 ELI
                        What?
           Patty suddenly freezes and holds up a finger. 

                                 PATTY
                        Sh! Did you hear that? 

           She hones in on a sketchy looking blonde waiter. This is 
           MARTY BERKINS (26).

                                 MARTY
                        What do you mean “chips...”

           Patty creeps up behind and TWISTS his nipple. He SHRIEKS and 
           drops the phone. Patty catches it and hangs up. He spins. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck--

                                 PATTY
                        Hey Marty. Long time no see. 

           His face falls. 

                                 MARTY
                        Fuck off, Patty. 

                                 PATTY
                        Gosh, it’s so funny, I was just 
                        talking about you. Fourth of July 
                        coming up and all, and here you are 
                        with your new job. They know how 
                        good you are with fresh meat? 

                                 MARTY
                        I’m calling security.

                                 PATTY
                        Yep, pretty ritzy place. Hell, I 
                        bet they even have crabs. Whattaya 
                        think, Eli? 

                                 ELI
                        If they didn’t before, I bet they 
                        do now. 

                                 MARTY
                        Okay, alright, shut up!

           He looks around frantically.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        What do you want?

                                 PATTY
                        Tell us what room they’re in.
           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

           Eli and Patty nervously weave through the ever growing crowd 
           with a ROOM SERVICE CART. Finally they make it to an open 
           ELEVATOR.

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 

           They shove the cart in and hit a button--

                                 MEL (O.S.)
                        Wait! Hold that! 

           Patty looks up and frantically POUNDS the DOOR CLOSE button. 
           The doors CREAK shut revealing an OUT OF ORDER sign. 

           Mel and Debra stop in front of the elevator, struggling with 
           a LOCK BOX and ROLLING RACK of furs. 

                                 DEBRA
                        Goddamnit, Mel, now what? 

                                 MEL
                        Well, Deb, if the elevator’s out, I 
                        guess we have to take the stairs.

                                 DEBRA
                        Obviously it’s not out, is it Mel? 
                        It’s just some kind of ruse to keep 
                        us corralled here!

           INT. HOTEL BALCONY - DAY 

           Jane and Max scurry along the second floor balcony towards a 
           stairwell.

                                 DEBRA (O.S.)
                        Excuse me. Excuse me!

           Jane freezes. She looks over the railing to the LOBBY below 
           where DEBRA clutches her lock box and taps Vlad incessantly.

                                 DEBRA (CONT’D)
                        Sir! Do you speak English?

           Jane stares, flabbergasted.

                                 MAX
                        What?
                                 JANE
                        That’s my boss and his dickhead 
                        wife!

                                 MAX
                        Not a great reason to stop running. 
                        Come on.

           He pulls her toward a door marked STAIRS as Vlad and Debra 
           continue to spar.

                                 VLAD
                        Missus! You to have to wait with 
                        the rest in the lobby lounge!

                                 DEBRA
                        Excuse me! I will not have to wait 
                        in the lobby lounge! And I want to 
                        know why the elevators say out of 
                        order when I just watched staff use 
                        them!

                                 VLAD
                        You did not see...

           INT. HOTEL STAIRCASE - DAY

           Jane and Max pant as they make their way up a seemingly 
           endless staircase. Max sweats as he hauls his recording gear.

                                 MAX
                        Thank God I wore my trusty 
                        slippers. How many floors are in 
                        this thing? 

                                 JANE
                        Thirteen. Plus the basement. 

                                 MAX
                        Anything for the listeners.

           Jane rolls her eyes. 

                                 JANE
                        No one buys your agenda, man.

                                 MAX
                        What does that mean?
                                 JANE
                        It means you’re trying so hard to 
                        look like you’re in it for the 
                        station, but you clearly just want 
                        to meet Epstein so you can hone 
                        your act.

           Max wipes sweat from his face to conceal his discomfort.

                                 MAX
                        No. That’s not accurate. Anyway, 
                        what about you? I mean, I get 
                        wanting to sleep with a rock star, 
                        it’s just George I can’t wrap my 
                        head around. You don’t think his 
                        whole mystery man thing is an act?

                                 JANE
                        No.

                                 MAX
                        You want to know what I think?

                                 JANE
                        No. 

                                 MAX
                        I think you like him because he’s 
                        quiet. It’s easier to imagine he’s 
                        what you want him to be.

                                 JANE
                        So what? Is that worse than liking 
                        Paul because he’s pretty? Or John 
                        because he’s got a good voice? And 
                        anyway, isn’t that what everyone 
                        does all the time? Isn’t that what 
                        we’re all doing with each other 
                        right now? I’m hoping you’ll be one 
                        way, you’re wanting me to be some 
                        other, until one of us breaks down 
                        and changes, or at least acts like 
                        she does? Aren’t we all just 
                        bouncing our expectations off each 
                        other all the time, hoping we run 
                        into someone it sticks to?

           Max is taken aback.

                                 MAX
                        Sure, maybe, but this is different. 
                        because it’s the music you really 
                        want. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        And it’s okay to want to fuck a 
                        song, hell, it’s okay to fuck a guy 
                        for his song, just as long as you 
                        know what you’re doing. 

                                 JANE
                        You don’t think I know what I’m 
                        doing. 

                                 MAX
                        I know for a fact you don’t know 
                        what you’re doing, because you 
                        don’t get how many girls George 
                        Harrison has been with. 

                                 JANE
                        Oh, right, because I’m just a 
                        dainty girl who dreams of going 
                        steady and having kids the old 
                        fashioned way, by stork.

                                 MAX
                        Thousands, honey. Thousands. 

                                 JANE
                        I don’t care. 

                                 MAX
                        I think you do.

                                 JANE
                        And why is that? What the hell 
                        qualifies you to be an expert on 
                        what seventeen year old girls want? 
                        Because they play your show at 
                        sleep overs?

           She shakes her head. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        See, that’s the thing. Same problem 
                        with you as with every other guy. 
                        Somehow you think talking is the 
                        same as listening. 

                                 MAX
                        Alright, fine. I’m listening. What 
                        do 17 year old girls want?

           Jane shrugs. 
                                 JANE
                        Someone who knows what they’re 
                        doing. Which definitely rules you 
                        out. 

           She glances at Max.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        What are you smiling about?

                                 MAX
                        Nothing. You play my show at sleep 
                        overs?

           She rolls her eyes. 

                                 JANE
                        Idiot.

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           Patty and Eli sit in the dim elevator among the wreckage of 
           room service food, passing an open bottle of WINE.

                                 PATTY
                        Okay, one more time. You be John 
                        Lennon, okay?

                                 ELI
                        Okay. “‘Ello, luv. I’m a real 
                        nowhere man.”

                                 PATTY
                        Oh, John!

           She does an elaborate little giggle, hair toss, eyelash 
           fluttering maneuver.

                                 ELI
                        Yeah, that’s pretty good. 

                                 PATTY
                        I know. Too bad you’re the only one 
                        that’ll see it. 

           She takes a swig.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        You really think we should drop a 
                        bomb on Vietnam?
                                 ELI
                             (shaking his head)
                        I was just pushing Jane’s buttons. 

                                 PATTY
                        You think she’s going to be okay? 

                                 ELI
                        I don’t know. 

           She passes the bottle to him.

                                 PATTY
                        What’s with all the explosions, 
                        then?

                                 ELI
                             (shrugging)
                        I just like chemistry. I like 
                        seeing things change. People always 
                        talk about God making us special, 
                        different from everything else, but 
                        explosions show you that we’re 
                        really all the same. You, me, this 
                        wine, The Beatles. Carbon, 
                        hydrogen, oxygen. All the same. So 
                        if you think about it, no one is 
                        ever coming or going. We’re just 
                        shape shifting. Changing.

                                 PATTY
                        So really, you are John Lennon. 

                                 ELI
                        Basically.

           Patty smiles.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

           Max and Jane hide by an ICE MACHINE ROOM watching a couple 
           extremely confused SECURITY GUARDS head towards the stairs, 
           arguing over the sound of Vlad’s voice on their walkies.

                                 WALKIE
                        Repeat, code five in the lobby! All 
                        dogs go to heaven!

                                 SECURITY GAURD 1
                        I’m telling you, code five is 
                        either an escaped convict or the 
                        septic is broken again.
                                 SECURITY GAURD 2
                        Bet you a buck you’re wrong...

           They disappear into the stairwell. Jane and Max slowly creep 
           out and approach the door. Jane takes a deep breath.

                                 MAX
                        You ready? 

           She nods. He tries the door knob. Incredibly, it’s unlocked. 
           He pushes the door open and steps into...

           INT. SUITE 1310 - DAY

           A huge, extravagant penthouse suite...

           Completely EMPTY. 

           The door suddenly SLAMS shut behind them. They whip around to 
           see DENNIS the bellhop standing in front of the door, 
           gripping his walkie like a gun. 

                                 MAX
                        You gotta be fucking kidding me.

                                 DENNIS
                             (into his walkie)
                        This is Straw Cat, come in Rotten 
                        Tooth, over.

                                 WALKIE
                        Go for Rotten Tooth, over.

                                 MAX
                        Wait wait, hang on a second, man. 
                        You call us in, what’s in it for 
                        you, huh? Let’s make a deal. What 
                        do you want to let us walk? 
                        Fortune? Fame? Free drugs?

           Max holds out the joints. Dennis reaches for them. Jane GRABS 
           his hand. 

                                 JANE
                        Wait. What room are they really in?

                                 DENNIS
                        That’ll be extra. 

                                 JANE
                        How much?

           He taps his chin with the walkie thoughtfully.
                                 DENNIS
                        Fifty. 

                                 MAX
                        Dollars?

           Dennis shrugs. 

                                 DENNIS
                        How bad do you want to meet the 
                        Beatles?

                                 JANE
                        I got fifteen.

           Jane turns to Max.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        You have any money?

           He shakes his head. Dennis raises his walkie. 

                                 DENNIS
                        This is Straw Cat--

                                 JANE
                        Wait! Wait. I can get the money. 
                        Just let me borrow your jacket. 

                                 DENNIS
                        Yeah, right.

                                 JANE
                        Swear to god. Give me ten minutes. 
                        You can keep his recording shit as 
                        insurance.  

                                 MAX
                        No, you can’t-

                                 JANE
                        You can keep him and his recording 
                        shit as insurance. 

           Dennis reluctantly shrugs his coat off. 

                                 DENNIS
                        You’re not back in ten and I’m 
                        calling it in.

           She runs out of the room. 
           INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

           Jane sprints down flight after flight of stairs, passing 
           SIGNS for floors 9, 8, 7...

           INT. LOBBY LOUNGE - DAY

           The Alaska Native conference has ended, adding to the melee 
           100 bewildered Natives, wondering what all these white idiots 
           are freaking out about. Vlad vainly tries to herd them out.

                                 VLAD
                        Sirs, please make to the exit...

           Behind him, Mel lectures the woman with the musk ox scarves.

                                 MEL 
                        Look, I’m not saying there’s 
                        anything wrong with it, but at the 
                        end of the day, ox ain’t fox...

           Nearby, Debra sucks on a cigarette and chatters. The LOCK BOX 
           and RACK OF FURS sit behind her, unattended. 

           Jane creeps up. 

                                 DEBRA
                        ...it’s a lot of power. And just 
                        when you start to figure it out, 
                        BANG! It’s gone. I know. I used to 
                        be young. You know, pretty. But I 
                        had class. Manners. I worked hard. 
                        I was careful. We didn’t have birth 
                        control. These girls now do 
                        whatever the hell they want. And 
                        why? Hm? Why is she so lucky? 

           Behind her, Jane’s face goes steely. She silently snatches 
           the LOCK BOX and slips away.

           Debra flicks her cigarette ash and fluffs her hair.

                                 DEBRA (CONT’D)
                        But you know what I mean. You have 
                        that whole respect your elders law.

           The NATIVE WOMAN Debra is babbling at shrugs blankly and 
           finishes her beer.

                                 DEBRA (CONT’D)
                        Could’ve just nominated Cindy over 
                        at Once in a Blue Moose, but no, 
                        Mel had to make a statement...
                                 VLAD (O.S.)
                        Please, all Eskimos go home now!

           The Native woman turns suddenly.

                                 NATIVE WOMAN
                        Fuck you, Ruski!

                                 NATIVE MAN (O.S.)
                        Yeah, you go home, asshole! 

           Vlad’s walkie talkie BEEPS: 

                                 WALKIE
                        This is Charlie One, I need back 
                        up. I got an old man out here...

           INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

           Jane SPRINTS back up the stairs, past floors 7, 8, 9...

           EXT. ANCHORAGE WESTWARD HOTEL

           Frank glowers over James, who shouts into his walkie. 

                                 JAMES
                        ...Repeat, back up, immediately!

                                 FRANK
                        You better call for back up, kid...

           Vlad jogs up, wheezing. Frank straightens, flips his wallet 
           open to his EARTHQUAKE INSPECTION BADGE.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Earthquake inspection. 

                                 VLAD
                        Today? Impossible. I must choose 
                        reschedule option.

                                 FRANK
                        Earthquakes don’t reschedule and 
                        neither do we. If you want to 
                        postpone, you can evacuate and 
                        close up until you’re ready for 
                        inspection.

           Vlad sighs. 
           INT. SUITE 1310 - DAY

           Dennis and Max wait in awkward silence. Dennis turns the 
           RADIO on. A weird, pubescent voice fills the room:

                                 RADIO
                        Welcome back to KFQD with me, your 
                        host, Dish Master Burt!

           Max stares at the radio in horror.

                                 MAX
                        No no no no no...

                                 RADIO
                        Hey. You know what I’ve always 
                        wondered? Why do girls order 
                        burgers and just eat the fries? 
                        Call in and tell me your thoughts. 
                        Anyway. Here’s The Stones.

           PAINT IT BLACK by The Rolling Stones plays. Max drops his 
           head in despair.

                                 MAX
                        Son of a bitch. 

           Jane BURSTS into the room. 

                                 JANE
                        Got it!

                                 DENNIS
                        No shit?

           She tosses the LOCK BOX on the bed and starts spinning the 
           code in. Max looks on worriedly. He leans in.

                                 MAX
                             (quietly)
                        Where did you get that?

                                 JANE
                        Somebody owed me. 

           Jane takes a deep breath and opens the lock box...They jerk 
           back instinctively.

                                 MAX
                        What the hell is that?

           Jane pulls out a tiny, skimpy LEATHER AND FUR BIKINI. 
           Dennis’s eyes light up. 
                                 JANE
                        Aw, fuck. Hang on, I can still find 
                        the cash--

                                 DENNIS
                        Put it on. 

           They turn and look at him. 

                                 JANE
                        What?

                                 DENNIS
                        I’ve loved Miss Fur Rondy since I 
                        was nine years old. Put it on and 
                        I’ll tell you where they are. Free. 

                                 MAX
                        No fucking way. Come on Jane...

           Jane hesitates a split second. 

                                 JANE
                        Okay. 

                                 MAX
                             (incredulous)
                        What? No, Jane this guy is some 
                        kind of spaz, let’s just go-

                                 JANE
                        Don’t tell me what to do. 

           Jane turns to Dennis. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I need to change. 

           He nods to the bathroom. Max watches in disbelief as she goes 
           in. He turns back to Dennis.

                                 MAX
                        You’re sick.

           Dennis rolls his eyes.

                                 DENNIS
                        Oh please. You want this more than 
                        I do. 

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY 

           Frank follows Vlad, scanning the crowd for Jane. 
                                 VLAD
                        I cannot give you coffee, okay, 
                        because the break room is holding 
                        prison for wild girls...

           He gestures at the window of the break room: Barbara sits 
           glumly inside with a score of other girls. Her eyes widen 
           when she sees Frank. He keeps a poker face. 

                                 VLAD (CONT’D)
                        ...but surely we are code 
                        compliant. I have heard the foreman 
                        of the retrofit was an...anal. Is 
                        this the right word, anal?

           Frank frowns. 

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t think so. 

                                 VLAD
                        Oh, no, you’re right. It’s assho-

           Frank spots the elevator door.

                                 FRANK
                        That elevator really out of order?

                                 VLAD
                        Ah, elevator man comes tomorrow...

                                 FRANK
                        Are you insane? You don’t have a 
                        working elevator? That’s a huge 
                        violation, codes 1002, 202 and 713. 
                        Not to mention you’re way over 
                        capacity. What do you think would 
                        happen if there was an emergency?

                                 VLAD
                        What can I do? I cannot fix. 

           Frank sighs, torn. 

                                 FRANK
                        You have a screwdriver?

           INT. SUITE 1310 - DAY

           Jane steps out of the bathroom in a hotel robe. Dennis’s 
           walkie beeps.
                                 WALKIE
                        Straw Cat, what’s going on in there-

           He turns the walkie off. On the radio, PAINT IT BLACK begins 
           its hysterical crescendo: “Black as night, black as coal...”

                                 JANE
                        Tell me. 

                                 DENNIS
                        Take it off first. 

           Max covers his eyes.

                                 MAX
                        This is so fucked.

           Jane takes the robe off and throws it on the bed. Max can’t 
           help but peer through his fingers: 

           Jane is framed by floor to ceiling WINDOWS, backlit by the 
           late setting sun on the mountains. She towers over the 
           pathetic Dennis, who stares, slack jawed. 

                                 JANE
                        Talk.

                                 DENNIS
                        Sing the song. 

                                 JANE
                        No fucking way.

                                 DENNIS
                        Sing it and I’ll escort both of you 
                        into their room myself. 

                                 JANE
                        I don’t even know the words.

                                 DENNIS
                        Bull. Shit. 

           Dennis turns the radio off and waits expectantly. Jane looks 
           at Max. He looks away. She sighs.

                                 JANE
                             (singing)
                        Eight stars of gold on a field of 
                        blue...

                                 DENNIS
                        With the hand motions.
           Jane sweeps her hands like an interpretive dancer. 

                                 JANE
                        Alaska’s flag, may it mean to you. 
                        The blue of the sea, the evening 
                        sky, the mountain lakes, and the 
                        flow'rs nearby. 

           Max lets his hands fall, watching in mesmerized horror.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        The gold of the early sourdough's 
                        dreams, the precious gold of the 
                        hills and streams. The brilliant 
                        stars in the northern sky: the 
                        Bear, the Dipper, and shining...

                                 DENNIS
                        High.

           Jane glares. Outside, the mountains go neon as setting 
           sunlight suddenly pours into the room. She takes a deep 
           breath.

                                 JANE
                        The great North Star with its 
                        steady light, over land and sea a 
                        beacon bright. Alaska's flag, to 
                        Alaskans dear, the simple flag of a 
                        last frontier.

           Dennis rubs his eye--is he crying? He stands, CLAPPING 
           slowly. Jane clenches her jaw. 

                                 DENNIS
                        Wow. Wow. Wow. They’re on ten. 
                        Whole floor. 

           BANG BANG BANG! Someone POUNDS on the suite door. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        DENNIS?!

                                 DENNIS
                             (screaming)
                        Don’t come in!

           The door SWINGS OPEN. Leo, aka “Rotten Tooth,” stands 
           stunned.

                                 LEO
                        Holy shit, Dennis! 
                                 DENNIS
                        Ah, fuck you Leo. It was worth it.

           Leo charges toward Jane.

           Max hesitates a split second, then THROWS his RECORDING 
           EQUIPMENT. It catches Leo in the gut and bounces to the floor 
           and BREAKS apart.

           Jane grabs the BELLHOP COAT and WALKIE, hurtles over Leo and 
           takes off running down the hall.

                                 DENNIS (CONT’D)
                        Thank you!

                                 MAX
                        Jane! Wait!

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Vlad smokes and stares out the window at the crowd as Frank 
           tinkers with the CIRCUIT BOX by the elevator. 

                                 VLAD
                        The youth I worry for. Especially 
                        the women. Look at them, begging. 
                        Like bitches in heat. Why are they 
                        here? Where are their parents? 

           Frank’s jaw clenches.

                                 FRANK
                        Can’t exactly lock them in kennels.

                                 VLAD
                        Ha! Clearly you have not been to 
                        Russia. 

           Vlad’s walkie squawks.

                                 WALKIE
                        Breach in the Elbow Room! The Straw 
                        Cat has been compromised! Floor 13!

           Vlad rubs his temple. 

                                 VLAD
                        Suka, blyad. Dog under hand, wolf 
                        under fur. Okay. Wait here.

           Vlad wearily shuffles off. Frank SLAMS the circuit box shut. 
           The elevator DINGS! The doors open...
           Eli and Patty, half-clothed and sweatily intertwined, squint 
           in the light. 

                                 FRANK
                        So. The gang’s all here. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Jane trips rigidly down the steps, barefoot, buttoning the 
           BELLBOY JACKET over the bikini. Max runs to catch up.

                                 MAX
                        Jane! JANE! Just stop a second! 
                        Where are you even going?

                                 JANE
                             (not stopping)
                        Tenth floor. 

                                 MAX
                        Look, maybe we should get you some 
                        pants or something. This is all 
                        getting very...out of control.

           Jane laughs bitterly. 

                                 JANE
                        Might as well make it count, right? 

           She PUSHES the stairwell DOOR marked 10 and steps into

           INT. 10TH FLOOR - NIGHT

           The atmosphere is completely different then anywhere else in 
           the hotel. It’s quiet, deserted except for a beleaguered 
           ROADIE in an arm chair who keeps jerking out of sleep and...

           Mel and Debra.

                                 DEBRA
                        ...was just here! Someone took it!

                                 MEL
                        Probably that cow with the musk ox.

           The door SLAMS behind Jane. They look over. Jane laughs 
           incredulously, almost crazily.

                                 JANE
                        Hey Mel!
                                 MEL
                        Jane? What are you doing here...

           Debra suddenly reaches out and RIPS the bellboy jacket open, 
           revealing the fur bikini. Mel GASPS, connecting dots in his 
           mind. He crosses his arms. 

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        Wow. This is very disappointing. 

                                 JANE
                        Tell me about it. 

                                 MEL
                        I thought you were way better than 
                        this, Jane. 

                                 JANE
                        Looks like you were way wrong.

                                 MEL
                        Obviously you’re fired. 

                                 JANE
                        You know, this might blow your 
                        mind, Mel, but I don’t really 
                        fucking care.

                                 MEL
                        After all we’ve done for you--

                                 JANE
                        I never asked for it! I never 
                        wanted any of it! I never wanted to 
                        be a mascot for wholesome fun. And 
                        I goddamn hated working in your 
                        animal holocaust.

                                 MEL
                        Animal holo--How dare you--Fur is 
                        timeless--

                                 JANE
                        No it isn’t, Mel! It’s tacky and 
                        disgusting!

                                 MEL
                        You’re tacky and disgusting! This 
                        is a disgrace to the Fur Rondy 
                        Tradition--

                                 JANE
                        Fuck Rondy.
           Max steps between them.

                                 MAX
                        Hey, woah, let’s all chill.

                                 MEL
                        Who the hell are you?

                                 MAX
                        Max Best. DJ at KFQD? Whatever, 
                        never mind. Listen, we’re at the 
                        threshold of a real opportunity 
                        here, if we can just put our 
                        problems aside...

                                 MEL
                        I’m calling the police.

                                 DEBRA
                        Oh, shut up Mel. Don’t be 
                        ridiculous.

           Everyone turns to Debra in surprise. 

                                 MEL
                        Debra, she stole from us!

                                 DEBRA
                        You were going to give it to her 
                        anyway, what difference does it 
                        make? 

           She turns to Jane, softer than we’ve seen her. 

                                 DEBRA (CONT’D)
                        What’re you doing, Jane? You really 
                        want to be in there, getting passed 
                        around a bunch of strange men? 

           She puts a hand on Jane’s arm. 

                                 DEBRA (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s hard, honey.

           Jane jerks her arm away.

                                 JANE
                        No you don’t. 

           The hotel room door OPENS. Everyone freezes. 

           BRIAN EPSTEIN (31), resplendent and fatigued in a navy suit, 
           steps out and glances at Mel and Debra with their furs. He 
           calls back into the room.
                                 EPSTEIN
                        Which of you lot wanted furs?

           Sounds of arguing VOICES inside the room. 

                                 EPSTEIN (CONT’D)
                        Right. It was George. Come in. 

           Debra gives Jane a long, sad look, then turns and pushes her 
           rack of furs into the Beatles room. 

                                 MAX
                        Wait...I, you...Mr. Epstein...

           Eppstein glances back, vaguely registering Jane clutching her 
           bellhop coat closed.

                                 EPSTEIN
                        Oh splendid. Take this, would you? 
                        Had a bit of a spill. Thanks. 

           He pushes a LAUNDRY CART out and SLAMS the door. 

           Jane and Max stand in stunned silence for a moment. Their 
           stolen walkie CRACKLES. A Russian accented voice:

                                 WALKIE
                        ...All available security to floor 
                        ten. Targets are a male in slippers 
                        and a female in fur bikini...

           INT. HOTEL STAIRWELL - NIGHT 

           Vlad speaks into his walkie as he heaves down the stairs.

                                 VLAD
                        Literally a bathing suit of fur. 
                        This is not a code.

           He steps out of the stairwell and onto 

           INT. 10TH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Empty but for the passed out roadie and a BELLBOY pushing a 
           LAUNDRY CART full of sheets toward the elevators. 

           Vlad squints suspiciously.

                                 VLAD
                        Hey! You! Show me your shoes!
           Max, in the bellboy coat, picks up speed. He gets to the 
           elevator just as it DINGS. The doors open. Inside is Frank, 
           Eli, and Patty. Max freezes.

                                 MAX
                        Uh...I can take the next one...

                                 FRANK
                        It’s fine, there’s room. 

           Max glances back. Another two SECURITY GUARDS BURST into the 
           hallway. Max takes a deep breath and pushes the cart in. 

                                 VLAD
                        Wait-!

           The doors close.

           INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Insanely awkward silence. KICKS by Paul Revere and The 
           Raiders plays quietly. 

           Frank stares straight ahead, seething. Eli and Patty gape at 
           Max, the cart, and Max again. Frank suddenly turns to him.

                                 FRANK
                        You’re young. Maybe you can  
                        explain something for me. What is 
                        it about the Beatles, huh? 

           UNDER THE LAUNDRY CART SHEETS, Jane goes still at the sound 
           of her father’s VOICE. Beads of SWEAT form on her forehead.

                                  MAX
                        Um.

                                 FRANK
                        I mean the reaction. The actual 
                        sheer physical combustion that 
                        makes all these smart, wonderful, 
                        sensitive young women act like... 

                                 PATTY
                        Men?

           Frank shoots a glare at Patty.

                                 FRANK
                        Quiet, you. I don’t know who I’m 
                        more disgusted by. For Christ’s 
                        sake, he’s fifteen, Patricia.
           Under the sheets, Jane’s eyes go wide. What the fuck?

           Eli, Patty and Max stand in silent horror, unable to stop 
           Frank from talking.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Covered in monkey bites like a 
                        couple of goddamned animals.

            He smacks Eli’s neck.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Neither of you breath a word of 
                        this to Jane, understand? 

           Patty glances nervously at the laundry cart.

                                 PATTY
                        But Jane is so sweet and level-
                        headed--a saint, really--I’m sure 
                        she’d understand we’re SO SORRY-

           Beneath the sheets, Jane bites her lip and tries to breathe 
           deeply. 

                                 FRANK
                        No. Clearly she’s...going through 
                        something. Or, Jesus, I don’t know. 
                        Maybe it’s all the same, maybe it’s 
                        a problem with your generation. 

           The elevator DINGS.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        No goddamned self-respect.

           The doors open into the lobby. 

           EXT. LOBBY - NIGHT

           Frank drags Patty and Eli through the lobby toward the BREAK 
           ROOM. Max pushes the cart rapidly toward the LAUNDRY ROOM. 
           Patty looks back desperately.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

           Max pushes the cart into the room and locks the door. The 
           room is hot and damp and flanked with rows of WASHERS, DRIERS 
           and huge piles of WHITE LAUNDRY. 
                                 MAX
                        There’s probably a uniform or 
                        something down here you can wear...

           No response. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Jane?

           He lifts the edge of a sheet and peers in. Jane’s tear 
           streaked face turns away. 

           He picks up the entire pile of sheets with Jane inside and 
           lays it on a stack of comforters. 

           He crawls under the sheet and lays down beside her.

                                 JANE
                        This room used to be on the second 
                        floor. Did you know that?

           He shakes his head. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        During the earthquake it sank ten 
                        feet, straight down. No one was 
                        hurt. My dad says it’s a miracle of 
                        engineering. Someone else’s 
                        miracle. We were at the park, a 
                        bunch of us. I was making out with 
                        James Cook in the back of his 
                        station wagon. A phone pole fell on 
                        it, so we had to walk home. When we 
                        got to our street, all the moms 
                        were standing outside on the 
                        porches, screaming for their kids. 
                        And one by one, everyone ran to 
                        them and were bundled up and taken 
                        inside. But when we got to our 
                        house, the porch was empty. The 
                        door was locked. Eli started 
                        crying. And I just stood there, 
                        waiting for the door to open and 
                        our mom to take us inside. 

                                 MAX
                        Marilyn. 

           Jane turns slowly toward him.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Last request of the night, every 
                        night for two years. Same song, 
                        same dedication.
           He shrugs. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I’m a DJ. I know voices. Knew it 
                        the second you spoke. 

                                 JANE
                        She’s my mom. Was. She was the 
                        music teacher at West High. Bad 
                        foundation. No miracle. 

            Jane stares at her watch, rubbing its glass face.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        She used to say that in a song, the 
                        pauses are more important than the 
                        notes. The space is what makes it 
                        music. That’s where I live. On the 
                        porch, in the longest pause. And 
                        it’s so quiet I can’t barely hear 
                        anything at all.

           They lay in silence for a beat. Somewhere, a staticky radio 
           hums NORWEGIAN WOOD, muffled by the dense tangle of sheets.

                                 MAX
                        You know, the only reason I became 
                        a DJ was so I could change my name. 

           She glances at him. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        My real name isn’t Max Best. It’s 
                        Albie Migliore. 

           She snorts an involuntary laugh. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I know. Not short for Albert, even. 
                        Just Albie. My mom thought she was 
                        so fucking cute. Anyway, got the 
                        KFQD gig, hated it, was thinking 
                        about quitting, then the earthquake 
                        hit while I was on the air. We were 
                        dark for ten minutes and the second 
                        the power came back on the request 
                        line rang. Some guy stuck in a 
                        phone booth next to JC Penny, 
                        asking me to let his family know he 
                        was okay. So I did, and as soon as 
                        I hung up the phone rang again, 
                        rang solid for 30 hours, and I 
                        remember thinking, this is how God 
                        must feel, listening to prayers. 
           He looks at her. She kisses him suddenly. He tries to pull 
           away, but she’s intense, and he’s no match for that damn fur 
           bikini. They make out frantically. 

           She peels off his shirt and grabs his belt. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Wait--

                                 JANE
                        No. 

           She pulls his belt off. 

                                 MAX
                        What about--

                                 JANE
                        Fuck em. 

                                 MAX
                        Are you sure-

           She shoves her hand down his jeans. 

                                 JANE
                        Please. Just shut up and do it. 

           He does. 

           The hum of the washers and beat of the driers drift into the 
           sound of NORWEGIAN WOOD.

           INT. BREAK ROOM - NIGHT

           NORWEGIAN WOOD plays on the radio in a shabby room with 
           battered couches, stale snacks, a flickering TV. A miserable 
           crowd of sniffling GIRLS stand in line to use the phone. 
           Intermittently, furious PARENTS enter and drag a girl out. 

           Vlad talks quietly into his walkie talkie as a BLONDE GIRL 
           sobs on the phone.

                                 BLONDE GIRL
                        I’m sorry, mom...

           Next in line, Patty and Barbara stand together.

                                 PATTY
                        This is a fucking nightmare.

           Eli approaches them, scanning the room and whispering.
                                 ELI
                        Guys, I got an idea. I still have 
                        some black powder and sugar, if I 
                        set off the fire alarm—

           Barbara turns irritably.

                                 BARBARA
                        Shut up, Eli. 

                                 PATTY
                        Don’t be an asshole to him. At 
                        least he’s trying to make it up to 
                        her.

                                 BARBARA
                        No, see, I don’t have to make 
                        anything up, Patty, because I 
                        didn’t do anything. 

                                 PATTY
                        Yeah, you never do anything. 
                        Because you’re never there for her.

                                 BARBARA
                        Oh, is that what you call humping 
                        her kid brother? “Being there”? 

           The snuffling Blonde Girl hangs up. 

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           Frank stalks through the hallways opening and slamming doors. 

                                 PATTY (V.O.)
                        You know, if you pulled your head 
                        out of Teddy’s ass for ten seconds 
                        you’d notice she’s really messed 
                        up, Barbara.

           Frank rounds a corner. At the far end of the hall is a door 
           marked LAUNDRY. 

                                 BARBARA (V.O.)
                        I noticed, Patty, I just don’t 
                        think fucking strangers is always 
                        the best solution. 
           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

                                 RADIO (O.S.)
                        And now, a word from our sponsors! 
                        Have a burger and visit with 
                        Annabelle the elephant at the world 
                        famous White Spot Cafe...

           Jane and Max lay wrapped in sheets next to each other, but 
           distinctly apart. Jane looks far away. Max looks uncertain.

                                 MAX
                        Hey. You okay?

           She glances at him.

                                 JANE
                        Why wouldn’t I be? 

                                 MAX
                        I don’t know. 

           He sees her withdrawing and clears his throat uncomfortably.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        All right. Well. We should probably 
                        get out of here.

                                 JANE
                        And go where?

                                 MAX
                        I mean, I still gotta try to get 
                        something for the station. I don’t 
                        know what you...want...

                                 JANE
                        Wow. You don’t waste time, do you? 

           She stands, pulling the sheets with her and revealing Max’s 
           wiry body in BRIEFS. He scrambles, grabbing the closest CHEF 
           PANTS and pulling them on. 

                                 MAX
                        Wait-what just happened? A second 
                        ago everything was fine.

           Jane pulls on his WHITE SPOT T shirt.

                                 JANE
                        No. It wasn’t. 
           INT. BREAK ROOM - NIGHT

           The line of girls look increasingly pissed as Barbara and 
           Patty fight in front of the phone. Vlad looks nervous.

                                 ELI
                        Guys--

                                 PATTY AND BARBARA
                        Shut up. 

                                 PATTY
                        You’re transparent, Barbie. You’ve 
                        always been jealous of me, because 
                        you're boring. You’re so square 
                        you're practically a cube. 

                                 BARBARA
                        Being a slut doesn't make you 
                        interesting, Patty. 

           Patty SLAPS Barbara! 

                                 VLAD
                        Woah! Woah!

           Vlad tries to break it up, but the crowd is dissolving into 
           chaos. Suddenly Eli’s pubescent voice breaks through--

                                 ELI
                        GUYS! LOOK!

           He points out the small window. Everyone turns curiously...

           The entire room SCREAMS collectively and STAMPEDES toward the 
           door, bursting past Vlad and running into the hallway.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Frank freezes just outside the laundry room, listening. 
           Hearing the SCREAMS, he turns and jogs back the other way.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

           Max bristles as he pulls on what looks like a woman’s BLOUSE

           Jane silently tosses the FUR BIKINI in a GARBAGE CHUTE and 
           watches it disappear into the dark. 

           A faint THUNDERING seems to echo above them. 
                                 MAX (O.S.)
                        You hear that?

           Jane SLAMS the chute door shut and turns around.

           INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

           Jane and Max step cautiously into the thrashed room. It’s 
           DESERTED except for Vlad halfheartedly picking up empty BEER 
           BOTTLES and COFFEE CUPS, cigarette hanging from his lips.

           He doesn’t even look up as Jane and Max walk past, speeding 
           up.

           EXT. ANCHORAGE WESTWARD HOTEL - NIGHT

           Jane and Max jog out into the shapeless chaos of the 
           dispersing crowd. Everywhere cars are starting and driving 
           away, headlights casting disorienting shadows, music blasting 
           from their radios. 

           They nearly trip over a GIRL collapsed on the asphalt, crying 
           hysterically. 

                                 JANE
                        What’s going on? Are you okay? 

           Max stops a passing woman. It’s the MUSK OX LADY.

                                 MAX
                        Hey what happened? What’s wrong 
                        with her?

                                 MUSK OX LADY
                        Paul blew her a kiss. 

                                 MAX
                        What?

                                 MUSK OX LADY
                        Paul. The Beatle. You didn’t see 
                        them? They came out that side door, 
                        in those suits and sunglasses. They 
                        waved...Look! There they go!

           She points down the hill at LIMO in the distance, a wild 
           CARAVAN behind it. She turns back.

                                 MUSK OX LADY (CONT’D)
                        You must’ve just missed them. 
           She shakes her head in amazement as she wanders into the 
           thinning crowd. Jane and Max stand shellshocked for a moment.

                                 MAX
                        FUCK!

           Jane looks dazed as a group pushes past her, laughing. She 
           speaks quietly, almost to herself.

                                 JANE
                        It wasn’t supposed to be like this. 

                                 MAX 
                        Like what?

                                 JANE
                        I don’t know. Pointless. Like 
                        everything else. 

           Jane and Max lock eyes, staring at each other for a beat. 

                                 MAX
                        Well, fuck. I’m sorry, then.

                                 JANE
                        Yeah. Me too. 

           Jane turns and walks off into the thinning crowd. 

           She gets a few paces. A CAR in front of her pulls away...

           FRANK stands, arms folded, staring at her.

           Jane stares back for a moment, as if considering her options, 
           then sighs in resignation, the fight gone out of her. 

           She looks back to where Max was standing, but he’s already 
           gone. 

           INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

           Frank drives in silence. Jane stares out the window blankly, 
           watching the city streak by.

           INT. JANE’S HOUSE - NIGHT 

           JOHNNY CASH on the radio. Frank and Jane enter. Jane goes 
           immediately to her room. 

           Frank sits at the kitchen table, lights a cigarette, and 
           stares at the empty chair across from him for a long beat.
                                 JANE (O.S.)
                        I got into Berkley. 

           She drops the thick ENVELOPE on the table in front of him and 
           sits down across from him. 

                                 FRANK
                        That what you want?

                                 JANE
                        I don’t know. I hadn’t even thought 
                        about it until today. But I want to 
                        be able to find out. 

           Frank rubs his forehead.

                                 FRANK
                        Look, you want to go to California, 
                        go. But you’re not going to find 
                        her out there. 

                                 JANE
                        I know that.

                                 FRANK
                        Do you?

           Jane says nothing. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You can’t escape your blues, Jane. 
                        The world isn’t big enough.

                                 JANE
                        That’s a terrible thing to say to 
                        someone.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m sorry. 

           He lights another cigarette and offers it to her. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Your mom loved this song.

           She accepts the cigarette suspiciously.

                                 JANE
                        I know.

           Frank sighs.

                                 FRANK
                        So. What else.
                                 JANE
                        I got fired. 

                                 FRANK
                        Ah. About time. Those two have 
                        always been freaky.

                                 JANE
                        You’re not upset?

                                 FRANK
                        Are you?

                                 JANE
                        No.

                                 FRANK
                        Then neither am I. 

           Beat.

                                 JANE
                        It doesn’t matter, anyway. None of 
                        it matters. 

           She shakes her head, rubs her watch nervously.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        It used to, you know? It used to be 
                        like breathing. So automatic you 
                        figure life must have it built in. 
                        A point. But then it went away, and 
                        now I can’t remember how I ever did 
                        it. I can’t make anything matter 
                        anymore. Like I forgot how to 
                        breathe.

           Frank nods slowly.

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah. 

           They smoke in silence for a moment.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 JANE
                        Stop being sorry. Don’t be sorry 
                        for me. 

           She looks out the window. 
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I was supposed to be there. You 
                        know that? I was supposed to pick 
                        her up, But I was off fucking 
                        around. So I was late. And now I’m 
                        here, and I don’t belong. It’s 
                        like, there was this terrible mix 
                        up. A mistake. Because she was 
                        important. People needed her. And I 
                        know I’m not who I’m supposed to 
                        be. And I’m so sorry. I’m just so 
                        sorry.

           Her eyes well up. 

                                 FRANK
                        It wasn’t a mistake.

           She looks back to him. He stares at his cigarette.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I did the inspections. Few months 
                        before, walked the foundation, 
                        signed a dotted line saying it was 
                        a-okay. I think about that every 
                        time you leave the house.

           He squints, takes a drag. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        For a long time I thought it was 
                        more important for you to be safe 
                        than happy. And maybe it was, for a 
                        while. But it isn’t any more. 
                        That’s not my job any more. 

           He sighs deeply and stamps out his cigarette

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Never lost a job before. I really 
                        hate it.

                                 JANE
                        You get used to it. 

           He smiles a little sadly.

                                 FRANK
                        This thing that happened will 
                        always have happened. So there will 
                        always be something missing. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                        And I don’t know why it did, but it 
                        can’t be all bad, because when I 
                        look at us, at you and Eli, I still 
                        feel lucky. You’re special, Jane. 
                        You’re a fucking warrior. And you 
                        are going to have a huge life. 
                        Because we are not mistakes. We 
                        belong. Wherever you are, Jane, you 
                        belong.

           He grabs her hand and squeezes it. She smiles. He coughs and 
           brushes the damp from him eyes. 

           Suddenly a PING rings out from the window. Frank opens the 
           side door and flicks on the porch light.

           EXT. JANE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Barbara stands frozen in the light with a handful of pebbles.

                                 BARBARA
                        Hi Mr. Murphy. 

                                 FRANK
                        Hello Barbara.

                                 BARBARA
                        Uh. Can Jane come out to the 
                        Midnight Sun Party?

           He looks at Jane. 

                                 FRANK
                        You want to go a party?

           Jane looks incredulous. She lifts her WRIST WATCH.

                                 JANE
                        You have any idea what time it is?

                                 FRANK
                        No. But in my day Midnight Sun 
                        Parties didn’t even get started 
                        before 2:00 am. So, I’ll tell you 
                        the same thing someone much cooler 
                        once told me: 

           He smiles.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        “Stop looking at your goddamnaed 
                        watch and try fucking living a 
                        little, Frank.”
           EXT. JANE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jane and Barbara walk down the driveway. Frank yells:

                                 FRANK
                        Be home by...the weekend. 

                                 JANE
                        Copy that.

                                 FRANK
                        And if you see Eli, tell him he’s 
                        grounded!

           She waves. He lingers in the doorway, then reluctantly closes 
           the door. Barbara grabs Jane’s hand and immediately starts 
           running.

                                 BARBARA
                        Come on, we gotta hurry!

                                 JANE
                        What the hell is going on? 

                                 BARBARA
                        Patty talked to the Delta girls. 
                        The typhoon’s passed. Beatles leave 
                        in 30 minutes. No one knows, not 
                        even them.

           Jane stops under a street light.

                                 JANE
                        What? No it’s too late, they 
                        already left--

           Barbara shakes her head. 

                                 BARBARA
                        That wasn’t them. That was just the 
                        crazy Russian’s decoy. It’s not too 
                        late, Jane. 

           Understanding dawns on Jane. She smiles, almost 
           involuntarily. Barbara grins and pulls her along.

                                 JANE
                        So where are we going?

                                 BARBARA
                        To the airport! Ted’s working, he’s 
                        getting you on the plane. 
           They round the corner where A CAR idles. Patty sits in the 
           drivers seat. 

                                 JANE
                        No way. I’m not going with her. 

                                 BARBARA
                        You’re not in charge, dummy. 

           Barbara opens the passenger door and easily forces Jane in. 

                                 BARBARA (CONT’D)
                        Say hi to Teddy for me!

           She slams the door. 

           EXT. ANCHORAGE WESTWARD HOTEL - NIGHT

           Max sits dejectedly on the back of a shitty old VW BUS, 
           looking insane in chef pants, hippy slippers and bellboy 
           jacket. He fishes a JOINT out of his cigarette pack and 
           lights it. 

                                 EPSTEIN(O.S.)
                        It’s your lucky day.  

           Max looks up. Brian Epstein stands in front of him. Max gapes 
           at him. He nods at the joint.

                                 EPSTEIN (CONT’D)
                        I can help you take care of that 
                        before the rest of the lads show 
                        up. Merciless bogarts, that lot.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Patty drives, Jane stares out the window.

                                 PATTY
                        Jane--

                                 JANE
                        Don’t talk to me. 

           Beat. 

                                 PATTY
                        We’re all just beings, Jane, sexual 
                        beings, and anyway it was just a 
                        hand job-
                                 JANE
                        Holy shit, shut up! Shut up! Stop 
                        trying to justify everything with 
                        feminist bullshit! Sometimes an 
                        asshole is just an asshole, Patty, 
                        and you’re a fucking asshole. 

           Patty goes silent. She starts to cry a little. 

                                 PATTY
                        I know. I’m sorry. Sometimes I 
                        think maybe I’m sick or something, 
                        you know? 

           Jane softens. 

                                 JANE
                        You’re not sick, Patty. You’re just 
                        really, really horny. 

           Patty laughs tearfully. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I slept with Max.

           Patty wipes a tear away.

                                 PATTY
                        What.

                                 JANE
                        Actually his real name is Albie.

                                 PATTY
                        What?

                                 JANE
                        In the laundry room.

           Patty peers at her closer.

                                 PATTY
                        Oh my god, you actually did. In all 
                        the sheets?

                                 JANE
                        Uh-huh.

                                 PATTY
                        Damn, Jane. That’s kind of hot. Was 
                        it crazy?

                                 JANE
                        Yeah, it was pretty crazy. 
           Patty smiles, shakes her head. 

                                 PATTY
                        Yeah. It’s a crazy thing. 

           EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

           The car stops near the tarmac in view of the CONTROL TOWER. 
           Patty JUMPS out and grabs a PACKAGE from the BUSHES.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

                                 PATTY
                        Here, put this on. 

           Patty hands Jane a DELTA UNIFORM. Jane starts changing.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        So while I was being shamed by your 
                        dad all night, I started thinking. 
                        It’s pathological, right, his 
                        rescue conquest? But it’s also kind 
                        of fucking boss in a medieval way. 
                        Like, most people go their whole 
                        lives without ever being loved like 
                        that. By anyone.

                                 JANE
                        You gonna try to blow my dad next?

                                 PATTY
                        No! Not next. But eventually, yeah. 
                        Definitely.

           Jane laughs as she pins on a name tag reading SALLY. From the 
           CONTROL TOWER a small light FLASHES three times. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Okay then. That’s Ted. This is it.

                                 JANE
                        How do I look?

                                 PATTY
                        Hang on. 

           With a teenage girl’s rapid, delicate precision, she runs her 
           fingers through Jane’s tangled hair, wipes mascara from under 
           her eyes...then stops, shaking her head. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Honestly, you’re pulling it off. 
           Jane starts to open the door. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Love you Jane. 

                                 JANE
                        Love you Patts.

           The jet sits in a pool of light. Jane steps out of the car. 

           EXT. ANCHORAGE WESTWARD HOTEL - DAY

           Epstein passes the joint to Max.

                                 EPSTEIN
                        Nice shoes.

           Max glances down at his moccasins. 

                                 MAX
                        Thanks. They’re...yeah. Thanks.

           Max hits the joint and passes it back.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        How’s it going, anyway?

                                 EPSTEIN
                        Let’s just say I’m determined to go 
                        through the horror of this world.
                             (Chuckles)
                        There’s a quote for your listeners. 
                        You’re one of the DJ’s, right?

           Max looks at him askance. 

                                 EPSTEIN (CONT’D)
                             (shrugging)
                        It’s my job to be omnipotent.

           He smiles but his face is drawn, shadows of a thousand 
           sleepless, pill fueled nights under his eyes. 

                                 EPSTEIN (CONT’D)
                        See, people think as a manager I’m 
                        telling them what to do. But my job 
                        is to protect them from people 
                        telling them what to do.

           Epstein rubs his eyes. 
           INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

           Jane steps slowly through the door of the jet and stands 
           still, taking it all in. Graceland. Mecca. Beatle Heaven: 
           Velvet JACKETS, a dozen GUITARS, cartons of Peter Stuyvesent 
           CIGARETTES, exotic SOUVENIRS... 

           She steps forward, reaches out, and touches a JACKET.

                                 EPSTEIN (V.O.)
                        Because everybody wants a piece, 
                        right? Everyone’s got their own 
                        version of what they mean.

           She unwraps and eats one of Ringo’s German KINDER chocolates. 

                                 EPSTEIN (V.O.)
                        The Beatles are this, The Beatles 
                        are that. They’re hearthrobs, 
                        they’re The Antichrist, they’re 
                        hippies, punks. 

           She pours a scotch, strums the strings of a guitar. Flips 
           through a stack of records (mostly Dylan). 

                                 EPSTEIN (V.O.)
                        They’re ours or mine, they belong 
                        to the label or England or the 
                        youth or the girls. Everyone’s 
                        entitled, everyone thinks they're 
                        owed. 

           She opens a NOTEBOOK to a page of DOODLES: A gun, a fish, a 
           woman, a list of seemingly random words: ABRACADABRA, FAT 
           MAN, BOBBY...and at the bottom, in bold letters, circled:

           REVOLVER. 

           Jane sets the book down and walks to back of the plane.

                                 EPSTEIN (V.O.)
                        And it’s all bollocks. 

           Jane unzips a SUITCASE with GH on the tag. A stack of folded 
           shirts and underwear inside. She takes a shirt and smells it. 

                                 EPSTEIN (V.O.)
                        Because no one owns you unless you 
                        sell yourself. That’s what you’ve 
                        got to remember. Self-
                        determination. Manifest destiny.
           Beneath the shirt is stack of POLAROIDS. She picks them up. 
           All hotel rooms and halls, with only bits of people visible: 
           the back of a head, a red eye, an open, sleeping mouth...

                                 EPSTEIN (V.O.)
                        That’s American, isn't it? That’s 
                        music, and art, that’s freedom: the 
                        right to say fuck it.

           ...and finally, George, alone, in the mirror in a hotel 
           bathroom. The gaze of truly lonely eye.

                                 EPSTEIN (V.O.)
                        The right to say I don’t bloody 
                        know.

           Jane looks out the window at the reconstructed CONTROL TOWER.

                                 EPSTEIN (V.O.)
                        It doesn’t matter what choice you 
                        make as long as you make it. That’s 
                        all that matters. And that’s my 
                        job. To make sure they’re not for 
                        sale. Ah, speak of the devil! Here 
                        we are. Hello, boys.

           Jane looks at her watch. 

           EXT. ANCHORAGE WESTWARD HOTEL - NIGHT

           The Beatles Bus COUGHS to life, alerting the lingering cadre 
           of clever fans. They rush towards it. The bus SCREECHES 
           forward, then LURCHES to a stop. The door opens. 

           Max hops out. Someone in the crowd shouts:

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Holy shit, that’s Max Best!

           The crowd SCREAMS with approval. Max waves. In the sea of 
           faces, Dick Moby’s stands out, stunned. They lock eyes for a 
           moment. Max shrugs. The bus HONKS. He jumps down. 

           Max watches from the parking lot as the bus hurdles into the 
           night, a tail of CARS following close behind. 

           INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

           Off screen, the sound of the airplane door OPENING, FOOTSTEPS 
           filing in, accented CHATTERING.

           Bodies crisscross frame, no one in focus. A RECORD is put on. 
           We follow a head wearing a FUR HAT to the back of the plane. 
           He takes the hat off and tosses it in an open SUITCASE.

           It lands beside a neatly folded a pair underwear. 

           JANE is written on the waistband.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Jane walks down empty streets, through dark neighborhoods. 
           Shadows cast by the STREETLIGHTS underline every crack and 
           wound in the roads and buildings. She slows as she passes

           EXT. THE WHITE SPOT - NIGHT

           The only 24 hour diner in town. Through the window, SKIP (50, 
           ex-marine gone to seed) is visible, cleaning around Otto, 
           passed out at the counter amid a sea of empty BEER BOTTLES.

           Jane rounds the corner and stops.

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           Jane stands at a WOODEN FENCE, looking utterly random in her 
           Delta uniform, staring at the field beyond the fence. A BARN 
           and a few sleepless HORSES stand silhouetted in the twilight.

           Jane leans her forehead on the fence and squeezes her eyes 
           shut. The only sound is the TICKING of her wristwatch.

           Suddenly, Jane’s head bobs, nudged. Her hair musses forward 
           onto her face with a HUFFING sound. She opens her eyes.

           Annabelle the Elephant stands on the other side of the fence, 
           inches away. Jane steps back. Annabelle seems unperturbed. 

           The two stand face to face for a moment.

           Jane steps closer. She reaches her hand out. Annabelle 
           reaches back with her trunk. Jane gently lays her hand on the 
           wrinkled hide, like old friends shaking hands, and looks up 
           uncertainly. 

           Annabelle’s big dark eye looks back, blinking slowly, 
           eyelashes sweeping.  

           Jane starts to cry. Then laugh, then both simultaneously, for 
           the horror, the wonder, the luck and fate of it all.
           After a moment, one of the horses whinnies jealously from the 
           BARN. Slowly, Annabelle turns and Jane watches her trudge to 
           the barn and disappear inside. The field is empty again.

           In the distance, smoke from a BONFIRE snakes into the sky. 
           The faint sounds of laughter and talking can be heard.

           Jane wipes her face and takes a deep breath.

           EXT. EARTHQUAKE PARK - NIGHT

           Hippies are partying, but the mood is tense and paranoid.

           A dozen yards away, down by the mudflats, a BONFIRE burns. 
           The Basies can be heard drunkenly singing The Ballad of the 
           Green Beret: 

                                 BASIES
                        Fighting soldiers from the sky
                        Fearless men who jump and die 
                        Men who mean just what they say 
                        The brave men of the Green Beret!

           Hippies BOO loudly. Jane navigates through the crowd, ducking 
           past BEER CANS and PAINTED FACES. The entire town seems to be 
           present. Familiar faces drift in and out of focus: 

           -The BLUE CHIPS BAND, standing on stumps, plugging into 
           GENERATORS.

           -MARTY BERKINS, JAMES COOK, and two OTHERS dressed as DECOY 
           BEATLES entertain a cadre of enthralled girls.

           -DENNIS the BELLHOP, holding a WESTWARD HOTEL PILLOWCASE in 
           one hand and arguing with a couple of teenage girls.

                                 DENNIS
                        Fifteen for the pillowcase is a 
                        steal! Their faces were on this!

           He clocks Jane and YELLS desperately. 

                                 DENNIS (CONT’D)
                        Oh! Miss Fur Rondy! Miss Fur Rondy!

           Jane keeps walking, heading toward the BONFIRE. 

           EXT. MUDFLATS - NIGHT

           Closer to the bonfire: 
           -MUFFY D and his BASIE BROS, all blind drunk, stumbling after 
           the poor, HONKING one-eyed GOOSE.

           -DICK MOBY, drinking heavily and pouting while his BASIE 
           SIDEKICKS make out with their girlfriends.

           Jane scans the crowd, looking for someone...Suddenly, a 
           wasted Patty intercepts her like a runaway train. 

                                 PATTY 
                        Omigod Jane! How are you here? I 
                        thought you were going to Japan for 
                        sure! Did you and George get into a 
                        fight?

                                 JANE
                        No, Patty.

                                 PATTY
                        You didn’t do it, did you?

           Jane shakes her head. Patty looks bummed.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        That’s okay I guess. Two in one day 
                        would have been kind of much.

                                 JANE
                        That means a lot, coming from you. 
                        Hey, you seen Max--

           Suddenly a BOTTLE ROCKET launches into the sky with a SCREAM 
           and EXPLODES. Everyone CHEERS. Jane narrows her eyes. Patty 
           holds her hands up.

                                 PATTY
                        I didn’t bring him. Swear to God. 

           EXT. BONFIRE - NIGHT

           Jane approaches the bonfire and is met by a wall of GIRLS 
           waving SPARKLERS. She fights to the center where ELI holds 
           BEER and a PUNK he’s lighting sparklers with.

                                 JANE
                        Jesus, kid, haven’t you had enough?

           He turns, his eyes shining in the firelight.

                                 ELI
                        I can’t stop thinking about her
                                 JANE
                        Who, Patty?

            He shakes his head.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. Me either.

           He suddenly holds a HOMEMADE ROMAN CANDLE out to her.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Nah. That’s your thing.

                                 ELI
                        Come on. Just once. You’ll like it, 
                        I bet. Its like being able to see 
                        your feelings.

           She hesitates, then takes the rocket. Eli grins and touches 
           the PUNK to the FUSE. It SPARKS hysterically, hissing.

                                 ELI (CONT’D)
                        Point it up! Point it at the sky!

           She points it up. 

           The fuse hits the rocket. A wonky flame SPRAYS out as it 
           soars, SHRIEKING into the sky, shooting past the drifting ash 
           of the bonfire. 

           It hits a zenith and EXPLODES with a huge raw POP, more like 
           a bomb then a firework. 

           The crowd CHEERS. Eli karate kicks, WHOOPING.

                                 ELI (CONT’D)
                        YES! MAGNESIUM FUCKING OXIDE! 

           Jane stares up in awe, watching the fading embers fall. Eli 
           looks at her and laughs. 

                                 ELI (CONT’D)
                             Pretty good, right?

           She nods. A cute younger GIRL taps Eli on the shoulder.

                                 GIRL
                        Hey. You have any more like that?

                                 BARBARA (O.S.)
                        JANE!
           Jane turns. Barbara stands by a KEG, waving beside TED (24), 
           who indeed looks square as a fucking rubix cube in his 
           GLASSES and ALASKA AIRLINES UNIFORM. Jane walks over to them.

                                 BARBARA (CONT’D)
                        There she is! Former Miss Fur Rondy 
                        1966! Look! Ted’s alive!

           Barbara hangs off him, goofy, giggling. A different person.

                                 JANE
                        Hey Ted, thanks for everything. 

           Ted shrugs, blushing. Barbara beams.

                                 BARBARA
                        Isn’t he a hero?

                                 JANE
                        You guys seen Max around?

                                 BARBARA
                        I think he’s in Kiddy Land. The 
                        hippies set up a whole thing over 
                        there. Just follow the lights.

           Barbara nods at a trail of candles leading into the woods. 
           Jane follows it into a clearing...

           EXT. KIDDY LAND - NIGHT 

           An abandoned PLAYGROUND destroyed by the earthquake: a 
           surreal jungle of twisted MONKEY BARS and ruined CAROUSELS, 
           all lit by CANDLES. 

           A stoned HIPPIE noodles on a LAP GUITAR. Everywhere are 
           TEEPEES, piles of PILLOWS and HAMMOCKS, all occupied with 
           couples. Jane slows, scanning the tangles of limbs...

           Jutting out from the darkness of an open teepee are Max’s two-
           toned Vans SNEAKERS (special from California), tangled up 
           with set of naked LEGS. Jane stands, frozen

           Giggling and whispering issue from the tent. She turns away.

                                 BEARDED GUY (O.S.)
                        Hey! Star child!

           She turns back. The Bearded Guy leans out of the teepee, 
           struggling to keep the nubile girl from entwining him. 

                                 BEARDED GUY (CONT’D)
                        I knew you’d be back. Join us.  
           He peers at her. 

                                 BEARDED GUY (CONT’D)
                        Did you get laid?

           Jane blushes.

                                 JANE
                        What? No, I...wait, so is Max here?

                                 BEARDED GUY
                        Aha. The Voice. Good choice. 

           He points to a small TRAIN TRACK leading deeper into the 
           woods. She starts to follow them, then stops and turns back. 

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Jane follows the mangled train track uphill through the 
           broken forest. Behind are the sounds of the hippies 
           highjacking The Ballad of the Green Berets and turning it 
           into BOB DYLAN’S RAINY DAY WOMEN 12&35. 

                                 HIPPIES
                        They'll stone you when you're set 
                        down in your grave...

           She passes by the lone MAILBOX.

           Finally she reaches a jagged peak. A tangle of decrepit 
           little TRAIN CARS are crowded together. Max sits on one, 
           smoking a cigarette and looking out over the mudflats. 

                                 HIPPIES (CONT’D)
                        But I would not feel so all alone/
                        Everybody must get stoned!

           Max’s SNEAKERS land in his lap. He looks up at her. His eyes 
           light up.

                                 MAX
                        You’re a stewardess now! Weird!

           Jane slides into a train car beside him. The singing factions 
           below compete cacophonously. 

                                 JANE
                        So you get fired or what? 

                                 MAX
                        Nah. Can’t fire the guy that 
                        interviewed the Beatles. 
           He holds up a tape casette. Jane grabs it.

                                 JANE
                        No way. 

                                 MAX
                        Yep. Ringo had it. Some kind of 
                        space age recorder.

           She turns the tape over in her hands. 

                                 JANE
                        What are they like?

                                 MAX
                        Well, for starters, George has just 
                        the tiniest dick. 

           Jane rolls her eyes. Max shrugs.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know. Funny thing seeing 
                        rock stars without their fans 
                        around. Reminds you that a radio 
                        playing to empty room is just 
                        noise, you know? It’s you, the 
                        right person finding the right 
                        song, your heartbeat speeding up, 
                        that’s when it becomes music.

           He scratches at the rust on the train car.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        That’s why I love my job. I get to 
                        be in the middle, turning everybody 
                        on. 

           He nods at the sky.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        And them, up there, they’re just 
                        lucky to be part of it. 

           He looks at her. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        They’re lucky to be part of you, 
                        Jane. And I feel bad for them, I 
                        really do, because they don’t even 
                        know it. 

           Jane smiles. Down in the crowd, a third group starts singing 
           IN MY LIFE by the BEATLES. 
                                 CROWD
                        There are places I remember/
                        All my life though some have 
                        changed/ Some forever not for 
                        better...

                                 MAX
                        You’re right, anyway. I don’t stand 
                        for anything. I’m totally full of 
                        shit. But I do love music. And I 
                        think your mom was wrong. It’s not 
                        the spaces that matter most. It the 
                        collapse. The connect. Me, you, 
                        them. But anyway. I don’t know why 
                        I’m talking. Because you’re right 
                        about that, too, I don’t--

           Jane kisses him. 

                                 JANE
                        Listen.

                                 MAX
                        Yeah.

           The singing below has coalesced into a single voice. The Blue 
           Chips Band pick up the beat and begin to play along. 

                                 JANE
                        I just wanted to tell you, I’m not 
                        sorry.

           He smiles. 

                                 MAX
                        Me either. 

           He leans over and kisses her. Someone in the park SCREAMS out 
           a surprisingly adequate rendition of the piano solo. 

                                 CROWD
                        Some are dead and some are living/
                        In my life I've loved them all.

           Jane and Max separate and look out at the hippies and basies 
           now mingled together, singing in unison. The Decoy Beatles 
           lead aggressively, fully committed. 

                                 MAX
                        Look at these idiots. One good sing-
                        a-long and everyone forgets how 
                        much they hate each other. 
                                 CROWD
                        In my life I love you more!

           Sloppy fireworks POP off in the sky, one after another. 

           Far above, the tiny blinking LIGHT of an airplane sails 
           unnoticed, up, up, and away. 

           INT. JANE’S HOUSE - LATER

           Jane enters, shuts the door silently. She tiptoes past Frank, 
           snoring on the couch in front of the TV. The Twilight Zone 
           plays. She gently removes a cold cup of COFFEE from his 
           hands. Outside, the sky is already beginning to lighten.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jane leans back on her bed and turns her clock radio on.

                                 RADIO
                        ...It’s that time again, time for 
                        the last song. This one’s for 
                        someone special, and I don’t want 
                        to embarrass her, so let’s just 
                        call her the future. When you get 
                        to tomorrow, wait for me there. 
                        Until then...

           She finally unstraps her wristwatch and lets it fall.
