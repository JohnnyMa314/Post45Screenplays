           FADE IN ON:

           KATHERINE TELLER

           40s. Been to hell and back. Cuts and bruises. Sitting at a 
           table. Hard to make out where.

           She spends a lot of time in her head. But here she’s 
           resolute, talking to SOMEONE off-screen.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Our society has become held hostage 
                        by technology...

           EXT. PARK SLOPE. BROOKLYN - DAY

           GLIDING high above the borough.

           Looking down on affluent tree-lined streets -- artisan shops 
           and cafes -- elegant brownstones -- oblivious PEOPLE. 

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        The average citizen thinks it’s a 
                        good thing... 

           TILT UP to see Manhattan’s spectacular skyline looming in the 
           distance -- glistening skyscrapers -- cinemagraph billboards.

           SUPER: NEW YORK, 2033

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        But whenever technology takes a 
                        step forward...

           Suddenly -- we pitch forward and DOWN -- FAST -- a nauseating 
           VERTICAL DROP -- concrete rushing at us --

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        Crime is right there with it.

           And then we STOP -- six feet from the ground -- fluidly 
           PIVOTING UP to find:

           NICK PRENTIS

           staring directly at us -- just stepped out of his brownstone.

           He’s 40s. Had work done. Expensive suit. Habitual air of 
           smarm and confidence turning to panic -- because there’s a:

           BLACK AND WHITE FBI DRONE
           hovering six feet off the ground. It’s called an EYESPY. And 
           it’s looking right at him.

                                 VOICE
                             (from drone’s speaker)
                        Nick Prentis, we have a warrant for 
                        your arrest under the 2020 
                        organized cyber crime act--

           Nick SMASHES his briefcase into the drone --

           Sending it careening into the street -- SHATTERING the 
           windscreen of a moving car --

           The car swerves -- SLAMS its brakes -- CRASHES into an 
           oncoming vehicle while --

           NICK

           BAILS -- running through traffic -- horns HONKING -- 
           sprinting down --

           EXT. AN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Polished shoes SPLASHING through puddles -- reaching the end  
           -- throwing a glance back to see:

           MULTIPLE EYESPY DRONES

           entering the alley -- WHOOSHING towards him as --

           NICK

           banks left -- down a tighter alley -- yanks open a door -- 
           barrels through into --

           INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           SLAMMING the door shut behind him -- running -- turning a 
           corner -- EXPLODING into the insanity of --

           INT. HIGH-END RESTAURANT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Where he COLLIDES with a WAITER -- tray of food going 
           EVERYWHERE! -- COOKS screaming obscenities as --

           Nick scrambles to his feet -- scanning the room -- clocking:

           CHEFS wearing iGlasses -- a WAITER with his phone out -- 
           SECURITY CAMERAS over the pass. 
           And Nick, moving quickly through into the -- 

           INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Slowing down -- trying to compose himself -- passing hip, 
           upscale DINERS -- all with a camera or networked device of 
           some kind.

           Nick hustling out onto --

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Coming face to face with:

           ANOTHER EYESPY DRONE

           which doesn’t waste a beat -- ZAPPP! -- it fires a taser -- 
           hitting Nick in the neck -- delivering a thousand volts --

           His body CONVULSING -- dropping to the ground as --

           AN UNMARKED SURVEILLANCE VAN

           pulls up -- door sliding open -- screens inside with feeds 
           from countless cameras and drones and --

           FBI AGENTS CLARKE and SUNSTEIN step out and grab Nick.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Modern. Hi-tech. A touch-screen table cycling through images 
           of: an office being seized by FBI AGENTS, computers and 
           drives tagged as evidence, employees in cuffs.

           Nick and his LAWYER sitting opposite Clarke and Sunstein.  

                                 CLARKE
                        While you were playing hide and 
                        seek with our eyespies, another 
                        team was raiding your office.

                                 SUNSTEIN
                        We know about the malware. In 
                        ComTech’s app.

                                 CLARKE
                        Gave you back door access into your 
                        customer’s systems, their bank 
                        accounts.
                                 NICK
                        I’m a businessman. If Edgar’s 
                        software was corrupt, you should 
                        talk to him.

                                 SUNSTEIN
                        We have.

           EDGAR DEMIR’s mugshot appears on screen. 

                                 CLARKE
                        Cops picked him up with an underage 
                        hooker and a bag of eightballs. He 
                        rolled on you quick. But there’s 
                        one thing he didn’t know... that 
                        you work for Leon Vasseur.

           Nick: who?

                                 CLARKE
                             (come on)
                        We know you’re close.

                                 SUNSTEIN
                        We just can’t prove it.

                                 CLARKE
                        Vasseur’s smart. Likes his buffers. 
                        But with Demir’s testimony, the 
                        evidence we seized, we got you on 
                        fraud, identity theft, 
                        racketeering.

                                 SUNSTEIN
                        That’s ten to fifteen at Rikers.

                                 CLARKE
                        But we don’t want you. We want him.
                             (beat)
                        US attorney’s willing to cut a 
                        deal, make your charges go away. 
                        All you have to do is cooperate, 
                        testify against Vasseur.

           A beat. Nick leans in to his Lawyer, who whispers to him. 
           Nick nods. Comes back.

                                 NICK
                        Sorry. I don’t know who that is.

           Clarke and Sunstein regard him. Fair enough.
                                 CLARKE
                        See if a night in county changes 
                        your mind.

           EXT. FBI OFFICES. DOWNTOWN - DAY

           Nick, now in jumpsuit, cuffs, shackles. Being escorted to an 
           SUV by Clarke and Sunstein. Lawyer at his side.

           Nick glances up and sees VARIOUS DRONES flying overhead, this 
           way and that. Some are government eyespies. Others with brand 
           advertising like AMAZON, COCA COLA, and so on. 

           Then something low enters Nick’s periphery:

           A MINI-VAN

           turning onto the street -- THE DRIVER wearing a futuristic, 
           tinted MOTORCYCLE HELMET -- turning to look directly at --

           NICK

           for whom time seems to slow down as --

           THE MINI-VAN SIDE DOOR SLIDES OPEN

           revealing a SECOND GUY in a motorcycle helmet -- levelling a 
           sleek, NEXT-GEN MACHINE GUN (called a QUADWAVE) at Nick and --

                                 NICK
                        GUN!

           The agents see it -- pulling Nick behind the car just as --

           VRRRRRR! VRRRRRRRRRR!

           Second Helmet Guy unleashes the WHIRRING terror of the 
           Quadwave. It’s fucking insane. Earth-shatteringly loud. 
           Faster and larger impact than anything you’ve ever seen. 

           It SHREDS the car to pieces in a second. Just fucking 
           decimates it and --

           SUNSTEIN AND CLARKE

           scramble to return fire -- BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! -- ARMED 
           OFFICERS coming out of the building also firing but --

           The mini-van is already tearing away -- its opportunity 
           missed and -- 

           NICK
           just lying there -- frozen -- ears ringing -- mind racing -- 
           taking in the scene --

           There’s glass everywhere. Twisted metal. Something’s on fire. 
           Sunstein and Clarke SHOUTING. Agents HUSTLING. 

           Fuck. This is SERIOUS.

           Then Nick’s being grabbed -- hurried into the building and --

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           His TREMBLING HAND tumbles pills from a bottle into his palm. 

           Nick swallows them. Chases with water from a plastic cup. Too 
           quick. Almost chokes on it. Coughs.

           Lawyer is practically catatonic.

           Nick looks up at Clarke, Sunstein, and now front and center: 
           US ATTORNEY JOHN UNGER (50s). Born and bred for this. Likes 
           to hear himself talk.

                                 UNGER
                        Would appear that Vasseur is not a 
                        gambling man.

                                 NICK
                        Which makes me valuable, yes?

                                 UNGER
                        Depends, on how much you cooperate. 

                                 NICK
                        I’ll need protection. Not just a 
                        couple’a flatfoots posted outside a 
                        safe house. High level protection. 

                                 UNGER
                        That can be arranged. If you give 
                        us something worth protecting.

           A NEWS REPORT

           playing on an HD SCREEN. The REPORTER standing outside City 
           Hall, talking to us.

                                 REPORTER
                        -- shock to the tech and business 
                        world as reclusive tycoon Leon 
                        Vasseur was arrested yesterday on 
                        charges of organized cyber crime. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 REPORTER (CONT'D)
                        Authorities allege Vasseur controls 
                        one of the largest criminal 
                        organizations in the United States. 

           INTERCUT with footage from the field, shot by various news 
           drones of:

           LEON VASSEUR (50s) in cuffs, being led away from his palatial 
           Montauk home by Clarke and Sunstein.

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)
                        He’s been charged with over a dozen 
                        federal crimes, including murder, 
                        conspiracy, and the use of 
                        technology to commit racketeering, 
                        money laundering, financial 
                        manipulation, and identity theft.

           A snippet from Unger’s official press statement. Ticker on-
           screen identifying him as: US ATTORNEY JOHN UNGER

                                 UNGER
                        The indictment of Leon Vasseur is a 
                        vicious blow to the heart of 
                        organized cyber crime. Now I intend 
                        to make that blow fatal in court.

           Back to footage of Vasseur. Arriving at the courthouse.

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)
                        If found guilty, Vasseur faces 
                        multiple life sentences with no 
                        chance of parol-- 

                                 KATHERINE (O.S.)
                        Pause.

           And the image freezes on VASSEUR’S FACE. Confident for a man 
           in his position. From that, reveal:

           INT. KITCHEN. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Katherine. Staring at the screen, which is embedded and flush 
           to the kitchen wall.

           She’s minus the cuts and bruises here. Hasn’t slept a full 
           night in a long time. Sitting at a table. A half-eaten pizza 
           and two crumbed plates.

           The house in constant disarray. Dishes and plants do not fare 
           well.
                                 KATHERINE
                        Power down.

           The screen fades to the same color as the wall. Can’t even 
           tell it’s there now.

           She sits, thinking. A sadness weighing on her.

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Katherine opens a closet. Stares at racks of MEN’S CLOTHING. 
           Shirts, suits, coats. All neatly hanging or folded. 

           Takes out a vintage denim jacket. Brings it to her face and 
           inhales deeply.

           Lost in the scent. Emotion brewing. Almost too much then --

           She puts the jacket on. Feels it. Bit big, but okay.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Open Katherine Andrew slideshow.

           An embedded WALL-SCREEN blinks to life. Begins scrolling 
           through images of Katherine and her husband, ANDREW (30s), 
           happy and in love.

           She watches as their earlier life together unfolds.  

                                 KATHERINE
                        Pause.

           ON SCREEN: a photo of Katherine and Andrew in front of an 
           ADIRONDACK-STYLE HOUSE. He’s wearing the same denim jacket. 
           And she’s holding a baby, LAURA.

           She considers the jacket on her. A wan smile.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Print image.

           A soft WHIR under the wall-screen and a small hard copy of 
           that photo ejects from a printer.

           Katherine takes it. Goes to a locked bedside drawer.

           Presses her thumb to a digi-panel. BEEP-CLICK! The drawer 
           slides open revealing:

           A US MARSHAL BADGE AND BERETTA

           Katherine grabs them both and we CUT TO:
           A SMALL PAIR OF BARE FEET

           bouncing in rhythm to a VIDEO GAME JINGLE. Reveal:

           INT. LAURA’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The feet are dangling off the edge of a bed. LAURA (9) 
           wearing a cutting-edge VR HEADSET - the source of the jingle. 

                                 KATHERINE (O.S.)
                        Laura?!

           Laura doesn’t budge as Katherine enters and sees:

           AN OPEN SUITCASE

           on the floor. Clothes and shoes covering it. Packing 
           abandoned.

           Katherine whips the headset off her.

                                 LAURA
                        Hey, I was in the spectrum!

                                 KATHERINE
                        You’re supposed to be packing.

           Laura sulks, says nothing.

           So Katherine -- frustrated -- ACTIVATES -- quickly jamming 
           clothes and shoes into the suitcase -- no sense of order.

           Laura freaks out -- bounds over and tries to stop her -- 
           pulling things back out.

                                 LAURA
                        No, I don’t wanna bring those! 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Stop! 

           But Laura doesn’t stop. She’s throwing everything out.

           Katherine sits back. Waits until the case is empty. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Are you finished?

           And now Laura is emotional. Teary eyed.

           Katherine, crushed by it. Softens. 
                                 KATHERINE
                        Peach-pear. You know I wouldn’t go 
                        if it wasn’t really important. And 
                        you’ll have fun--

                                 LAURA
                        We’re supposed to go to Moo’s 
                        today.

                                 KATHERINE
                             (remembering, damn)
                        I’m sorry, it slipped my mind. 

                                 LAURA
                        You always say that.

                                 KATHERINE
                        We’ll go soon as I get back.

                                 LAURA
                        That too.

           Katherine, realizing she’s right.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I promise. This time I mean it, 
                        okay?

           Laura nods, half-hearted.

                                 KATHERINE
                        And you can have the biggest sundae 
                        on the menu.

                                 LAURA
                        Everything on it?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Be none left for anyone else.

           Laura studies her. Half-smile. Okay. Starts to re-pack.

           Katherine watches her for a moment. Wants to say something 
           else. But doesn’t.

           Instead, she just moves in to help with packing.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

           Sun low over middle class New Jersey homes. Driveways with 
           late model, streamlined, futuristic cars.
           Katherine’s vintage BMW pulls up. Laura talking. Katherine 
           miles away, deep in thought. 

           Drones WHOOSH by high overhead and --

           EXT. MORGAN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           A door OPENS. Katherine’s sister, MORGAN (30s), coming out.

                                 LAURA
                        Hi, Auntie Morgan!

                                 MORGAN
                        Hello there, Miss Laura. Millie’s 
                        waiting for you. 

           Laura smiles. Hurries inside with her suitcase. Morgan steps 
           out, closing the door.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Thank you--

                                 MORGAN
                        Can you at least call this time?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Mor, you know I can’t--

                                 MORGAN
                        Can’t or don’t want to?

           Hurt by that --

                                 KATHERINE
                        Not fair.

                                 MORGAN
                        This situation’s not fair.
                             (beat)
                        Donnie and me, we’ve been talking. 
                        We think if we have to take her 
                        like this again... she should live 
                        with us, permanently.

           Katherine, stunned. Doesn’t know what to say.

                                 MORGAN
                        She needs a stable home, Kat. A 
                        parent who’s present.

           Katherine chews on that. Knows she’s right. But...
           Her watch DINGS! She looks at the screen. A message: 
           DEPARTURE SET FOR 0500

                                 KATHERINE
                        I can’t do this now--

                                 MORGAN
                        You have to find a way to move 
                        forward. For Laura’s sake. For 
                        yours.
                             (beat)
                        When you get back, you need to 
                        decide what kind of future you want 
                        for her and for yourself.

           Katherine, considering that.

           INT. KATHERINE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           She gets in. Sits there, thinking. Sees Morgan still on the 
           doorstep for a beat, then going in the house.

           A STREETLIGHT CAMERA catches Katherine’s attention.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        Living in the past was my job. 
                             (beat)
                        You see, time travel is real. 

           She starts the car and --

           INT./EXT. KATHERINE’S CAR/FREEWAY - DUSK

           Katherine driving. Merging onto a busy freeway of streamlined 
           automobiles. Hers is one of few older model vehicles.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        It was invented accidentally by 
                        government physicists in the 2020s. 
                        They were attempting to extract 
                        zero-point energy as a power 
                        source, when a quantum implosion 
                        generated a temporal field.

           EXT. FREEWAY - LATER

           Traffic thinned out. Sun dipping. Katherine flicks on 
           headlights as she exits the freeway onto rural roads. 
                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        They developed a system called Axis 
                        to manipulate the field. To connect 
                        two points in time. And use it to 
                        jump into the past.

           EXT. RURAL ROADS - NIGHT

           Driving still. Countryside. Nothing around here for miles. 
           Katherine’s headlights cutting a path through darkness.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        See we’re all anchored to a 
                        specific point in the timeline, 
                        which is constantly moving forward. 
                        You can’t accelerate that. Meaning 
                        we can’t jump into the future 
                        beyond our anchor point, but we can 
                        go back.

           She turns a corner and now we see:

           A heavily reinforced SECURITY FENCE alongside the road, 
           protecting several large, low-slung concrete buildings.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        While the government was exploring 
                        the possibilities and dangers of 
                        Axis, the Department of Justice and 
                        US Marshals were struggling with 
                        the omnipresence of digital 
                        surveillance technology in society. 

           She pulls off the road onto a driveway. Stops at a blacked 
           out gate. Rolls her window. Speaks to a metallic box.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Sierra echo nine four victor seven.

           A green light BLINKS on the box. Gate opens.

           She pulls through into --

           EXT. SECURITY CHECKPOINT - CONTINUOUS

           Stops. Gate closing behind her. Another blacked-out gate in 
           front, blocking her in this zone alongside a security hut.

           Multiple MILITARY POLICEMEN (MP’s) with automatic weapons 
           stand at guard, fingers tickling triggers.

           She looks up at a CAMERA ANGLING ON HER.
                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        There are eyes everywhere now. 
                        Above us, around us. I’m not just 
                        talking phones and drones. Our 
                        lives are digitally dependent. 

           An emotionless MP steps out of the hut. Offers a tablet.

           Katherine presses her hand to it. Lights BLINK and she 
           winces, like she just got pinched.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        Almost everything we interact with 
                        from clothing to shopping carts, 
                        all connected directly or 
                        indirectly to cameras and GPS 
                        trackers.

           MP steps back into the hut. Consults a monitor scanning 
           results and then the following blinks on:

           VOICE ANALYSIS CONFIRMED...
           CLEARANCE CODE CONFIRMED...
           HANDPRINT CONFIRMED...
           DNA CONFIRMED...

           IDENTITY CONFIRMED: US MARSHAL KATHERINE TELLER
           ACCESS GRANTED

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        All networked. Hackable. Tools and 
                        weapons for both sides of the law.

           The second gate opens. Katherine drives on through --

           EXT. MILITARY COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS

           A paved road runs through the field to the nearest building. 
           An old air force hangar.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        These advancements bred a new 
                        generation of criminal. Motivated 
                        hackers-for-hire, known as 
                        Sightseers, could find anyone 
                        anywhere for a price. 

           As Katherine approaches, hangar doors slide open -- 
           INT. SECURE MILITARY FACILITY - CONTINUOUS

           An expansive space. Bright lights. More armed guards, but 
           these have US MARSHAL across kevlar vests.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        This led to breaches in the Witsec 
                        program. There was nowhere we could 
                        hide high-profile witnesses that 
                        the Sightseers couldn’t find them. 
                        Meaning we couldn’t keep them alive 
                        long enough to testify. 

           The hangar’s empty except for a dozen or so cars and a 
           prisoner transport van. Katherine parks. Climbs out. 

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        So time travel offered a solution.

           She approaches a steel door. Places her hand on another 
           panel. Lights blink and she winces again.

           INT. BYGONE BASE - MOMENTS LATER

           Underground. Cavernous but polished. Elevator doors open and 
           Katherine steps into a corridor. Winds through into --

           INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Vast. Dimly lit. Modernist. Dozens of top-line computers 
           running calculations and simulations. Several TECHS and 
           ASSISTANTS working at them. 

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        A small team of Marshals was 
                        designated Operation Bygone. 
                        Overseen by the DOJ. High level 
                        clearance only.

           Katherine moving through, glimpsing databases and news 
           articles being scanned. Algorithms running.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        Our assignment: to hide witnesses 
                        in the past until trial.

           She reaches the largest screen at the center of it all 
           displaying a date range: 08-22-72 - 10-03-72

           Beside her: IAN HAMILTON (30s), a lean ball of energy and 
           proud assembler of eclectic shirt, tie, waistcoat combos. 
           We’re in is his domain.
           He’s wearing AUGMENTED REALITY GLASSES. His hands moving 
           invisible objects.

           IAN’S POV: He is inside a database, streaming FAST through 
           newspaper articles, police reports, weather reports.

           Ian pauses. Sensing Katherine beside him. Pulls the headset 
           off. Sees her looking at the date range. 

                                 IAN
                        Was an Indian summer. Sorry.

                                 KATHERINE
                        The year of Ziggy.
                             (off his look)
                        Stardust. Bowie.

                                 IAN
                        Who?

           He grins. Grabs a fluorescent, bio-enhanced protein shake. 
           Sucks it through a straw. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        You disgust me.

                                 IAN
                             (off shake)
                        Thirteen weeks, no solids. You 
                        should see my core.

                                 KATHERINE
                        You heard what I just said?
                             (then, becoming serious)
                        Is he here?

                                 IAN
                        Briefing with Lowell. They started 
                        without you.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Ops assembling our kit?

                                 IAN
                             (nods)
                        And I need you both in medical.
                             (she turns to go)
                        Oh. Unger’s in with them too.

           Shit.
           INT. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT

           Nick sitting across from Unger and Bygone Director BRIANA 
           LOWELL (40s). If Lowell has a home, she doesn’t see it often. 

           Nick staring at them, trying to wrap his mind around this.

                                 LOWELL
                        You’ll be there until trial. 
                        Accompanied by our most experienced 
                        Marshal.

                        The trial has been expedited, but 
                        with a case of this magnitude it’s 
                        scheduled six weeks out. You keep 
                        your word, testify against Vasseur, 
                        you’ll be given a new identity, new 
                        life, here in the present. 

           Nick, the weight of this on him. His life no longer what it 
           was. Trying to bury it...

                                 NICK
                        Why 1972?

                                 UNGER
                             (ignoring that)
                        Your immunity agreement precludes 
                        you from discussing Operation 
                        Bygone. You so much as mention its 
                        name, your agreement is invalid, 
                        you go directly to jail--

           The door opens suddenly -- and Katherine enters -- everyone 
           turning to look at her.

           Katherine’s eyes instantly lock with Nick’s.

           Unger glances at Lowell, clearly not a fan of Katherine.

                                 LOWELL
                        Nick Prentis, Marshal Katherine 
                        Teller. Your escort and protector.

           Nick rises. Thrusts out a hand to shake. Grinning.

                                 NICK
                        And fellow time traveller?

           Katherine doesn’t shake. Her disdain for Nick is palpable.
                                 KATHERINE
                             (to Lowell)

                        Director Lowell, a word.

           INT. LOWELL’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Katherine watching Unger and Lowell go at it.

                                 UNGER
                        It’s a conflict of interests.

                                 LOWELL
                        It’s my op, John.

                                 UNGER
                        The rest of Vasseur’s organization 
                        has scattered into the woodwork 
                        like fucking cockroaches.

                                 LOWELL
                        I’m aware of the importance--

                                 UNGER
                        So we need someone impartial, 
                        someone whose emotions aren’t 
                        compromised.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Bullshit.

           They stop and turn to her.

                                 UNGER
                        Excuse me?

                                 LOWELL
                        Katherine--

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes, it’s true, I’m not impartial. 

           Unger glances at Lowell. See?

                                 KATHERINE
                        There’s nothing I want more than to 
                        see Vasseur spend the rest of his 
                        life in prison.

                        Meaning there’s no-one else here 
                        more motivated, more singularly 
                        determined to get Nick Prentis to 
                        that witness stand.

           Unger regards Katherine. Relents. Turns back to Lowell.

                                 UNGER
                        Bygone is still experimental. After 
                        the Reyes incident, the A.G.’s eyes 
                        are on us. Prentis doesn’t make it 
                        to trial, we don’t just lose our 
                        key witness against Vasseur, we all 
                        lose our jobs.

           That hangs in the air and we CUT TO:

           THE BACK OF NICK’S NECK

           as it’s ZAPPED with a syringe. He YELPS and we’re now in:

           INT. MEDICAL BAY/PREP ROOMS - NIGHT

           Sleek. Glass partitions. State-of-the-art technology.

                                 NICK
                        What was that?

           Nick feels his neck. Something small and firm under the skin.

                                 IAN
                        Your receiver. It’s a live 
                        connection, tethering you in 1972 
                        to us in 2033.

                                 NICK
                        A live connection?

                                 IAN
                        Think of it like a magnetized 
                        bluetooth device. When you’re 
                        within range of the temporal field, 
                        we connect to your receiver, pull 
                        you back home.

           Ian injects one into Katherine’s neck. Other TECHS and 
           ASSISTANTS are buzzing around them, busy with prep work.

                                 IAN
                        The live connection means time runs 
                        concurrently. One day here equals 
                        one day there.
           Ian moves to a computer. Activates the receivers.

           Nick sees Katherine’s RECEIVER UNDER HER SKIN glow faint 
           blue... once... twice... then fade away.

                                 IAN
                        We can monitor your vitals.

           ON SCREEN: active readouts appear for Katherine Teller and 
           Nick Prentis, heartrates and GPS.

                                 KATHERINE
                        It’s also a tracking device. 

           She shows him a VINTAGE WATCH. Presses her thumb to the face 
           and -- CLICK -- it opens to reveal a DATA SCREEN INSIDE.

                                 NICK
                        So you can keep a leash on me?

                                 KATHERINE
                             (walking away)
                        Our receivers get more than twenty 
                        feet apart and...

           The watch vibrates, emitting a low pulsating HUM.

                                 NICK
                        Cozy.

           Ian keys a command on a tablet. One of the walls slides away 
           to reveal RACKS OF 1970S CLOTHING.

           Nick’s eyes light up.

           INT. CHANGING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Katherine dressing in ‘70s jeans, plaid shirt. 

           Being very careful with her necklace. Because there’s a 
           WEDDING RING on the chain.

           She pauses. Considers it. Then tucks it under her shirt.

           Looks at her denim jacket. Puts it on. Comforting to her. And 
           it’s old enough to work in 1972.

           Empties the pockets of her present day clothes. Puts her 
           phone and present day watch in a tray.

           Stares at the photo of her, Andrew, baby Laura. A moment.

           Then she folds and pockets it.
           INT. MEDICAL/PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Nick in polyester pants and patterned shirt, checking himself 
           out in a mirror. Ian brings him a bottle of pills.

                                 NICK
                        Yeah. Anxiety. Sometimes. Gives me 
                        the tremors.

                        Why 1972?

                                 IAN
                        It’s not always ‘72. We determine a 
                        precise window where any ripples 
                        will be minimal enough for course 
                        correction.

                                 NICK
                        But doesn’t any ripple affect the 
                        future?

                                 IAN
                        No, time is a river. Throw a pebble 
                        in and you cause a ripple, but the 
                        river adjusts and still runs its 
                        course. But, throw a boulder in 
                        and... 

                                 NICK
                        You dam the river.

                        Our system runs a series of complex

                        date range, staying in a suite at 
                        The Regal, any minimal ripples you

                        It’s not a vacation.

                                 NICK
                        I know but--

                        We won’t be leaving the hotel.

                             (terse)
                        There’s a balcony.

           Nick nods. Okay. Noting her obvious disdain for him.

           INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - LATER

           At Ian’s station. Finalizing details. ‘70s driver licences.

                                 IAN
                        You’re Katherine and Nick Dupont. 
                        Staying at The Regal while your 
                        Hamptons house is under 
                        construction.

           Ian lines up small stacks of cash. Freshly reproduced $100 
           bills, circa 1969.

           Nick’s eyes widen. He touches one, like it’s gold.

                                 NICK
                        Haven’t seen actual cash in... I 
                        don’t know, ten years?

                                 IAN
                        Our dollar goes far back there.

           Katherine takes the stack away from Nick. Sets them all in 
           her suitcase. Breaks off loose notes, into her pocket.

                                 IAN
                             (off a tablet)
                        Systems are charged and set. 
           EXT. MILITARY COMPOUND - NIGHT

           Katherine and Nick, each carrying their small suitcases, 
           follow Ian outside. Surrounded by armed US MARSHALS.

           In the middle of a vacant field, floodlights illuminate the 
           Axis technology: a circle of six metal cylinders, about 4ft 
           high, and a console outside the circle.

           Ian and the Marshals stop on the outer perimeter of the metal 
           cylinders by the console.

           Katherine gestures for Nick to enter the circle.

           They step over cables and into the center of it all.

           THE EMBEDDED RECEIVERS

           on the backs of their necks now glow SOLID BLUE under their 
           skin. They are within the temporal field.

           They stand side-by-side, clutching suitcases, facing Ian.

           Ian docks his tablet into the console. Keys in commands. 

                                 IAN
                        Priming the field.

           A low WHIRRING -- the metal cylinders slide open -- an 
           internal compartment extending up -- making them now six feet 
           tall -- just above Katherine and Nick’s head height.

           Ian and the other Marshals all pull GOGGLES over their eyes.

                                 IAN
                        Activating displacement sequence.

           Electricity gently surges inside the cylinders -- glowing -- 
           pulsating -- one after another --

           Slow at first -- then faster -- faster -- FASTER --

           So fast now that everything beyond becomes blurred and --

           To Nick it feels as if he’s SPINNING -- round and round --

           He opens his jaw -- his ears popping -- starts to sway -- 
           swallowing -- like he might vomit.

           Katherine just standing there -- jaw clenched -- fist tight.

           The electricity gets brighter -- BRIGHTER -- BLINDING --

           Then WHOOSH! -- suddenly the lights and sounds cease to be.
           Silence. Darkness.

           Nick blinks. Sways. Disoriented. Strains to make out their 
           surroundings.

           Sounds comes back first. A light breeze through trees. A 
           rooster crowing.

           Nick blinks some more. Darkness becoming blurred vision. 
           Immediate surroundings coming into focus.

           Flattened grass at his feet. Katherine beside him.

                                 NICK
                        Did it...?

           He pauses. Stumbles onto his hands and knees and VOMITS onto 
           the grass.

           Katherine watches. No rush to help. Steadying herself.

           Puffing air through her cheeks. Trying not to vomit also. 
           She’s used to this sensation, but it’s still jarring.

           Nick retches. Vomits again. Just bile coming up now. Then 
           he’s spitting. Breathing.

           Now groaning. Trembling. Clamoring at himself.

                                 NICK
                        My skin... ah God... I’m on fire...

                                 KATHERINE
                        Don’t panic, it passes.

           Nick falls back onto his knees. Clutching his chest. 
           Breathing FAST.

                                 NICK
                        Can’t... breathe...

           Fuck. She has to do something. 

           Fumbles through his pockets. Finds the bottle of Zoloft. Tips 
           one out. Roughly puts a pill in his mouth and forces it shut.

           He dry swallows it. Tries to get his breathing under control.

           She pops back up. Watches him until he’s calmer.

           Then she moves off. Scanning their surroundings.

                                 NICK
                        Are we... are we here?
           Katherine gestures to where the concrete buildings were: 

           There’s nothing there now. No facility, no Axis technology, 
           no Marshals.

           Just an empty field. Trees. A road in the distance. The first 
           glow of dawn approaching. Serene and beautiful.

                                 NICK
                        You could’ve warned me about...

                                 KATHERINE
                        Must’ve slipped my mind.

                                 NICK
                        Right.

           He pulls himself to his feet. Stretching, breathing.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Time to go.

                        We’re walking to the city?

                        There’s a town two miles southeast. 
                        A cab company.

                                 NICK
                        Any chance there’s a restaurant? 
                        Stomach’s empty now.

           He cracks a tight smile. But no smile back from her.

                                 KATHERINE
                        No restaurant.

                        A coffee shop?

                        No.

                        A vending machine?

                        This is gonna be a fun six weeks.

                                 KATHERINE
                        It’s not a vacation.
                                 NICK
                        So you said.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Time to go.

                                 NICK
                        So you said.

           As they walk towards the rising sun, we see the grass all 
           around them is flattened, in a perfect circle where the 
           cylinders were in 2033.

           EXT. FREEWAY - MORNING

           A small town taxicab joins the crush of traffic crawling onto 
           the George Washington Bridge.

           Hundreds of people in vintage cars heading into the city on 
           this already sweltering hot morning.

           INT. CAB - SAME

           Nick and Katherine in back. Sweating. The CABBIE enjoying 
           music jamming from tinny speakers. 

           Nick catches sight of something through the windshield.

                                 NICK
                        Incredible.

           EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - SAME

           The hazy, sun-tinged Manhattan skyline now visible as they 
           cross the bridge. A vastly different sight than in 2033.

           SUPER: NEW YORK, 1972

           And the cab filters into grungy ‘70s Manhattan...

           INT./EXT. CAB/STREETS - DAY

           Making their way through the city. Bumper to bumper traffic. 
           Horns HONKING. People SHOUTING. Chaotic.

           Nick marveling at their surroundings. Katherine un-fazed.

           Gritty Harlem streets. Crumbling buildings. Street art. 
           Colorful nightclub facades. Trash heaped on every corner.
           A Puerto Rican wedding party. Kids on bikes. Sitting on cars. 
           Playing hockey with a tin can.

           The people, the wardrobes, the cars, the sheer lack of any 
           kind of technology. All of it so different.

           Then it changes to the affluent Upper East Side. Nicer, but 
           still a hint of unease beneath the surface.

           The edges of Central Park in full bloom. People walking dogs. 
           Jogging. Snooty well-dressed types going about their 
           business.

           EXT. THE REGAL HOTEL. UPPER EAST SIDE - DAY

           Katherine and Nick climb out of the cab. Regard the grand art 
           deco building.

           A DOORMAN opens the door for them and they step into --

           INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Opulent and sophisticated. Wealthy GUESTS in bright, 
           fashionable 1970s attire and hairstyles. Everyone smoking, 
           drinking cocktails. Attentive STAFF in uniforms. 

           As they reach the check-in desk...

                                 CLERK
                        Good morning. Welcome to The Regal.

                                 KATHERINE
                        We have a reservation under Dupont.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

           A BELLHOP sets their suitcases down in this luxurious space. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        We’ll take it from here, thank you.

           She palms him a healthy tip and he’s gone.

           Nick moves to big windows. Opens balcony doors and feels a 
           warm breeze. Steps outside.

           Drinks in the stunning view of ‘70s Manhattan. Vibrant green 
           of Central Park to his right. Midtown straight ahead. The 
           East River and Brooklyn beyond to his left.

           He goes back inside. Notices that there’s only --
                                 NICK
                        One bedroom?

                                 KATHERINE
                        You’re in there. I’m on the couch.

                                 NICK
                             (realizing)
                        Guarding the only exit.

           She holds up her wrist, pulling back her jacket sleeve to 
           reaffirm the watch. And that she knows his every movement.

           He nods. Spots a big, heavy GLASS ASHTRAY on the table. 
           Weighs it in his hand. Wow. They’re on every surface.

           He sees a NEW YORK TIMES. Amazed by it. Touches the paper.

                                 NICK
                        I remember these.

           Looks at his ink-stained fingers. Turns his nose up.

           She pops open her suitcase. Retrieves her Beretta handgun.

                                 NICK
                        That’s for just in case, right?

           No response. Nick nods. An awkward silence.

                                 NICK
                        So can we eat now?

           Katherine grabs the room service menu. Brings it to him.

                                 NICK
                        We’re seriously not leaving the 
                        hotel?
                             (she nods)
                        What about the Mets tickets I 
                        scalped off the bellhop?

           She gives him a stern look and his grin fades.

                                 NICK
                        I’m joking.

                                 KATHERINE
                        This is not--

                                 NICK
                        --a vacation. Yeah got it.
           Nick exhales. Opens the menu. 

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        And so we waited. No technology, no 
                        cameras, no-one to find us. A safe 
                        haven in time.

           MONTAGE:

           -- A room service cart being wheeled in.

           -- Nick savors a filet mignon, drinks wine. Delicious. 
           Katherine eats pizza, drinks coffee.

           -- Nick watches the Mets game on TV in the bedroom. It’s a 
           bulky Zenith tube set, encased in sturdy oak frame.

           -- Katherine in the living room, doing push-ups, feet 
           elevated on a chair.

           -- Nick savors another steak, drinking wine. Looks across at 
           Katherine eating pizza and drinking coffee. He offers her 
           wine, but she dismisses him.

           -- Katherine doing jumping jacks. Then sit-ups. Then a 
           handstand against the wall... which turns into push-ups.

           -- Nick, amused, watching ELVIS on TV, strutting across a 
           Nevada stage in a white jumpsuit singing “Suspicious Minds”. 
           He changes channel to PRESIDENT NIXON addressing the nation.

           -- Changes channel to news footage of THE WATERGATE BURGLARS 
           being indicted by a grand jury. Nick is captivated by it.

           -- Nick paces, feeling trapped. Swallows one of his pills.

           -- Katherine and Nick out on the balcony. Fresh air. Watching 
           the deluge of New York Marathon runners on the street below. 
           A CRACK of thunder, a storm rolling in.

           -- Nick eats yet another steak, less enthusiastic.

           END MONTAGE ON:

           Nick, hair unkempt and with a short beard now. Staring at the 
           room service menu. Tired, bored, sick of this. Slaps it shut.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        We waited six weeks. One day to go, 
                        then back to 2033. That’s when 
                        everything went sideways.
           Katherine at the table. Playing solitaire with a deck of 
           cards. Sipping coffee. Nick studies her. How to propose this.

                                 NICK
                        Have you ever heard of Mario’s?

                                 KATHERINE
                        We’re not going out to eat.

                                 NICK
                        We should celebrate.

                                 KATHERINE
                        No.

                                 NICK
                        It’s an Italian bistro. Only two 
                        blocks from here. Legendary. A 
                        classic. Shuttered in 2019. But 
                        thriving here and now.
                             (no response)
                        One dinner. One true sampling of 
                        the era. Can it really hurt?
                             (no response)
                        Haven’t I been a model witness?

           She thinks on that and --

           INT. MARIO’S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           An old school Italian place. Dark and cavernous. Candles 
           everywhere. A live quartet playing jazz.

           The air heavy with smoke. People casually dragging on 
           cigarettes, flicking ash into ashtrays as they eat.

           Nick now with a thick mustache shaved out of his beard. 
           Savoring a bowl of decadent pasta. 

           Drains his wine glass. Tops himself up.

           Katherine’s wine is untouched. But she’s enjoying her pizza. 
           A sliver of relaxation for the first time. A job almost done. 

                                 NICK
                        What d’you think of my mustache?
                             (no response)
                        Thought I should blend in.
                             (no response)
                        I might keep it, as a souvenir.

           She ignores him. They continue eating.
                                 NICK
                        So where else have you been on 
                        these trips?
                             (no response, new angle)
                        You can go anywhere in time, where 
                        do you go?
                             (no response)
                        Okay. I’ll tell you mine. August 

           She looks up. Curious.

                                 NICK
                             (grins)
                        Mets Dodgers. We killed ‘em nine 
                        three. Huskey with a home run like 
                        nothing I’d ever seen.

           She exhales. Attention back on the pizza.

                                 NICK
                             (nostalgic)
                        It was a Sunday. Warm.
                             (beat)
                        No matter the week’s drama, my 
                        parents and I going to a game, it 
                        was special. Meant something.
                             (solemn now)
                        Last memory I have of them.

           She looks up at him again. That piece of honesty catching 
           with her. Is there a decent person in there?

                                 NICK
                        Your turn.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Eat your pasta.

                                 NICK
                        But this is the longest 
                        conversation we’ve had.

                                 KATHERINE
                        We’re not friends.

                                 NICK
                        But we’re allies, yes?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Allies?

                                 NICK
                        We’re on the same side now.
                                 KATHERINE
                        We’ll never be on the same side. 

                                 NICK
                        It’s not like I ever actually hurt 
                        anyone.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Are you that delusional? Maybe you 
                        never pulled a trigger, but you 
                        filled the pockets of a man who 
                        pulled plenty. For me, that’s as 
                        good as loading the gun.

                                 NICK
                        And now I’m gonna help put Vasseur 
                        away, so give me some credit.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Credit? You’re only helping because 
                        you got caught, which makes you no 
                        less a psychopath than him.

                                 NICK
                        What is your problem with me? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        You wanna know when I would travel 
                        to, if I could go anywhere in time?

                                 NICK
                        Changing the subject but yea--

                                 KATHERINE
                        2028. Not to a ball game. Or a 
                        fucking restaurant. To the night my 
                        husband died because of Vasseur.

           Nick, taken aback, confused.

                                 NICK
                        Vasseur killed your husband?

           Katherine swallows. Said too much. Stares at him.

                                 NICK
                        What happened--

           She pops up from her chair.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Don’t move.
                                 NICK
                        Katherine--

                                 KATHERINE
                        Just eat your fucking pasta.

           She strides off to the restroom. Nick watches her go. 

           INT. RESTROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Katherine leaning against the sink. Wristwatch vibrating, 
           emitting that pulsing HUM. Trying to ignore it. Deep breaths.

           Pulls her necklace with the wedding ring from under her 
           shirt. Grips it tight. Clenches her jaw.

           It’s everything she can do to not explode.

           INT. MARIO’S RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           She comes back to the table. Composed. Sits.

           Nick, concerned. Regards her. Tries to think of the right 
           thing to say...

                                 NICK
                        I’m not delusional. I know I’ve 
                        made some questionable choices in 
                        my life. But maybe some good can 
                        come from this one...

           He raises his glass.

                                 NICK
                        To Vasseur going away for a very 
                        long time.

           Katherine, taken by that. Raises her glass. Sips.

           Nick drinks. Then back to his pasta in silence.

           Katherine, deep in thought. Drains her glass and --

           INT. LIVING ROOM. SUITE - MORNING

           Sun blazing through curtains. Blinding Katherine as she wakes 
           on the couch. Groggy, bleary eyed, like she’s hungover.

           Suddenly -- she realizes something -- SNAPS AWAKE -- looking 
           around -- as if she can’t remember how she got here.
           THE BEDROOM DOOR

           is wide open and -- she’s on her feet -- moving to it --

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Empty -- fuck -- panic setting in -- she grabs a look at her 
           wristwatch -- but nothing’s amiss and then --

           Nick emerges from the en-suite. Still with the mustache, mid-
           floss, startled by her.

                                 NICK
                        You okay?

                                 KATHERINE
                        What happened last night? After 
                        dinner?

                                 NICK
                        Nothing. We ate. Came back here. 

           She narrows her eyes, rubs her neck, the back of her head.

                                 NICK
                        Oh, well, you, uh, finished the 
                        bottle. You don’t remember?

           Katherine thinks. Trying to find the memories. Frustrated she 
           let her guard down.

           Nick turns to a mirror to finish flossing.

                                 NICK
                        Thought we were starting to 
                        connect, but alas...

           He turns back and she’s gone.

           EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE STREETS - MORNING

           Hazy, stifling hot morning. Traffic teeming. New Yorkers on 
           the move. And then we notice:

           TWO DARK CADILLACS

           navigating traffic in unison. An unbreakable convoy. Each car 
           packed to the gills with MEN IN CHEAP SUITS.

           They park across from The Regal. Four Suits climb out.
           One with a MUSTACHE, one with SIDEBURNS, one wearing aviator-
           style GLASSES, and one with SLICK hair. All with briefcases.

           They look to the back car, waiting for orders, and --

           CORBIN

           emerges -- hardened face and eyes locking on to The Regal.

           He’s 50s. Broad, imposing presence. Takes pride in his 
           appearance. Pinstripe suit is expensive, bespoke, 1970s era.

           Without looking -- he cuts through HONKING traffic like a 
           shark -- heading for the hotel -- the men falling in behind.

           INT. BATHROOM - SAME

           Katherine, fresh from the shower. Pulling a shirt over wet 
           hair. Pauses.

           Considers her necklace. The wedding ring.

           The most important job of her career almost done.

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Long and quiet. A spent room service trolley outside one 
           door. Our Suits crowded around the door opposite.

           Corbin studying a piece of paper. Looks up at the room 
           number: 2959. Nods.

           Sideburns and Glasses step forward -- open their cases -- 
           silently tamper with the door.

           Mustache and Slick open briefcases -- take out Heckler & Koch 
           MP5K short machine guns -- silently -- efficiently.

           Corbin retreats down the hall. Pulls a huge Smith & Wesson 
           revolver from a shoulder holster.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. SUITE - SAME

           Katherine emerges from the bathroom barefoot. Pants and 
           shirt. Drying her hair with a towel.

           She stops. Hears SOMETHING. Eyes snap to the door.

           Nick breezes in...
                                 NICK
                        Would a Mets hat really affect the--

           Her hand goes up forcefully. He freezes. Falls silent.

           And she listens.

           TICKTICKTICKTICK...

           What is that? Oh shi--

           KABOOM! The suite door EXPLODES inward --

           Katherine moves lightning fast -- grabbing Nick -- yanking 
           him to the ground -- as door remnants fly over their heads -- 

           SHATTERING the window on the other side of the room and --

           Katherine BLINKING -- shaking it off -- surrounded by dust 
           and rubble -- ears RINGING -- 

           Pulling it together quickly -- taking hold of a dazed Nick -- 
           dragging him to the bedroom as --

           SIDEBURNS AND GLASSES

           penetrate the smoke -- entering the room -- guns aiming and --

           KATHERINE

           slams the bedroom door shut just as --

           BRRRRRR! BRRRRRRR! -- bullets rip through the door and wall -- 
           one SLICING Nick’s shoulder -- he SCREAMS as --

           Katherine pulls him to the ground -- shielding him as wood 
           and plaster EXPLODE all around them and --

           The TV SHATTERS -- shards of glass and plastic raining down.

           Then silence. Just their breathing. Nick starting to panic...

                                 NICK
                        Ahhhhshit--ohshit--

           She slams her hand over his mouth -- silencing him -- 
           listening to footsteps CRUNCHING outside.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Sideburns and Glasses moving closer to the door -- listening 
           for any sign of life in the bedroom.
           Nothing.

           Sideburns nods to Glasses -- who cautiously tries the handle  
           -- pushes open the door -- 

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Finds Nick’s lifeless body facedown on the floor.

           Glasses moves closer -- realizes something -- spins just as --

           KATHERINE

           launches at him -- SMASHING HIM IN THE HEAD with a heavy 
           glass ashtray -- he drops his gun --

           Which Katherine catches -- spinning towards the door -- just 
           as Sideburns breaches the room and --

           BRRRR! -- she sprays him with bullets.

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Doors opening now -- concerned and curious GUESTS coming out.

           Slick and Mustache wave guns in their direction -- terrifying 
           them -- forcing them back inside.

           Corbin’s eyes locked on the room. Waiting to see who emerges. 
           Cocks back the hammer on his revolver. Aims at the doorway.

           INT. BEDROOM - SAME

           Nick sits up -- in a panic -- clutching his shoulder.

                                 NICK
                        Fuck I’m shot I’m shot--

                                 KATHERINE
                        Put pressure on it.

           He grips the wound -- clenches his jaw -- stifles moans.

           Katherine’s got a steady aim on the door -- waiting -- but 
           nobody else comes.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Behind me, we have to go.

           He stands -- winces -- moves up behind her.
                                 NICK
                        The fuck is happening?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Stay behind me.

           She edges out into --

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Her aim solid and focused on the hole where the door was -- 
           bare feet navigating debris -- Nick close behind.

           Nobody else enters.

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Slick and Mustache at either end of the hall.

           Corbin moving towards the room -- gripping his revolver.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Katherine still with her aim on the doorway -- glances over 
           at her denim jacket slung over the couch. 

           She drops the H&K machine gun -- scoops up her Beretta -- 
           jams her shoes on -- grabs the jacket.

           Moving for the doorway -- Nick right behind and --

           Katherine glimpses:

           THE ROOM SERVICE TROLLEY

           across the HALLWAY -- the reflection on a metal coffee pot:

           CORBIN

           with his revolver -- squeezing the trigger and -- BOOM!

           Katherine ducks just in time -- as what’s left of the wall 
           EXPLODES -- the impact causing her to drop her gun and --

           She looks up -- sees Corbin stepping closer -- re-aiming -- 
           she has one option -- less than a second to act --

           Throws herself at him -- a low tackle -- knocking the 
           revolver from his hands -- they SLAM into the wall but --
           Corbin recovers quickly -- grappling with her -- SLAMMING her 
           into the opposite wall -- denting the plasterboard and --

           SWISH! -- Corbin pulls a blade from his belt -- but Katherine 
           blocks it with one hand -- bringing her elbow straight up --

           WHAM! -- she CRACKS him under the chin -- knocking his head 
           back -- using the momentum -- shoves his head into the wall --

           Corbin drops -- stunned -- looks up at them as --

           SLICK AND MUSTACHE

           advance -- levelling their guns and --

           NICK

           spots a fire alarm on the wall -- yanks it -- and the alarm 
           RINGS! -- distracting everyone for a beat as --

           KATHERINE

           scoops up her Beretta and -- BLAM! -- takes down Slick.

           MUSTACHE

           goes to shoot -- but now EVERYONE is flooding out of their 
           rooms en masse -- blocking his aim and --

           KATHERINE AND NICK

           take the opportunity -- bolting down the hallway -- passing 
           emerging guests --

           Rounding a corner -- they dive into --

           INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           -- just as the doors CLOSE -- and Katherine HAMMERS the 
           “LOBBY” button.

           Riding down. Catching breath. Katherine trying to figure out 
           what happened.

           Nick clutches his shoulder and groans. She takes hold of him. 
           Shifts him around to examine the wound.

                                 NICK
                        Ahh fuck.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Flesh wound, clean through. You’ll 
                        be fine.
                                 NICK
                        I don’t feel fine.

           Blood running down his arm -- DRIPPING on the elevator floor.

           She tucks the Beretta into her waistband --

           Whips off her denim jacket -- throws it around his shoulders  
           -- pulls it tight -- covering the mess best she can just as --

           DING! Doors open -- but they’re not on the ground floor -- 
           they’re picking up GUESTS evacuating because of the alarm.

           Katherine tugs her shirt over the Beretta -- concealing it -- 
           as the elevator fills with people, curious and frustrated.

           INT. LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Elevator doors DING open -- and they step out into a frenzied 
           lobby -- fire alarm still RINGING -- GUESTS being herded out.

           Katherine and Nick join the crush -- hustling out onto --

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Where they hear the oncoming SIRENS -- Katherine’s eyes clock 
           the Cadillacs across the street -- just as they move out in 
           unison and --

           She guides Nick off in the opposite direction -- disappearing 
           into the city.

           EXT. HOTEL SIDE ALLEY - DAY

           More GUESTS flooding out of a fire exit stairwell -- Corbin 
           and Mustache amongst them.

           The guests hurrying to one end of the alley -- the street 
           where FIRE TRUCKS and POLICE CARS are arriving out front of 
           the hotel.

           Corbin and Mustache head in the opposite direction -- to the 
           other end -- a Cadillac pulling up on the adjacent street.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. ERIC GRANT’S APARTMENT - DAY

           A tired old air conditioner RATTLING, working overtime in 
           this tight third floor walk-up.
           ERIC GRANT (30s) stares at it. Weighing an important 
           decision. Sweating through his short-sleeved shirt and tie. 
           Never gives up on anything, yet embraces the status quo.

           Hears something behind him.

           Turns as his girlfriend, CASSIE, enters. A packed suitcase in 
           one hand. A set of keys in the other.

           We now see Grant wearing a sidearm. NYPD BADGE on his belt.

           Cassie lays the keys on the coffee table. Grant regards them.

                                 GRANT
                        You’re really doing this.

                                 CASSIE
                        You know how you can stop me.

           He looks up at her. Wants desperately to say something. But 
           can’t bring himself to. 

           She nods. Leaves.

           And Grant stands here alone. He sinks slowly into a chair. 
           What has he done?

           He looks to the door, like he might go after her... then the 
           phone RINGS.

           EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE STREETS - DAY

           Katherine and Nick hustling along. Nick struggling, gripping 
           his shoulder. Blood soaking through the denim jacket.

                                 NICK
                        Hey, hey, slow down a sec. I’m 
                        gonna puke. No, I’m gonna pass out.

           Katherine steadies him. PEOPLE on the street throw them 
           glances. Katherine sees this. Has to do something.

           INT. PHARMACY - DAY

           A bell over the door DINGS! Small. Hot. No customers. A fan 
           blowing hard on a sweaty PHARMACIST behind the counter. 

           He catches a glimpse of SOMEONE as they disappear down an 
           aisle. Thinks nothing of it.

           KATHERINE
           swipes supplies off shelves. Gauze, bandages, medical tape, 
           alcohol rub.

           PHARMACIST

           sees Katherine now standing across from him. Disheveled, hair 
           still wet. But offering a friendly smile, setting her 
           purchases on the counter.

           Pharmacist starts ringing them up.

                                 KATHERINE
                        There a clothing store around here?

                                 PHARMACIST
                        Two blocks over--

           He hears SOMEONE ELSE (Nick) shifting around, hiding in the 
           aisles. Peers over at BLOOD ON THE FLOOR.

                                 PHARMACIST
                        I don’t serve drug addicts.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m not an addict, don’t want 
                        trouble.

           Pharmacist snatches for a phone behind the counter -- but 
           then he has A GUN IN HIS FACE and --

                                 KATHERINE
                        I just want to buy these things. 
                             (realizing something)
                        And your shirt.

           INT. CADILLAC - DAY

           Corbin in back. Staring at his jacket sleeve, now torn from 
           the fight. Furious.

                                 CORBIN
                        I want their fuckin’ heads.
                             (to Mustache)
                        Do whatever you have to.

           Up in the passenger seat, Mustache nods. Opens the glovebox. 
           Scoops out the installed TELEPHONE HANDSET.

           Corbin looks out at the unsavory streets of ‘70s New York. 
           Realizes something.

                                 CORBIN
                        Wait. Are we near 88th and 1st?
           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Seedy and dilapidated restrooms deep in the park. 

           INT. WOMEN’S RESTROOMS - SAME

           Nick leaning over a sink. More concerned with their grimy 
           environment than the pain as Katherine peels away the bloody 
           denim jacket.

           She tears his shirt open. His shoulder just caked in blood.

           She pours rubbing alcohol over it. Wipes with gauze. Exposing 
           the wound. 

                                 NICK
                        Ah fuck me fuck me.

           She rips open more packets of gauze, tape, bandages. Presses 
           gauze to it tight. Nick grits his teeth.

                                 NICK
                        You didn’t think to get pain meds 
                        while we’re in a pharmacy??

                                 KATHERINE
                        Must’ve slipped my mind.

                                 NICK
                        Right.

           She starts dressing it, taping it up.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Pain keeps you alert, focused. You 
                        recognize him?

                                 NICK
                        The guy with the hand cannon? Yeah. 
                        Michael Corbin. Vasseur uses him 
                        for wetwork.

                                 KATHERINE
                        The others?

           He shakes his head, no.

                                 KATHERINE
                        He could’ve hired local talent.

                                 NICK
                        All of which means you’ve got a 
                        leak, in your team.
           Katherine. Thinking on that. The reality of it. Doesn’t want 
           to believe. But has to be true.

                                 NICK
                        How else could he’ve known where to 
                        find us?

           Then she pauses. Realizes something. Shit.

           Grasps the back of her neck. Where the receiver is embedded.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Fuck. If there’s a mole, they have 
                        access to our receivers. They can 
                        track our movements.

                                 NICK
                        So what do we do?

           Katherine looks around. Finds a graffiti-covered mirror. 
           SMASHES it with the butt of her gun.

           EXT. ANOTHER ALLEY SOMEWHERE - DAY

           A crime scene. Behind a seedy nightclub, not the hotel. 
           UNIFORM COPS. Three bodies, dead a while.

           Grant sucks on a popsicle. Examines the body of a BURLY MAN. 

                                 RUSSO (O.S.)
                        How long’s it been?

           Grant, irritated by that. Turns to RUSSO (40s), his portly 
           partner, always out of breath, smoking a cigarette. 

                                 RUSSO
                        Three years? Four?
                             (no response)
                        Five?!

                                 GRANT
                             (to shut him up)
                        Six.

                                 RUSSO
                             (chuckles)
                        Jesus, and you just let her walk 
                        out?

                                 GRANT
                        Fuck me for mentioning it.
                                 RUSSO
                        What’s your problem?

                                 GRANT
                        I got a dead mobster in an alley 
                        and it’s not even lunchtime.

                                 RUSSO
                        I meant with your old lady.

                                 GRANT
                        I know what you meant.

                                 RUSSO
                        Well I think you’re afraid’a--

                                 UNIFORM COP (O.S.)
                        Detective Grant?!

           Grant looks over. Thankful for the distraction.

           Uniform Cop is by a car at the alley’s mouth. Holding a RADIO 
           HANDSET, thick curled cable stretching out the window.

           INT. WOMEN’S RESTROOMS. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Nick groans and squirms as Katherine pulls the receiver from 
           an incision in the back of his neck.

           It’s small. Like a lithium battery. Ovular and translucent.

           She tapes a piece of gauze over the incision.

           Walks past the SMASHED REMAINS OF HER WRISTWATCH. Drops the 
           receiver in the toilet then flushes.

           She takes a fresh piece of the broken mirror. Feels the back 
           of her neck, locating the right spot. Goes to cut --

                                 NICK
                        You’re seriously attempting that on 
                        yourself?

           She ignores him. Goes to cut. He averts his eyes. Grimaces.

           But she pauses. Offers him the glass.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Here.

           He takes it. She pulls out her Beretta. Grips it tight.
                                 NICK
                        Oh, that’s real trust.

           She presses her fingers as a guide for him where to cut.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Small and quick.

                                 NICK
                        I’ll bet now you’re wishing you got 
                        pain meds.
                             (no response)
                        Or maybe you like it?

           Katherine says nothing. Doesn’t flinch as Nick slices.

           INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - DAY - 2033

           An ALARM BLIPPING!

           Ian yanks off his AR GLASSES -- scrambles to his monitor -- 
           the source of the alarm --

           Knocking his bio-enhanced shake to the floor in the process --

           His eyes locking on the monitor and... SHIT.

           INT. BRIANA LOWELL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Lowell at her desk. Watching a NEWS REPORT on a computer. 

                                 REPORTER

                        testimony to begin tomorrow...

           The door FLIES OPEN -- Ian bursts in with a tablet.

                        They’re offline.

           Lowell kills the report.

                                 LOWELL
                        What?

                                 IAN
                        Katherine and Nick. Their receivers 
                        are offline, dead.

                        Vitals were elevated, spiking, 
                        heart rates and adrenaline off the 
                        charts, then just gone.

                                 LOWELL

                        the temporal grid. News archives, 
                        databases, official and unofficial. 
                        See if anything flags.

                                 IAN
                             (turning to go)
                        Okay, I’ll get everyone on it.

                                 LOWELL
                        No. This stays between us for now.

           Ian stops. Turns back to her. What?

                                 LOWELL
                        No-one else in the loop, 
                        understand?

           Ian nods, reluctant.

                                 LOWELL
                        Straight to me with any intel.

           He nods again and hurries out.

           Lowell watches him go. Snatches up her phone. About to dial, 
           but hesitates.

           EXT. THE REGAL HOTEL - DAY - 1972

           NYPD, fire trucks, ambulances all over the street. UNIFORM 
           COPS holding people back. GUESTS congregated, irritated at 
           the inconvenience.

           Grant double parks his car -- leaping out -- Russo slower -- 
           trailing him as --

           Grant badges a UNIFORM COP at the line.
           INT. SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

           Grant peels back a sheet. Stares at Sideburns. Exasperated.

           Russo enters, out of breath. Stubs his cigarette out in an 
           ashtray. Consulting a notebook.

                                 RUSSO
                        Room occupants: Nick and Katherine 
                        Dupont.
                             (off a piece of paper)
                        Clerk xeroxed ID’s when they 
                        checked in. 

           Grant studies smudged photocopies of Katherine and Nick’s 
           fake licenses. Perplexed. Who are they?

                                 GRANT
                        Get a BOLO to all units.

                                 RUSSO
                        Already done.
                             (beat)
                        So now we’re on two cases?

           A UNIFORM COP hurries in.

                                 UNIFORM COP
                        Sir, we might have something.

           Grant leaving the room with Uniform Cop...

                                 GRANT
                             (to Russo)
                        Stay here. Work witnesses.

                                 RUSSO
                        Oh yeah thanks, partner.

           When Grant’s gone, Russo exhales. Happy to be left behind. 
           Lights up another smoke.

           INT. WOMEN’S RESTROOMS - DAY

           Katherine, the back of her neck taped with gauze. Holding her 
           (husband’s) blood-covered denim jacket.

           It’s ruined, too conspicuous to take. But tough to part with.

           Nick dressing in the Pharmacist’s shirt, which is too big. 
           Watching her. Feels bad about the jacket.
                                 NICK
                        Sorry...

           She nods. Un-wedges the trashcan from under the door handle. 
           Lays the jacket in there.

           A breath. Gathers herself. New resolve.

                                 KATHERINE
                        We have to get back, get you to 
                        that witness stand.

                                 NICK
                        But how? If Vasseur has someone on 
                        the inside, they must know about 
                        the field, where we arrived.

                                 KATHERINE
                             (nods)
                        There’s another way.

           Nick, intrigued by that.

           EXT. PHARMACY. UPPER EAST SIDE - DAY

           Grant bailing out of his car -- hustling inside --

           INT. PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

           Pharmacist missing his shirt, wearing a dirty white tank. 
           Talking to two NYPD OFFICERS.

           Grant shows the xerox of Katherine’s ID to Pharmacist.

                                 GRANT
                        This her?

           Pharmacist peers at it. Nods.

           EXT. MIDTOWN STREETS - DAY

           Katherine and Nick walking. Fast, but not too fast. Trying to 
           blend in.

           Streets are busier, grimier, steamier. Trash piles 
           everywhere. Tobacco billboards and XXX movie theaters. 
           PROSTITUTES brazenly open for business. 

                                 NICK
                        Where are we going?
           Katherine doesn’t answer. Keeps walking. Nick, frustrated. 
           Stops. Stands there in protest.

           She realizes. Turns to him.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Move.

           But a prostitute, skimpy outfit and CHERRY LIPS, is on Nick.

                                 CHERRY LIPS
                        Hey, darlin’.

           Katherine coming back --

                                 KATHERINE
                             (to Cherry Lips)
                        Sell it somewhere else.

                                 CHERRY LIPS
                             (off Nick)
                        He’s taken.

           Katherine shows her gun -- 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes he is.

           Cherry Lips stares at her... then shrugs, whatever. Moves on.

           Katherine grabs Nick’s bad shoulder. He winces and complies, 
           starts walking again.

                                 KATHERINE
                        When Bygone started, each Marshal 
                        was sent back to hide our own 
                        personal Axis tech. In case of any 
                        kind of breach or malfunction. A 
                        contingency protocol. So nobody 
                        would be stuck in the past.

                                 NICK
                        How do you know that’s not 
                        compromised too?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Because I’m the only one who knows 
                        where mine’s hidden.

           INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - DAY - 2033

           Ian and Lowell looking at something ON HIS MONITOR:
           A newspaper article from 1972 New York Times: TERROR HITS 
           UPPER EAST SIDE 

                                 IAN
                        Three bodies, all male, none 
                        identified by authorities. 

                                 LOWELL
                        Nothing on Katherine or Nick?

                                 IAN
                        No, so they’re in the wind. Or she 
                        is and he’s one of the bodies.

                                 LOWELL
                        Theories? 

                                 IAN
                        Best case? It’s unrelated and they 
                        got spooked.

                                 LOWELL
                        Worst case we have a breach. 

                                 IAN
                        Which would mean we have a leak.

                                 LOWELL
                        Which I don’t want to think about.

                                 IAN
                        So let’s hope for best case.

                                 LOWELL
                        But plan for worst. Keep this 
                        between us. 

                                 IAN
                        Roger that. If she’s okay, she’ll 
                        enact the contingency protocol.

                                 LOWELL
                        Means all we can do is wait.

                                 IAN
                        And observe. I’ll keep searching 
                        for any other flags that might 
                        point to a location.

                                 LOWELL
                        Let me know the second you have 
                        something.
           She walks away. Ian watches her go. Eyes narrow. Thinking. 
           Turns back to his system and --

           Lowell walking away. Phone in hand. Still hesitant to dial.

           EXT. MIDTOWN STREETS - DAY - 1972

           A COP comes out of a fast food joint with a greasy bag of 
           junk and a milkshake. Eases his butt into --

           INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Offers the fast food to the driver, COP 2.

                                 COP 2
                        Thanks, partner. Diet’s killin’ me. 

           He pulls a sloppy burger out of the bag. Wrestles with the 
           paper around it and takes a huge bite. Heaven.

                                 COP 1
                        How you eat that shit in this heat 
                        is beyond me.

           Cop 1 sucks on his cold milkshake. Relief. Something catches 
           his attention down the street.

                                 COP 1
                        You got descriptions on that BOLO 
                        just went out?

           Cop 2 follows his eyeline to see:

           EXT. MIDTOWN STREETS - SAME

           Katherine and Nick. They’ve stopped walking. He’s bent over, 
           leaning against a payphone, breathing. 

                                 NICK
                        I just... need a minute.

           Katherine scans their surroundings. Amongst the bustle, she 
           spots the SQUAD CAR -- Cop 1 with a radio in hand.

                                 KATHERINE
                        We don’t have one.

           Nick sees the squad car. Shit.

           COP 1
           pops out the car -- starts towards them -- but Katherine and 
           Nick are already moving FAST in the opposite direction --

           Cop 1 realizes they’ve been made -- bundles back into the car 
           and -- Cop 2 pulls out after them as --

           KATHERINE 

           pulls Nick down an alley -- looking for a way out -- there’s 
           another street at the far end -- but she spies:

           A FIRE EXIT DOOR AJAR

           and she yanks it open -- hustling Nick inside -- just as --

           THE SQUAD CAR

           BLIPS its siren on the street -- moving cars and pedestrians 
           out of the way -- BLASTS into the alley --

           Cop 1 leaping out -- sees the fire exit door ajar --

           INT. CORRIDOR - SAME

           Dark and tight. Katherine and Nick hurrying through. MUSIC 
           coming from somewhere... and other sounds -- what is that?

           They hear the door back down the corridor opening -- daylight 
           flooding in and --

           They’re running now -- pushing through another door into --

           INT. XXX MOVIE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

           A seedy porno show. Katherine and Nick right down by the 
           screen -- looking up at dozens of mesmerized PATRONS bathed 
           in flickering light.

           They glance at the screen and see flesh and whoa, disgusting.

           But they have to keep moving -- up a set of stairs --

           Shuffling down a row -- pushing past irritated patrons -- 
           dropping into seats -- sinking low -- trying to blend as--

           The exit door by the screen opens and Cop 1 bursts in --

           CLICK! -- his flashlight illuminating patrons -- who are now 
           scattering for the main exit and --

           KATHERINE
           pushes Nick up -- joining the crush of vacating pervs into --

           INT. LOBBY. XXX THEATER - CONTINUOUS

           Passing display stands for various XXX movies -- moving with 
           the other escapees onto --

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Where the pervs disperse and Katherine spots:

           THE SQUAD CAR

           Cop 2 inside -- on the radio -- sees them.

           KATHERINE

           grabs Nick -- running -- turning a corner and --

           COP 2

           on foot now -- huffing -- moving as fast as he can -- turning 
           that same corner and stopping -- shit -- because there’s a:

           VIETNAM WAR PROTEST

           underway here -- hundreds of PROTESTORS with anti-war and 
           peace signs -- MARCHING and CHANTING and --

           KATHERINE AND NICK

           are deep within the crowd -- pushing through -- going against 
           the flow -- hard work -- she glances back and sees:

           COP 2

           joined by Cop 1 as they try to follow and --

           KATHERINE

           realizes something -- turns to one PROTESTOR -- shouting 
           something barely audible because of the din.

           Protestor nods and gives her his sign.

           Katherine holds it up -- chanting -- going with the flow of 
           the march -- pulling Nick with her and --

           THE COPS

           are now swamped. Completely lost. Their suspects gone.
           EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Katherine and Nick turn down here -- splitting off from the 
           march -- tossing the anti-war sign -- running onto --

           EXT. ANOTHER STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Where they drop back to a casual walk. Both fighting to catch 
           their breath. To regain some calm.

           Nick rotates his shoulder. Winces.

                                 KATHERINE
                        You good?

                                 NICK
                        A daquiri in the Caymans would be 
                        good...
                             (beat)
                        How much further?

           Katherine scans the street.

           Trying to get her bearings. Sees something in the distance 
           and... relief.

           EXT. PHARMACY. UPPER EAST SIDE - DAY

           Grant spreads a map of Manhattan across the hood of his car. 
           Unwraps a fresh a popsicle and jams it in his mouth.

           Studies the map. Sucks on the popsicle.

                                 GRANT
                        Hotel’s there.

           Presses his finger to the location of The Regal. Traces it 
           south through the city and stops.

                                 GRANT
                        We’re here.

           The popsicle DRIP-DRIPS on the map.

                                 NYPD OFFICER
                             (coming off his radio)
                        They were spotted around 52nd and 
                        Madison, sir.

           Grant traces his finger south on the map to 52nd and Madison.
                                 GRANT
                             (sotto)
                        Where are you headed?

           He continues to trace his finger along the same directional 
           line... until he reaches: GRAND CENTRAL.

           EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

           The ornate building looms large, full of history. But here 
           outside it’s seedy and dirty. Littered with addicts and 
           homeless people.

           A sweaty DEALER palms drugs to a DESPERATE JUNKIE. And then 
           something catches Dealer’s attention:

           KATHERINE AND NICK

           picking their way through people and heading inside.

           Dealer studies them, brow furrowing. Curious. 

           INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Katherine and Nick -- heads down -- moving for ticket sales.

           Dealer watches them from way back. Sees Nick standing off to 
           one side. Katherine talking to a TICKET SELLER. Handing over 
           cash for two tickets. Then moving on.

           Dealer waits a beat. Moseys up to the Ticket Seller. Smiles, 
           revealing crooked yellow teeth.

           A PAYPHONE

           is snatched up by Dealer ACROSS THE LOBBY -- he feeds it 
           quarters -- punches a number -- someone answers.

                                 DEALER
                             (into phone)
                        I seen ‘em. They headin’ north.

           INT. LOWER LEVEL CONCOURSE - DAY

           Katherine and Nick hustling through a quiet underpass -- 
           heading to the platforms when -- 

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Nick and Katherine Dupont!

           And Katherine and Nick stop -- spin to see:
           GRANT

           coming up behind -- gun levelled at them.

                                 GRANT
                        Police, don’t move!

           Katherine registers him and FREEZES. Her face goes slack, all 
           life just drained out of her. She’s shaken to the core.

                                 GRANT
                        Hands in the air!

           Nick’s hands shoot up -- he glimpses at Katherine -- 
           wondering what to do -- but she’s too shocked to move.

                                 GRANT
                        Get ‘em in the air, NOW!

           Katherine slowly raises her hands -- Nick glancing back and 
           forth between them -- something’s wrong with her.

                                 GRANT
                        Interlace ‘em behind your head. On 
                        your knees slowly.

           They don’t. So Grant steps closer, only a few feet away now.

                                 GRANT
                        Do it!!

           Katherine opens her mouth to speak -- but words don’t come 
           out -- her lips trembling and then --

           The CLICK CLACK of heels and VOICES as -- TWO TRAVELLERS 
           enter the underpass behind Grant --

           Startling him -- causing him to spin around -- which 
           terrifies the Travellers and --

           Nick seizes an opportunity -- LAUNCHES at Grant -- PUNCHING 
           him in the face -- dropping the stunned agent and --

           Katherine fucking loses it:

                                 KATHERINE
                        NO!!

           The Travellers flee in the background as --

           Katherine tackles Nick off Grant -- SLAMMING him into 
           concrete -- Nick SCREAMS in pain -- clutches his shoulder --
           Katherine scrambles up -- Grant’s unconscious -- she checks 
           his pulse -- still beating.

                                 NICK
                        The fuck?

           Katherine rifles through Grant’s pockets -- finds his badge -- 
           ID -- a photo -- his name: ERIC GRANT.

           It rocks her.

                                 NICK
                        I had to do something.

           Katherine. Too stunned to respond.

                                 NICK
                        Katherine! Hey!

           Nick hears SHOUTING -- from the direction Travellers ran -- 
           he grabs her -- startling her out of the daze.

                                 NICK
                        We have to move! NOW!

           She SNAPS back.

           There’s a drinking fountain nearby -- she snatches cuffs from 
           Grant’s belt -- drags his body over -- locks him to a pipe.

           Nick goes for GRANT’S GUN on the ground -- but Katherine puts 
           her foot on it first -- he looks up --

                                 NICK
                        Think I need one, considering--

           She kicks it away from him -- over to Grant.

           Nick rises -- shows his palms -- fair enough -- then she 
           grabs him -- hustling him down to --

           INT. PLATFORMS -- CONTINUOUS

           They run onto their platform -- train about to depart -- 
           doors being closed -- and just in time --

           Katherine catches a CONDUCTOR -- flashing their tickets.

           A SHAKY HAND

           pushes a pin through dark silk. We are now:
           INT. SUIT STORE - DAY

           Small, high-end, family-owned. Corbin being fitted for a new 
           suit jacket by an anxious elderly TAILOR. Who pushes that pin 
           in too far.

                                 CORBIN
                        Fuck.

           He shoots a death stare at Tailor, who backs off. Offers an 
           apologetic smile.

           Then Tailor continues pinning the jacket.

           Corbin glances at Mustache standing with his back to the 
           street door. His cheap, scruffy suit.

                                 CORBIN (CONT’D)
                        Know what my father used to say?--

           Corbin WINCES. Because Tailor stuck him again. 

                                 CORBIN (CONT’D)
                             (to Tailor)
                        Al. I’m disappointed. I read such 
                        good things.
                             (matter of fact)
                        You stick me again and I’ll stick 
                        you in your fuckin’ eye.

           Tailor swallows. Nods. Shaky hands moving in.

           Corbin looks back to Mustache. 

                                 CORBIN (CONT’D)
                        Never underestimate the effect of 
                        the right suit, he used to say. 
                        ‘Course, he was a tailor, so he was 
                        talkin’ about the effect on your 
                        boss or your lady. Our line of 
                        work? It lowers people’s 
                        expectations. They see a tailored 
                        suit, cut from Italian silk, they 
                        think you’re something you’re not. 
                        A businessman on his way to a 
                        lunch. Then BAM! Their brains are 
                        all over the sidewalk.

           Watching Tailor’s shaky hand push in another pin. We wait for 
           it... but all good.

                                 MUSTACHE
                        Your old man was a tailor?
                                 CORBIN
                             (nods, thoughtful)
                        As was I. At one point in time.

                                 MUSTACHE
                        How come you ain’t no longer?

           Tailor pushes in another pin.

           Corbin eyeballs Mustaches. Deciding whether or not to answer. 

           Mustache feels the heat, a potential misstep.

                                 MUSTACHE
                        Not my business.

           A beat, and then...

                                 CORBIN
                        Needle’n thread was my family’s 
                        bread’n butter. Time I was 
                        thirteen, my father’s got 
                        arthritis, can’t grip a needle. So 
                        I’m working the cloth for him. 
                        Problem was, he couldn’t stay away 
                        from the track. Day comes he gets a 
                        call from the family he owes money 
                        to. They’ll clear his debt, they 
                        say, if he comes quick’n stitches 
                        someone up. ‘Course he can’t do it. 
                        So there I am, not even old enough 
                        to drive, stitching a man’s neck 
                        back together. Thing is, I wasn’t 
                        scared. It was just a job. And I 
                        did such a fine one, we start 
                        getting more calls.

           Tailor pushes in another pin.

                                 CORBIN
                        Time I’m eighteen, I must’a 
                        stitched fifty men. One night, I’m 
                        working on a capo when five guys 
                        come to finish him off. The capo’s 
                        men are taken by surprise. It’s a 
                        fuckin’ bloodbath. I see this gun 
                        on the floor and... a minute later 
                        the five guys are dead and I’m 
                        finishing my job.
                             (beat)
                        The boss hears what happened. He’s 
                        so impressed he takes the needle 
                        out of my hand and puts a gun in-
                        OWW!
           He looks down at Tailor, who just stuck him again.

           A KNOCK on the door and Corbin’s attention SNAPS to that as --

           Mustaches opens up. A guy with a CREWCUT leans in and 
           whispers. Mustaches listens. Closes the door. Nods to Corbin.

                                 CORBIN
                             (urgent now, to Tailor)
                        Off...

           Tailor helps Corbin out of the new jacket, revealing Corbin’s 
           shoulder holster and revolver.

                                 CORBIN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll finish it myself when I get 
                        home.

           Corbin takes the jacket from Tailor, whose nervous eyes are 
           on the revolver.

                                 CORBIN
                        Al, I wasn’t serious about the eye 
                        thing...

           Tailor relaxes. But then suddenly -- Corbin pulls his knife -- 
           very fast -- STABS Tailor in the heart three times!

                                 CORBIN
                        Heart’s much quicker.

           INT. PASSENGER CARRIAGE. TRAIN - DAY

           Katherine and Nick moving through rows of seats as the 
           commuter train chugs along. 

           A KID drops his Mets hat in the aisle. Nick scoops it up. 
           Admires it. 

                                 NICK
                        Hey, nice hat, kid.

           He stares at the Kid with his MOM and DAD. And it deeply 
           affects him. Triggers memories. 

           The parents stare back at him. Getting awkward now. Dad’s 
           about to say something when --

                                 KATHERINE
                        Keep moving.
                                 NICK
                             (handing the hat back)
                        Hang on to it, be worth something 
                        someday.

           Katherine and Nick move along until --

                                 KATHERINE
                        Here.

           Nick sits where he’s told.

           Katherine sits next to him. Breathes. On edge. Mind racing. 

           Nick glances at the Kid and parents. Their surroundings. The 
           train. Sadness washing over him. Breaking out of it --

                                 NICK
                        I need a drink. 

           He pops to his feet. She rises. Blocking him in the seat.

                                 KATHERINE
                             (hushed)
                        Sit down.

                                 NICK
                        You wanna play eye-spy? After the 
                        morning we’ve had, I need an adult 
                        beverage.
                             (off her)
                        And I’m sensing you do too.

           Katherine, thinking on that. Finally backs off.

           EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY

           The train slices its way through suburban communities on its 
           journey from urban to rural. 

           INT. BAR CAR. TRAIN - DAY

           Katherine and Nick sitting at a table with drinks. The air 
           thick from people around them smoking.

           Katherine observing upstate New York whizzing by. Thoughtful.

           Nick sips. Blanches.

                                 NICK
                        Far from a daiquiri in the Caymans.
           He can tell she’s rattled. Broaches this with caution...

                                 NICK
                        What happened back there, with that 
                        cop?

           She considers him for a long moment. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        That cop... is my husband’s 
                        grandfather.

           INT. LOWER LEVEL CONCOURSE - DAY

           Travellers and STATION OFFICIALS gathered around unconscious 
           Grant. An Official picks up his badge and ID --

           Just as Grant SNAPS AWAKE -- looks around -- what the hell?

           INT. BAR CAR. TRAIN - DAY

           Nick staring at the photo of her and Andrew.

                                 NICK
                        Fuck me, what are the odds.

           She points at something behind them in the photo: the 
           ADIRONDACK-STYLE HOUSE surrounded by trees.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Our cabin. Well, it will be. Was in 
                        the Grant family for decades. 
                        Barely used, except for the 
                        occasional summer vacation.
                             (beat)
                        That’s where we’re heading.

           Nick notices she’s fondling her wedding ring on the necklace. 

                                 KATHERINE
                             (off the ring)
                        It was Andy’s grandmother’s. So 
                        Eric Grant’s wife.

                                 NICK
                        Are they married? Eric and his 
                        wife, here in ‘72?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Not yet.
                                 NICK
                        So Andy’s father hasn’t been born?

                                 KATHERINE
                             (shakes head)
                        Not until ‘73.

           She drinks. Nick sees her hands are trembling. Seems 
           genuinely concerned. 

           The train slows and shudders as it pulls into a station.

           INT. PLATFORM - SAME

           People getting on and off. And then --

           CORBIN

           striding onto the platform -- precise and focused -- flanked 
           by Mustache, Crewcut and THREE MORE GUYS IN SUITS.

           They board in the middle carriage, then separate. Corbin, 
           Mustache, and Crewcut go left. SQUARE JAW, BEARD and STRIPED 
           SHIRT go right.

           INT. BAR CAR. TRAIN - MOMENTS LATER

           The train tugs out of the station and gets going again.

                                 NICK
                        At the restaurant, you said Vasseur 
                        was responsible for your husband’s 
                        death?

           She studies him for a long beat.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Andy was with the Bureau... OCC 
                        task force. They had intel Vasseur 
                        was running a human trafficking 
                        operation, so they moved on it.
                             (beat)
                        Turned out they weren’t shipping 
                        people, but weapons. The crew 
                        running the site was armed to the 
                        teeth and it went sideways.
                             (beat)
                        Andy and two other agents were 
                        killed. 

           She looks down at the photo. 
           Nick. Not sure what to say other than...

                                 NICK
                        I’m so sorry.

           She nods, thinking. Then...

                                 KATHERINE
                        And of course, they couldn’t tie 
                        any of it directly to Vasseur. 

           INT. PASSENGER CARRIAGES - SAME

           Corbin, Mustache, and Crewcut spreading through -- moving 
           along -- checking PASSENGERS -- not finding their prey.

           INT. BAR CAR - SAME

           Nick points to the photo, to the baby in Katherine’s arms.

                        Who’s this then?

                        She was so young when it 
                        happened...
                             (hard to accept this)
                        And I’ve been so hung up on what I 
                        lost, so consumed by it, I haven’t 
                        been there for her.

                                 NICK
                        People say the brain is like a 
                        sponge, but grief can just as 
                        absorbent.

           He becomes thoughtful. She regards him. Remembers...

                                 KATHERINE
                        That Mets game. It was the last 
                        memory of your parents?

           Nick thinks on it. Nods. 

                                 NICK
                        My dad always liked to beat the

                        and a drunk driver hit us head on. 
                        I was lucky. Broken leg and arm, 
                        three cracked ribs.
                             (beat)
                        My mom and dad died instantly.

           Katherine takes this in. Nick reflects on it. A sincere 
           connection between them. The universality of loss.

                                 KATHERINE
                        What happened to you after?

                                 NICK
                        I had no other living family. Which 
                        meant I ended up in the system, 
                        bouncing around shitty foster 
                        homes. Last couple, they were good 
                        to me, but they just wanted a kid 
                        to help them steal and run cons. I 
                        was so angry by then, I took to it.

           A long beat. Both thinking. Nick redirects, drives home a 
           point...

                                 NICK
                        You lost your husband, but you

                        back home. Waiting for you.

           She nods. That truth hits home for her. But...

                        What if... our interaction with

                             (thinking)
                        What was it your operations man 
                        said? Throw a pebble in a river, 
                        the river still runs its course. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I just hope this was a pebble, not 
                        a boulder. 

                                 NICK
                        I vote pebble. It’s not like I 
                        kicked him in the balls.

           Katherine can’t help but crack a smile at that. But then her 
           eyes land on SOMETHING beyond Nick and her face falls.

           Nick spins to see -- through the bar car door window:
           CORBIN

           in the next carriage -- coming their way with Mustache.

           Fuck.

           Katherine, on her feet -- back to the door -- pulling Nick up 
           -- and they’re walking quickly -- calmly -- through into --

           INT. PASSENGER CARRIAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Where Katherine stops a beat -- takes out her Beretta -- 
           discretely holds it low at her side as --

           She puts Nick in front of her -- moving through and --

           A ROCKER GUY

           suddenly pops up in front -- startling them!

                                 ROCKER GUY
                        ‘Scuse me.

           They dance a little as he navigates his way past Katherine 
           and Nick -- walking away from them --

           Katherine pushing Nick onward when suddenly --

           BLAM!! Katherine’s back is SPATTERED WITH BLOOD!

           She spins to see:

           ROCKER GUY

           took the bullet instead of her -- dropping to reveal:

           CORBIN

           re-aiming his revolver -- PASSENGERS cowering, SCREAMING -- 
           and he squeezes the trigger just as --

           WHOOSH! -- the train plunges into a tunnel -- everything 
           going DARK as --

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

           SCREAMS mix with the RATTLING OF THE TRAIN as darkness 
           continues until --

           THWWWWP! -- we’re sucked back out into daylight and --

           Corbin lowers his gun -- scanning the carriage.
           No sign of Katherine and Nick. But he does see:

           THE DOOR AT THE OTHER END OF THE CARRIAGE

           bouncing open and -- Corbin sprints for it -- livid -- 
           Mustache and Crewcut behind -- exploding into --

           INT. NEXT CARRIAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Full of STARTLED PEOPLE -- Corbin and his men aggressively 
           search for Katherine and Nick.

           Meanwhile back in the --

           INT. PREVIOUS CARRIAGE -- SAME

           People are panicking, freaking out.

           And then -- Katherine and Nick -- ease out from underneath 
           seats -- where they hid when the lights went out.

           Katherine glances at the door to the next carriage, where 
           Corbin is. Looks around for something to lock or jam it.

           The CONDUCTOR hurries through from the opposite end --

                                 CONDUCTOR
                        What happened--ohmyGod--

           Sees the dead body of Rocker Guy -- reaches for the emergency 
           stop cable.

                                 KATHERINE (O.S.)
                        Don’t!

           Conductor spins to Katherine pointing her Beretta at him.

                                 KATHERINE
                        How do we cut the last carriage 
                        loose?
                             (he’s frozen, no response)
                        HOW DO WE CUT IT LOOSE?!

           But before he can answer, Nick spots:

           THE OTHER SUITS

           stepping into the carriage from the opposite end.

                                 NICK
                        KATHERINE!
           She looks beyond Conductor -- pushes him down and --

           BLAM! BLAM! -- she takes out Square Jaw -- but Beard and 
           Striped Shirt return fire and --

           KATHERINE AND NICK

           dive behind seats -- trapped in the middle of the carriage 
           now -- Katherine returning fire as --

           Everyone else hits the deck -- scrambling for safety and --

           CORBIN

           hears it from the other carriage -- pivots and hurries back.

           KATHERINE

           exchanging fire with Suits -- drops low and BLAM! BLAM! -- 
           takes out their legs under the seats.

           She grabs Nick and they run -- stepping over the Suits and --

           Nick scoops up one of their guns -- just as --

           CORBIN

           enters at the other end and fires -- BLAM! BLAM! --

           Katherine takes cover as windows EXPLODE behind her and -- 
           Nick fires back -- forcing Corbin to grab cover as --

           Mustache and Crewcut explode through behind him -- unloading 
           their guns as --

           KATHERINE

           grabs Nick -- and they burst out of the carriage --

           Running now -- sprinting -- carriage to carriage -- passing 
           confused and panicked Passengers.

           Katherine ejects her Beretta clip. Empty. Fuck. Tosses it 
           aside -- grabs the gun Nick took from Suit --

           BACK IN THE PREVIOUS CARRIAGE

           Conductor on his feet -- yanks at the EMERGENCY STOP CABLE --

           KATHERINE AND NICK

           feel the jolt -- falling to the floor -- as the train 
           SCREECHES and SHUDDERS to a stop.
           They scramble up and Nick sees:

           THE METS HAT 

           on the floor -- the Kid pulling away from his Parents -- 
           running for it as --

           MUSTACHE AND CREWCUT

           burst in -- opening fire -- spraying bullets wildly and --

           NICK

           dives for the Kid -- dragging him down between seats -- 
           covering him as --

           KATHERINE

           pops up from a seat behind the Suits and -- BLAM! BLAM! -- 
           drops them both. 

           Silence. Except panicked breathing and crying.

           Nick pops his head up -- Christ, is it over? -- sees 
           something --

                                 NICK
                        BEHIND!!

           Katherine spins -- just as Corbin appears right behind her -- 
           his revolver coming up to her face and --

           She dodges sideways -- just in time as -- BLAM! -- he fires -- 
           missing her -- and she dives forward and -- 

           BITES HIS FUCKING HAND!

           He GROANS -- dropping his gun -- but immediately launches an 
           elbow into her face -- WHAM! --

           She drops her gun -- stunned -- stumbles back as he throws a 
           right hook and --

           She ducks just in time -- counters -- jabbing him in the face 
           -- but he’s not fazed and -- 

           She swings -- he blocks -- jerks forward and headbutts her --
           she staggers back -- spitting blood while --

           NICK

           is scrambling for the gun she dropped as --

           CORBIN
           comes at her -- throwing punches -- thick and heavy --
           Katherine blocking or dodging each one -- countering --

           A brutal and furious fight ensues -- Katherine’s efficient 
           mix of Aikido/Krav Maga vs Corbin’s savage boxing and -- 

           NICK

           has the gun now -- but no clean shot as --

           CORBIN

           sees an opening -- his hand gripping Katherine’s throat --

           But she grabs his thumb and -- SNAP! -- breaks it -- forcing 
           his hand away --

           Corbin winces but not down for long -- CHARGES at her --

           BLAM!

           A bullet punctures his throat -- he staggers -- STARTLED -- 
           drops into a seat -- hands clamoring for the wound as --

           Katherine spins -- sees that it was Nick who fired -- and 
           then she rushes to Corbin.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Who was it? Who sold us out?

           Corbin looks at Nick. Tries to say something. Gargling. Blood 
           flooding out of him.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Who d’you have on the inside? Ian? 
                        Lowell? Unger??

           Corbin’s brow furrows. And then he’s dead.

           Katherine. Fuck. Didn’t get an answer.

           Grabs his revolver. Checks his pockets. Finds bullets.

           Regards the terrified Passengers. Looks out the window at 
           where they’ve stopped. Middle of nowhere.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           The train just sitting there. People vacating. The DRIVER 
           looking for the Conductor.

           In the distance: Katherine and Nick running through a field.
           EXT. COUNTRY ROADS - DAY

           They emerge from trees -- hot -- sweating -- out of breath. 

           Katherine scans the empty road. Trying to determine location.

           INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - DAY - 2033

           Ian at his computer. Staring at digitized newspaper articles. 

           Photographs of the train. Headlines such as: TRAIN SHOOT-OUT, 
           HORROR ON THE RAILS, and so forth.

           INT. BRIANA LOWELL’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Lowell swiping through the same articles on a tablet. Lands 
           on one article with: A PHOTO OF CORBIN.

                                 IAN
                        It’s a major ripple. System’s 
                        running algorithms to determine 
                        implications on the timeline.

                                 LOWELL
                        Katherine and Nick?

                                 IAN
                        There’s a statewide manhunt, but no 
                        mention of arrests. I’m checking 
                        all law enforcement in the county.

                                 LOWELL
                        Do whatever you can to pinpoint 
                        their location.

           Ian nods and exits.

           Lowell with her phone. Shit. Dials now.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROADS - DAY - 1972

           Hot blazing sun. Air thick with humidity. Katherine and Nick 
           walking. No sign of any cars. Tired, sweaty.

           Nick stops, keels over. Breathing hard. His shoulder.

           Then Katherine sees something in the distance... 
           INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           The DRIVER spots Katherine in the road, waving him down. He 
           eases to a stop.

                                 DRIVER
                        You okay?

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m sorry.

           Driver sees Nick now at the passenger window with his gun.

           EXT. THE STOPPED TRAIN - DAY

           POLICE all over this. Dozens of them. Paramedics and Fire 
           Department too. Passengers being escorted away.

           Grant bounces his car onto grass -- jumps out of it --

           Whisks over to UNIFORMS holding a cordon of SPECTATORS and 
           REPORTERS -- badges them -- moving through --

           INT. THE STOPPED TRAIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Grant examines Corbin’s body. Looks around at the wreckage. 
           Just confounded by it all.

           Flash bulbs POP all around him as the scene is documented.

           INT. NEXT CARRIAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Grant picking through debris. Something on the floor catches 
           his eye. Moves closer. Picks up a tattered photo.

           Katherine’s photo. Of her, Andrew, and baby Laura. 

           Grant studies it. Curious. Then he realizes something. Looks 
           closer and --

           Recognizes the house in the background. His family’s house. 
           WHAT THE HELL?

           EXT. COUNTRY ROADS - AFTERNOON

           Katherine driving. Winding around. Nick slumped against the 
           window. Ragged, sweating.

           She pulls off the road onto a driveway. 
           Nick perks up. The house from the photo up the hill.

           EXT. ADIRONDACK-STYLE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Tires CRUNCH on the driveway as the truck parks out front.

           Katherine and Nick climb out.

           No lights on in the house. Empty. Bones of it are beautiful, 
           but it’s seen better days. Held hostage by overgrown grass 
           and trees that have begun turning yellow and rusty orange.

           A lake down the hill behind it. Low sun shimmering over the 
           water. Crickets CHIRPING all around. A cool evening breeze. 

           Katherine pauses for a beat. The beauty of it hitting her. 
           Bringing back memories.

           INT. ENTRANCE HALLWAY. ADIRONDACK-STYLE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           They enter. Floorboards CREAKING under their feet. It’s dim, 
           dusty, warm and baked. Basic furnishings. No frills.

           Katherine stops. Breathes in the familiar air.

           Nick looks around. Everything feeds off this large hall... 
           there are open throughways to the living room, dining room, 
           kitchen. Some closed doors off the hall.

           A big sturdy, zigzag staircase that leads up to a second 
           floor landing, which overlooks the entrance.

           Katherine moves for one of the closed doors.

           INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           A light BLINKS on amongst cobwebs. Thick dust. Storage boxes. 

           They descend into the vast space, which runs the entire 
           footprint of the house. 

           Katherine goes to the brick wall. There’s a small window at 
           head height (and at ground level outside). 

           She crouches below it. Runs her fingers along the wall. Down 
           low near the ground.

           Finds a loose brick. Digs her fingers in and pulls it out. 
           Pulls another and another. Until there’s a hole.
           She reaches into the darkness. Retrieves an AIRTIGHT METAL 
           BRIEFCASE. Blows dust and cobwebs from it. 

           Presses her palm to the surface. Lights GLOW around the 
           outline of her hand and -- BEEP -- CLICK -- air HISSES as it 
           unlocks and opens.

           Inside: a syringe gun, two receivers, and a tablet.

                                 NICK
                        That’s the contingency protocol?

                                 KATHERINE
                        New receivers and an activator. 
                        Coded to a base unit.

                                 NICK
                        Which is where?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Right where we’re standing. In 

           She loads a receiver into the syringe. Pulls her hair back, 
           careful of the incision, the gauze.

           Finds a clear spot and -- ZAP! -- injects the receiver. 

           Loads the second receiver. Goes to Nick. Injects him.

           She grabs the tablet and boots it. Keys in some data.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Just need to configure the correct 
                        return date and time, and my base 
                        unit back there generates the 
                        temporal field, connects to our 
                        receivers, pulls us home.
                             (finishing)
                        Okay, we’re set--

           She looks up and freezes --

           BECAUSE NICK HAS HIS GUN POINTED AT HER

           And Katherine. Confused. Speechless. What the fuck?!

                                 NICK
                        Toss your gun. Do it slowly.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Nick--
                                 NICK
                        TOSS THE GUN!

                                 KATHERINE
                        Okay, okay, easy.

           She slowly reaches for her gun. Tosses it.

                                 NICK
                        Set the tablet down and back away.

           She does as she’s told.

           Nick advances. Slowly. Carefully. Picks up the tablet, eyes 
           never leaving her.

                                 KATHERINE
                        What are you doing?

           He sees the tablet now waiting for an ACTIVATION CODE. Shit.

                                 NICK
                        What’s the code?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Nick--

                                 NICK
                        The code!

                                 KATHERINE
                        Nick, listen--

                                 NICK
                        I’m not Nick, Katherine.

                        I’m Vasseur.

           Katherine reels. WHAT? Her mind racing. Trying to compute.

           Nick taking pleasure from her confusion.

                                 KATHERINE
                        No, you’re Nick Prentis.

                                 NICK
                        Nick was a fabrication. To get me 
                        back here. To your contingency 
                        protocol.
                             (beat)
                        Now give me the fucking code--

                                 KATHERINE
                        Vasseur’s in custody.

                             (smirks)
                        I’m afraid not. His name’s David 
                        Tanner. We scoured the country for 
                        him, for someone who looked just 
                        like me. Vetted him, compensated 
                        him. Some minor cosmetic surgery 
                        and you couldn’t tell the 
                        difference. He took my place while 
                        I went through more extensive 
                        facial reconstruction.
                             (fact is)
                        I couldn’t trust this job to anyone 
                        else. So we built the Nick Prentis 
                        identity and I slipped into it. 
                        Played the part. Lured in the feds, 
                        so I could turn against... me.
                             (beat)
                        Of course, I had to make my 
                        defection look believable...

           FLASH TO: Nick being escorted from the FBI building -- he 
           looks up -- sees the MINI-VAN coming before anyone else -- 
           because he knows it’s there --

                                 KATHERINE
                        This whole thing was a set-up?

                             (nods)
                        I heard about the Axis tech. From 
                        sources inside the government. But 
                        it was so closely guarded, even 
                        with my connections I couldn’t get 
                        my hands on it. Then I caught 
                        whispers of Operation Bygone, and 
                        the contingency protocols.
                             (beat)
                        Of course I had to force us to run. 
                        Force you to bring me here.

                        Corbin.
                                 NICK
                        He wasn’t from the future. He was 
                        from here, ‘72. Name’s Michael “The 
                        Tailor” Corbin.

                             (realizing)
                        There’s no mole in the team.

                                 NICK
                        Actually an honor to have crossed 
                        paths with The Tailor. He was a 
                        renowned hitman for the Scalisi 
                        crime family.

           FLASH TO: Nick and Katherine at dinner at Mario’s restaurant  
           -- she goes to the bathroom -- he drops a whole bunch of 
           crushed Zoloft into her wine.

                                 NICK (V.O.)
                        I spiked your wine with Zoloft.

           FLASH TO: The hotel room -- Katherine passed out -- Nick 
           slipping the watch off her wrist -- leaving the room. 

                                 NICK (V.O.)
                        I’d done my homework. Knew where to 
                        find Scalisi capos at any point in 
                        time.

           FLASH TO: Nick entering a thumping DISCO NIGHTCLUB -- 
           watching a GROUP OF MEN -- a BURLY MAN gets up and goes out 
           with a WOMAN -- two BODYGUARDS follow.

           We recognize Burly Man as the body Grant was examining 
           earlier in the alley.

                                 NICK (V.O.)
                        So I killed one.

           FLASH TO: Burly Man getting a blow job in the alley -- 
           BODYGUARD 1 and 2 with their backs to him -- Nick stumbles 
           towards them -- pretending to be drunk and --

           BODYGUARD 1 approaches -- Nick falls into him -- grabs his 
           gun -- BLAM! BLAM! -- shoots the Bodyguards then --

           BLAM! Shoots Burly Man! The woman cowers -- SCREAMING!

                                 NICK (V.O.)
                        Left a calling card.
           FLASH TO: Nick lays a piece of paper on Burly Man’s body --
           THE REGAL HOTEL stationary -- a handwritten note: ROOM 2959. 
           WE’LL BE WAITING!

           BACK TO SCENE:

                                 NICK
                        I knew it would elicit an 
                        aggressive response. You’d think we 
                        were compromised and lead me here.

                        You’ll kill me soon as I tell you.

                        What choice do you have but to 
                        trust me--

           And then they hear: TIRES CRUNCHING ON THE DRIVEWAY

           Which distracts Nick for a beat -- and Katherine seizes the 
           opportunity -- dives forward -- tackling him --

           His gun and the tablet SKITTER across the ground.

           EXT. ADIRONDACK-STYLE HOUSE - SAME

           Grant climbs out of his car. Eyes the stolen pick-up. 

           INT. BASEMENT - SAME

           Nick and Katherine fighting -- grappling -- both DESPERATE --
           SLAMMING into walls -- the stairs -- and then --

           WHAM! -- he lands a punch -- knocking her away and --

           She scrambles for her gun as --

           NICK

           snatches the tablet -- looking for his gun -- but it’s too 
           far away -- then he sees:

           KATHERINE

           grabbing hers -- spinning -- Nick now fleeing up the stairs 
           as -- she FIRES!
           EXT. ADIRONDACK-STYLE HOUSE - SAME

           Grant hears it: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! from inside the house.

           Fuck -- pulls his weapon -- moving towards it when --

           NICK

           bursts out -- clutching the tablet -- running -- sees Grant 
           leveling his gun --

                                 GRANT
                        Don’t move!

           But Nick keeps coming -- 

                                 NICK
                        Detective, thank God--

           Closer --

                                 GRANT
                        Don’t move!

           Closer --

                                 NICK
                        I need your help.

                                 GRANT
                        What’s going on here?

           Too close -- and Nick moves FAST -- disarms him -- snatching 
           his gun -- dropping the tablet in the process but --

           Spinning Grant around -- using him as a human shield as --

           KATHERINE

           barrels out of the house -- gun up -- finding Nick --

           But also Grant.

           SHIT.

           She’s breathing heavy. Furious. Trying to get a bead on Nick. 
           But can’t separate him from Grant.

                                 GRANT
                        Whatever this is we can figure it--

           Nick jams the gun harder into his back -- edges around -- 
           keeping Grant in front of him and --
           Katherine angles -- still no shot.

                                 KATHERINE
                        No fucking way you’re leaving here.

                        I will kill him, Katherine.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Then I’ll kill you.

                                 NICK
                        Okay. 

           BLAM! -- Nick shoots Grant in the leg -- Grant drops 
           SCREAMING and --

                                 KATHERINE
                        NO!!

           -- Nick whips his gun up at Katherine. Standoff.

                                 NICK
                        Pretty sure I hit the femoral 
                        artery. Means he doesn’t have long 
                        before he bleeds out. I’d call that 
                        a very big boulder.

                        Let me go, I let you get him to the 
                        hospital.

           Katherine’s mind races. FUCK. No other choice.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Twenty twenty-eight.

           Nick cautiously lowers -- grabs the tablet -- gun and eyes on 
           Katherine the whole time and --

           He rises -- holds the tablet up to his eyeline -- carefully 
           keys in: 2028.

           The screen blinks: CONTINGENCY PROTOCOL ACTIVATED

                        GO!

           Guns still trained on each other -- he edges back --

           Into the house -- SLAMS the door shut -- drops the lock and --

           Katherine’s FUCKING PISSED -- wants to chase -- but Grant is 
           bleeding out.

           She scrambles to him -- pressure on his leg -- he SCREAMS!

           She looks around -- frantic -- dives for his car -- comes 
           back with his suit jacket -- tearing the sleeve off.

           Wraps it around his thigh -- but blood is still pumping out.

                                 GRANT
                        What... you doing here?

           She sees that he’s now holding her photo. Stares at it. 
           Didn’t even realize she lost it.

           Then she snaps back -- heaves him up -- towards his car.

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT - 2033

           BLINDING LIGHT fades and --

           Nick staggers forward with the tablet. Steadies himself. 
           Blinks. Eyes adjusting.

           Keels over and vomits. Spits.

           Looks up. He made it.

           The basement he’s now in is the same, but different. The 
           loose bricks and the hole in the wall sealed.

           Six metal cylinders arranged in a circle around him. Cooling 
           down. All connected to a console, a base unit similar to the 
           Axis tech we saw before.
           INT. GRANT’S CAR - NIGHT - 1972

           Katherine blasting down the tight country roads.

           Grant in back -- sliding around -- BLOOD EVERYWHERE.

                                 GRANT
                        Tell me... what’s... going on--

           She hammers around a corner -- skidding onto the wrong side 
           of the road and then --

           HEADLIGHTS blind her -- as she sees a car coming straight for 
           them -- HORN BLARING now and --

           She jerks the wheel -- missing a collision by an inch --
           swerving back onto the right side of the road.

                                 GRANT
                        The house... the photo...

           She glances back and sees that he’s weak -- losing 
           consciousness -- pale.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Hey! Eric, don’t-- Fuck!

           Eyes back on the road -- trying to get her bearings -- a left 
           turn up ahead -- that’s it --

           Takes it FAST -- tires SCREECHING -- PUNCHES the gas and --

                        Gunshot. Femoral artery.
           They take him -- onto a gurney -- rushing away --

           Leaving Katherine standing there. Soaked in blood. Almost as 
           pale as Grant.

           She collapses to her knees as -- TWO SECURITY GUARDS close in 
           on her -- but she has no strength to run.

           EXT. ADIRONDACK-STYLE HOUSE - NIGHT - 2033

           Nick steps out onto the porch. Crickets CHIRPING. Looks over 
           at lights glowing from a house down the road.

           INT. NEIGHBORING HOUSE - NIGHT

           An OLD HIPPY DUDE answers the door to Nick.

           Old Hippy Dude’s strangled dead body on the floor.

           Nick steps over him. Dialing a phone. Peers out the window.

                                 KATHERINE
                        What are you arresting me for? I 
                        didn’t do anything--

                                 DESK SERGEANT
                        Look lady, there’s a city cop in 
                        the hospital. Until we know exactly 
                        what happened, you ain’t going 
                        nowhere.
                                 KATHERINE
                        Did he make it? Detective Grant? 

                                 DESK SERGEANT
                        Name?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Can you at least tell me if he 
                        survived? Please.

           Desk Sergeant studies her. She seems genuinely concerned. He 
           glances around. Nobody else listening.

                                 DESK SERGEANT
                             (nods)
                        Heard my lieutenant on the phone. 
                        Yeah he’s gonna pull through.

           Katherine breathes a massive sigh of relief. Tears of joy 
           welling in her eyes.

           Desk Sergeant is taken aback by it. But has to do his job.

                                 DESK SERGEANT
                        Now what’s your name?

           Katherine thinks on that and --

           QUICK CUTS OF:

           -- Katherine going through processing.

           -- Her mugshot.

           -- Fingerprints.

           -- Personal effects taken. Her necklace with wedding ring.

           And then:

           INT. HOLDING CELL - NIGHT

           CLUNK! The door is locked. Katherine slumps onto the floor. 
           Back against the wall. Alone. Stranded.

           INT. BRIANA LOWELL’S OFFICE - NIGHT - 2033

                                 IAN
                             (off tablet)
                        I found her.
           ON THE SCREEN: A digitized copy of Katherine’s old arrest 
           record. Her mugshot. And her name: KATHERINE BYGONE TELLER

                                 IAN
                        Gave her middle name as Bygone. She 
                        knew the system would flag it. 
                        She’s sending me a message.

                                 LOWELL
                        What about Nick?

           Ian shakes his head. Lowell thinking, summing up options.

                                 LOWELL
                        Okay. I’ll buy you some time.

                                 IAN
                        What?

                                 LOWELL
                        Unger’s on his way here now. After 
                        the train, I had to call it in.

                                 IAN
                        Meaning?

                                 LOWELL
                        Without a fix on Nick, they’ll shut 
                        us down.

                                 IAN
                        And Katherine?

                                 LOWELL
                        If she failed to activate the 
                        contingency protocol, then they’ll 
                        disavow.

                                 IAN
                        You mean leave her back there?

                                 LOWELL
                        Officially, yes. Unofficially... go 
                        get her.

           INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - NIGHT

           Ian in a ‘70s suit now -- no time to lose -- gathering money 
           and equipment -- his tablet -- stops because he sees:

           UNGER
           moving through -- accompanied by DOJ AGENTS -- heading for 
           Lowell’s office.

           Ian drops low -- avoids being seen -- hurrying towards the 
           elevator.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1972

           Grant, hooked up to IV and heart rate monitor. Stirs. Wakes. 
           He’s groggy, weak. Sits up. Swallows.

           Remembers. Shit.

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT - 1972

           Darkness. The SOUND OF SOMEONE WRETCHING --

           Then a FLASHLIGHT CLICKS ON and we see Ian -- on his knees -- 
           just puked all over the flattened grass. 

           He rises. Cuts the beam through the dark field. Getting 
           bearings. Same place Katherine and Nick arrived here in ‘72.

           Now he’s moving quickly -- laptop bag over his shoulder and --

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Grant eases his legs to the ground. Winces in pain.

           Tries putting pressure on his injured leg. Fuck, it hurts.

           He yanks heart rate monitor cables loose. An alarm sounds -- 
           BEEP-BEEP-BEEP and --

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Ian on a driveway off a rural road. A light on in the house.

           He swiftly, but quietly tries a car door. It’s unlocked.

           Climbs in. Smooth and quick.

           Under the wheel, pulls the ignition wires loose. Isolates the 
           ground wire, the hot wire. Sparks them together.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Grant hobbling out, quick as he can. On crutches.
           Just misses a cab leaving.

           INT. IAN’S STOLEN CAR - NIGHT

           Ian blasting along country roads. White knuckling the wheel.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Another cab arrives. Grant struggles to climb in.

           INT. IAN’S STOLEN CAR - NIGHT

           Ian still driving. Sees the lights of a small downtown 
           cluster up ahead.

           INT./EXT. CAB/ROAD - NIGHT

           Grant in back. Impatient. DING-DING-DING go the warning bells 
           signalling a crossing train. Barriers coming down.

           The cab eases to a stop behind a couple other cars. They wait 
           as the train RATTLES by.

           INT. IAN’S STOLEN CAR - NIGHT

           Ian navigating small downtown streets. Shit, is he lost??

           INT. CAB - NIGHT

           Grant, so vexed. The train barriers raising slowly.

           CAB DRIVER drops the car into Drive and --

           INT. HOLDING CELL. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           CLUNK! Katherine’s cell door opens.

                                 DESK SERGEANT
                        Someone here to question you.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Desk Sergeant shows Katherine in and she sees:

           IAN
           waiting for her. She can barely contain her relief.

           INT. CHECK-IN DESK - MOMENTS LATER

           Katherine in cuffs. Ian signing paperwork.

                                 IAN
                        Thank you, Sergeant.

           Desk Sergeant gives him an evidence bag with Katherine’s 
           personal effects.

           INT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Ian escorts her out. Passing more UNIFORMS. To a parked car.

           He places the handcuff key in Katherine’s hand. Puts her in 
           the backseat, official.

           Ian gets in. Drives away --

           Just as the cab pulls up and Grant struggles out of it with 
           crutches. Hobbles into the station.

           INT. CHECK-IN DECK - MOMENTS LATER

           Desk Sergeant frustrated. Grant baffled.

                                 DESK SERGEANT
                        She was just taken.

                                 GRANT
                        By who?!

                                 DESK SERGEANT
                        Some FBI agent.

           Grant: what the hell?

           INT. IAN’S STOLEN CAR - NIGHT

           Katherine, free of the cuffs now. Climbing through into the 
           passenger seat. Ian, floored by what he’s just heard.

                                 IAN
                        ... could be catastrophic. Imagine 
                        all he can do. The money he could 
                        make, the power--
                                 KATHERINE
                        Which is why you need to get me 
                        back to the house.

                                 IAN
                        The house? No, we’re going to 
                        Bygone.

                                 KATHERINE
                        That’ll take too long.

                                 IAN
                        We can send eyespies and a response 
                        team.

                                 KATHERINE
                        There’s no time. Way I see it, 
                        he’ll relocate the base unit from 
                        the house to his own location, 
                        right? 

                                 IAN
                        Makes sense but--

                                 KATHERINE
                        But he won’t move it without help. 
                        Think about everything he’s gone 
                        through to get his hands on this. 
                        He’ll be smart, careful.

                                 IAN
                             (realizing)
                        Which means we have a small window 
                        before he’s gone.

                                 KATHERINE
                        And the element of surprise.

                                 IAN
                        But we can’t jump back at the 
                        house. Not without a receiver coded 
                        to your base unit in 2033.

           She spins -- shows him the back of her neck -- the injection 
           site of the new receiver.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Stuck myself with one before he 
                        left.

           Ian looks at her. Unsure.
                                 KATHERINE
                        We have to go to the house. We have 
                        to stop him. No tech, no team, just 
                        the two of us. Whatever it takes.

           Ian doesn’t like it, but knows she’s right.

           He SLAMS the brakes -- yanks the wheel and --

           EXT. ADIRONDACK-STYLE HOUSE - NIGHT

           CRUNCH! Ian’s car brakes hard on the driveway. The stolen 
           pick-up still there. They climb out.

           Katherine’s got the evidence bag with her personal effects.

           She sees something: the photo of her and Andrew just lying 
           there on the grass, covered in blood.

           She picks it up. Looks closer. But not at Andrew, at BABY 
           LAURA in her arms.

           And Katherine’s jaw tightens. Fucking determined. Has to get 
           home to Laura no matter what.

           She folds and pockets the photo.

           Tears open the evidence bag. Takes out her necklace. The 
           wedding ring.

           Goes to put it on... but pauses... stares at it... 

           Then she slowly pockets that too.

           INT. BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Ian working on his own tablet, configuring data.

           Katherine hurries down with a SHOVEL and a KITCHEN KNIFE. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Best I could find.

           Ian swallows. The gravity of that. Back to business.

                                 IAN
                        I need to check the connection.

           She shows him the back of her neck. The RECEIVER UNDER HER 
           SKIN glows faint blue... once... twice... then fades.
                                 IAN
                        Okay. Both of our receivers are now 
                        tethered to the base unit in 2033.
                             (nervous about this)
                        Of course, we have to jump right 
                        here, within range of the temporal 
                        field. Which means we might 
                        materialize right in front of him, 
                        like jumping into the lion’s den.

                                 KATHERINE
                        What if you send us back before he 
                        arrives?

                                 IAN
                        Can’t be done. The contingency 
                        protocol base unit has been 
                        activated, which means the 
                        receivers are now running 
                        concurrently with it...

           Katherine hands him the shovel. Grips the knife.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Then into the lion’s den it is.

           But Ian has a thought. Looks up. Realizing...

                                 IAN
                        Oh maybe...
                             (keying commands)
                        Yes, I can boost the signal.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Meaning what?

                                 IAN
                        We can be within the field range, 
                        but above it.

           INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           They’re standing in the center of the room.

                                 IAN
                        You sure this space is unoccupied 
                        in 2033?

           She looks around, at the furniture placement.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I don’t think we changed anything.
                                 IAN
                        Let’s hope you’re right.

           His finger hovers over the ENTER key... he slams it down.

           And they wait. Nothing happens.

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT - 2033

           Nick is here with gun-toting HEAVY 1.

           A bespectacled PHYSICIST and his ASSISTANT are just beginning 
           to disassemble the base unit equipment.

                                 NICK
                        Move faster.

                                 PHYSICIST
                        This is delicate technology--

           Suddenly -- the metal cylinders ACTIVATE -- opening -- 
           raising -- glowing -- slow at first -- then FASTER.

           Nick realizes what’s happening.

                                 NICK
                        Kill the power.

           Electricity surges on the cylinders -- getting BRIGHTER -- 

                                 PHYSICIST
                        If I do that I might permanently 
                        damage it.

           The lights become BLINDING -- incapacitating them and --

           INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1972

           Katherine and Ian waiting in silence. Nothing happening.

                                 KATHERINE
                        It’s not work--

           And then just like that, they’re gone.

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT - 2033

           The light fades -- system cooling down -- cylinders closing.

           Nick blinks -- eyes adjusting -- glances frantically around 
           the basement -- confused. Where is she?
           INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - SAME

           Dark. Just enough moonlight to see:

           Katherine and Ian in the center of the room. Swaying. 
           Breathing. Trying to steady themselves.

           Ian stumbles forward -- drops the shovel --

           Katherine catches it -- just before it hits the floor and -- 

           Ian vomits.

           Katherine hears movement in the house -- grips the knife and 
           shovel in one hand --

           Takes still dizzy Ian by the arm -- quietly pushes him 
           against a wall.

           She creeps to the door. Cracks it a little.

           Can see out onto the upstairs landing. Beyond that a sliver 
           of the downstairs hallway, lights on down there and --

                                 NICK (O.S.)
                        She’s somewhere, in the house, on 
                        grounds.

           Katherine hears BOOTS MOVING. Heavies dispersing. 

           Glimpses a few of them spreading out. Carrying QUADWAVES, the 
           next-gen machine guns we saw earlier. Then she sees:

           HEAVY 2 AND 3

           moving upstairs and --

           Katherine eases back from the door. Closing it quietly.

           Thinking. Planning. No way out of here except the window -- 
           through which she can see and hear:

           MORE HEAVIES

           spreading out across the grounds.

           INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - SAME

           Heavy 2 and 3 reach the top of the stairs. Three doors. One 
           at one end of the landing, two at the other. They split up. 

           Heavy 2 moving to the solo door. Heavy 3 to the pair.
           Heavy 2 reaches his door -- charges into --

           INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Flicks on the light. The room Katherine and Ian were in. But 
           it’s empty.

           Heavy 2 clears the room -- checking his corners -- under the 
           bed -- opening a sliding door closet and --

           THE SHOVEL

           swings out -- SMASHING him in the face hard -- wielded by 
           Katherine -- his face crumples -- he staggers back -- drops 
           his Quadwave and --

           Katherine dives for it -- grabbing it -- spinning as --

           He launches for her -- and she fires -- VRRRR! -- shredding 
           him -- sending him CRASHING into the bed --

           FOOTSTEPS COMING and -- 

           HEAVY 3

           bursts in -- gun raised -- got the drop on her but then --

           WHAM! Ian tackles him -- DRIVING the kitchen knife into his  
           chest but Heavy 3 is still standing and --

           HEADBUTTS Ian -- knocking him away and --

           VRRRR! VRRRRR! -- Heavy 3 gets sprayed with bullets by 
           Katherine -- fucking DEAFENING --

           Sleek shell casings BOUNCING off the floor.

           And silence.

           Then SHOUTS and FOOTFALL from Heavies heading their way.

           Katherine grabs Heavy 3’s Quadwave. Looks for Ian as he 
           staggers up -- nose bleeding -- nods to her that he’s okay.

           She tosses him a gun --

                                 KATHERINE
                        Whatever it takes.

           Ian nods. The enormity of this sinking in now.
           INT. BASEMENT - SAME

           Nick hears the noise upstairs. Makes a decision.

                                 NICK
                        Okay. Change of plan.
                             (to Heavy 1)
                        Eyes on the door. When I’m gone, 
                        destroy it all.

           Nick grabs the terrified Physicist -- shoves the tablet into 
           his hands. 

                                 NICK
                        Set a destination for me.

                                 PHYSICIST
                        But if he destroys it, we can’t 
                        bring you back.

           Nick nods. Understands.

           INT. ENTRANCE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           HEAVIES 4 and 5 come running in from the living room and -- 
           VRRRR! VRRRRRR! -- both get shredded because --

           KATHERINE

           is firing from the upstairs landing -- RIPPING APART the 
           stairs and hallway -- but she sees:

           HEAVY 6

           coming in from the kitchen -- Quadwave aimed at her -- oh 
           shit -- then VR-VRR-VRRRRR! -- Heavy 6 is taken down by --

           IAN

           at her side -- just as Katherine spots:

           HEAVIES 7 AND 8

           creeping in from outside -- and she fires -- forcing them to 
           take cover --

           But Heavy 7 pops out -- opening fire -- VRRRR! VRRRRR! -- 
           SHREDDING the upstairs landing as --

           KATHERINE

           grabs Ian -- sprinting to the other end and then --
           HEAVY 8

           flicks a switch on his Quadwave and -- KER-THUNK! KER-THUNK -- 
           fires GLOWING PROJECTILES --

           Which just miss Katherine and Ian -- SLAMMING into the wall 
           and -- BOOM! BOOM! -- they EXPLODE into balls of flames!

           Katherine and Ian burst through the BEDROOM DOOR as --

           KER-THUNK! KER-THUNK! KER-THUNK! -- more projectiles fly 
           their way -- EXPLODING and --

           The SHOCKWAVE catapults Katherine and Ian -- through a window 
           out onto --

           A PORCH ROOF

           -- rolling and sliding across it -- off the edge -- dropping 
           to the ground outside --

           Where they land with terrible THUDS -- knocking the wind out 
           of them -- gasping for air and --

           INT. BASEMENT - SAME

           Physicist with the tablet docked into the console.

                                 PHYSICIST
                        Okay, it’s set.

           Nick NODS to Heavy 1. BLAM-BLAM! He shoots Physicist and 
           Assistant dead.

           INT. SPARE BEDROOM - SAME

           Fire raging. Heavies 7 and 8 coming in -- seeing no bodies -- 
           the shattered window -- turning on their heels and --

           EXT. ADIRONDACK-STYLE HOUSE - SAME

           Katherine struggling to move -- finds Ian -- conscious but in 
           agony -- his collarbone BROKEN!

           She looks up. Her house on fire now. Hears FOOTFALL --

           EXT. ADIRONDACK-STYLE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Heavy 7 and 8 come barreling out -- around the house --
           Finding just Ian there -- his collarbone sticking out.

           And then -- VRRRR! VRRRRR! -- Heavy 7 and 8 drop as --

           Katherine comes up behind them -- bleeding -- looking like 
           shit -- but furious as all fucking hell.

           And she doesn’t stop moving -- heading for the house --

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           She kicks open the basement door -- glimpses Nick and the 
           lights of the cylinders activating --

           They make eye contact -- and he grins at her -- just before --

           VRRRR! -- Heavy 1 fires -- and Katherine dives away.

           INT. BASEMENT - SAME

           Heavy 1 with his aim on the door -- FIRES some more.

           But no sign of her now. Is she dead?

           The lights growing brighter -- BRIGHTER --

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Katherine. Fuck.

           Takes off running -- SPRINTING out of the house --

           EXT. ADIRONDACK-STYLE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- round the side -- to where that small window is at ground 
           level -- light blasting out of it --

           She runs at it full pelt -- FIRING at the window -- 
           SHATTERING the glass -- dropping and sliding through into --

           INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           -- hitting the ground hard -- gun sliding away from her --
           just as the light fades and --

           She’s temporarily blinded. Blinking.

           Vision coming back... but Nick is gone. She’s too late.
           Heavy 1 also blinking -- getting his vision back --

           Katherine scrambling for her gun -- spinning to him --

           Heavy 1 turning with his gun and --

           Katherine fires -- HITTING HIM as he also fires -- a glowing 
           projectile -- KER-THUNK --

           But not at Katherine -- at the Axis technology and -- 

           KABOOM! It EXPLODES in a ball of flames -- sending Katherine 
           flying back -- crashing into the wall.

           She’s dazed. Vision BLURRED. Ears RINGING. Covered in rubble. 
           Crawls out from under it and --

           Stumbles to the charred equipment -- the decimated tablet -- 
           frantically looking for a clue to where he went but -- 

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        The contingency protocol was 
                        destroyed.

           EXT. ADIRONDACK-STYLE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Katherine staggering out -- dropping to the ground -- 
           coughing -- choking.

           Looks back at the house ablaze. Devastated.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        He was gone. For good this time.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           FADE UP ON:

           INT. OPERATIONS ROOM. BYGONE BASE - NEXT DAY

           Ian now patched up, nose bandaged, arm in a sling. Working 
           furiously one-handed at his station. 

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        There was no way to track when he 
                        went. It was such a severe failure 
                        that Bygone was terminated.

           DOJ AGENTS swarm through -- removing him from his station.
           INT. KITCHEN. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Katherine. Sitting at the table. Lost in her defeat.

           The WALL-SCREEN is on in the background, cycling through news 
           updates. She’s not paying attention to it.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        Nick-- Vasseur was free. To live 
                        another life somewhere else in 
                        time, where no-one knew him, 
                        profiting from his knowledge of the 
                        future.

           Something ON SCREEN catches her eye. She looks over. We don’t 
           see what it is, but her face changes. A light bulb moment.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        Then I remembered something he said 
                        to me...

           Now we see ON SCREEN: highlights from a recent Mets game.

           And Katherine, on her feet. New resolve. Mind racing.

                                 KATHERINE

           The image ON SCREEN flips around to a web browser.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Search: New York Mets... Los

           She waits, hopeful.

           The web browser running its search. Presents some info.

           Katherine stares at it -- yes -- she’s moving now and --

           A BAT CRACKS A BASEBALL

           sending it soaring -- and the CROWD goes WILD as we reveal:
           EXT. METS STADIUM - DAY - 1998

           A beautiful day. Mets vs Dodgers in play. A home run.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        And I realized this was never about 
                        money or power...

           INT. STADIUM STANDS - DAY

           Nick wearing a Mets shirt and hat -- clutching a soda -- 
           moving through -- searching.

           Starts down stairs into seats -- stops -- sees something that 
           takes his breath away:

           A FAMILY OF THREE

           sitting there watching the game. DAD, MOM, and a YOUNG BOY 
           (little Nick/Vasseur).

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        He was just as hung up on the past 
                        as I was.

           Nick starts towards the family but --

           KATHERINE

           steps in front of him and --

           Nick is stunned to see her -- doesn’t notice as she pulls a 
           syringe gun and -- ZAPS his neck!

           He staggers back. Realizes. Shit.

                                 NICK
                        How d’you find me?

                                 KATHERINE
                        All those lies. You couldn’t help 
                        one truth slipping out.
                             (beat)
                        This was your plan all along. This 
                        was why you wanted the contingency 
                        protocol.

                                 NICK
                        You of all people should 
                        understand. 

           She reaches for him. He backs off. She discretely shows him a 
           handgun tucked in her belt.
           He thinks. Then he spins -- tries to bolt -- but she GRABS 
           HIM and --

           WHOOSH-CLICK! He looks down. He’s now cuffed to her. Fuck!

           A FEW PEOPLE nearby glance over at them, concerned.

           She flashes a (fake) NYPD BADGE and their attention goes back 
           to the game.

                                 NICK
                             (trying to bargain)
                        You could let me go.

           She goes to move him, but he pulls back.

                                 NICK
                        Think about it, Katherine. You walk 
                        away. You never found me. Your 
                        hunch didn’t pan out. I go over 
                        there. Spill this soda on my dad. 
                        Take his keys. And it all changes. 
                        They can’t drive home from the 
                        train. Don’t get hit by the drunk 
                        driver. I don’t end up in the 
                        fucking system. Don’t become the 
                        man I am. Never do all the terrible 
                        things I’ve done.
                             (beat)
                        And maybe your husband’s still 
                        alive when you get back to the 
                        present.

           That gets her. She thinks on it. A long, loaded moment. This 
           could change everything for her.

           They both glance over at HIS FAMILY. The dad getting the mom 
           and boy ready to leave.

           Nick looks back to her. Pleading.

           Katherine regards him. The cuffs. The family now moving up 
           the stairs to the exit.

           Not sure what to do...

           EXT. MILITARY COMPOUND - DAY - 2033

           CLICK-CLICK! Shackles are locked around Nick’s wrists and 
           ankles by another MARSHAL. Back in the present now.

           Despondent Nick looks up at Katherine. He’s escorted to a 
           prisoner transport van by a heavily armed team of Marshals.
           Katherine watches on.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        I had an opportunity to change the 
                        past. Maybe the present would’ve 
                        been different... but maybe the 
                        river would’ve still run its 
                        course. Fact is, Vasseur did do all 
                        those terrible things, so he needed 
                        to answer for that. 
                             (beat)
                        And I was done living in the past.

           INT. BASEMENT. ADIRONDACK-STYLE HOUSE - DAY - 1972

           Grant. On crutches. Examining the pile of bricks. What the 
           hell happened?

           Exhales. Resigning to the fact he may never know. 

           EXT. ADIRONDACK-STYLE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Grant hobbles out. Stolen pick-up and Ian’s abandoned car 
           still here.

           And there’s Russo, waiting at his car.

           Grant pauses. Looks down at the dried blood on the driveway 
           where he almost bled out.

           Makes a decision.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        I found out that our interaction 
                        with Eric did alter things...

           CLOSE ON KATHERINE’S WEDDING RING

           but this one is actually not hers yet, it’s the earlier 
           version. Being slid onto the ring finger of:

           CASSIE

           Grant’s girlfriend. We’re now:

           EXT. BEHIND THE ADIRONDACK-STYLE HOUSE - DAY - 1973

           Nine months later. Grant and Cassie getting married down by 
           the lake. A small, pretty affair. She’s pregnant.
                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        Or not so much alter as course 
                        correct.

           EXT. MILITARY COMPOUND - DAY - 2033

           Back to Katherine watching as the doors are closed on Nick. 
           Ian sidles up to her. The van drives away.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        Despite everything, Unger used our 
                        success arresting Vasseur to 
                        convince the A.G. to keep Bygone 
                        active.

           Then Unger and Lowell converge on them. Unger talking, Lowell 
           chiming in. We don’t hear what they’re saying, because we’re 

           ON KATHERINE

           She’s not listening. Her mind elsewhere. Making a decision.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        They wanted me to stay... 

           INT. BEDROOM. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Katherine boxing up Andrew’s clothes. Last few pieces going 
           in. And she closes the box.

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        But I told them I have a life to 
                        live...

           She looks at the closet. Empty now. Moving on...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           KATHERINE

           at that table FROM THE BEGINNING. Been to hell and back. Cuts 
           and bruises. Finishing the story...

                                 KATHERINE
                        And a daughter to be present for. 
                             (beat)
                        I know that’s a lot to take in. 
                        Does it all make sense?

           EXT. ICE CREAM STAND - DAY

           Katherine sitting across from LAURA. Sun setting on a warm 
           spring day. Laura with a massive sundae dish in front of her, 
           almost gone. 

                                 LAURA
                        Was it a long way of telling me 
                        you’re not going on anymore trips?

           Katherine. A smile breaks across her face.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes, I suppose it was.

           Laura beams. Happy.

                                 KATHERINE
                             (serious again)
                        Laura--

                                 LAURA
                        D’you want to try my maple walnut?

           She offers Katherine a spoonful of her ice cream.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I would love to.
                             (tries her ice cream)
                        Mmmm, that’s good.

                                 LAURA
                        How’s yours?

           Katherine realizes she hasn’t touched hers. Tries it. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Oh wow, it might be the best ice 
                        cream I’ve ever had.

                                 LAURA
                        Can I try?

           Katherine nods. Laura dives in. Tastes it. Nods approval.

                                 LAURA
                        Yep, you’re the winner.

           Katherine smiles. Regards her. And then serious again...

                                 KATHERINE
                        I have something for you.

           The necklace and wedding ring.
                                 LAURA
                        But that’s yours.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Daddy gave it to me. Now I’d like 
                        you to take care of it.

           Katherine puts the necklace around Laura’s neck. Laura looks 
           at it. Proud.

           Katherine watches her. Eyes wet. Laura misreads...

                                 LAURA
                        Don’t be sad, mom.

           Katherine laughs. Wipes the tears away. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m not, peach-pear. I’m not.

           She clasps Laura’s hand.

                                 KATHERINE
                        So. What do you want to do 
                        tomorrow?

           Laura smiles, thinking. And on the two of them sitting there, 
           considering the future, we --

                                                              FADE OUT.
