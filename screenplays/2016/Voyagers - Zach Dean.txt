           We hear the sound of wind as we FADE IN:

           EXT. RHODOPE MOUNTAINS - CENTRAL BULGARIA - 1870 - NIGHT

           The jagged dark peaks of the western Rhodope range rise 
           beneath a vast basin of summer stars.

           Forests of towering black pines bend in the wind. There 
           is no moon.

           EXT. CLIFF TRAIL - SAME MOMENT

           On a narrow herding trail worn through centuries into the 
           side of a mountain cliff, a BULGARIAN SHEPHERD GIRL (16) 
           walks under the starlight.

           As her SHEEP graze on the trail ahead of her, the 
           shepherd girl pauses at the edge of the cliff. 

           For a moment, she looks out at the valley of darkness 
           below and listens to the wind. 

           With incredible power, the girl raises her face to the 
           heavens and SINGS THE OPENING PHRASES OF THE HAUNTING 
           BULGARIAN SONG, “IZLEL YE DELYO HAYDUTIN”.

           She falls silent, listening as the timbre of her voice is 
           carried on the wind, echoing through the dark canyons and 
           valleys, as if waiting, hoping for a response as we...

                                                       FADE TO BLACK:

           BEGIN OPENING MONTAGE SEQUENCE. THERE IS NO INDIGENOUS 
           SOUND, ONLY VOICE OVER.

           Rising slowly from the blackness we see A TINY, FAINT, 
           PIXILATED BLUE DOT. The dot is the Earth, six billion 
           kilometers in the distance.

                                 CARL (V.O.)

           EXT. LAUNCH PAD - CAPE CANAVERAL - AUGUST 20, 1977 - DAWN

           There is NO AUDIO as the purple hue of dawn rises on a 
           NASA launch pad.

           INT. E-TRAIN - QUEENS PLAZA STATION - 1938

           A 1930’s subway car. Lost in thought, a HANDSOME YOUNG 
           MAN (20’s) sits on the train intently reading A NOVEL. A 
           PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN (20’s), a stranger, sits in the seat 
           beside him, reading over his shoulder, unbeknownst to the 
           young man. 

           As he attempts to turn the page the YOUNG WOMAN SUDDENLY 
           PLACES HER HAND ON HIS, STOPPING HIM. 

           Startled, he looks up at the stranger seeing her 
           beautiful face for the first time...

           As sunlight shimmers in the ocean surface above, a PAIR 
           of majestic HUMPBACK WHALES silently drift in unison 
           through the aquamarine depths off the coast of Bermuda...

           EXT. CAPE COD BEACH - AUGUST 22, 1977 - 12:58PM

           A younger Linda, 37, in an aqua bikini, kneels with six-
           year-old Nick in the sand. 

           Carl watches his wife and child digging with their bare 
           hands for water beneath the sand. 

           Carl glances at his WRISTWATCH. It reads:

           INT. ANNIE’S UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - SAME MOMENT

           Annie (28) passes through the living room of her 
           apartment where Tim (32) lies on her couch reading. 

           An issue of NEWSWEEK MAGAZINE rests on the coffee table 
           featuring CARL’S FACE ON THE COVER.

           Annie pauses, looking anxiously at the CLOCK on the 
           living room wall. It reads:

                                       12:59PM

           INT. DINING ROOM - BROOKLYN TENEMENT - 1942 - EVENING

           An EXTREME CLOSE UP ON SKETCHBOOK PAGE: a PENCIL TIP 
           carefully writes the headline words:

                     LIFE FOUND ON VENUS! PREHISTORIC-LIKE REPTILES!

                         PLUTO HAS BEEN EXPLORED, WHAT’S NEXT?

           We PULL OUT slightly revealing an ELABORATE PENCIL 
           DRAWING of TWO ASTRONAUTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUITS POINTING 
           TO THE SKY, surrounded by dozens of FAUX NEWSPAPER 
           HEADLINES OF IMAGINED FUTURISTIC SPACE EXPLORATIONS. 

           We SHIFT ANGLES TO REVEAL, eight-year-old CARL SAGAN, 
           with boyish cropped hair, wearing a white t-shirt and 
           trousers, hunched over a sketchbook at the dining room 
           table.

           Hearing the CLINK OF A DISH, Carl looks up from his 
           drawing and sees his MOTHER and FATHER standing side by 
           side in the adjacent kitchen. Their backs are turned to 
           Carl and we cannot see their faces.

           Both reformed Jews, his father is still dressed from his 
           work day at a garment factory. His mother wears a dark 
           housedress. Their bodies touch as they talk, washing the 
           evening dishes together.

           CONTINUED:

           With his pencil between his fingers, Carl stares at his 
           parents, as if examining their intimacy: the way his 
           father touches the small of his mother’s back, the way 
           she tilts her head affectionately toward his father. 

           Carl listens intently, but he cannot hear their warm, 
           private words.

           The boy glances at his elaborate drawing, then closes the 
           notebook and slowly stands from the table...

           EXT. TENEMENT ROOFTOP - 1942 - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

           We hear the sound of roosting PIGEONS as young Carl walks 
           alone out onto the rooftop of his Bensonhurst tenement.  

           Carl looks up at the brilliant constellations 
           illuminating the heavens above. The distant lights of a 
           million other worlds reflect in his young eyes as we...

           EXT. BACKYARD GORGE - SAGAN HOME - ITHACA, NY - PREDAWN

           In his bathrobe, Carl, now 40 years old, stands alone in 
           the darkness staring up at the same constellations in the 
           radiant night sky. 

           Perched in the trees on the edge of an eighty-foot rock 
           gorge, the MODERN DESIGN GLASS EXTERIOR of the SAGAN HOME 
           glows behind him in the darkness.

           The sound of falling water is audible from the far side 
           of the ravine.

           INT. KITCHEN - SAGAN HOME - ITHACA, NY - SUNRISE

           LINDA SALZMAN SAGAN, (34), gorgeous with 70’s shagged 
           hair and remarkable figure stands in the kitchen PACKING 
           LUNCHES for her son, NICK and her husband, Carl.

           Nick draws a picture of a DOLPHIN with paper and crayons 
           at the table.

           Carl, dressed in a corduroy jacket for the lecture hall, 
           walks briskly into the kitchen looking for his shoulder 
           bag...

                                 LINDA
                        Good morning...

                                 CARL
                        Have you seen my bag?

                                 LINDA
                        By the door. I put it there so you 
                        wouldn’t have to look for it.

                                 CARL
                        Oh. Thank you. 

           She reaches into the cupboard and retrieves a COFFEE MUG.

           SHE POURS HIM A CUP OF COFFEE, HANDS IT TO HIM, THEN 
           REACHES IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR A LOAF OF BREAD.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be staying in the city

           CARL PAUSES IN MID-SENTENCE, WATCHING LINDA AS SHE SLIDES 
           TWO SLICES OF BREAD INTO THE TOASTER TO HEAT...

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Why do you do that?

                                 LINDA
                        Do what?

                                 CARL
                        Why do you make my toast after my 
                        coffee? Is there a reason for that 
                        method?

                                 LINDA

                                 CARL
                        Every morning you do the same 
                        thing in the same order: the 
                        coffee...then the toast. And I 
                        have to wait for the toast. Why 
                        not put the toast in first, then 
                        simultaneously, while the bread is 
                        toasting, pour the coffee?

                        It’s inefficient.

                                 CARL
                        Nine seconds each day. If you 
                        extrapolate those nine seconds out 
                        over say...the next 35 years...

                        31.9 hours. That’s nearly a day 
                        and a third of my life wasted on 
                        waiting for toast.

           There’s a beat of silence as LINDA STARES AT HIM, then...

           LINDA SEIZES THE TOASTER, RIPS THE PLUG FROM THE WALL, 
           OPENS THE SLIDING KITCHEN DOOR AND PITCHES THE TOASTER 
           OFF THE SECOND FLOOR DECK DOWN INTO THE YARD BELOW.

                        Nothing. I feel wonderful.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - SAME MOMENT

           As the sun rises over the cityscape of 1970’s Manhattan, 
           we hear the SOUND OF AN ACOUSTIC GUITAR BEING ADJUSTED 
           NOTE BY NOTE, INTO TUNE...

           INT. ANNIE’S UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - SAME MOMENT

           Standing naked at the window, silhouetted by the morning 
           sunrise, we see the attractive backside of TIM FERRIS, 
           30, a handsome, intelligent, Rolling Stone writer with 
           modish shoulder-length hair. 

           We hear sounds of the city awakening as Tim gazes nude 
           out the fourth floor window, slowly tuning an OLD GUITAR.  

           Across the apartment, through the open bathroom door, 
           ANNIE DRUYAN, (25), a beautiful young woman with dark 
           curly hair soaks naked in a worn clawfoot tub.

           She smiles at her fiancé Tim’s back-lit body.

                                 ANNIE
                        So...apparently it’s morning.

           Tim turns from the window, smiling as he plucks a string.

                                 TIM
                        Whose guitar is this anyway?

                                 ANNIE
                        I don’t even know. Somebody left 
                        it here last summer.

                                 TIM
                        The high-E doesn’t want to stay in 
                        tune. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Are you coming in?

           Tim enters the bathroom skillfully STRUMMING THE GUITAR.

           Annie picks up a folded copy of ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE 
           sitting beside the tub and reads from an article.

                        Our perception of the universe is 
                        warped by the fact that humans 
                        have never ventured very far from 
                        earth.

                        To the collective mind of mankind, 
                        the earth is "here" and the 
                        universe "out there."

           Tim sets the guitar against the wall and SLIDES INTO THE 
           HOT BATH WATER across from Annie, facing her.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s a really good article, Tim.

                                 TIM
                        Thank you.

                                 ANNIE
                        Sometimes I wonder that about 
                        people. Myself particularly. 
                        That...despite my best efforts at 
                        connection, part of me will always 
                        “be here” and everyone else will 
                        always be “out there”. 

           Tim looks at her, listening...

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        I guess I’m saying I’ve never 
                        ventured very far from myself.

                                 TIM
                        Maybe that’s where love comes in.

           Annie smiles.

                                 ANNIE
                        When you were younger, did you 
                        think you were going to get 
                        engaged to someone like me? Am I 
                        what you imagined?

           Tim pauses, considering.

                                 TIM
                        When I was sixteen I had a vision. 

                                 ANNIE
                        A vision?

                                 TIM
                        As much as a sixteen-year-old can 
                        have a vision, I had one. 

           Annie smiles playfully.

                        Can we establish that I’m already 
                        aware that as visions go, it’s a 
                        little sophomoric?

                        Well, when I was sixteen down in 
                        Florida, I fell asleep on a beach 
                        and I had a dream. And in the 
                        dream I saw a woman. Not her face, 
                        but her silhouette. She was 
                        standing in the distance, 
                        completely surrounded by hundreds 
                        of white birds, swirling all 
                        around her. And I knew in that 
                        instant, that was her. That was 
                        the one. 

           Annie eyes him for a beat.

                                 ANNIE
                        Tim?

                        up... 

           Tim breaks in laughter.

                                 TIM
                        True. But for a second there was a 
                        whole new facet of me opening up 
                        there.

           Annie grins, laughing...

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NYC - THAT AFTERNOON 

           The October trees are ablaze with color as the autumn 
           wind blows through Central Park.

           Annie, wearing a white Bohemian semi-sheer shirt and bell-
           bottom jeans walks down a tree lined path. 

           Tim walks beside her wearing a green fatigue jacket and 
           corduroys.

           SMOKING A JOINT, they laugh and wander off the path into 
           the trees toward the great lawn.

                                 ANNIE
                        I need to finish my book.

                        That makes two of us.

                        It’s not about just finishing it.

                        My book? I’ve told you ten times.

                        I know what your book is about. 
                        I’m talking about you. What’s 
                        stopping you from finishing it?

                        I think it’s my mother.

                        Pearl? You think Pearl is keeping

           INT. HALLWAY - NORA’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Tim, still wearing his tinted glasses, stands in a warmly 
           lit hallway of a prewar building. The sound of a busy 
           dinner party HUMS from behind an apartment door.

           Annie leans into Tim’s shoulder as he KNOCKS...

                                 ANNIE
                        I might be too stoned for this. 
                        Maybe we should walk around the 
                        block again.

           Before Tim can respond, the apartment door SWINGS OPEN 
           and RITA ROSEN, 24, a pretty, vital, speed-talking young 
           woman KISSES Tim on the cheek. 

                                 RITA
                        Tim! So glad you’re here. It’s 
                        been forever and you’re handsome 
                        as ever but take off your shades, 
                        you look like a narc.

           Rita turns and smiles at Annie.

           apartment as Tim follows behind them.

                        finds you.

           Tim kisses Annie’s cheek, then heads off into the 
           eclectic mix of NEW YORK ARTISTS AND INTELLECTUALS...

           As Annie and Rita move through the kitchen, Rita motions 
           to NORA, 33, thin and witty, standing across the room 
           talking with ANOTHER WOMAN...

                                 RITA
                              (to Annie)
                        Nora’s a writer. She used to work 
                        for the Post. Now she works for 
                        Esquire. This is her pad.

           Pausing to light a cigarette, Rita veers into a non 
           sequitur.

                                 RITA (CONT’D)
                        Tim says you love baseball as much 
                        as I do.

           Annie gives Rita a look.

                                 ANNIE
                        Mets or Yankees?

                                 RITA
                        I’m a life long Orioles fan.

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh...did you grow up in Baltimore?

           SUDDENLY AN EXPLOSION OF HOWLING HIGH-PITCHED LAUGHTER 
           ECHOES from the adjacent room...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NORA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           As she enters, ANNIE SEES CARL FOR THE FIRST TIME, LYING 
           ON HIS BACK ON THE LIVING ROOM RUG, HIS EYES CLOSED, 
           HOWLING WITH UNCONTROLLABLE LAUGHTER.

           Annie grins, taken by the sound of his wild, unabashed 
           laughter.

           Carl opens his eyes and sees Annie standing over him. 
           Their eyes meet and CARL SMILES.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NORA’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           GUESTS lounge around a long dining table amid 
           conversation as Nora stands pouring wine.

                                 NORA
                        Speaking of Carl! Tell us more 
                        about the planet thing.

           The table’s jovial attention turns to Carl.

                                 CARL
                              (to the group)
                        Well this particular planetary 
                        alignment is a very rare 
                        occurrence. 

                                 TIM
                        How rare?

                                 CARL
                        It occurs once every 175 years. 

           The dinner guests grow even more interested.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        We weren’t even aware of its 
                        existence until about a decade 
                        ago. A young grad student at Cal 
                        Tech named Gary Flandro was 
                        observing the solar system when he 
                        discovered the impending 
                        alignment.

                                 NORA
                        Well done, Gary Flandro.

                                 CARL
                        Precisely. Mr. Flandro calculated 
                        that with the correct trajectory, 
                        an unmanned spacecraft, utilizing 
                        the massive gravitational 
                        assistance of Jupiter, would 
                        create an extraordinary 
                        opportunity: a complete and 
                        unprecedented survey of the outer 
                        planets. We call it the Planetary 
                        Grand Tour. 

           Carl reads the interested, but in some cases, CONFUSED 
           FACES OF THE DINNER GUESTS.

           Carl stands up from the table.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                              (to everyone)
                        Come on. I’ll show you how it 
                        works.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - NORA’S APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           On the rooftop eight stories above Manhattan...

           With the rooftop door propped open with a wine bottle, 
           NINE SEMI-INTOXICATED DINNER GUESTS, including Rita, 
           Nora, and others are spaced out in a long line aiding 
           Carl’s demonstration. 

           Annie, Tim, and a CROWD OF OTHER DINNER GUESTS watch from 
           the sidelines intently.

           Carl walks down the line of nine guests, giving each the 
           name of a planet...

                                 CARL
                              (walking down the 
                               line of guests)
                        Dan, you are Mercury. Nora, you 
                        are Venus...Rita you’re Earth.

           Carl continues down the line.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                              (to each in the line)
                        Mars...Jupiter. Saturn, Uranus, 
                        Neptune, and Pluto...

           Carl pauses.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Now we need...

           Carl looks over at Tim standing on the sideline.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Tim, would you mind coming over?

           Tim approaches and stands at the front of the line.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                              (addressing the nine)
                        All right, listen up planets. Tim 
                        is the sun. A mid-sized G2 star. 
                        He contains more than 99.8% of the 
                        total mass of the Solar System. 
                        Consequently, you’re all greatly 
                        attracted to his substantial 
                        gravity. Thus, you’ll all be 
                        orbiting around him. 

           Pleased by his introduction, Tim makes a nonchalant, yet 
           triumphant motion with his fist.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        In a moment I will ask you all to 
                        begin orbiting, but first, in 
                        order to fully demonstrate the 
                        Planetary Grand Tour, we need one 
                        more thing...

           Carl looks at Annie.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                              (to Annie)
                        My apologies, I don’t know your 
                        name.

           Annie smiles at Carl.

                                 ANNIE
                        Annie. Annie Druyan.

                                 CARL
                        Annie, would you be interested in 
                        playing the role of our unmanned 
                        spacecraft?

           Annie sets down her glass of wine.

                                 CARL
                        Technically there will be two 
                        spacecrafts launched for the Grand 
                        Tour, but for our purposes we’ll 
                        go with a single example.

                                 ANNIE
                        I assume I’m launching from Earth.

                                 CARL
                        Quite right.

           Rita smiles warmly at Annie as she approaches.

                              (to Annie)
                        Hello unmanned spacecraft.

           Carl addresses the planets...

                                 CARL
                        Now, in addition to orbiting the 
                        sun, you also each have your own 
                        indigenous gravitational field 
                        relative to your mass. So, just 
                        like Tim holds you all in his 
                        gravitational orbit, you each hold 
                        various moons and other cosmic 
                        debris in your own.

                                 TIM
                        Carl?

                                 CARL
                        Yes, Tim?

                                 TIM
                        Shouldn’t they all be revolving 
                        themselves?

           Carl looks at the planet-guests and smiles.

                                 CARL
                        Yes. They should. (addressing the 
                        group) Planets, would you please 
                        begin to rotate.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Venus and Uranus, you two planets 
                        have the distinction of rotating 
                        east to west, the opposite 
                        direction of all the others.

                                 NORA
                        And why do I do that?

                                 CARL
                        We don’t know. We think you may 
                        have been struck by large 
                        asteroids in your youth, but it’s 
                        only a theory.

                        Very good. (addressing everyone) 
                        So lets push forward in time three 
                        years from this moment, to mid-
                        1977, when Gary Flandro’s planet 
                        alignment begins to happen.

                        Not part of the trajectory. 
                        Besides, Viking I and II are 
                        already going to land there.

           As guests watch, Carl walks Annie slowly toward Tim’s 
           editor JAN, A TALL, ROTATING MAN WITH SIDEBURNS playing 
           the role of JUPITER.

                        As we approach Jupiter, two years 
                        will have gone by. It will now be 
                        the summer of 1979. Now Annie will 
                        slingshot around Jupiter and...

                        It will take nearly two more years 
                        to reach the rings of Saturn. It 
                        will be a new decade. The year 
                        will be 1980.

                        moons and study your majestic 
                        rings.

           Saturn-woman giggles, then starts her orbit again.

           Carl and Annie ‘sling-shot’ from Saturn-woman’s orbit and 
           head toward the MALE GUEST playing URANUS...

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        The journey to Uranus will take 
                        six years.

           As Annie and Carl approach, Carl looks at URANUS-MAN.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                              (to Uranus-Man)
                        You are almost a complete mystery 
                        to humankind. We’ve never been 
                        anywhere near you. 

           Annie and Carl ‘sling-shot’ again toward the last guest, 
           an OLDER, WHITE-HAIRED MAN representing Neptune...

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                              (addressing everyone)
                        We will push-on, traveling three 
                        more years, until the late summer 
                        of 1989, where at last we’ll see 
                        Neptune for the very first time.

           Carl pauses with a hint of seriousness. 

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                              (addressing everyone)
                        And every single observation we 
                        make, every photograph and 
                        instrument reading, will be a 
                        landmark discovery.

           Carl smiles.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                              (addressing everyone)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, I give you 
                        the Planetary Grand Tour.

           The PARTY GUESTS CLAP, CHEER, AND CLINK THEIR GLASSES.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                              (to the ‘Planets’)
                        Planets, I thank you for your 
                        assistance. Please cease orbiting 
                        before the solar system is awash 
                        in cosmic retch.

           As the crowd bottlenecks toward the roof door, Jann, 
           Tim’s uber-editor, puts his arm around Tim, engaging him 
           in conversation as they disappear downstairs together. 

           At the very back of the line, Annie smiles at Carl.

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                              (to Carl)
                        What happens to me then?

           Carl is slightly aflutter as Annie gazes at him.

                                 CARL
                        The spacecraft?

           Annie nods.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Well, eventually you’ll leave our 
                        solar system and enter 
                        interstellar space.

                                 ANNIE
                        How long until that would happen?

           Carl pauses, looking away from her warm gaze, doing a 
           quick calculation in his head.

                                 CARL
                        Approximately 38 years from now, 
                        Sometime around the year 2012. 

                                 ANNIE
                        And then what?

                                 CARL
                        And then...then you wander the 
                        galaxy indefinitely.

                                 ANNIE
                        For keeps?

           Carl smiles.

                                 CARL
                        Yes. For keeps. 

           Suddenly Annie and Carl realize THEY ARE THE LAST TWO 
           PEOPLE REMAINING ON THE ROOF. 

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        I suppose we should head down.

           They cross the rooftop, but as Carl reaches for the door, 
           he notices SOMEONE HAS ACCIDENTALLY KNOCKED THE BOTTLE 
           PROPPING THE DOOR ASIDE.

           CARL TRIES THE DOOR KNOB, BUT THE ACCESS DOOR HAS AUTO-
           LOCKED FROM INSIDE. IT DOESN’T BUDGE.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (7)

           Carl tries again, pulling self-consciously on the knob.

           Carl and Annie exchange a glance.

                                 ANNIE
                              (re: the door)
                        Really?

                                 CARL
                        Apparently.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - 20 MINUTES LATER

           Carl and Annie sit beside each other on the rooftop 
           looking out at the breathtaking city lights.

                                 ANNIE
                        It was in 1938, in Queens, and my 
                        father was coming home from NYU on 
                        the E-Train. And he was reading... 

                                 CARL
                        Do you know what he was reading?

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes, I do. He was reading ABSALOM, 
                        ABSALOM by Faulkner. And this 
                        young woman sat down beside him. A 
                        complete stranger. She was sitting 
                        close. He could smell her perfume 
                        and he could feel her presence, 
                        beside him. But he was very shy 
                        and very proper so he kept his 
                        head in his novel. And after a 
                        moment, when he reached to turn 
                        the page, the young woman, this 
                        complete stranger, put her hand 
                        gently on his and whispered, 
                        Please, I haven’t finished reading 
                        the page yet. (pause) And that was 
                        the first moment my mother and 
                        father saw each other. (Pause) And 
                        you know what?

           Carl smiles, captivated by Annie.

                                 CARL
                        What?

           Annie grins.

                        They’ve fought every single 
                        fucking day since that moment for 
                        the last sixty-five years! And I 
                        guarantee you they are still 
                        fighting in Queens this very 
                        moment!

           Carl BURSTS INTO HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER...

           Annie smiles and their eyes meet again, HOLDING FOR AN 
           INSTANT TOO LONG. 

           SUDDENLY, ACROSS THE ROOFTOP THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN...

                                 TIM
                              (calling out)
                        Annie?

           Annie turns to the sound of Tim’s voice.

                                 ANNIE
                              (to Tim)
                        Hey! It took you long enough!

           Tim props the door open again and crosses the rooftop as 
           Carl and Annie stand up.

                                 TIM
                        What can I say?

           Tim approaches and KISSES ANNIE ON THE CHEEK.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        I got wrapped up. 

           Tim turns to Carl.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Carl, my apologies.

                                 CARL
                        No need. We had a fantastic 
                        conversation.

           Tim smiles and puts his arm around Annie.

                                 TIM
                        Listen, Carl. While I’ve got you 
                        here. I was just talking to Jann, 
                        my editor downstairs.

                                 TIM
                        We want to do a think-piece on the 
                        existence of life on other planets 
                        and after witnessing your rooftop 
                        performance here, we think you’re

                        Yup. 

           There’s a beat as Carl SMILES at the idea.

                                 CARL
                        I think you’re right.

           EXT. INTERSTELLAR SPACE 

           A VAST EXPANSE OF INTERSTELLAR SPACE...

           We hear the hollow cry of a Japanese flute. The lonesome 
           opening notes of “TSURU NO SUGOMORI” play as...

           TWO MAGNIFICENT, TWISTING GALAXIES, EACH ILLUMINATED BY 
           BILLIONS OF STARS, SLOWLY ENTER THE EDGES OF THE FRAME.

           EXT. BALCONY - SAGAN HOME - ITHACA, NY - DAY

           Late afternoon sunlight streams through the trees on a 
           warm late autumn day. 

           Carl and Tim sit together outside on a second floor 
           balcony. An AUDIO TAPE RECORDER rolls as Tim interviews 
           Carl for his article...

                        Carl, why do you think there has 
                        been such fierce skepticism about 
                        the existence of intelligent life 
                        beyond Earth?

           With the sunlight on his face, Carl considers his answer.

                                 CARL
                        Well, it gets very complicated 
                        psychologically if we’re not the 
                        only ones. If you imagine, for an 
                        instant, that we're only one kind 
                        of life among millions of other 
                        kinds, some remarkably more 
                        advanced than us. That’s a mind-
                        expanding experience, and some 
                        people are not quite ready to  
                        have their minds expanded...

           INT. LINDA’S PAINTING STUDIO - SAGAN HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Each carrying a flute of champagne, Linda leads Annie 
           down a flight of stairs into her painting studio.

           The room is flooded with sunlight from the large glass 
           window at the far end. 

           The long white walls are covered with A SERIES OF 
           UNFINISHED OIL PAINTINGS.

           More canvases lean in the corner: some are abstract, some 
           are realistic, and ALL HAVE BEEN ABANDONED in various 
           stages of execution.

                                 ANNIE
                              (re: the paintings)
                        Linda, these are great.

                                 LINDA
                        No, they’re not. 

           Annie looks out the floor to ceiling glass window.

                                 LINDA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Maybe they would be if I ever 
                        finished one. Lately I’ve been 
                        thinking more about writing.

           From Annie’s vantage point through the window she can see 
           Carl and Tim recording their interview up on the balcony.

           Annie watches as the RICH GOLD AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT FALLS 
           ON THE TWO MEN, SILHOUETTING THEM AGAINST THE SKY.

                        like that, they look...divine.

           Linda makes a noise and takes a sip of her champagne.

                                 LINDA (O.S.)
                        Carl doesn’t believe God exists.

           Annie turns from the window, glancing at Linda.

                        He thinks God is a fallacy mankind 
                        has created to help us cope with 
                        our own mortality.

                        He might be on to something there.

                              (cutting Annie off)
                        What am I supposed to do with 
                        that? A father telling his child 
                        there is no God?

           Linda looks at Annie.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        You believe in God, don’t you 
                        Annie?

           Annie pauses, recognizing seriousness in Linda’s voice. 

                                 ANNIE
                        I don’t know. 

           Annie offers a disarming smile.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to believe in 
                        something. I want to know it. 

           EXT. LIVING ROOM - SAGAN HOME - LATER

           As night falls, marijuana smoke curls through the air as 
           Tim, Annie, Carl, and Linda relax in the living room.

                                 CARL
                        There’s this incessant infighting 
                        within the Viking landing team 
                        about where to land the probes. 

                                 TIM
                        What’s your position?

                                 CARL
                        My position is that if we’re going 
                        through the incredible effort to 
                        put instruments on the surface of 
                        Mars, we may as well place at 
                        least one of the two probes in an 
                        area which yields the highest 
                        chance of actually discovering 
                        something. Which in my opinion, is 
                        near the poles.

                                 ANNIE
                        What’s the argument against that?

                                 CARL
                        The poles are more topographically 
                        treacherous areas, and if the 
                        landing fails, it fails on 
                        national television. Viking is 
                        going to cost a billion dollars. 
                        They don’t want the star of the 
                        show to tumble down a crater.

                                 TIM
                        Like the Soviet landers in 71’... 

                                 CARL
                        Precisely. 

                                 TIM
                        Are we still on the record?

           Carl shrugs.

                                 CARL
                        I haven’t said anything that isn’t 
                        true.

                        No, Greg. I do not. I’m afraid 
                        I’ve been quite critical of the

           professor of music demonstrates a technique on the GUQIN, 
           a Chinese 7-string zither, to a group of MUSIC STUDENTS.

           The old professor STOPS PLAYING as a UNIFORMED SQUAD of 
           Mao Zedong’s RED GUARD SURGES INTO THE ROOM.

           A DOZEN YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN ZEALOTS , donning CRIMSON 
           ARMBANDS, force their way to the front of the class.

           The old professor starts to speak, but before the words 
           can leave his mouth the FEMALE SQUAD LEADER (20), STRIKES 
           HIM BRUTALLY IN THE NECK WITH A WOODEN CLUB, SHATTERING 
           HIS FRAGILE COLLARBONE.

           Exhausted from lack of sleep, yet buoyed by feverish 
           excitement, Carl pulls himself out of the car.

           GATHERING TWO ARMFULS OF CARDBOARD SHIPPING TUBES from 
           the passenger seat, he kicks the car door shut.
           INT. CARL AND LINDA’S RENTAL APARTMENT - SECONDS LATER

           As Carl steps through the apartment door with his arms 
           loaded, he hears LAUGHTER and the low sound of seventies 
           rock music from the kitchen.

           Tim, Annie, and Linda enter into the living room.

           Linda approaches Carl to hug him but Carl cuts her off.

                                 CARL
                              (to Linda)
                        Hi. Where’s Nick?

           Linda pauses.

                                 LINDA
                        Sleeping. I put him down about a 
                        half an hour ago. You want to tell 
                        us how it’s all going at JPL?

                                 CARL
                        I thought his bed time was eight 
                        thirty? I asked you, and you 
                        specifically told me eight thirty. 
                        It’s now only five-after-eight.

           Linda makes a face.

                                 LINDA
                        He was tired, Carl. His sleep is 
                        still messed up from west coast 
                        time. 

                                 CARL
                        Well, I made an effort to get 
                        home. I wanted to talk to him.

                                 LINDA
                        You haven’t been home from the lab 
                        in three days! How was I supposed 
                        to know you were going to decide 
                        to roll in tonight?

           Carl TOSSES the cardboard tubes on the couch EXCEPT ONE, 
           which he keeps in his hand. Without another word, Carl 
           heads for Nick’s bedroom door.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        Carl don’t...

           He ignores her.
           INT. NICK’S BEDROOM - RENTAL APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Illuminated by a night-light, Carl sits beside Nick, 
           watching as the boy’s small chest slowly rises and falls 
           as he sleeps.

           Carl is about to wake him, but seeing the peace in the 
           boy’s expression, he thinks better of it. 

           Carl adjusts Nick’s blanket, and crosses the room to 
           leave when he hears a small, SLEEPY VOICE...

                                 NICK
                        Dad?

           Carl turns back and sees Nick rubbing his eyes...

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Is that you?

           Carl sits back down beside him.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        You’re home...

                                 CARL
                        Just for the night. I have to be 
                        back at JPL early.

                                 NICK
                        Can we have breakfast together?

                                 CARL
                        Probably not. I’ll be gone. 

           There is a beat of silence.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Can I show you something?

                                 NICK
                        Sure.

                                 CARL
                        I’ll need to turn the light on.

                                 NICK
                        How about a flashlight?

                                 CARL
                        You have one?

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NICK
                        Uh-huh. Under my pillow. Mom gave 
                        it to me in case I get bad dreams. 

           Carl smiles as Nick sits up in his pajamas, SWITCHING ON 
           A SMALL FLASHLIGHT.

           Carl pulls the end cap off the cardboard tube and slides 
           out a 20” ROLLED-UP PHOTOGRAPH.

           He slowly unrolls it, revealing a HIGH RESOLUTION, GROUND 
           LEVEL PHOTOGRAPH OF A MARTIAN CANYON LANDSCAPE.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                              (re: the photo)
                        Whoa...what is that?

                                 CARL
                        A ravine, where long, long ago a 
                        great river once flowed on Mars.

                                 NICK
                        Like it flowed with water?

                                 CARL
                        Honestly, we don’t know the 
                        composition of a Martian river.

           Nick stares at the image.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Nick, do you know how many kids in 
                        the history of the world have seen 
                        this image?

                                 NICK
                        How many?

                                 CARL
                        As of this very moment...one.

           Nick GRINS.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - RENTAL APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           We can hear the sounds of Linda cooking in the adjacent 
           kitchen as... 

           Tim removes Louis Armstrong’s 1927 MELANCHOLY BLUES from 
           the record sleeve and places it on a TURNTABLE.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Tim sets the stylus, and the first MUTED NOTES OF TRUMPET 
           AND TROMBONE drift through the room.

           Tim takes a long sip of red wine and closes his eyes for 
           a moment, listening. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - RENTAL APARTMENT - SAME MOMENT

           Carl and Annie stand together alone in the dining room. 

           The Jazz is audible from the adjacent room as Carl lays 
           dozens of high-resolution PHOTOGRAPHS across the table.

           Together they stare at the MYRIAD OF MARTIAN IMAGES.

                                 ANNIE
                        So...any signs of life?

           Carl looks directly into Annie’s eyes. It’s clear his 
           gaze sends an unexpected electricity through Annie...

                                 CARL
                        We have to be careful, you know?

           There’s a charged beat of silence. Annie doesn’t break 
           his gaze.

                                 ANNIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 CARL
                        False pattern recognition. 

                                 ANNIE
                        And what is that, exactly?

                                 CARL
                        The human brain has a propensity 
                        to create patterns in otherwise 
                        random data.

           She looks in his eyes.

                                 ANNIE
                        You mean when we see what we want 
                        to see? 

                                 CARL
                        Yes. We project it. We project 
                        what we want. What we think we 
                        need. And run the risk of becoming 
                        blind to reality. I’ve done that.

                        tried to correct for it. I’ve 
                        created sets of criteria to self-

                                 ANNIE
                        What happens if what we see is 
                        real?

           Carl falls silent, looking at her.

           INT. DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Carl, Tim, Linda, and Annie laugh like a family as they 
           gather around food at the dinner table.

                                 CARL
                        My mother and father, Rachel and 
                        Sam, took me to the World’s Fair 
                        in Queens. We saw an exhibit 
                        called, The World of Tomorrow. 
                        There were these massive, amazing 
                        pavilions displaying futurist 
                        visions of what the world might 
                        someday look like. To my five-year-
                        old mind, it was simply wonderful. 

           Annie watches Carl, clearly absorbed in his story.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        I remember looking for the 
                        restrooms with my father...and 
                        there was this terribly gaunt man, 
                        a derelict, selling pencils. And 
                        my father took the apple from my 
                        lunch bag and gave it to the him. 
                        (pause) I threw a fit. I stomped 
                        my feet. And my father pulled me 
                        aside so not to make a scene, and 
                        he looked me in the eye and he 
                        said...Carl, that man is hungry.

           Carl glances at the table full of warm food before them.

                        was starving in a stairwell.  

           There is a beat of silence, then suddenly Annie speaks.

                                 ANNIE
                        I need to go back to New York. 

                                 TIM
                        All right, but, I was hoping to do  
                        a couple interviews before we...

                        I’m going to buy a ticket and fly 
                        home tomorrow. You should stay 
                        here. Finish what you started. I 
                        need to go home and get to work.

           Carl glances at Annie from the end of the table.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - A WEEK LATER

           The August heat beats down on mid-1970’s New York City.

           The newly completed TWIN TRADE TOWERS shine in the sun. 
           Checker cabs crowd midtown. Central Park is packed with 
           overheated NEW YORKERS.   

           WE HEAR THE STACCATO SOUND OF A TAPPING TYPEWRITER LAPSE-
           IN as we CUT TO...

           EXT./INT. FIRE ESCAPE - ANNIE’S APARTMENT - SAME MOMENT

           Braless, in shorts and a tank top, Annie sits on her 
           apartment FIRE ESCAPE hunched over her TYPEWRITER as 
           music plays from the living room.

           Pages of her novel are strewn throughout the apartment.

           Her hair in a loose ponytail, Annie types sporadically, 
           then pauses, reading back what she’s written...

           The TELEPHONE RINGS inside, breaking her flow.

           Annie ducks in through the fire escape window, crosses

                        As far as I know he is. Sounds

                                 ANNIE (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Where are you?

                                 CARL (ON PHONE)
                        This very moment I’m on the corner 
                        of Broadway and 113th.

                                 ANNIE (INTO PHONE)
                        You’re in the city?

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 CARL (ON PHONE)
                        I flew in this morning. I had a 
                        NASA thing. Anyway, I was thinking 
                        we should have dinner tonight. Are 
                        you free?

           Annie, blind-sided by the invitation, watches the fan 
           spin as fast as her mind.

           There’s a long beat of silence on the line.

                                 CARL (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Annie?

           EXT. BALCONY - PLAZA HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

           An elegant 20th floor SUITE at the Plaza.

           Carl and Annie stand out on a balcony rolling a Thai-
           stick as night falls on Central Park below. 

                                 ANNIE
                        But see, no one really knows 
                        exactly why we are the way we are? 

                                 CARL
                        You’re talking as a species?

                                 ANNIE
                        Generalizations about a species 
                        are easy to make. Basically...we 
                        want to stay alive. At all costs. 
                        Even if it kills us.

           Carl laughs as Annie lights the Thai-stick and passes it 
           to Carl.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        But I’m talking about personality -  
                        who we are as individuals. Sure, 
                        there’s biology. Which is major, 
                        but not necessarily paramount. 
                        There are countless examples of 
                        people with delicious genetics 
                        that turn out to be dreadful, soul 
                        sucking human beings.

                                 CARL
                        You have to consider circumstance.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ANNIE
                        Exactly. The environment you were 
                        raised in, the obstacles you face 
                        and how you navigate them.

           Carl grins.

                                 CARL
                        The mother...

                                 ANNIE
                        Damn right! The mother! They’re a 
                        governing dynamic in themselves!

                                 CARL
                        Like gravity...

                                 ANNIE
                        Or erosion.  

                                 CARL
                        There should be a ‘Mother-
                        Equation.’

                                 ANNIE
                        ‘Solving For ‘M’...a modern 
                        tragedy by Annie Druyan...

           Carl let’s out a high, infectious laugh.

           INT. HALLWAY ELEVATOR BANK - PLAZA HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Carl and Annie stand beside each other in the scarlet 
           carpeted hallway, waiting for the ELEVATOR in silence.

           Judging by their curious expressions, it’s evident they 
           are notably stoned.

           After a moment, a PLEASANT CHIME RINGS OUT, signifying 
           the arrival of the elevator car. 

                                 ANNIE
                              (re: the chime)
                        What a beautiful sound.

           There’s a beat.

                                 CARL
                        Not as beautiful as your voice.

           Annie slowly tilts her head and looks at Carl.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           There is another beat of silence, then ANNIE STEPS 
           SILENTLY INTO THE ELEVATOR FOLLOWED BY CARL.

           INT. THE RUSSIAN TEA ROOM - LATER 

           Carl and Annie sit in a red circular booth at the opulent 
           RUSSIAN TEA ROOM in midtown. 

                                 ANNIE
                        So what was the NASA thing?

                                 CARL
                        Frank Drake, John Cassani, and I 
                        have this idea. We’re planning a 
                        special project to launch with the 
                        Voyagers next year.

                                 ANNIE
                        What’s the project?

                                 CARL
                        We want to send a message on the 
                        Voyagers into interstellar space, 
                        in hopes that someday, somewhere, 
                        beings from some other world will 
                        find it.

                                 ANNIE
                        A message? What do you want it to 
                        say?

                                 CARL
                        It would be about us. Our species. 
                        Who we really are. We want to 
                        convey our global culture. We want 
                        to send greetings in different 
                        human languages. And music. And...

           Annie pauses, her mind racing.

                                 ANNIE
                              (interjecting)
                        Just human greetings? What about 
                        all the other species? You should 
                        send the greetings of other 
                        species.

           Carl pauses.

                                 CARL
                        What would you recommend?

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Annie pauses to think.

                                 ANNIE
                        I don’t know. How about whales? 

           Carl smiles, considering.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        And what about all the other ways 
                        we communicate? Like the cries of 
                        a baby? Or the sound of a kiss?

           A WARM SMILE INSTANTLY BROADENS on Carl’s face at Annie’s 
           suggestions, watching her as they riff...

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        In essence, you want to tell our 
                        story? All of our stories? 
                        Correct?

                                 CARL
                        Yes.

                                 ANNIE
                        What about Hiroshima? Or 
                        Auschwitz? Do you show them that?

           Carl pauses.

                                 CARL
                        I’ve been wrestling with that very 
                        question. I honestly don’t know.

                                 ANNIE
                        But I suppose, if it’s a first 
                        contact, the first time you meet 
                        someone...you put best foot 
                        forward. That’s real human nature. 
                        We don’t lead with your darkest 
                        hours. We offer an open hand...or 
                        we bow. We try show our intentions 
                        are good willed.

                                 CARL
                        Exactly.

           Carl is clearly captivated by their exchange.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        You know what my problem is with 
                        you?

           Annie pauses, mid-thought...

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ANNIE
                        What’s that?

                                 CARL
                        You’re a woman. It would be a lot 
                        easier if you were a man.

           Annie makes an edgy face.

                                 ANNIE
                        Perhaps you should articulate that 
                        thought further. 

                                 CARL
                        The best conversations I’ve ever 
                        had with a woman...

           Carl pauses.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        ...I’ve had with you.

           Annie looks at him unflinching.

                                 ANNIE
                        Just with a woman?

                                 CARL
                        Maybe the best conversations I’ve 
                        ever had with anyone... 

           Carl pauses, considering.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Except possibly with Joshua 
                        Lederberg. The exobiologist.

           Annie’s beautiful face BREAKS INTO A LAUGH.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Cabs pass as Carl walks Annie home along Central Park.

                                 ANNIE
                        When do you head back to Pasedena?

           There is a pause.

                        part of our team. Tim as well.

           She stops walking and looks at him.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        You can stay local. We’ll work out 
                        of New York as much as we can... 

                                 ANNIE
                        Carl...I’m not a scientist. I’m a 
                        college drop-out with a half-
                        finished novel.

                                 CARL
                        This isn’t about science. It’s 
                        about what it means to be human. 
                        We are feeling creatures. And you 
                        understand that. Probably better 
                        than I do. 

           Carl looks in Annie’s eyes. 

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        This is a chance in a lifetime. To 
                        do something unprecedented and 
                        extraordinary. To reach out. To 
                        try to make contact. You said it. 
                        To tell our story. Everyone’s 
                        story. It’ll be the Earth’s 
                        message in a bottle. You should be 
                        part of that.

           INT. GREGORY BRUCE’S OFFICE - JPL - SAME MOMENT

           Gregory Bruce stands from his desk, shaking the thick 
           hand of JOHN LOWELL, a red-bearded scientist and right 
           wing head of a NASA OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE.

                                 JOHN LOWELL
                        First things first, Greg. I wanted 
                        to congratulate you on your 
                        appointment to director.

           John Lowell TAKES A SAMPLE of Gregory’s crisp NEW 
           BUSINESS CARDS off a stack on Gregory’s desktop.

                                 JOHN LOWELL (CONT’D)

                        I like the font.

           Gregory smiles.

                        Just opened the box this morning. 
                        Listen, I appreciate your support 
                        in helping make it happen.

                                 JOHN LOWELL
                        We couldn’t be happier with the 
                        choice.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        So what can I do for you?

                                 JOHN LOWELL
                        I’m here about the Voyagers.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        It’s an amazing project. We’re 
                        incredibly enthusiastic.

                        Good. That’s how it should be. I 
                        want to talk about your team.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        Well, it’s not really my team, 
                        John. It’s Ed Stone’s team. His 
                        baby.

                                 JOHN LOWELL
                        Understood. And we love Ed Stone. 
                        He’s brilliant, understands the 
                        minutiae without losing the big 
                        picture. Best man for the job.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        What’s your concern then?

                                 JOHN LOWELL
                        It’s my understanding that Carl 
                        Sagan has a place on the project. 

           Gregory pauses.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        That’s correct. He’s on the 
                        imaging team.

                                 JOHN LOWELL
                        And we don’t have an objection 
                        with that at this point. But we’ve 
                        heard something about a pet 
                        project of Sagan’s. A planetary 
                        greeting thing?

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        I’m aware of it. They’re making 
                        some type of interstellar message.

                                 JOHN LOWELL
                        A message? Well what the hell 
                        would the message say?

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        Well, I don’t know the details. I 
                        don’t think they know the details 
                        yet. It’s in development.

           John Lowell pauses, looking at Gregory.

                                 JOHN LOWELL
                        I’m going to be frank with you.

                        Please.

                                 JOHN LOWELL
                        We have reservations about Sagan. 
                        His politics are questionable. 

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        I’ve known Carl professionally for 
                        years. His ego certainly precedes 
                        him, but I wouldn’t describe him 
                        as...

                                 JOHN LOWELL
                              (cutting him off)
                        Sagan is the opposite of American 
                        values and should not be America’s 
                        voice in space.

           The statement hangs heavy in the air.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        Look, Carl is arguably finest 
                        planetary scientist in the 
                        world...

                                 JOHN LOWELL
                              (interrupting)
                        He’s a left wing Russian 
                        sympathizer! For god’s sake he 
                        even wrote a book with one... 

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        I know, I read it...

                                 JOHN LOWELL
                              (cutting Gregory off)
                        ...and he absolutely reeks of pot!

           Gregory Bruce falls silent, rubbing his eyes.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        It’s not my call. I’ve been 
                        director a month. Ed Stone wants 
                        him. Ed’s the man on Voyager. I 
                        can’t undermine his authority.

                                 JOHN LOWELL
                        Then I want a NASA liaison 
                        assigned to him.

                        way. Carl will never allow it.

           There is a silence.

                                 JOHN LOWELL
                        Fine. Then the baby sitter is you.  
                        He’s your responsibility. 

           John Lowell stands up.

                                 JOHN LOWELL (CONT’D)
                        So I suggest you keep a very close 
                        eye and a very tight lid on Dr. 
                        Sagan.

           EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE CBS STUDIOS - NEW YORK - DAY

           Carl and Gregory Bruce argue loudly on the street outside 
           CBS STUDIOS in New York...

                                 CARL
                        Human beings are far more 
                        complicated than that! Our 
                        emotional life is difficult to 
                        communicate...

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        So what’s your plan, Carl? How are 
                        you going to convey the complexity 
                        of human emotion to an alien race 
                        that may or may not exist 
                        somewhere out in space?

           Carl pauses.

                                 CARL
                        Well, Frank and I had an idea 
                        about that.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        Did you?

                        We use a record. 

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        A record?

                                 CARL
                        Yes. A phonograph record. On it we 
                        can compress data, audio, and 
                        visual content. It’s far more 
                        durable than magnetic tape. 

           Gregory stares at Carl, not speaking.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        We can send images of the earth 
                        and humanity and recordings of 
                        human languages, as well as 
                        languages of other species...like 
                        whales. 

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        Whales?

                                 CARL
                        Absolutely. Why not? 

           Gregory pauses.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        But most importantly, using a 
                        record allows us to include music. 
                        Music conveys emotion. It’s a 
                        language of feeling. 

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        How would they play the record?

                                 CARL
                        Who?

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        The aliens!

                                 CARL
                        We include a stylus and a 
                        schematic of how it works. 

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        That’s a big leap.

                        Greg, logic follows, if they’ve 
                        found one of the Voyagers, it 
                        means they’re technologically 
                        advanced enough to have achieved 
                        interstellar travel.  And if they 
                        can traverse the universe, they 
                        probably can reason that a disc, 
                        by design, is meant to spin.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        Okay. (pause) There’s a finite 
                        amount of room on an LP record, 
                        Carl. Who chooses what’s included 
                        and what isn’t?

                                 CARL
                        My team and I.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        Do you really think you have the 
                        right to make those choices? 

                                 CARL
                        Greg, I’m sure one could argue the 
                        complete inappropriateness and 
                        absurdity of half a dozen people 
                        making decisions for what should 
                        and should not represent all of 
                        humanity for eternity. That would 
                        be a valid line of 
                        argumentation...

           It’s clear Gregory is thinking. 

           Carl puts his hand on Gregory’s shoulder.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        But it’s not mine. I say yes. Yes 
                        we do have the right. Because we 
                        thought of it and we care enough 
                        to do it. And I’m not sure we have 
                        another 175 years to wait.

                        What if Bob Dylan was 
                        from...central Mongolia?

           Tim makes a face.

                                 TIM
                        Wouldn’t hold it against him.

                        But if he was from central 
                        Mongolia and he sang in the 
                        Mongolian language, would you know 
                        he was the most gifted lyricist of 
                        the 20th century?

                                 TIM

                                 CARL

                                 TIM
                        So the question is, does Dylan’s 
                        music alone, without comprehending 
                        his lyrics, merit a spot on the

                        I’m sure Carl and Linda love Bach. 
                        If you don’t take your hat off 
                        when Bach walks into the room 
                        you’re an asshole. Totally get

                        It’s a lone female voice. A young 
                        woman. A shepardess, leading her 
                        flock through the mountains at 
                        night. Alone in the darkness she 
                        sings her song out across the 
                        mountains. Her voice is powerful. 
                        So magnificent, echoing through 
                        the night. And then her song ends 
                        and silence falls, and she waits, 
                        listening, hoping for a response, 
                        for someone out there to hear her 
                        voice and call back to her... 

           Annie looks at the three of them.

                        Isn’t that what Voyager is? Isn’t

                        into the darkness, hoping someone 
                        will hear us?

           Carl stares across the dining room table at Annie. He 
           cannot take his eyes off of her.

           Carl stands alone in a conference room at CBS. 

           Spread out across the LONG CONFERENCE TABLE are a MYRIAD 
           OF PHOTOGRAPHS depicting ALL THINGS HUMAN.

           Lost in thought, Carl stares at the images, when suddenly 
           there is a KNOCK...

           Carl turns and sees Annie standing in the door frame but 
           not entering the room.

                                 ANNIE
                        Hey, did Tim pass by this way?

           With a charged silence, Annie, enters the room, but makes 
           a point to leave the door open.

           Annie eyes the FEAST OF IMAGES spread across the table as 
           Carl smiles and MOTIONS for Annie to join him.

                        eclectic examples of typical 
                        architecture, but I also wanted to 
                        include something more impressive.

           On the far end of the table Carl opens a large envelope 
           and SPREADS OUT A SELECTION OF MAGNIFICENT EXAMPLES OF 
           WORLD ARCHITECTURE:

           Carl looks at her, surprised, but clearly pleased by her 
           comment. He smiles with curiosity.

                                 CARL
                        That’s correct. I’m not. Do you 
                        know why?

                                 ANNIE
                        Because they’re all monuments

                        Precisely. I’ve been standing here

                        Use the Taj Mahal. It’s one of the 
                        most beautiful buildings in 
                        history, and it wasn’t built in 
                        the name of God.

           Carl gazes into Annie’s beautiful eyes as the idea 
           blossoms in his mind.

           Tim nods, then looks at her.

                                 TIM
                        Are you coming over tonight?

           Annie shakes her head.

                                 ANNIE
                        Tim, it’s been a long day. I just 
                        want to go back to my apartment. 

           Tim stops walking. YOUNG CHILDREN laugh and run in the 
           background as Tim looks at Annie...

                                 TIM
                        It’s been a year and a half, 
                        Annie. We haven’t set a date.

                                 ANNIE
                        Tim...can we talk about this 
                        tomorrow? 
                                 (MORE)

                        We can have dinner or something? I 
                        just, I need to get some sleep, 
                        okay?

           Tim nods slowly, knowing he should let it go...

                                 TIM
                        Okay.

           INT. ANNIE’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Annie lies awake in bed, staring at the ceiling and 
           listening to the city outside her apartment window. 

           Her mind is racing. She closes her eyes.

           EXT. INTERSTELLAR SPACE 

           SILENT INTERSTELLAR SPACE, THE TWO TWISTING GALAXIES SPIN 
           FASTER AND FASTER, GROWING CLOSER AND CLOSER, TERMINALLY 
           LOCKED IN EACH OTHER’S GRAVITATIONAL PULL...

           EXT. BACKYARD GORGE - SAGAN HOME - THE NEXT MORNING

           Dressed for travel, Carl stands in the forested backyard 
           of his home looking out into the gorge. 

           Linda approaches him, eyeing his attire...

                                 LINDA
                        I thought you didn’t leave until 
                        this afternoon.

           Carl continues gazing at the gorge.

                                 CARL
                        I had Shirley move my flight up.

                                 LINDA
                        Carl, our meeting with the Rabbi 
                        is this morning. You said you 
                        would come with me.

                                 CARL
                        I’m sorry. I don’t have time.

                                 LINDA
                              (with edge)
                        Would you please look at me when 
                        you speak to me?

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Carl turns to face her. 

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        Carl, you said you would come. 

                                 CARL
                        Linda, if you insist on me being 
                        there, then you’ll have to 
                        reschedule. The NASA oversight 
                        meeting is this afternoon in 
                        Pasadena. Then I head to Tucson to 
                        lecture...

                                 LINDA
                        This is important, Carl! It’s 
                        about Nick...

                                 CARL
                              (cutting her off)
                        This isn’t about Nick! It’s about 
                        you! 

           Carl pauses, abruptly stopping himself from saying more.

           Holding his gaze, Linda’s pretty face strains with 
           emotion as she absorbs his comment. 

           Carl’s voice softens.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Linda, look, I’m sorry, I am. But 
                        I have to catch this flight.

           INT. ANNIE’S UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - SAME MORNING

           Sitting cross-legged on the floor with her typewriter 
           when the sound of Annie’s APARTMENT BUZZER RINGS.

           Annie crosses the room, and POKES HER HEAD OUT THE 
           WINDOW. Several floors below, LINDA STANDS ON THE STREET.

           INT. ANNIE’S UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Linda and Annie sit across from each other on the sofa. 
           Linda TEARS UP as she speaks...

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LINDA
                        I’m so sorry. I was over at NYU 
                        and I finished the recording 
                        session and I was walking to Penn 
                        Station and I started crying...and 
                        I just kept walking and then I was 
                        by the park and I needed somewhere 
                        to go to get it together.

           Annie puts her hand on Linda’s arm.

                                 ANNIE
                        Linda, it’s okay. What’s wrong?

                                 LINDA
                        I don’t know what to do. I mean, I 
                        knew he was focused when I married 
                        him. I knew his life was all about 
                        his work. What’s worse, I knew he 
                        wasn’t a good father in his first 
                        marriage. (pause) Did you know 
                        that? That Carl was married 
                        before?

                                 ANNIE
                        Tim mentioned it once...

                                 LINDA
                        Carl has two older boys. Jeremy 
                        and Dorian. He rarely sees them. 
                        Lynn, that’s his first wife, she’s 
                        a brilliant woman, a scientist 
                        like Carl. Driven like Carl. As 
                        far as I can tell they were 
                        spectacularly unhappy together. 

           Linda wipes her mascara with a piece of toilet paper.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        The thing is, when Carl talks to 
                        me...when he says my name, it’s in 
                        the same impatient, tedious tone 
                        he speaks to her.

           Another rush of tears roll down Linda’s face as she 
           breaks down, reaching out to Annie. 

           Annie hugs her, trying to console her, but THERE IS 
           SOMETHING UNCOMFORTABLE IN ANNIE’S UNSEEN EXPRESSION.
           EXT. JET PROPULSION LABRATORY - PASADENA, CA - AFTERNOON

           Palm trees sway in the breeze on the grounds of JPL...

           INT. GREGORY BRUCE’S OFFICE - JPL - SAME MOMENT

           Carl sits with his legs casually crossed as Gregory Bruce 
           aggressively slides a large MANILA ENVELOPE at Carl.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                              (re: the envelope)
                        You want to explain to me exactly 
                        what this is?

           Carl opens the envelope revealing the 8x10 NUDE 
           PHOTOGRAPH of the MAN AND PREGNANT WOMAN HOLDING HANDS. 

                                 CARL
                        A photograph of two human beings.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        Don’t be coy.

                                 CARL
                        I’ve always found coy to be the 
                        appropriate response to 
                        rhetorical.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                              (angry)
                        Are you kidding me!

                                 CARL
                        There you go again.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        Goddamn it, Carl! 

           Gregory motions with his hands as if reading a headline.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        ‘NASA SENDS SMUT TO THE STARS!’  
                        The committee is freaking out!

           The back of Gregory Bruce’s neck grows cranberry red.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Carl, we both know the space 
                        program is changing. More funding 
                        is coming from the defense 
                        department than ever before.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        And there are people at NASA that 
                        do not like you. Those people 
                        would very much like to see you 
                        removed from the Voyager project. 
                        So I strongly suggest you quit 
                        poking the fuckin’ wolf with the 
                        stick! 

           Carl stands, holding up the PHOTOGRAPH OF THE NUDES.

                                 CARL
                              (re: the photo)
                        Greg, this is what our species 
                        looks like! This is what we are! 
                        Do you honestly think that an 
                        alien civilization would somehow 
                        be offended by our physical form? 

           Gregory doesn’t respond.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Maybe I could paint some fig 
                        leaves on there for you? Are we so 
                        consumed by a culture of self-
                        shame and puritanical dogma that 
                        we can’t take ownership of our own 
                        bodies? 

           Gregory looks Carl dead in the eyes.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        You done? 

                                 CARL
                              (re: photo)
                        There’s nothing in this image to 
                        be ashamed of. 

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        Lose it. Period. End of speech. 

           Carl absorbs the resolve in Gregory Bruce’s voice.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        One more fuck up, Carl, even a 
                        little one, and they pull the plug 
                        on your record project. Do you 
                        understand me? And that is not 
                        rhetorical.
           INT. METRO DINER - UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT

           Yellow CHECKER CABS pass outside in the rain as Tim sits 
           across a booth from Annie in an Upper West Side diner. 

                                 TIM
                        I heard Carl is going to be on the 
                        cover of Newsweek.

           Annie smiles in a quiet way but doesn’t respond.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        You have your meeting at Columbia 
                        tomorrow, right? With the Chinese 
                        music guy?

                                 ANNIE
                        That’s right. 

           Tim looks at her distant expression.

                                 TIM
                        Annie, what’s wrong with you? 

           Annie pauses, then looks away again.

                                 ANNIE
                        Linda came to see me this morning 
                        at my apartment. 

                                 TIM
                        Oh yeah? What’d she say?

                                 ANNIE
                        Nothing. She just had some stuff 
                        on her mind. 

           Annie pauses.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        We just talked, you know? About 
                        things. But it was really nice 
                        that she came to me.

                                 TIM
                        Well, yeah. You’re her friend. She 
                        trusts you.

           Avoiding Tim’s gaze, Annie looks out at the wet city as 
           COUPLES HUDDLE TOGETHER, SHARING UMBRELLAS IN THE NIGHT.
           EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - THE NEXT DAY

           The sun hangs over the Hudson River as Annie emerges from 
           the tiled stairwell of the 113th ST. SUBWAY STATION and 
           walks toward the gates of COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.

           INT. COLUMBIA SCHOOL OF THE ARTS BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Annie walks down a CORRIDOR of PRACTICE ROOMS as YOUNG 
           MUSICIANS religiously practice CELLOS and OBOES and other 
           CLASSICAL INSTRUMENTS behind closed doors.

           INT. OFFICE OF DR. CHOU WEN-CHUNG - MOMENTS LATER

           In a small, clean office, Annie sits across from DR. CHOU 
           WEN-CHUNG (40’s), a quiet, brilliant composer and 
           professor of music.

           Annie smiles...

                                 ANNIE
                        We’ve had a very difficult time 
                        selecting a Chinese piece of 
                        music. The truth is, we’re 
                        ignorant of Chinese culture...

           Dr. Wen-Chung HOLDS UP AN AUDIO CASSETTE, interrupting 
           Annie...

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                              (re: the cassette)
                        What’s that?

                                 DR. CHOU WEN-CHUNG
                        Ms. Druyan, this is the piece of 
                        music you’ve been looking for.

           Annie eyes the cassette again.

                                 ANNIE
                        Really? Are you certain?

           The professor SLIDES the tape across the desk to Annie.

                                 DR. CHOU WEN-CHUNG
                              (re: the cassette)
                        The title translated means Flowing 
                        Streams. It was composed more than 
                        2500 years ago. 

           She looks at the cassette another moment.

                        Twelve years ago, the musician who 
                        performed this particular 
                        recording was dragged from his 
                        classroom, beaten publicly, and 
                        murdered in China’s cultural 
                        revolution. He was 90 years old. 
                        He was my teacher and my friend. 
                        And I am certain this is what 
                        you’re looking for.

           EXT./INT. FIRE ESCAPE - ANNIE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Annie sits alone on her fire escape as sun falls. She 
           puts on a pair of HI-FI HEAD PHONES, inserts the cassette 
           into a tape player, and pushes PLAY.

           As sunlight fades and the city lights come to life, Annie 
           is transported by otherworldly HARMONIC SOUNDS OF AN 
           ANCIENT CHINESE STRING INSTRUMENT.

           As the breathtaking music progresses, we HOLD CLOSE on 
           Annie’s face AS TEARS WELL IN HER EYES.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - TUCSON - NIGHT

           We hear A KEY RATTLING in a lock, and Carl, weary from 
           travel, enters a dark hotel room. 

           He switches on a fluorescent lamp and gazes around the 
           lonely, nondescript room.

           Exhaling, Carl sets his bag on the desk and sits down on 
           the edge of the double bed. He rubs his eyes, listening 
           to the sound of trucks passing on the Arizona interstate.

           After a moment he opens his eyes again and begins pulling 
           off his corduroy blazer, when HE STOPS...

           We follow his gaze to a SMALL RED MESSAGE LIGHT BLINKING 
           ON THE HOTEL ROOM PHONE...

           INT. FIRE ESCAPE - ANNIE’S APARTMENT - A MINUTE LATER

           We hear the sound of a PHONE RINGING as Annie crosses 
           through her apartment in a tank top and jeans.

           She answers the phone.

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                        Hello?

                                 CARL (ON PHONE)
                        I just got back to my room and 
                        found a message that said, Annie 
                        called. 

           Annie GRINS at the sound of Carl’s voice.

                                 CARL (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Why didn’t you leave me that 
                        message ten years ago?

           THERE IS A LONG BEAT AS ANNIE HOLDS THE PHONE RECEIVER TO 
           HER EAR, TRYING TO GATHER HERSELF.  

                                 ANNIE (INTO PHONE)
                              (in a joking tone)
                        Well, I’ve been meaning to talk to 
                        you about that, Carl...

           Carl doesn’t respond. 

           The silence on the line is deafening.

           Annie’s tone shifts sober...

                                 ANNIE (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Do you mean...for keeps?

                                 CARL (ON PHONE)
                        Yes. For keeps. Will you marry me, 
                        Annie?

           The phone trembles in Annie’s hand.

                                 ANNIE (INTO PHONE)
                        Yeah, I’ll marry you.

           Without another word, Annie HANGS UP THE PHONE. 

           She stands for a moment unable to move. Her mind racing, 
           she PACES circles like a compass unable to find North.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                              (to herself)
                        Oh...Annie, Annie...oh, dear 
                        Annie, what the fuck...

           Suddenly the PHONE RINGS AGAIN and Annie LEAPS, startled 
           by the sound. 

                                                          (CONTINUED)

           She stares at the phone as it RINGS AGAIN, then answers.

                        Yup?

                                 CARL (ON PHONE)
                        In our last conversation...did...

                                 ANNIE (INTO PHONE)
                        Yes. Yes it did. 

                                 CARL (ON PHONE)
                        Okay. Good. Just making sure all 
                        that really happened.

           Annie smiles.

           INT. LANGUAGE STUDIES DEPT. - CORNELL UNIVERSITY - DAY

           CLOSE UP ON: Nick Sagan (5), steps up to the microphone. 
           We hear Linda’s voice off screen talking sweetly.

                                 LINDA (O.S.)
                        Go ahead, sweetheart...

           EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR - ONE WEEK LATER - MORNING

           The magnificent, 150 foot silhouette of the STATUE OF 
           LIBERTY rises from the fog shrouding New York Harbor.  

           On the water far below, a CIRCLE LINE FERRY BOAT cuts 
           through the mist.

           EXT. UPPER DECK - CIRCLE LINE FERRY - SAME MOMENT

           Carl and Annie stand beside each other on the nearly 
           empty, open air UPPER DECK of the CIRCLE LINE FERRY.

           Carl adjusts his collar to the wind and looks at Annie. 
           Her dark hair falls in ringlets in the damp ocean air.

                                 CARL
                        We can’t tell anyone. If there’s a 
                        scandal, NASA could pull the plug 
                        on the record. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Then we wait. We wait until after 
                        the launch. Until Voyager is 
                        safely out of the atmosphere, and 
                        it becomes something that cannot 
                        be taken back.

           Carl nods.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        But we need to decide right now 
                        when we’re going to tell them.

                                 CARL
                        You mean the date?

                                 ANNIE
                        I mean the exact date and the 
                        exact time. 

           Carl looks at Annie.

                                 CARL
                        The launch is on August 20th. How 
                        about August 22nd? Linda and I are 
                        in the Cape that weekend. I could 
                        tell her there.

                                 ANNIE
                        What time?

                                 CARL
                        One-o’clock PM Eastern?

                                 ANNIE
                        All right. I’ll tell Tim the very 
                        same moment.   

           Mist drifts through the morning air as Annie looks into 
           Carl’s eyes.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Carl, I have an idea...

                                 CARL
                        Well, that’s a phrase I’d like to 
                        hear for the next fifty years...

           Annie leans in closer as the harbor breeze kicks up.

           Carl hesitates for an instant, then, for the first time, 
           as Manhattan emerges out of the fog, THEY KISS...

           Annie and Carl’s conversation LAPSES IN from the previous 
           scene as we see...

           Annie in an EXAMINATION GOWN walking down a long corridor 
           beside a FEMALE NURSE (30’s) at NYU Medical Center...

                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        Do you think, if we somehow 
                        recorded what it’s like to be 
                        human. My thoughts. And I don’t 
                        mean just about me, but about all 
                        of us. If we hooked me up to a 
                        machine while I meditated...an EEG 
                        or something, do you think we 
                        could physically capture it? And 
                        do you imagine that someday, 
                        somewhere out there, another life 
                        form could decipher it? 

                                 CARL (V.O.)
                        The record will last a billion 
                        years. That’s a long time, Annie. 
                        Do it.

           Annie lies on a bed while TWO RESEARCHERS PLACE ELECTRODE

           As the last of the electrodes are placed, one of the 
           Researchers turns toward a bank of oversized, late-
           seventies MEDICAL MONITORING EQUIPMENT.

           Annie closes her eyes, meditating as we CUT TO...

                        What it’s like to be alive. Here

           EXT. LAUNCH PAD - CAPE CANAVERAL - AUGUST 20, 1977 - DAWN

           The purple hue of dawn rises on a NASA launch pad. 

           Carl, Linda, Tim, and Annie stand shoulder to shoulder 
           behind a safety barricade. 

           Carl holds Nick in his arms as they all gaze upward, 
           captivated by a MASSIVE TITAN ROCKET towering above them.

           NOTE: THIS MOMENT LOOPS BACK TO THE OPENING MONTAGE OF

           FEET BEGIN TO TREMBLE AS THE ROCKET SEQUENCE FIRES.

           The darkness is lit with BRILLIANT ORANGE as the rocket 
           carrying Voyager 2 RISES FROM THE LAUNCH SCAFFOLD in a 
           trail of magnificent fire. 

           As the rocket ascends into the heavens, Tim and Carl 
           raise their arms in joyful triumph.

           All four scream with excitement.

           Linda turns to Annie with tears streaming down her face, 
           HUGGING HER WITH JOY. 

           Annie begins to cry in Linda’s arms. Her bittersweet 
           expression conveys the attainment of an impossible dream, 
           and also the knowledge of the price to be paid.

           Linda, wearing an aquamarine bikini, plays with Nick on 
           the beach. 

           Carl watches his wife and child as they dig in the sand 
           with their bare hands, looking for the water. 

           Carl glances at his WRISTWATCH. It reads: 12:59PM...

           Tim lies on Annie’s couch in her apartment reading.

           The new issue of NEWSWEEK MAGAZINE rests on the coffee 
           table featuring CARL’S FACE ON THE COVER.

           Annie enters the living room and pauses, looking 
           anxiously at the CLOCK on the living room wall.

           Tim looks up from his book and smiles...but his SMILE 
           FADES QUICKLY AS HE SEES THE DREAD ON ANNIE’S FACE.

                        Tim, I need to tell you something.

           There is a long difficult beat of silence as Tim stares 
           at Annie, READING THE GUILT IN HER EYES.

           A LOOK OF RECOGNITION FLOODS TIM’S FACE AS HIS GAZE 
           DRIFTS TO THE ISSUE OF NEWSWEEK ON THE COFFEE TABLE.

           THEN SLOWLY, WITHOUT A WORD, TIM REACHES OUT AND FLIPS 
           OVER THE MAGAZINE, TURNING CARL’S IMAGE FACE DOWN.

           EXT. INTERSTELLAR SPACE - SAME MOMENT 

           WE HEAR THE HAUNTING SOUND OF THE INDIAN, RAGA, "JAAT 
           KAHAN HO," AS...

           THE TWO TWISTING STARS WE’VE BEEN TRACKING REACH THEIR 
           FINAL PAS DE DUEX, ENTERING EACH OTHER’S SYSTEMS.

           AS THE MUSIC RISES, WE WATCH AS THE EACH STARS INDIGENOUS 
           PLANETS COLLIDE IN BEAUTIFUL, BREATHTAKING DISPLAYS OF 
           SPECTACULAR DESTRUCTION...

           EXT. UNDERWATER - SAME MOMENT

           Nick’s young body glides beneath the ocean waves, 
           grabbing a LARGE SEASHELL OFF THE OCEAN FLOOR as the 
           August sunlight refracts through the surface above him.

           The boy hovers for a moment in the current, studying the 
           shell, when somewhere in the distance he HEARS THE MUTED, 
           FAR AWAY SOUND OF HIGH PITCHED VOICES.

           EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - THIRTY-FEET OFFSHORE - SECONDS LATER

           Nick BREAKS THE SURFACE OF THE WATER offshore. 

           He quickly pulls off his DIVING GOGGLES AND IS ABOUT TO 
           HOLD UP THE SEASHELL FOR HIS PARENTS TO SEE.

           HE STOPS, HEARING HIS MOTHER’S SCREAMING VOICE. We follow 
           Nick’s gaze to...

           EXT. BEACH - CAPE COD, MA - CONTINUOUS

           Linda, standing in her aqua bikini holding Nick’s plastic 
           sand shovel in her hand. Her pretty face is wrought red 
           with furious tears.

                                 LINDA
                        What have you done, Carl! What 
                        have you done to us! 

           The breeze gusts off the water and Linda’s nipples are 
           pronounced through the wet fabric of her bikini top.

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                 CARL
                        Linda, people can see your 
                        breasts...your nipples...through 
                        that top...

                                 LINDA
                        What? 

           Linda looks down at her body.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        Are you fucking serious! Who 
                        cares? What is wrong with you? 

           Carl remains silent.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        Do you need to control two women 
                        at once now, Carl? Is that it?

           Linda’s eyes well with hot tears.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        You know, Diane said something to 
                        me. She pulled me aside at her 
                        exhibit a few weeks ago...but I 
                        said No! Carl would never!

           She shakes her head in disbelief, then looks at him.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t. Don’t do this. Don’t throw 
                        us away. I’ve got no mother. No 
                        father. This family is my whole 
                        world.

           Carl’s voice softens.

                                 CARL
                        Linda, I’m so sorry it happened 
                        this way.

                                 LINDA
                        You’re sorry? What about Nick? We 
                        have Nick! For God’s sake! We have 
                        Nick! What are you going to say to 
                        him? Are you going to tell him how 
                        sorry you are!

           SUPER TITLE:

                                  THREE MONTHS LATER

           WE HEAR THE QUIET, CRACKLING SOUND OF A RECORD NEEDLE 
           AIMLESSLY SPINNING AT THE END OF A RECORD AS WE...

                                                          FADE IN ON:

           AN EXTREME CLOSE UP: of THREE WHITE SUGAR CUBES lined up 
           on a window ledge. In the background, through the window, 
           snow falls on the city.

           Slowly, the TIP of a SMALL PIPETTE ENTERS THE FRAME and 
           SQUEEZES A SINGLE DROP OF LIQUID LYSERGIC ACID (LSD) ON 
           EACH OF THE THREE CUBES.

           As the chemical is instantly absorbed into the porous 
           sugar we hear a familiar WOMAN’S VOICE...

                                 RITA (O.S.)
                        Tim...that’s...that’s a lot of 
                        acid.

           We SHIFT ANGLES TO REVEAL...

           INT. TIM’S APARTMENT - NEW YORK CITY - SAME MOMENT

           Tim sitting shirtless beside the apartment window looking 
           out at the falling snow.

           Rita, whom we met earlier at Nora’s party, stands in the 
           foyer. Her coat and boots are wet with snow. 

           Tim doesn’t respond as Rita glances around the room. 

           SEVERAL HUNDRED LP RECORDS are arranged in geometrically 
           ordered patterns across the hardwood floor.

           In the corner A RECORD SPINS AIMLESSLY ON A TURNTABLE, 
           the music having long been over...

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                        Tim? Did you hear me?

           Tim slowly looks up at her. He hasn’t shaved in a week. 
           His hair is shaggy. But he’s as handsome as ever. 

           Tim motions to the sugar cubes.

                                 TIM
                        You want one?

           Rita shakes her head.

                                 RITA
                        It’s like...eight-thirty in the 
                        morning. I haven’t even had a 
                        cigarette yet.

                                 TIM
                        Understood.

           Tim PLUCKS ALL THREE SUGAR CUBES OFF THE WINDOW LEDGE AND 
           POPS THEM IN HIS MOUTH.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        I prefer the early start so I can 
                        round the horn before sundown. 
                        Sometimes the darkness...you don’t 
                        want to hit it wrong... 

           Tim’s comment trails off, choosing to look back out the 
           window at the pure white snow falling on the city.

           Rita removes her coat and MOTIONS TO THE TURNTABLE...

                                 RITA
                              (re: the record)
                        You want me to start that over?

           Tim looks curiously at the turntable, as if just 
           realizing there is no music.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah. I do.

           Rita carefully steps over the patterns of albums laid out 
           on the floor and RESTARTS THE RECORD...

           The OPENING GUITAR CHORDS of Bob Dylan’s VISIONS OF 
           JOHANNA, crackle through the quiet room. 

           Rita pulls up a chair and sits at the window with Tim.

                        To myself, I seem to have only 
                        been like a boy playing on the 
                        seashore, and diverting 
                        myself...now and then finding a 
                        smoother pebble or a prettier 
                        shell than ordinary, whilst the 
                        great ocean of truth lay all 
                        undiscovered before me...

           Tim looks at Rita.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        You know who said that?

                                 RITA
                        Issac Newton.

           Tim raises his eyebrows.

                                 TIM
                        You’re a smarty.

                                 RITA
                        Learned it from you. Read it in 
                        your book.

           Tim smiles.

                                 RITA (CONT’D)
                              (re: Tim’s book)
                        Red Limit is really good, Tim. The 
                        reviews are amazing.

           Tim nods quietly as a silence falls between them.

                                 TIM
                        So...Rita...who sent ya?

           Rita lights a cigarette and sets her PACK on the ledge.

                                 RITA
                        Nobody sent me. I’m just here.

                                 TIM
                        You never enter a room without a 
                        plan.

                                 RITA
                        I’m here to check in. See how 
                        you’re doing. I tried calling but 
                        it just rings and rings.

                        I unplugged it awhile back.

                                 RITA
                        Why?

                                 TIM
                        Linda. She’s really, really angry. 
                        And I get that. So she calls me, 
                        you know? Morning, noon, and 
                        night. To bitch about them. In the 
                        beginning, I wanted to help, but 
                        after awhile, it’s just poison. I 
                        couldn’t listen to it anymore. 

           Rita looks at him.

                                 RITA
                        Tim, have you spoken to Annie?

           Tim rubs his eyes, then NABS A CIGARETTE from Rita’s 
           pack. He lights it and takes a hard drag.

           As Dylan’s sand and glue voice echoes quietly in the 
           background, Tim turns his attention back to the snow 
           falling outside the window.

                                 TIM
                        Rita, I’ve got eight to ten solid 
                        hours of cerebral rewiring ahead 
                        of me. The last fuckin’ thing I 
                        want to do this moment is dish 
                        about Annie Druyan.

           EXT. A-FRAME CABIN - OUTSIDE ITHACA, NY - DAY

           Snow falls hard on a small A-FRAME CABIN nestled in the 
           woods south of Ithaca. Wood smoke drifts from the chimney 
           through the crisp air...

           After a moment, an ORANGE 1970 PORSHE 914, pulls into the 
           snowy driveway. The license plate reads: PHOBOS.

           INT. A-FRAME CABIN - SECONDS LATER

           Annie curls up in a robe by the fireplace drinking tea 
           and looking badly under the weather.

           She COUGHS HARD as she hears Carl come through the door 
           and stomp the snow off his shoes.

                        have Shirley make you an 
                        appointment.

           Annie takes a sip of her tea.

                        How did it go with Linda?

                        Not well. She rejected our

                        All of them? Carl, we pretty much

                                 CARL
                        Everything. I know. Reason is lost 
                        on her. Anger seems to be her 
                        guiding dynamic.

           Annie looks at him.

                        She was betrayed, Carl.

                        attorneys. She’s going to fight 
                        it. This divorce could take years.

           Annie falls silent as she absorbs the information.

                                 ANNIE
                        Did you get to see Nick?

                                 CARL
                        Yes. I took him to lunch. We 
                        played some pinball.

                                 ANNIE
                        How is he?

                                 CARL
                        I think he hears a lot from Linda.  
                        Things he doesn’t need to hear.

           Annie nods. There’s a beat of silence...

                                 ANNIE
                        I wonder where they are right now.

           Carl pauses, thinking...

                                 CARL
                        They passed through Mars’ orbit 
                        about two weeks ago. 

                                 ANNIE
                        How long until they reach Jupiter?

                                 CARL
                        Sixteen months.

           A GRANNY-APPLE-DOLL-LOOKING RECEPTIONIST (60’s) looks up 
           from her desk with pursed lips as Annie sits bundled up 
           in a waiting room feeling terrible.
           INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Annie sits on the exam table with a fistful of TISSUES as 
           A family DOCTOR (60’s), white hair, enters the room.

                                 ANNIE
                        Doctor, thank you so much for 
                        getting me in to see you. I’ve 
                        been fighting this thing for weeks 
                        and I just can’t seem to get...

                        Let me stop you right there 
                        Miss...

           The Doctor checks her name on his note pad...

                        Miss Druhan...

           Annie blows her nose.

                                 ANNIE
                        Druyan.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Miss whatever your name is. To be 
                        clear, I have no intention, nor 
                        does any other physician in this 
                        practice have any intention of 
                        treating you today. In fact, if I 
                        had known who you were when 
                        Shirley Arden made the appointment 
                        I would have refused.

           Annie stares at the man blankly.

                                 ANNIE
                        I don’t understand...

                        And after what you did to Linda 
                        Sagan and their little boy, you 
                        should get used to this kind of

           EXT. CARL’S OFFICE - CORNELL CAMPUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Carl walks out of the ASTRONOMY BUILDING and sees Annie 
           in the parking lot, leaning against the orange Porsche

                                 CARL
                              (calling out to her)
                        Annie? 

           INT. PORSCHE - MOMENTS LATER

           Carl drives as Annie trembles in the passenger seat.

                                 CARL
                        Annie, what’s wrong?

                        Please, just drive.

                                 CARL
                        All right. Where to?

                                 ANNIE
                        Out of this town.

                        twenty...

           Carl stops himself, seeing her tears. He veers the car 
           onto a rural road, exiting the city limits.

           They drive north in silence as Annie stares out the 
           passenger window at the wet fields and forest.

                                 ANNIE
                              (whispering to 
                               herself)
                        What have we done?

           Carl looks over at her...

                                 CARL
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t hear you?

           Annie turns to him fiercely...

                                 ANNIE
                        What have we done! To Linda? To 
                        Tim? To Nick?

           Carl looks at her, unsure how to answer.

           Through the windshield, in the distance, Annie sees an 
           ABANDONED GAS STATION on the side of the road. 

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Pull the car over. Pull over 
                        there.

                                 CARL
                        What are you...

                                 ANNIE
                        Pull the car over! 

           Carl slows and pulls the car into the overgrown lot of 
           the defunct station. 

           EXT. ABANDONED GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Annie gets out and slams the passenger door shut.

           Carl follows her.

                        I want you to go.

                                 CARL
                        Go where?

                                 ANNIE
                        I don’t care, Carl! But I need to 
                        be alone! So just leave, okay?

                                 CARL
                        But you just asked me to drive 
                        with you out into the...

                                 ANNIE
                        So I’m the first woman in the 
                        history of the world to change her 
                        mind! Now I’m telling you to go!

           Carl looks at the empty, derelict building. The sagging 
           roof is covered with moss. The windows and door are 
           boarded with weathered plywood. The pumps are gone.

                                 CARL
                        There’s nothing here, Annie. 

           She looks at him with hot tears in her eyes. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Leave.

           He’s about to say more, then STOPS HIMSELF.

           Without another word, Carl gets behind the wheel of the 
           car, PULLS A U-TURN, AND DRIVES AWAY...

           Annie lets out a faint, involuntary, MAMMALIAN CRY as she 
           watches the car disappear around a bend.

           As she sits down on the curb her body is seized with 
           uncontrollable sobbing. 

           EXT. ROADSIDE - MOMENTS LATER

           Carl has pulled the car to the side of the rural road a 
           few miles from the abandoned station.

           With the collar of his blazer turned up against the wind, 
           Carl SILENTLY PACES IN CIRCLES, his mind racing.

           EXT. ABANDONED GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Annie sits alone on the curb with her EYES CLOSED, 
           LISTENING TO THE WORLD AROUND HER.

           The wind blows. Melting ice drips from a rain gutter. 
           Somewhere off to her right, a murder of CROWS takes 
           flight from the barren canopy of a MAPLE TREE.

           Then SHE HEARS IT...THE SOUND OF AN APPROACHING CAR.

           Without opening her eyes, Annie listens as the vehicle 
           slows, tires meet the gravel roadside, the engine 
           shutters to silence, and a door opens.

           Annie finally opens her eyes and SEES CARL STANDING IN 
           FRONT OF HER.

                                 ANNIE
                        We made this promise. We captured 
                        this thing. We did that. I did 
                        that. I captured this love I 
                        thought I could have...this 
                        incredible promise I thought I 
                        could keep...and we sent it to the 
                        stars. We sent it to forever. 

           A tear streaks down Annie’s face...

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        But I can’t do it! I can’t keep 
                        this promise, no matter how much I 
                        want it. Because we’ve ruined 
                        these people! These people that we 
                        love! It’s such hubris! To think 
                        that we could have this.

           Carl kneels in the wet gravel and takes Annie’s hand.

                                 CARL
                        Look at me...

           Annie looks in his eyes.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        That’s what we are. We are lovers

                        Spot, a prominent oval-shaped 
                        feature in the southern hemisphere 
                        of Jupiter, which has been a 
                        mystery to us since it was first 
                        observed by Cassini and Hooke 315 
                        years ago, is in fact, a 
                        persistent, ongoing, anticyclonic 
                        storm. A storm that has been 
                        raging for hundreds, if not 
                        thousands of years. And at this 
                        moment, is larger than planet 
                        Earth itself...

                        Galilean moons is covered in a 
                        thick crust of ice. And possibly

                        We’re talking about lava flows 300 
                        miles in length.

           The hands of dozens of reporters shoot into the air with 
           questions.

           EXT. JUPITER ENCOUNTER PARTY - JPL - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Champagne is passed as HUNDREDS OF GUESTS celebrate the 
           success of the Jupiter Encounter.

           Having joined the party crowd outside, Carl’s arm is 
           wrapped around Annie. 

           Rita approaches with a glass of champagne.

                                 ANNIE
                        Hey you!

                                 RITA
                        My god, the brainpower at this 
                        party!

           CONTINUED:

           Annie smiles and HUGS Rita warmly. As they embrace, Rita 
           WHISPERS SOMETHING UNHEARD in Annie’s ear.

           Annie shoots Rita an UNSEEN look. Rita gives her a kiss 
           on the cheek...

                                 RITA (CONT’D)
                              (quietly to Annie)
                        I’m just the messenger, babe. Do 
                        with it what you will.

           EXT. OUTDOOR STEPS - JPL - MOMENTS LATER

           As the sounds of the after party thrive in the distance, 
           Annie walks alone across the sprawling JPL grounds.

           As she turns a corner she sees Tim, a glass of SCOTCH in 
           his hand, looking up at Jupiter in the night sky...

           Tim doesn’t take his eyes off the sky as Annie sits down 
           beside him...

                                 ANNIE
                        You know Tim, you’re making Carl 
                        nervous.

           Tim LAUGHS.

                                 TIM
                        Is his nose doing that twitching 
                        thing?

           Annie smiles.

                                 ANNIE
                        A little.

           Tim chuckles to himself and takes a sip of his scotch.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad you’re here, Tim.

                                 TIM
                        Of course I’m here. 

           Annie nods.

                                 ANNIE
                        Rita said you wanted to see me.

           Tim looks at Annie for the first time since she sat down.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           There is a beat of silence between them.

                                 TIM
                        Do you have any idea what you’re 
                        doing, Annie?

           She looks at him, then slowly shakes her head.

                                 ANNIE
                        No. I don’t.

                                 TIM
                        Can you look at me and honestly 
                        say you’re happier with him than 
                        you were with me?

                                 ANNIE
                        Tim, I don’t think about it that 
                        way...

                                 TIM
                              (cutting her off)
                        I do. 

           Annie looks at him.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        That is precisely how I think 
                        about it.

                                 ANNIE
                        Tim, I’m sorry.

                                 TIM
                        I don’t want you to be sorry. I 
                        want you to answer me.

           In the distance Annie can hear the SOUNDS OF THE PARTY 
           grow louder as the revelry escalates. 

           Annie looks at Tim with guilt in her eyes.

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes. The answer is yes. I may not 
                        deserve it, but I am so happy.

           There is a beat of silence, Tim nods his head as if to 
           himself. He slowly looks back up at Jupiter.

                                 TIM
                        You should get back to the party.
           EXT. CARL AND ANNIE’S RENTED HOUSE - HOLLYWOOD - DAY

           The sun shines on the Hollywood Hills as Rita pulls up in 
           a WHITE CONVERTIBLE outside Annie and Carl’s two-story 
           rented house.

           As Rita gets out of her car, she sees Carl pacing on the 
           second floor veranda talking into his DICTAPHONE.

           Rita looks up from the driveway and calls out...

                                 RITA
                              (calling up to Carl)
                        Hey Carl! 

           Carl, lost in thought, is startled by Rita’s voice. He 
           glares down at her.

           Rita grins up at him...

                                 RITA (CONT’D)
                        Can Annie come out and play?

           EXT. RITA’S CONVERTIBLE - MULHOLLAND - MOMENTS LATER

           In the convertible, Rita and Annie race down Mulholland 
           Drive with breeze in their hair and sun on their faces.

           Annie talks loudly over the sound of the road.

                                 ANNIE
                        ...So it’s the very first 
                        production meeting and everyone is 
                        sitting there, all the producers 
                        and the director and Carl and so 
                        forth. And everyone is going on 
                        about this and that and I decide 
                        to open my mouth and I say: 
                        Really? MAN IN THE COSMOS? Do we 
                        really think that’s the 
                        appropriate title for this show?

           Rita looks at her...

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        And of course, total crickets. 
                        Nobody says a thing. Not even 
                        Carl. And I can see the vein in 
                        the director’s forehead engorging 
                        with blood. But I’m committed at 
                        this point, right? 
                                 (MORE)

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        So I say: Not only is MAN IN THE 
                        COSMOS irretrievably sexist, it’s 
                        completely ego-centric and 
                        regressive. It implies that we, 
                        once again, believe that ‘mankind’ 
                        is at the center of the universe. 
                        Which, unless I’m mistaken, is the 
                        opposite of what this show is 
                        about.

                                 RITA
                        Fuck. What happened then?

                                 ANNIE
                        There was an incredibly long, 
                        incredibly pregnant pause. Then 
                        the director takes the pipe out of 
                        his mouth and he bangs his ashes 
                        out into the ashtray... 

                                 RITA
                              (re: banging pipe)
                        For dramatic effect...

                                 ANNIE
                        Exactly! And it’s clear the 
                        director’s about to launch into 
                        some misogynistic carpet-bomb 
                        tirade against me, when Carl 
                        clears his throat and says, She’s 
                        right. It should simply be called, 
                        COSMOS.

           Rita’s face lights up.

                                 RITA
                        No shit?

           Annie smiles.

                                 ANNIE
                        No shit.

           EXT. CAFE - LOS FELIZ - MOMENTS LATER

           In the shade of an avocado tree, Annie and Rita sit 
           drinking wine across a cafe table from one another.

                                 RITA
                        So she’s going to sign the 
                        paperwork this time?

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ANNIE
                        I think so. It’s been three years 
                        for God’s sake. I don’t know what 
                        more she wants.

           Rita takes a sip of wine then looks at Annie.

                                 RITA
                        Did you ever consider that she 
                        doesn’t want the fight to be over?

           Annie looks at Rita.

                                 RITA (CONT’D)
                        Because, once it’s really over, 
                        and the lawyers and the phone 
                        calls and the letters stop, and 
                        she deposits the check...what 
                        then? You and Carl will go travel 
                        the world...and do your show. But 
                        what’s next for her? 

           There is a moment of silence.

                                 ANNIE
                        What I did to Linda and Tim was 
                        the worst thing I’ve ever done. 
                        And I wake up some nights 
                        convinced that someday I will pay 
                        some terrible price for that. 

           Annie looks at the shifting sunlight on the avocado 
           leaves.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        But all the evidence I have tells 
                        me I live on this Earth one time. 
                        Once. Period. That’s it. Eighty 
                        years if I'm average. Ninety if 
                        I'm lucky. That’s what I know. 

           Annie pauses.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        And if there is one thing I will 
                        take with me, it’s that Carl is my 
                        one true love. And to deny it, is 
                        to deny my life itself. And I’m 
                        not willing to do that. I’m not 
                        going to be selfless. Not with my 
                        short time here. There will be no

                                 CARL
                              (into mic)
                        In 1655, it was first suggested 
                        that Saturn was surrounded by some 
                        type of mysterious rings. Thanks 
                        to Voyager 2, we can now confirm 
                        that those mysterious rings are 
                        made almost exclusively of 
                        crystallized water ice.

           Reporters take notes.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        We’ve discovered that Titan, 
                        Saturn’s largest moon, has a 
                        nitrogen rich atmosphere.

                        We’re talking about clouds and 
                        rain on a moon! There’s nothing 
                        else like it in the solar 
                        system...except Earth!(pause) But 
                        the haze over Titan is so opaque 
                        our instruments cannot penetrate 
                        it. So if there’s life on Titan, 
                        it’ll remain a mystery until we 
                        put a lander on the surface. 

           A REPORTER in the front row RAISES HIS HAND...

                                 REPORTER
                        John Farrell, CBS news. Dr. Sagan, 
                        is that a mission NASA is 
                        planning?

                                 CARL
                        NASA’s funding is moving 
                        drastically away from this type of 
                        space exploration.

                                 REPORTER
                        What direction is it moving?

                                 CARL
                        Cheap, reusable shuttle missions 
                        designed to service surveillance 
                        and commercial satellites in low 
                        Earth orbit. Providing the 
                        superficial illusion of hard 
                        scientific research to the 
                        taxpayer, but in reality,

                        communications sector.

           The sound of REPORTERS SCRIBBLING NOTES fills the room.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        So to answer your question, 
                        there’s no budget for a Titan 
                        mission. But by all means Mr. 
                        Farrell, if you’d like to break 
                        the ice with the incoming 
                        administration, be my guest.

           INT. CATWALK ABOVE CLEAN ROOM - JPL - MOMENTS LATER

           Gregory and Carl stand on a GLASS-ENCLOSED CATWALK above 
           a massive, bright white, 40,000 square foot CLEAN ROOM 
           designed for the construction of spacecraft.

           Forty-feet below them on the clean room floor, an 
           experimental UNMANNED ROVER UNIT lies partially built.

           Gregory sets his drink on a ledge and looks at Carl.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        Carl, you can’t talk about NASA 
                        that way. Not to the press.

           Carl speaks emphatically.

                                 CARL
                        How should I talk about it then, 
                        Greg? The shuttle program is going 
                        to gut the funding for real space 
                        exploration and transform the 
                        Earth’s thermosphere into a junk 
                        yard of spy satellites staring 
                        down at ourselves like some 
                        narcissistic, paranoid, futurist 
                        cautionary tale. And that’s not 
                        even to mention the very real, 
                        inherent dangers of reusing the 
                        same shuttles over and over. 

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                              (cutting Carl off)
                        John Lowell came to see me this 
                        afternoon. He asked what you want.

                                 CARL
                        What I want?

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        What. You. Want.

                                 CARL
                        Like, what appointment? Or job 
                        title? Or perhaps funding for a 
                        mission to one of my favorite 
                        planets? In exchange for me being 
                        less...vocal?

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        Something along those lines.

           Carl pauses, rubbing his eyes, his voice gaining edge.

                                 CARL
                        And you’re just here kindly 
                        passing along this information?

           Furious, Carl starts to walk away, then turns back at 
           Gregory with anger.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Just out of curiosity, what did 
                        you say I would want?

           Gregory pauses.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        An 80 percent reduction in the 
                        countries's ICBM arsenal. An 
                        annual S.E.T.I. research budget 
                        equal to that of Dow Chemical’s 
                        tax incentive package. And the 
                        reallocation of the hundreds of 
                        billions they’re going to waste on 
                        the shuttle program to doing 
                        serious exploration of the 
                        universe. 

           Carl’s terse expression BREAKS INTO A GRIN...

                                 CARL
                        You actually said that?

           Gregory rattles the ice in his vodka.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        I did.

                                 CARL
                        And what was their response?

           Gregory drains his glass in one swallow.

                                 GREGORY BRUCE
                        My resignation by the end of the 
                        week. (pause) You’re not the only 
                        person who’s dedicated their life 
                        to science around here.

           Carl pauses, looking at Gregory.

                        Greg, I’m aware I can sometimes

           EXT. LIMOUSINE - ITHACA - DAY

           The December snow drifts and blows as a LIMOUSINE drives 
           toward the Ithaca airport.

           INT. LIMOUSINE - SAME MOMENT

           Carl, Annie, and Nick (now 10) are driven to the Ithaca 
           airport by A DRIVER.

           Annie, now PREGNANT, smiles and squeezes Carl’s hand.

                        St. John is a U.S. territory, dad. 
                        You don’t need a passport.

           Carl smiles warmly.

                                 CARL
                        Right you are. But for 
                        identification purposes?

           Nick digs in his BACKPACK and holds up his PASSPORT then 
           looks out the limousine window at the drifting snow.

                        if we call her when we land this 
                        afternoon, and she’ll know you’ve

                        before we take off.

           Carl pauses.

                                 CARL
                        Okay. Well, that’s what we’ll need

           EXT. PAYPHONE - AIRPORT TARMAC - MOMENTS LATER

           Nick stands on the tarmac gripping a payphone receiver 
           with a pained expression on his young face.

           Behind them on the snowy runway, the propellers of a 
           PRIVATE CHARTER PLANE spin, waiting for them to board.

           Carl and Annie stand nearby holding their coats against 
           the cold wind, watching Nick as we hear LINDA’S UPSET 
           VOICE on the line...

                                 LINDA (ON PHONE)

                        alone here, do you?

           Nick’s eyes well with tears.

                                 NICK (INTO PHONE)
                        No...

           Carl and Annie watch Nick BURST INTO TEARS. Carl walks

                        Nick, hand me the phone, please.

           Nick’s face streams with hot tears as he hands his father 
           the phone.

           As Nick walks to Annie, Carl puts the phone to his ear.

                        Linda, what are you doing?

           Linda’s voice SCREAMS through the phone...

                        I’m not doing anything to you. I’m

                        vacation. We discussed and agreed

           In her apartment, Linda stands in an oversized tee shirt 
           and panties gripping the phone on a long cord.  

           AN EMPTY WHITE CANVAS hangs on the wall and a mostly 
           empty BOTTLE OF WINE sits on the floor. It’s clear by her 
           eyes Linda has been crying...

           There is a silence as flecks of snow melt in Carl’s hair. 

           He can feel Annie and Nick watching him.

                                 CARL (INTO PHONE)

           Carl TAKES THE PHONE AWAY FROM HIS EAR AS LINDA’S VOICE 
           SHRIEKS FROM THE RECEIVER.

           Without another word, Carl DROPS THE PHONE RECEIVER.

           LINDA’S FURIOUS VOICE IS STILL AUDIBLE AS THE PAYPHONE 
           RECEIVER TWISTS IN THE COLD WIND.

           Not looking back, Carl walks toward Annie and Nick,

           INT. OCEANFRONT EVENT SPACE - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

           Tim (now 40) stands at a PODIUM in a blazer and slacks 
           giving a book lecture. 

           A LARGE CROWD occupy the chairs and NUMEROUS OTHERS stand 
           in the aisles listening.

                              (reading from a book)
                        The trouble is that it’s 
                        difficult, probably impossible, 
                        for a human to make the mental 
                        leap to galactic scale. The very 
                        concept of space is inadequate for 
                        dealing with galaxies; one must 
                        invoke time as well. For instance, 
                        the Andromeda galaxy is so 
                        immense, that when the starlight 
                        from the far-side of Andromeda 
                        started its journey toward us, 
                        Homo habilis, the first humans, 
                        did not yet exist. By the time the 
                        light from the near-side of 
                        Andromeda started towards us, they 
                        did...

           EXT. REAR BALCONY - EVENT SPACE - MOMENTS LATER

           Tim steps out A REAR EXIT onto a second floor balcony 
           behind the lecture hall. 

           Inhaling the damp salty air, Tim looks out into the fog 
           at the Golden Gate Bridge beyond the beach.

           The exit door opens and an ASSISTANT (early 20’s) pokes 
           her head out.

                                 EVENT ASSISTANT
                        The Q&A starts in two minutes, Mr.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, okay...

           As the door shuts again, Tim FISHES A JOINT from his 
           interior pocket and lights it...when SOMETHING UNSEEN IN 
           THE DISTANCE CATCHES HIS EYE.

           Tim STARES, CAPTIVATED, AND PITCHES THE JOINT ASIDE.

           EXT. BEACH - SECONDS LATER

           Having abandoned the lecture, Tim hurries through the 
           sand, striping off his shoes as he walks faster and 
           faster towards something...

           Slowly, the woman turns. She is absolutely beautiful.

           AS THE SEA BIRDS ENCIRCLE THEM, she smiles at Tim. He is 
           barefoot and his dress pants are covered in wet sand.

           Rain falls as Linda and Nick, dressed for Yom Kippur, 
           climb the steps of a Synagogue.

           INT. SYNAGOGUE - LATER

           Inside the temple, Linda prays in silence as an UNSEEN 
           RABBI speaks in Hebrew. 

           After a moment, Linda looks at Nick seated nearby...his 
           eyes are closed praying, his boyish face on the verge of 
           adolescence. 

           A subtle look of maternal love fills Linda’s expression.

           As the suns sets on Yom Kippur, Linda fills Nick’s plate

           Having not eaten all day, Nick is famished. 

           Linda smiles, watching her son eat.

           in a white blanket. He looks down at her tiny face as she 
           sleeps. Her mouth is slightly ajar, her eyes dart beneath 
           her eyelids in a dream state.

           PINK FLOYD THE WALL T-SHIRT watching the Uranus encounter 
           coverage on television. 

           Linda, a few years older, dressed for work in 80’s 
           fashions, stands at the kitchen table. She pulls the 
           final FINISHED PAGE OF A TELEPLAY out of her typewriter.

           AS THE SPIRALING PLUMES OF SMOKE AND FIRE DRIFT DOWNWARD 
           THROUGH THE CRISP JANUARY SKY...

           WE HEAR THE FIRST METALLIC NOTES OF A BOTTLE NECK SLIDE 
           GUITAR AND THE LOW VIBRATO, VOCAL HUM OF “DARK WAS THE 
           NIGHT” BY BLIND WILLIE JOHNSON...

           The HAUNTING GOSPEL SONG CONTINUES, lapsing into the next 
           scene as we FADE TO...

           EXT. BURNED OUT CHURCH - RURAL TEXAS - 1945 - NIGHT

           A desolate Texas road at night. Wet fields stretch to the 
           wooded horizon. In the darkness, rain falls on the 
           CHARRED RUINS of a BURNED-OUT BAPTIST CHURCH.

           INT. BURNED OUT CHURCH - SAME MOMENT

           Shivering violently with malarial fever, a BLIND BLACK 
           MAN lies on a bed of wet newspapers. 

           An impoverished WOMAN, his wife, holds him in her arms 
           and his body trembles... 

           In his final moments of life, the man looks upward 
           through the burnt roof rafters at the dark sky above. 

           RAIN FALLS IN HIS SIGHTLESS EYES as the music FADES.

                                                            FADE TO:

           EXT. SPACE - SAME MOMENT

           VOYAGER 2 SPEEDS THROUGH THE DARKNESS TOWARD THE BLUE 
           SPHERE OF NEPTUNE FAR IN THE DISTANCE.
           EXT. CORNELL UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

           Daffodils poke their heads from the soil as the warm 
           spring wind blows across the Cornell Campus.

           Carl laughs as he strolls toward his classroom holding 
           his now seven-year-old daughter Sasha’s hand.

           INT. LECTURE HALL - CORNELL UNIVERSITY - MOMENTS LATER

           Carl sits in a front row seat of his empty lecture hall 
           as little Sasha in a yellow dress stands up at the 
           BLACKBOARD teaching him...

           Sasha DRAWS A BIG CIRCLE on the blackboard in chalk.

                                 CARL
                        You’ve drawn a circle.

                                 SASHA
                        No, Dad. I’ve drawn a cake.

           Sasha WRITES ‘HAPPY BIRTHDAY’ in the center of the 
           circle, making it look more like a cake.

                                 CARL
                        I stand corrected. You’ve drawn a 
                        cake.

                                 SASHA
                        Let’s say you’re having a party.

                                 CARL
                        Excellent. Whose birthday is it?

                                 SASHA
                        It makes no difference. The riddle 
                        will remain the same.

           Carl laughs...

                                 CARL
                        Let’s say it’s Mom’s birthday.

           Sasha adds ‘MOM’ to the cake beneath ‘HAPPY BIRTHDAY’

                                 SASHA
                        Better?

                                 CARL
                        Much.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SASHA
                        You’re having this party and 
                        you’ve invited eight people.

                                 CARL
                        Eight. Understood.

                                 SASHA
                        So here is the riddle: how can you 
                        cut this cake into eight equal 
                        pieces using only three cuts?

           Carl looks at the circle on the board.

                                 CARL
                        Each slice has to be exactly the 
                        same?

                                 SASHA
                        Bingo.

           Carl shifts in his seat, thinking...

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        Need a minute?

           Carl smiles...

                                 CARL
                        Perhaps.

                                 SASHA
                        Let me know if you need a hint.

           Sasha wanders across the stage to the other side of the 
           blackboard where Carl has CLASS NOTES written.

           Carl stares at the circle, clearly imagining different 
           possibilities in his mind.

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        Dad?

           Carl turns and looks as Sasha, on her tip-toes, points to 
           THE DRAKE EQUATION written on the other blackboard.

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        What’s this?

                                 CARL
                        That is The Drake Equation.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 SASHA
                        What does it do?

                                 CARL
                        It’s a tool, intended to solicit 
                        conversation about the possibility 
                        of intelligent life existing in 
                        other parts of the universe.

                                 SASHA
                        Aliens. You’re always taking about 
                        aliens. Did you always talk about 
                        aliens? Like when you were my age?

           Carl smiles..

                                 CARL
                        Yes. But I suppose not in quite 
                        the same way.

                                 SASHA
                        Why is it so important to you?

           Carl pauses. He looks at the equation.

                                 CARL
                        Because in theory, if they, 
                        whoever they are, are advanced 
                        enough to communicate with us, 
                        then there’s a very good chance 
                        that their species would be beyond 
                        human beings in their evolution as 
                        a society.

                                 SASHA
                        I don’t get it. Why is that good?

                                 CARL
                        Because Presh...extinction is the 
                        rule. Survival is the exception. 
                        It means they made it. Somehow 
                        they got through the dangerous 
                        parts. The self destructive parts 
                        of their evolution...and came out 
                        the other side. 

           Carl stands from his seat in the front row...

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        So if I ever met one, you know 
                        what I would ask them?

           Sasha thinks for a second...

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 SASHA
                        You’d ask them how they did it.

           Carl grins.

                                 CARL
                        Bingo.

           Carl picks up a piece of white chalk and approaches 
           Sasha’s circular cake drawing.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Your riddle is unsolvable if you 
                        only look at the cake from one 
                        perspective. You have to look at 
                        the cake from a different 
                        perspective.

           Carl DRAWS A NEW CIRCLE ON THE BOARD...

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Like you said, it’s not a 
                        circle...

           CARL ADDS TWO SIDES AND A BOTTOM TO THE CIRCLE, CREATING 
           A CYLINDER. 

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        It’s a cake.

           Carl grabs a piece of RED CHALK.

           HE DRAWS HIS FIRST RED CUT-LINE ACROSS THE TOP OF THE 
           CYLINDER, cutting the cake into TWO EQUAL PIECES. 

           HE DRAWS HIS SECOND CUT LINE BISECTING THE FIRST AT 90 
           DEGREES, cutting the cake into FOUR EQUAL PIECES... 

           Then he turns the chalk and MAKES HIS FINAL CUT 
           COMPLETELY THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE CAKE, CUTTING IT INTO 
           TWO SEPARATE BUT EQUAL CYLINDERS...therefore creating 
           EIGHT EQUAL PIECES. 

           Carl sets down the chalk and looks at Sasha.

           She grins...

                                 SASHA
                        I love you dad.
           INT. LINDA’S HOUSE - SANTA MONICA, CA - EVENING

           With a bowl of popcorn between them, Nick and Linda sit 
           on the couch watching the final seconds of an episode of 
           the television show, KNOT’S LANDING.

           As the episode ends, they both STARE AT THE SCREEN WITH 
           DEAFENING SILENCE AS THE CREDITS BEGIN TO ROLL...

           CLOSE ON TELEVISION as we see the words...

                               WRITTEN BY LINDA SALZMAN

           As Linda’s name appears on the screen Nick leaps off the 
           couch SCREAMING...

                                 NICK
                        There it is! Right there! 

           Linda grins and covers her face.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Credits baby! She’s got credits!

           Nick reaches for the clunky VCR CONTROLS. He hits the 
           stop button and begins to rewind the VHS tape.

                                 LINDA
                        What are you doing?

                                 NICK
                        I taped it. We’re gonna watch it 
                        again.

           Linda smiles, her face red.

                                 LINDA
                        Oh honey, it’s not that big of a 
                        deal. You don’t have to...

                                 NICK
                              (cutting her off)
                        Fuck that shit! That’s my mom! 
                        We’re watching it again!

           Linda laughs as we...

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAGAN HOME - ITHACA, NY - MORNING

           Warm morning sunlight floods the bedroom through the 
           floor to ceiling windows. 

           Annie lies in bed beneath a white sheet sifting through a 
           stack of recent mail.

           Carl stands shirtless in the adjacent master bathroom 
           shaving as he talks into his Dictaphone.

                                 CARL
                              (into Dictaphone)
                        Taking into account the new 
                        climate models, we must stress the 
                        reevaluation of this long 
                        standing, dangerously naive idea 
                        of a limited nuclear exchange. We 
                        must consider, that any nuclear 
                        exchange would ignite fires in 
                        urban centers and petroleum 
                        reserves. The density of the 
                        resulting smoke plumes would 
                        saturate the atmosphere, feasibly 
                        blocking out 99% of sunlight. The 
                        effect on the Earth’s climate 
                        would be devastating...

           Annie calls to Carl from the bed.

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        We got another one! Can you 
                        believe it?

           Carl stops his Dictaphone and sets it on the sink. 

                                 CARL
                        Another what?

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        Invitation to the Whitehouse. 
                        We’ve already said no to lunch and 
                        dinner. Do they really think 
                        brunch is what we’ve been holding 
                        out for?

           Carl steps out the bathroom wiping remnants of shaving 
           cream from his face. He smiles at Annie.

                                 CARL
                        The President of the United States 
                        has invited us to break bread.

                        entertain the idea that there 
                        could be an opportunity here?

                        They want you to change your

                        nuclear testing, Nicaragua, the 
                        war on Drugs...

                                 CARL
                        I’m aware of their motives. But 
                        perhaps, given a private audience, 
                        we could influence their 
                        perspective instead?

           Annie looks at him.

                                 ANNIE
                        Carl, the first thing they’ll do 
                        when we walk in the door is a 
                        photo-op. You and me and Ronny and 
                        Nancy smiling with mimosas. 

           Carl considers.

                                 CARL
                        You’re right.

                                 ANNIE
                        I know I’m right...

           Annie stops mid-sentence, looking at Carl.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Carl...that mark on the back of 
                        your arm, is that the same bruise?

           Carl pauses, turning his arm in an awkward position to 
           see the BRUISE-LIKE MARK on the back of his right arm. 

                                 CARL
                        I’m...I’m not sure.

                                 ANNIE
                        Honey, it’s been weeks. It 
                        should’ve healed up by now.

           Carl shrugs.

                                 CARL
                        It’s nothing. I probably just ran 
                        into something.

                        I know. But let’s get Dr. Breiman 
                        to check it out, okay?

           Carl gives Annie a reassuring smile.

                        evergreens,
                        There stood a log cabin made of

                        Where lived a country boy named

           Above the rocking dance floor a HUGE BANNER READS:

                                 “FAREWELL TO VOYAGER”

           EXT. ROOFTOP - JPL - SAME MOMENT

           Surrounded by massive RADAR DISH ARRAYS POINTED AT THE 
           HEAVENS, Carl and Annie sit beside each other on a 
           rooftop at the JPL. 

           Chuck Berry’s performance is audible in the distance as 
           Annie rests her hand on her PREGNANT BELLY.

           For a moment, Carl appears distant, lost in thought...

                                 ANNIE
                        What did NASA say?

                                 CARL
                        They won’t turn Voyager’s camera 
                        around. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Why?

                                 CARL
                        They find no scientific merit in 
                        seeing what the Earth looks like 
                        from the edge of the solar system.

                                 ANNIE
                        The merit isn’t scientific. It’s 
                        philosophical. It puts us in 
                        perspective... 

           Annie pauses mid-sentence, knowing she’s preaching to the 
           choir. She reads the distant expression on Carl’s face.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Carl? What is it? What are you 
                        thinking about?

                                 CARL
                        The Voyagers.

                                 ANNIE
                        What about them?

           Carl pauses, thinking silently. 

           After a moment, he turns and looks at her.

                                 CARL
                        Annie, I’ve spent my life 
                        searching for evidence...trying to 
                        prove we aren’t all alone in the 
                        cosmos.

           Annie listens.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Yet I spent a childhood. An 
                        education. A career. Forty years. 
                        Two marriages. Completely alone.

           Carl looks in her eyes.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        It’s you, Annie. You’re my proof.

           STARS IN THE DISTANCE...

           CLOSE ON: VOYAGER’S INSTRUMENTS, SLOWLY THE CAMERA BEGINS 
           TO PIVOT, TURNING ITS LENS ARRAY BACK TOWARD EARTH SIX 
           BILLION KILOMETERS IN THE DISTANCE.

           EXT. BACKYARD GORGE - SAGAN HOME - DAY

           A warm spring day.

           Carl and Annie sit beside each other in the forested 
           backyard. Annie holds their NEWBORN SON SAMUEL. 

           Sasha, (now 9), shrieks with laughter as she runs through 
           in the nearby woods playfully chasing Nick, (now 22) as 
           he tries to get away from her.

           Carl smiles at Sasha in the distance, then he reaches for 
           the LARGE PHOTOGRAPH resting on the table beside him.

           CLOSE ON IMAGE:  NEARLY UNDETECTABLE IN A DISTANT WASH OF 
           SUNBEAM IS A TINY, FAINT, PIXILATED BLUE DOT.

           Annie and Carl stare at the image.

                                 ANNIE
                              (re: the image)
                        Look at that. That one little dot.

           Annie looks at the innocent sleeping baby in her arms.

                                 ANNIE
                        Think about it. All the lives 
                        lost. The rivers of blood that 
                        have been spilled by all those 
                        generals and emperors...just so 
                        they could become the momentary 
                        masters of a fraction of a dot... 

           EXT. LUCIFER FALLS - OUTSIDE ITHACA - DAY

           Carl walks alone along a forested trail at LUCIFER FALLS, 
           a breathtaking chain of rocky gorges and waterfalls 
           following a rushing river. 

           Gazing at the intense natural beauty of the waterfalls 
           Carl speaks into his DICTAPHONE as he walks.

                                 CARL
                              (into Dictaphone)
                        ...Think of the endless cruelties 
                        visited by the inhabitants of one 
                        corner of this pixel on the 
                        scarcely distinguishable 
                        inhabitants of some other corner. 
                        How frequent their 
                        misunderstandings, how eager they 
                        are to kill one another...how 
                        fervent their hatreds...

           Carl, looking older in a hospital gown, holds his body 
           still in a coffin-like SCAN TUBE as A RED SCAN LIGHT 
           descends down the contours of his thin body.

                                 CARL (V.O.)
                        ...Think of our posturings, our 
                        imagined self-importance, the 
                        delusion that we have some 
                        privileged position in the 
                        universe, are challenged by this 
                        point of pale light...
           INT. CHEMOTHERAPY UNIT - TIME LAPSE -  A YEAR LATER

           Carl sits in a padded chair with numerous TUBES FLOWING 
           into his arms. 

           He looks older, thinner, and frail. His hair is 
           completely gone from chemotherapy.

                                 CARL (V.O.)
                        ...The Earth is the only world 
                        known, so far, to harbor life. 
                        There is nowhere else, at least in 
                        the near future, to which our 
                        species could migrate. Visit, yes. 
                        Settle, not yet. Like it or not, 
                        for the moment, the Earth is where 
                        we make our stand... 

           INT. THEATER STAGE - SAN FRANCISCO - A YEAR LATER

           Carl stands up at a podium delivering a speech to a 
           packed theatre of GUESTS. 

           The PALE BLUE DOT IMAGE is projected on a huge screen 
           behind him.

           Carl is bald from treatment, thin, but his delivery is as 
           eloquent as ever. 

                                 CARL
                              (to the audience)
                        ...It has been said that astronomy 
                        is a humbling and character-
                        building experience. There is 
                        perhaps no better demonstration of 
                        the folly of human conceits than 
                        this distant image of our tiny 
                        world. To me, it underscores our 
                        responsibility to deal more kindly 
                        with one another and to preserve 
                        and cherish the pale blue dot, the 
                        only home we've ever known.

           The AUDIENCE ERUPTS IN APPLAUSE as Carl carefully makes 
           his way off stage.

           INT. DINING ROOM/KITCHEN  - SAGAN HOME - EVENING

           The house is quiet.

           Carl sits at the dining room table in his bathrobe. He 
           appears tired.

           His DICTAPHONE, MANUSCRIPT PAGES, and various COMPOSITION 
           NOTEBOOKS are spread out across the tabletop.

           As he reads a document, he suddenly hears the CLINKING 
           SOUND OF A DISH and he looks up from his notebook.

           We follow his gaze to the adjacent kitchen, where he sees 
           Annie standing alone at the kitchen sink washing dishes. 
           Her back is turned away from him.

           For a long, quiet moment Carl silently watches her.

           Carl sets aside his notebook and slowly stands, crossing 
           the dining room into the kitchen.

           Without a word, Carl takes a place beside the sink with 
           Annie, gently touching the small of her back.

           We see Annie’s head tilt toward him affectionately, their 
           bodies touching as she hands him a dish to dry.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SEATTLE - MORNING

           Rain falls hard against a hospital room window as Carl 
           lies in bed.

           Carl’s body is ravaged by cancer as his vital signs are 
           monitored closely. 

           He looks up as Sasha (now 14), enters the room.

                                 CARL
                              (to Sasha)
                        Your enormous gorgeousness...

           Sasha smiles and takes his hand gently, conscious not to 
           touch the HEPARIN LOCK feeding fluids into his body.

           Carl’s voice is barely a whisper as Sasha begins to cry.

                        moment. That is the amazing thing. 
                        Think about the nearly infinite 
                        number of forks in the road that 
                        lead to any single person being 
                        born. 

           Sasha leans in, holding him.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        And I am so lucky that you are 
                        you. 

           Carl touches his forehead to Sasha’s.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        We are all connected. We really 
                        are.

           Annie sits alone with Carl as the STORM STRENGTHENS 
           OUTSIDE, PELTING THE WINDOW WITH SHEETS OF RAIN.

           Carl is GROWING CONFUSED AND AGITATED.

                                 CARL
                        Annie, there’s so much...so much I

           The storm rages outside in the darkness as CARL TREMBLES 
           VIOLENTLY IN BED, DELIRIOUS AND SOAKED IN FEVERISH SWEAT.

           ANNIE LIES BESIDE HIM, HOLDING HIS SHAKING BODY AS SHE

           EXT. TENEMENT ROOFTOP - 1942 - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

           Eight-year-old Carl stands alone on the rooftop of his 
           tenement building.

           Holding the DRAWING of TWO ASTRONAUTS IN ENVIRONMENT 
           SUITS POINTING TO THE SKY, Carl looks up at the brilliant 
           constellations as the distant lights of a million other 
           worlds reflect in his young eyes.

           IN ABSOLUTE SILENCE, A STAR EXPLODES IN A BLINDING 
           SUPERNOVA FLASH...

           THE INCREDIBLE FORCE PROPELS THE BEAUTIFUL, LUMINESCENT 
           SHOCK WAVE OUTWARD ACROSS THE EXPANSE OF SPACE.

           THEN SUDDENLY THE EXPLOSION CONTRACTS, IMPLODING ON 
           ITSELF, SUCKING ALL THE MATTER BACK INTO A CENTER MASS.

           THE ENERGY AND MATTER TWISTS ON ITSELF IN A MYRIAD OF 
           COLORS, FORMING A VAST MOLECULAR CLOUD, A STELLAR 
           NURSERY, A PLACE WHERE THINGS THAT END CAN BEGIN AGAIN.

           EXT. BACKYARD GORGE - SAGAN HOME - DAY

           Annie stands in the snowy woods looking out at the 
           forested gorge. 

           She is alone. The woods are silent as snow falls around 
           her.

           She gazes at the TWO WOODEN CHAIRS on the edge of the 
           gorge where she and Carl spent endless hours. She cannot 
           speak.

           INT. FUNERAL LIMOUSINE - ITHACA - LATER

           In the back of a LIMOUSINE, Anne wears a black dress and 
           overcoat on the way to Carl’s funeral. Annie’s arm is 
           draped around four-year-old Sam beside her. Sasha, also 
           in black, sits across from her. 

           Annie kisses Sam’s head, then looks out the window at the 
           passing frozen landscape.

           EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER

           The trees are barren.

           Blackbirds dart across the sky as Annie steps out of the 
           limousine.

           A LARGE CROWD OF MOURNERS await her arrival at the 
           cemetery.

           Annie takes her children’s hands and walks up the 
           shoveled snow path toward Carl’s grave plot...

           As Annie reaches Carl’s grave, she sees LINDA and Nick 
           (now 26) on the far side of Carl’s grave.

           Linda looks at Annie.

           There is a beat, then without a word, Linda walks around 
           in front of Carl’s grave, past the crowd of mourners and 
           STANDS BESIDE ANNIE. 

           Annie looks at her, and is about to say something WHEN 
           SHE FEELS LINDA TAKE HER HAND AND HOLD IT. 

           Tears well in Annie’s eyes as the two woman stand 
           together for all their guests and their children to see.

           Suddenly Annie SENSES SOMEONE WALK UP FROM HER BLIND 
           SIDE.

           Annie quickly turns her head and SEES TIM, now 52 years 
           old, dressed in a sharp black suit and long dark coat. 

           RITA, now 46, emerges from the crowd dressed in black. As 
           she nears she touches Annie’s shoulder, then stands 
           beside them... 

           And as the funeral begins, they all stand together, 
           shoulder to shoulder, facing the loss.

           A summer evening. Through a WARMLY LIT WINDOW WE SEE...

           Annie (63), Linda (72), Sasha (30), Sam (21), and Nick 
           (42) and Nick’s WIFE AND DAUGHTER, all sitting together 
           around a large table eating dinner.

           We cannot hear their voices, be we see their relaxed 
           laughter as they eat, drink, and share an intimate 
           evening at home with family.

           EXT. BACKYARD GORGE - SAGAN HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           As the rest of the Sagans clean up from dinner, Annie 
           walks alone out into the back yard to the edge of the 
           gorge where she and Carl always sat and thought.

           As the August breeze blows through the trees, Annie looks 
           up into the starlit heavens.

                        Stars die and are reborn. They

                        the atoms fuse together deep 
                        within them to create the oxygen
