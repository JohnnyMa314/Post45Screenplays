                     "Anything worth doing, is worth overdoing!"

                           Don Simpson, Bad Boys set (1994)
           NEW YORK CITY at night. Go fuck yourself.

                        It was 1996.

                        Bubba got caught, Tupac got 
                        shot...and The Macarena was hot. 

           CLUB

           After hours. Packed. Loud. 

           Wall-to-wall grinding. And crying (dancing was emotional). 

                                 JUNIOR VO
                        It was an epic time to be alive, 
                        and no place was hotter than NY. 

           SHOTS: 

           A fresh poster for the off-Broadway sensation “STOMP!” A 
           BROTHER in a NO FEAR baja shows off a Panasonic Kaboom Box!

                        But an epic city, had epic crime. 
                        We needed an epic cop. Enter my 
                        dad, RAY GUN: The Gun Show. 

           TRACK the backs of TWO COMMANDING MEN through the party. 
           People part like they’re Nickelback, or Moses.

                        Some say Gun Show never farted, 
                        because nothing ever escaped him...

           Walking further into this Eastbay catalog:

           A healthy DMX pounds a Zima with The Blue Man Group! A young 
           Dane Cook in Zubaz pants, chats with MTV News’ Duff in the 
           giant Jamiroquai hat! 

           Our TWO GUYS walk right through.

                        If he were alive today, Ray 
                        wouldn’t need Twitter...

           VIP SECTION 

           The real Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson -- post WHITE MEN 
           CAN’T JUMP fame. A banner reads: CATCH “THE MONEY TRAIN!”

                        Over his twenty year career, my old 
                        man made NY safe. By any means. 

           SECRET BACK ROOM 

           We finally see their faces. Meet THE MAN:

           RAYMOND “THE” GUN “SHOW” 55, think Sam Jackson from SHAFT.
           Dude is such a hero, gets double air quotes. A gold crucifix 
           medallion hangs from his neck. 

                                 JUNIOR VO
                        But even the top cop needs a 
                        partner. The Gun Show had the best 
                        rookie in the game: Harry Johnson.  

           Meet HIS PROTEGE: 

           HARRY “SON OF THE GUN SHOW” JOHNSON, think Mark Wahlberg from 
               MARKY MARK & THE FUNKY BUNCH.  

           Notched eyebrows. Lightning Bolts shaved into his hairline. 
           House Of Pain hockey jersey. Tommy overalls (one strap off). 

           They are met by -- 

           WALLACE, 30’s. Lives by the gun; dies by the gun. Mark Ecko
           hoodie. Ski goggles to the side, LL Cool J-style. 

           With Wallace is BODYGUARD RICK, 20’s, smooth, silent. ENYCE
           turtleneck with pleaded Phat Farm khakis. 

           People exchange daps, etc. 

                                 JUNIOR VO (CONT’D)
                        Everyone talked about Ray, super 
                        cop...

           Wallace slides Ray a band of $100 bills. As he counts, Ray 
           slides Wallace back a gym bag filled with cash blocks. 
                                 JUNIOR VO (CONT’D)
                        No one ever talked about Ray, super 
                        dad...but then it was too late.  

           SOUND RESTORES.

           Rick gives Harry a leather Jansport and four more like it. 
           Inside: BRICKS AND BRICKS OF COCAINE. The motherload. 

           Smiling an ONYX TOOTH. Daps around, Ray and Harry leave with 
           the score through the BACK WALK-IN FREEZER. 

           FREIGHT ELEVATOR  

           All alone now. Waiting for the lift.  

                                 RAY
                        After tonight. “The Show.” All you. 

           Harry, touched, shocked --

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        You’re ready; now I gotta get 
                        Junior ready. Make my boy a man. 

                                 HARRY
                        Stop playing.

                                 RAY
                        You two will work together someday. 
                        Be the best duo, ever. Believe me. 

                                 HARRY
                        But we run NY now! You can’t leave? 

                                 RAY
                        Junior needs me. Like you did. 

           BEAT. 

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        Until he’s ready, the show’s yours. 

           Embraces him. 

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        Make us proud. 

           Harry, processing. 

           DING. The elevator arrives -- right before the unmistakable 
           sound of a gun’s CLICK. They turn to see the passengers:  
           A CREW OF THUGS aiming guns on our guys. 

                                 WALLACE OS
                        RUN!  

           Harry and Ray turn to book it as -- BANG! 

           Wallace clutches his HEART. Blood flows from the impact 
           wound, he lands at Ray’s feet, dead. 

           IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE

           Ray throws the bags of coke into the air, Harry shoots the 
           bag rapid fire. 

           Chemicals COMBUST with gunpowder = A BALL OF FIRE ERUPTS in 
           the tight, metal space, forcing the inertia onto the gun men. 

           FIRE ALARM LIGHTS strobe. 

           SHOTS FIRE IN ALL DIRECTIONS like a disco gun convention. 

                                 RAY
                        We got set up!!! 

           Kicking the back door open, rushing into a dark alleyway. 
           FOOT CHASE up the fire escape. 

           They jump over things just to jump over them. Ray uses the 
           round house kick for everything. 

           Bullets hail from all directions. Our guys bust back, 
           reloading while LUNGING over rooftops like it’s no thing. 

           Ray pulls out TWO OFF MARKET UZI’S. Click clack. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’m about to sue NBC!

                                 RAY
                        What is it this time? 

                                 HARRY
                        Identity theft! Everyone knows, 
                        we’re the original -- 

           In sync --

                                 RAY AND HARRY
                        LAW & ORDER!!!

           Unloading. Ducking for cover. Reloading. 
                                 RAY
                        What’s the hottest show in town?

                                 HARRY
                        You don’t mean that show???

           Ray tosses Harry an Uzi, while it’s shooting in all 
           directions. Harry catches it mid-flight. No bigz. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Two tickets to --

           Standing and shooting an overwhelming, pretty much 
           unnecessary amount of hot lead everywhere -- 

                                 HARRY & RAY
                        THE GUN SHOW!!!

           In the gunfight, Harry and Ray toss each other’s Uzi to the 
           other person, power-chord sliding while catching guns. 

           (There’s absolutely no benefit to this, other than being 
           fucking rad!) Over gun shots -- 

                                 RAY
                        We gotta get off this roof STAT!

           With a wink -- they’ve been here before. 

                                 HARRY
                        The forecast calls for rain?!

                                 RAY
                        I heard there’s a chance of SNOW! 

           And with that -- they spring up -- guns out! 

                                 HARRY & RAY
                        INFORMER!!!

           Mumbling the part of the song that comes next, before --

                                 HARRY & RAY (CONT’D)
                        Ill-icky-boom-boom-n’edge!!!

           Harry turns into the Thugs gaining and unloads!!!

           Ray jumps for cover, signals, and then covers Harry, who does 
           another super elaborate maneuver, until they reach the edge: 
           10 FLIGHTS down to a STEEL DUMPSTER. 

                                 HARRY
                        About time we NYPDeee --
                                 HARRY & RAY
                         Doooo this thing!

           Ready to jump -- as Harry’s eyes see something:

           A FIGURE IN BLACK, looking up from the street, gun in hand. 
           Before they can register -- 

                                 FIGURE IN BLACK 
                        Fuck the police.

           BANG!

           Ray spins Harry and, TAKES THE BULLET FOR HIS “SON”. 

           They freefall, before CRASH LANDING into a dumpster. 

           WHAM!

           Dying. Ray and Harry lock eyes. The Black Figure looks over 
           the lid. 

                                 FIGURE IN BLACK (CONT’D)
                        Serve n’ protect now, motherfucker.  

           Empties his clip. Bolts. 

           ON our guys, bleeding to death under the full moon. Ray 
           covered Harry’s body from most of the shells. 

           Ray’s eyes flutter between life and death. Harry clutches 
           Ray’s GOLD CROSS MEDALLION. 

           SILENCE. 

           Crimson engulfs the cross, filling the screen. 

                                 JUNIOR VO
                        Ray was my pops, but I only know...

           Timed to SHOTGUN FX, three words appear to Junior’s VO:

           TITLE:      THE. GUN. SHOW.

           CREDITS (90’s Martin Show font)

           TIME LAPSE ON 125th STREET -- radically changing over 20 
           years. 

           As we do this, the tracks bleed from the past artists mixed 
           with the new: The Weekend, A$ap Rocky, Future, Tyler, etc. 
           STILL ON 125th, now a quiet, nice boulevard, lined with Jamba
           Juice, Duane Reade, Citi-bank free bike. Safer. 

           CHYRON:
                          Present day, Harlem. 

           A tinted Prius whips into frame. 

                                 JUNIOR VO (CONT’D)
                        Where Ray’s show ended, mine 
                        began...

           PRIUS -- LATE AFTERNOON 

           THREE MILLENIAL COOL GUYS smoke a cool guy VAPORIZER. Fedora 
           hats, blazers, expensive t-shirts. Super “aware.” 

           The moment is broken by RED AND BLUE FLASHING LIGHTS. 

           The DRIVER, also a Cool Guy, pulls over. The window rolls 
           down to TWO UNIFORMED AUXILIARY OFFICERS -- 

                                 JUNIOR VO
                        Filling a legend’s shoes...that no 
                        one can...

           Meet our narrator:

           TRAFFIC COP RAY GUN JR, late 30’s, a mirror image of Ray Sr. 
           but the opposite of his father. Unplugs the toaster when not 
           in use. Loves daytime running lights. Lives on the sidelines. 

           The second is ROOKIE ALISON COWIE, 20, petite and nice, but 
           ready to take a tubesock of quarters to a kneecap. Traffic 
           Division is not her endgame. 

           They have flashlights in their hands. Mace on hip. NO GUNS. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Any idea why we pulled you over?

           Cowie studies the Driver’s ID and insurance super close. 

                                 DRIVER
                        Because the day is nearly here when 
                        you’re livelihood will be replaced 
                        by drones who do a better job and 
                        save tax-payers money.   

           Stopping Junior right there. 
                                 JUNIOR
                        And...

           Millenials nod. One sips a young Thai coconut. Only young.  

                                 DRIVER
                        Chillax. The vape is tobacco. 

           Junior sees a logo on the device: LB$

                        My Lyft sign is displayed. Everyone 
                        has a seat belt. What’s the deal? 

           Junior sniffs the passenger’s FLASK. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Kumbucha. Pretty cool. 
                               (beat)
                        There’s a noise ordinance going 
                        into effect this evening. 

           Points to one of many NEW PARKING RESTRICTIONS SIGNS.

                                 DRIVER
                        You can’t police a vibe --

                        Just keep your windows up if you’re 
                        blasting muzak. Thank --  

           They peel away before he can finish. Head still up, they walk 
           back to their NYPD Nissan Leaf. 

                                 COWIE
                        Hey. So when you’re ready to take 
                        your dick out of your butt and let 
                        it hang like a dick, just shout? 

           Turning the electric engine over.

           Taps a STICKER on the dashboard that reads: 

                                 COWIE
                        Play it safe. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        We keep NY moving. A safer, cleaner 
                        city. That’s what we do.

                                 COWIE
                        We keep on getting disrespected is 
                        what we do.  

                                 JUNIOR
                        People respect the badge. They just 
                        don’t say it. Verbally.  

           No cars slow for them to enter the flow. 

                                 COWIE
                        Just put on the siren.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Section 8, paragraph 5, when not in 
                        an emergency, officers will --

                                 COWIE
                        Refrain from using issued siren.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Rules are rules. For a reason. 

           He turns over the engine. Cowie stares at her future. Just 
           another day in the life of a traffic cop...

           Cowie notices Junior’s KEY TO THE CITY MEDALLION slip over 
           his uniform. He senses her eyes. 

                                 COWIE
                        Wait...rumor’s true? 

           Gives her a “what?” look --

                                 COWIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re The Gun Show’s kid! People 
                        won’t shut the fuck up about him 
                        and Harry!

           Junior rolls his eyes. Again. 

                                 COWIE (CONT’D)
                        I heard they sued NBC and WON
                        because they named LAW & ORDER 
                        after them! 
           Tries cutting her off -- 

                                 COWIE (CONT’D)
                        Gun Show made Harlem safe! No shit! 
                        What was your Dad like? 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Never knew the man. 

           BEAT. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Only the legend. 

                                 COWIE
                        Whatever. I heard he had a one 
                        night stand -- she put that shit on 
                        her resume! Dude never used pickup 
                        lines -- just told babes “NOW!

           Junior drives. Trying not to mouth the stories he’s heard 
           since high school. 

                                 COWIE OS
                        Never did a push up his whole life; 
                        pushed the Earth down every time!

           CLOSE ON JUNIOR.

                                 COWIE OS (CONT’D)
                        He went to The Virgin Islands for 
                        one night...

           Junior, steaming -- 

                                 COWIE OS (CONT’D)
                        Now its just called “The Islands”! 

           BANG

           A locker is slammed shut. 

           NYPD LOCKER ROOM 

           Junior changes into civilian clothes. 

           A BAND OF NARC DETECTIVES come in wearing black kevlar vests, 
           Oakley’s, Fitbits. Their leader is -- 

           COMMANDER DANNY TREMONTE, 40’s. Pounds Bud heavies. Crushes 
           big puss. Rocks a hoop earring. No big deal. 
           With him is PARTNER JON PARK, 30’s. Asian. Muscle Milk. Creed 
           cologne. Tribal tattoos. 

           The Detectives cruise by Junior like he’s invisible. He is. 

           They all drink DUMBO BREWERY beers. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Beer me brother. 

                                 TREMONTE
                        Brother? You walked away from the 
                        Narc squad. That’s permanent. 

           Walking away. 

                                 PARK OS
                        And grow a fucking dick before you 
                        talk to us, traffic bitch. 

           The other guys crack fresh beers from several 6-PACKS. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Cool. I gotta family thing... 

           Junior looks into his locker. We see a picture of he and a 
           woman, kissing on their wedding:

           This is BONNIE, late 30’s, fire. More on that later. 

           In the back, barely visible, is an old NY POST clipping 
           headlining his father’s death and Harry, landed into a coma. 

           ANGLE ON PAPER: 

           LEGENDARY TOP COP AND STAR PROTEGE GUNNED DOWN. 

           A CITY MOURNS. NO SUSPECTS. 

           Junior whispers to the picture of his DAD receiving the KEY 
           TO THE CITY, next to Harry, hugging him like his own son. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Something I always wanted to ask 
                        you pops: was it worth it? 

           Moment broken by -- 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (O.S.)
                        Junior! Fuck in here!
           CHIEF’S OFFICE

           Junior enters to: 

           CHIEF BARBARA HALLS, Queen Latifah old school. Probably has 
           cancer and doesn’t give a fuck; already gave her fucks away. 

           She tosses Junior a dossier. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        I like my steak: well done, kid.

           Junior surveys the dossier: a TRANSFER ASSIGNMENT. SUBURBS. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        West Chester. Mecca for Traffic 
                        Cops. 

           She smiles. Junior does not. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        This is what you wanted. 
                               (standing)
                        You’re the best traffic cop in the 
                        district. You want out of the city -
                        - this is it.  

                                 JUNIOR
                        ...What’s the catch?

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        Look around. Harlem’s crime rate is 
                        at an all-time low. 

           She looks outside the window to a homogenized 125th St. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        We’re being distributed to other 
                        precincts. 

           She sips the wrong coffee mug and takes a mouth of cigarette 
           ash. Doesn’t flinch. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Close one more violation, you’re in 
                        the suburbs. 

           Junior looks around the Chief’s office. Sees a DUSTY BRONZE 
           PLAQUE with his father’s face. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Listen: I trained your ‘ol man, but 
                        the city doesn’t need another Gun 
                        Show. His era is done.
           BEAT. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been in my precinct for 
                        twelve years. You earned this. 

           The phone rings. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Your dad would’ve wanted this for 
                        you. 

           Off Junior, divided. 

           CORONA QUEENS

           A middle-class neighborhood with actual hardware stores, 
           grocers, and butchers. Family run places. 

           Junior exits the train platform in civilian clothes: wide Dad 
           cut jeans, baggy polo shirt. 

           Without hesitation, helps an OLD WOMAN carry some heavy shit. 

           Junior nods to the usuals in the hood. Knows these people. Is 
           one of them. More respected without his uniform and badge. 

           Junior tries to block some KIDS shot and rolls his ankle. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        All good. Just a twist. 

           Plays it cool. Sort of.  

           TIGHT APARTMENT

           A DINNER TABLE is nicely set for a family dinner. It’s 
           “fusion”. Junior smells -- winces, but --  

                                 JUNIOR (PRE-LAP)
                        Can someone point me toward flavor 
                        country?

           Junior kisses his loving wife BONNIE, 40, pretty, fire 
           within. Bonnie sets a raw salad down. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Found it! Hello!

           Enter:
           KIM, 13, good kid who sneaks out at night. Her fake ID that 
           actually works. Mile-a-minute. 

           They say Grace quietly and start eating. Junior sits AC 
           Slater-reverse chair style. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        ‘Sup at school?

                                 KIM
                        Justine’s pregnant. Mike told the 
                        whole school at assembly it wasn’t 
                        his because you can’t impregnate 
                        someone’s mouth. 

           She eats salad. Junior kind of chokes. 

                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        That’s what’s up. It’s true. 

                                 BONNIE
                        And not dinner conversation. 

                                 KIM
                        You asked. Oh, and some kid from 
                        India brought a clock in and the 
                        police were called in. It was just 
                        a clock. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        I’m having a word with the 
                        principal. 

                                 KIM
                        She’s the one who called it in. We 
                        were sent to Wendy’s for three 
                        hours until the campus was cleared. 

           Junior and Bonnie look at each other, “wtf”...

                                 BONNIE
                        SO, Sunday is our monthly family 
                        day. Ideas? 

           Kim exhales. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        We could head into the city and go 
                        ice skating. 

                                 KIM
                        Ice skating is for homosexuals. 
                                 JUNIOR
                        Hey! That’s not OK to say!

                                 BONNIE
                        I hate ice skating.   

                                 JUNIOR
                        Not helping Bonnie. 

                                 KIM
                        Trevor’s step-dad’s throwing a 
                        rager. Word is he’s gonna butt-chug  
                        a bottle of Fireball for $100 -- 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Kim! This is a family table. 

           Kim mouths the next words. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Growing up, I never had family 
                        meals, because my parents weren’t 
                        around. 
                               (beat)
                        You can tell us anything -- 

                                 KIM
                        But...

                                 JUNIOR
                        As your father, something’s might 
                        be better just, kept inside...

                                 KIM
                        I’m not repressing my feelings Dad. 
                        Look at what happened to you? Wound 
                        so tight if you sneezed you’d spray 
                        shit out your mouth. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        KIM!

           Looses it. 

                                 KIM
                        OH LOOK WHO LOST HIS SHIT AGAIN!

           He SLAMS THE TABLE in anger. Face red. Sweating profusely. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        I AM BEING PUSHED INTO A BOX AND 
                        I WILL REACT WHEN PROVOKED!
                                 KIM
                        WHICH IS WHY YOU’RE SO REPRESSED 
                        AND SWEATY! 

           Bonnie holds her head. 

                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        You want this to be an open house, 
                        start by being open yourself. 

           She stands and leaves. They sit for a moment. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        She’s out of control. 

                                 BONNIE
                        She’s not wrong. 

           Junior starts cleaning up. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        You don’t seem...happy. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        I’m happy with everything in my 
                        life. I love you and Kim.  

                                 BONNIE
                        Not talking about us. I mean you. 
                        You’re happy with you? 

           He thinks. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Kim and I can’t be happy...

           Kisses him, holds his big, sweet face in her hands. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        When you’re not.  

           BEDROOM

           They’re both on iPads. Bonnie smiles, and turns her off. 
           Cuddles up to him. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        I should have said something 
                        earlier. Came out wrong. 

           Kisses his cheek. 
                                 JUNIOR
                        You’re right. I gotta shake things 
                        up. Starting with... 

           Slides her the DOSIER from the Precinct. As she reads --

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        West Chester. 

           Her eyes light up. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        One more cleared citation, we’re 
                        outta Queens. 

           The gravity of things hits her. It’s happening. 

                                 BONNIE
                        So proud of you. 

           He smiles. Half assed. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        It’s everything I’ve worked for. 
                              (beat)
                        And...I don’t want it. 

           News to her. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        I went to the same Academy as my 
                        dad. Did NARC training. SWAT 
                        training. Worked for the same 
                        chief...but I’ve done nothing 
                        compared to what he did. 

                                 BONNIE
                        Correct. You’re dad left you and 
                        treated you’re mom like shit. He 
                        wasn’t there for you. 

           BEAT. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re a better man than he was. 

           Means every word. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Then why do I need to prove that. 

                                 BONNIE
                        To who?!
           Stands. A passion washes over his face. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        To ME. Go into the night with 
                        nothing but a gun and a partner.

           Walking around the room with conviction --

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Live in the now. 

                                 BONNIE
                        You’re seriously envious of your 
                        father? 

           Looks at himself in the mirror. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        I hate saying it: he made the city 
                        safer. 

                                 BONNIE
                        But that was then!

                                 JUNIOR
                        Now I police rideshare programs!

                                 BONNIE
                        You make the city better, because 
                        you actually care about people!

           Has a point there. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Think about what you want, because 
                        they might be a legend, but Ray was 
                        never a good father. You are. 

           Leaving this there for the moment. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe it’s best to forget him. Not 
                        like Ray remembered to be there for 
                        you...

           Junior climbs into bed, holds his wife, just a moment between 
           them -- conveying she’s right. Finally, he shuts his eyes...

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           ANOTHER PAIR OF EYES SHOOT OPEN

           Red! Angry! Awesome! 
           ASSUME THEIR POV

           We look right up at the ceiling. Then around a hospital room. 

           We sit up, pulling a series of IV cords from our arm, stumble 
           to the floor, then across to a window. 

           An OLDER HARRY looks back at us. 

           ALIVE...

           Harry looks down to see a mean OLD BLACK DICK where his YOUNG 
           WHITE DICK used to swing. “NYPD” is tattoo’d on the shaft. 

           Harry looks up, clutches his heart, and sexually fixes his 
           eyebrows. 

           A CELL RINGS BEDSIDE

           After a few buzzes, Chief Halls answer, half-awake. 

           Her eyes shoot up. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        Say...that...shit...again...

           Totally serious --

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Give him a six pack of Colt .45, 
                        pack of Newport 100’s, and every 
                        sedative you’ve got. 

           She cocks a bedside pistol. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be there in thirty. 

           She hangs up. Turns to her HUSBAND DAVE, 60. Kind of guy who 
           fucks pretty hard. Doesn’t say much. Has a mustache. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Never thought he’d come back... 

           Dave raises an eyebrow.

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Twenty years ago, the second most 
                        feared cop in NYC’S heart stopped. 

           She grabs a dusty pair of brass knuckles, crushes a Midol and 
           mixes it with an E-mergency packet. 
                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        That man’s heart just started 
                        again; God just fucked us.   

           Slams the concoction. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Harry Johnson is back. 

           She looks scared. 

                                 DOCTOR PRELAP
                        We gave him everything you said!

           HOSPITAL HALLWAY

           Chief Halls is escorted by DOCTORS and POLICE OFFICERS.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Substances only angered him!

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        You’re talking about a man who was  
                        once bitten by a rattlesnake. After 
                        five days of brutal pain, the snake 
                        finally died...

           BEAT. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        We need to hurry! 

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        There’s more. Harry then sucked the 
                        venom back out of the snake.
                        Brought it back to life, out of 
                        respect. Then the snake sucked the 
                        venom out of Harry. For two weeks, 
                        they kept each other alive on 
                        nothing but deadly venom. Passing 
                        it back-n-forth, under the stars. 

           Wipes a single tear. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Harry carried that snake all the 
                        way to the Zoo, where it started 
                        telling the story to other snakes. 
                        Word spread...

           BEAT. 
                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Now, in snake holes around the 
                        world, snakes tell snake children 
                        at snake Thanksgiving about the 
                        legend of “Harry Johnson”, just so 
                        they don’t go biting the wrong 
                        motherfucker. 

           She pulls out a SIX PACK from a brown bag. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Ten years later, a random snake bit 
                        Harry in the ass. Snake froze, 
                        apologized, and then committed 
                        snake suicide. Poison fears Harry.

           BEAT. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        ...He’ll only speak to you. 

           REACHING A DOOR 

           Everyone backs up. Chief Halls nods. 

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Alcohol did nothing to slow his 
                        heart rate. Stomach pump failed. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        Doc, this cop doesn’t throw up.

           Cracking a beer. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        He only THROWS DOWN!

           Hitting the beer. 

           HARRY’S ROOM

           In the back, facing away, smoking a cigarette, with an open 
           gown, is our man. Harry fucking Johnson. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        Wondering why I kept you on ice?

           Nothing.   

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Doc’s gave you 1% chance of 
                        survival. I said shit, that’s more 
                        than you had when we met. 
           Nothing. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        I kept you plugged in because 1% of 
                        Harry Johnson scares criminals in 
                        this city more than 99% of the cops 
                        wearing a badge right now.   

           He turns to her, slowly. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Men fear you. Even in a coma. And, 
                        you deserve revenge. 

           Steps closer. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        But months turned into years. Years 
                        into decades. It’s a different NYPD
                        now. Revenge isn’t served the same. 
                        It’s for the better.  

           Harry rotates his head, ever-so-slowly. Looks dead at Halls. 
           Harry’s hair is still perfectly Vanilla Ice-style. 

                                 HARRY
                        They gave me Ray’s dick. 

           He turns. It’s full frontal. Chief Halls makes a face.

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        You sure? 

                                 HARRY
                        Says NYPD on the side. New York 
                        Pounding Department. 

           It does.  

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        Yep...Welcome back kid. 

                                 HARRY
                        Kid? I’m 40 years old. 

           He just stares around, lost, angry. Confused. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        The Gun Show was murdered.  

           Chief’s face says it all. Yes.  

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Man gave his life for me. 
                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        And dick. 

                                 HARRY
                        And middle finger. 

           He’s also got an older, wrinkled black middle finger.

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        He loved you like a son. 

           Harry sheds a single tear. Catches it with his tongue. 

                                 HARRY
                        Chief, I need two things: my shield 
                        and his guns. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        That night. What do you remember?

                                 HARRY
                        We were working the Caviar Cartel. 
                        Wallace finally got us to the 
                        supplier. Hit the motherload, then 
                        we got buttfucked. IT WAS A SET UP. 

           Exhaling twenty years of pain. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Someone made off with two mill in 
                        product. Left us for dead.

           Harry cracks another Colt 45 and shotguns the thing. Not a 
           drip spills. It wouldn’t dare. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        No witnesses. 

                                 HARRY
                        You should have made some. 
                               (exhales smoke from before)
                        Whole case was off the books. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        We let you down. 

                                 HARRY
                        No. I let Ray down. Now I will 
                        solve this case. Chief: I need my 
                        gun and my shield. Now.  

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        Welcome to 2016. 
           Chief Halls opens the curtains to a panorama view of NYC from 
           Bellevue Hospital. Buildings punch clouds. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        You and Ray, that time, the shit
                        you guys pulled off...that’s twenty 
                        years in the rearview. 

           Puts a hand on his shoulder. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        No gun. No shield. Not until you 
                        get up to current procedures, pass 
                        an Internal Affairs test. 

           Harry crushes a can. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        To pass that test, you’ll need a 
                        2016 NYPD crash course. ...I got 
                        the perfect poster boy to help you.

                                 HARRY
                        You give me a partner, I’ll give 
                        you a widow. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        Think of Junior as a cultural 
                        guide. Follow his lead, you’ll pass 
                        Internal Affairs review. 

                                 HARRY
                        Fuck IA. I’m ready to go now.  

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        Your badge is in IA’s hands. I’ll 
                        send Junior to get you in the 
                        morning to show you around 2016.  

           Leaves A CASE FILE. His murder case. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Off the record. Have a look. 

           Harry takes the file. 

                                 HARRY
                        You said Junior...

           Halls turns back. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Was his pop’s on the force? 
           Chief Halls gives nothing. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        You be the judge of that. 

           Letting the door shut behind him. Harry takes a long BEAT to 
           collect his thoughts. Closes his eyes. 

                                 HARRY
                        Won’t let you down Ray. 

           Catches the reflection of Ray’s old black dick off the 
           window. Talking to the dick, like a gravestone. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I’m about t make it rain, Gun Show-
                        style. 

           Looks out over NYC alive and kicking. The pulse of 
           opportunity. The heart of hustle. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        NY better be ready for the return 
                        of this Son Of A Gun...

           The city night scape time-dissolves to a new day -- 

                                 HARRY VO
                        Because I ain’t asking.

           HOSPITAL ENTRANCE 

           Next morning. 

           Junior cruises up in the Hyundai leaf cop car dressed in 
           civilian clothes. Whistling nervously. 

           HOSPITAL DOOR 

           Junior sips a green tea. Does a breathing exercise. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Just be yourself. 

           Enters -- 

           HOSPITAL ROOM 

           Beer cans everywhere. Overflowing ashtrays. 
                                 JUNIOR
                        Good morning Detective.

           Looks around. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           The door closed behind him. Harry swings from it. Silently. 
           He’s wearing a House Of Pain hockey jersey.

                                 HARRY OS
                        BANG-YOU’RE-FUCKING-DEAD! 

           Suddenly, Harry puts Junior in a Cross-face choke hold. 

                                 HARRY
                        Gun Show rule #1: Never enter a 
                        room without knowing who’s inside. 

           Junior raises an eyebrow. What?

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Rule #2: never say the word 
                        “detective” in public. 

           Junior cannot breathe. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Rule #3: I ain’t your partner. You 
                        earn that.  

           Releasing Junior, who is OUT FUCKING COLD. Slams his head 
           into a wall. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Wait...

           Looks at Junior. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Rule #4: You look like someone I 
                        know...

           Sees the CROSS MEDALLION NECKLACE. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        (lightning bolt) That’s The Gun 
                        Show’s!

           Releasing him. Junior COUGHS TO LIFE 
                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Rule #5: Should’ve said something 
                        man. Your pops was my pops. Taught 
                        me everything I know. 

           Junior exhales. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I expected someone...more...like
                        me. You’re really Ray’s kid? 

           Junior nods. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        He didn’t mention me?

                                 HARRY
                        One time. Before he died. Said 
                        something about you becoming a man. 
                        Wanted to be there for you. 

           Junior, floored.  

                                 JUNIOR
                        He really said that? 

                                 HARRY
                        He also used to say when he entered 
                        a room, he never turned the lights 
                        on. Ray turned the dark, off. 

           BEAT. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Harry Johnson. 

           They shake. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Ray Gun. Junior.  

           OLD SCHOOL MEETS NEW SCHOOL.

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Status check: Chief made this 
                        assignment my last one before I get 
                        transferred out. 

           Takes a sip of Tazo tea. Harry knocks it away. 

                                 HARRY
                        And I need you to get me through IA 
                        so Chief Halls can get me my gun 
                        back. Solve Ray’s murder. 
           Opens the door. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Correct. We have 72 hours before 
                        the exam. I’m here to get you out 
                        of 1996 and into 2016. Let’s begin. 

           Slides him a THICK BINDER with 20 years of world events. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Everything you need, right there. 
                        Start with 9/11, jump to the Ipod -- 

           Harry drops the binder on the ground, drops his pants, and, 
           without using his hands, pisses all over the book. 

           Junior watches. In shock. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Do you have a...black weiner? 

                                 HARRY
                        I know I don’t have time for some 
                        whack ass history lesson. 

           Harry holsters a Motorola Startac phone, a Diva Pager, and 
           RAY’S TWO GUNS under a shoulder holster. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I can feel it: your father’s killer 
                        is out there. Fill me on the fly. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        To the station we go!

           Standing an inch from Junior’s nose. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’m alive by a miracle. My job is 
                        to use that miracle and make people 
                        pray, for their own miracle. 

           Crushes the same beer can a third time.  

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        The only crooks’s who can get away 
                        now are the one’s who became 
                        astronauts. 
                               (beat)
                        After I’m done killing here, I’ll 
                        build a space ship, find them, and 
                        kill them in orbit because they 
                        fucked with the wrong cop!
           Punching the wall. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        ...I just need to get you into the 
                        station; and up to speed.  

                                 HARRY
                        We’re not going anywhere, but back 
                        to the scene of the crime. 

           HOSPITAL ENTRANCE 

           Harry exits, lights a match. Swipes a pack of cigarettes from 
           a CANCER PATIENT. Junior races after him -- 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Listen Encino Man: follow the 
                        rules, and we get through this. 
                        Fail; you’re in a psych word. 

                                 HARRY
                        Where’s your ride?

           Junior motions to the hybrid Hyundai. Beep beep. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        55 MPG. 60 with tail winds. 

           Opens the passenger door, but Harry casually grabs a LARGE 
           ROCK and -- SMASHES THE PASSENGER’S WINDOW. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck did the window do to 
                        you?

                                 HARRY
                        It got in the way of my rock. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Ground rules! This is my issued 
                        sedan -- which is in my command -- 

                                 HARRY
                        Rule #7 -- know your role...

           In one move, Harry grabs Junior’s MACE and sprays him in the 
           eyes, pulls his shirt over his head, punches his thorax, and 
           tosses him through the broken window to the back seat. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Or I will slow your role.   
           Harry turns over the silent engine, and tries to floor it to 
           no avail. They cruise in e-silence. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        You’re a cop in the greatest city 
                        on Earth. Act like it.

           Cutting cars off, putting the sirens on while lightning a 
           cigarette. Points a gun at someone to pass them. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        You got a mix tape up in here?

                                 JUNIOR
                        STOP THE CAR!

                                 HARRY
                        I’ll pit stop the car when were at 
                        my place. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Where?

                                 HARRY
                        Spanish Harlem. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Bonnie and I lived there.  

                                 HARRY
                        Bonnie? Like a woman Bonnie? 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Yes. Exactly like a woman Bonnie. 

                                 HARRY
                        Thought you had sex with men who 
                        have sex with men in cages.

           Driving WAY TOO FAST. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        PLEASE SLOW DOWN.

                                 HARRY
                        So, you got a shorty. I pound 
                        wives. Kids?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Kim. 16. Why I need to get you to 
                        pass the test: so we can move her 
                        out of this place. 
                                 HARRY
                        Why would anyone LEAVE the city?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Priced out. Everything became a 
                        chain. It’s not the same city you 
                        left behind. 

           Harry comes to a 180 DEGREE spin stop across 2nd AVENUE. 

           Harry looks up at an apartment building that hasn’t been 
           hosed off since 1996. This is hood that never got “hip”. 

           Harry smiles. Breathes in garbage. Closes his eyes. 

                                 HARRY
                        Just like home. 

                                 JUNIOR OS
                        Isn’t this actually home?

           A DOOR IS KICKED IN

           Harry and Junior enter Harry’s pad. 

                                 HARRY
                        Welcome back.  

           Basically Arsenio Hall’s place from COMING TO AMERICA, after 
           he spends the Prince’s money.

                                 JUNIOR
                        I’ve never been here. 

                                 HARRY
                        Wasn’t talking to you. 

           Everything is The Sharper Image. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I was welcoming myself back to my 
                        apartment, on behalf of my 
                        apartment. 

           Harry flips a coffee table to reveal a floor safe. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        If we’re gonna roll on some fools, 
                        need to get the drop on them. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Say that again in present speak.

           Opens the steel panels to a cache of AFTER MARKET FIREARMS. 
                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        How’d you get a permit for an uzi?  

           Harry drops his pants. 

                                 HARRY
                        They gave me your dad’s dick. 

           Junior, stopped. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        And his dick, it has a little dick
                        under it. That dick, the second 
                        quiet, hidden dick, is still bigger 
                        than your dick. Sack UP. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        You have my dad’s dick?  

           Harry tosses Junior a MAC-10. Junior drops it. 

                                 HARRY
                        How many men have you killed? 

           Junior sees an open bag of SHOTGUN BUCK SHOT. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        I’m auxilary. 

           Harry doesn’t follow. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        We don’t carry arms. 

                                 HARRY
                        Serious? Traffic? 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Did SWAT and NARC, then we had a 
                        daughter. Made the right call. 

           Harry scratches his balls. 

                                 HARRY
                        The Gun’s Show’s boy works traffic? 
                        You could pick any division with 
                        his name. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Why I did this on my own. Without 
                        his name.  
                                 HARRY
                        Your ‘ol man would kill if he was 
                        here --

                                 JUNIOR
                        But he’s NOT HERE. Is he?

           BEAT. 

                                 HARRY
                        ...You got your dad’s temper.

                                 JUNIOR
                        I got nothing from my dad. 

           Harry studies the file. 

                                 HARRY
                        Research trip. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        No. We’re going to the station. 

                                 HARRY
                        We’re going to stop you from being 
                        such a huge dry pussy. 

           Harry slides his shield over his shirt with a gold chain, 
           Training Day-style. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Knew the man or not, he’s your 
                        father, and he was murdered. We 
                        gotta make that right. 

           Opens the door, beer in hand -- 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Family is all that matters.   

           Junior reluctantly, slowly, shakes his head. His phone buzzes 
           with a new text. 

               Bonnie: what’s he like? 

               Junior: insane! why did the Chief assign him to me???

           The phone is slapped out of his hand. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I need you to tell Chief I’m 
                        playing by the book. Got it? 

           BEAT. 
                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Do this one thing for me, I’ll 
                        behave. Pass that test for you. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Deal. 

           Harry smiles a gold-tooth grin. Winks. Twice. Junior winks 
           back. Harry’s smiles fades. 

                                 HARRY
                        Fuck are you winking at?

                                 JUNIOR
                        I thought --

                                 HARRY
                        Don’t wink at me. Ever. 

           Pushes Junior aside to reveal a FLOOR TO CEILING MIRROR. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Before I leave and face the 
                        unknown, I always wink at myself, 
                        because it might be the last time 
                        anyone does. And I look good. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        That’s really self-centered. 

                                 HARRY
                        The only center that matters, is 
                        self.  

           He loads a HOLLOW POINT bullet into Ray Senior’s hand cannon. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get this Gun Show on the 
                        road. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        What does that mean? 

           Harry smiles. 

                                 HARRY
                        Means let’s go practice something 
                        called Not Gun Control. 

           Can’t help himself. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Not Gun Control? 
                                 HARRY
                        What your pops called Gun Out Of 
                        Control. Get ready.  

                                 JUNIOR
                        Definitely not ready. At all. 

                                 HARRY
                        Correct. I’ll tell you when you’re 
                        ready. 

           Harry is perfectly still. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Am I looking for a signal? 

                                 HARRY
                        First stop: scene of the crime. See 
                        who remembers what. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        From twenty years ago? Not only is 
                        Harlem completely different but no 
                        one will remember what happened!

           After a brain freeze, dead pan -- 

                                 HARRY
                        I got ways to make people remember. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        ...How?

                                 HARRY
                        I didn’t cheat death. I won death, 
                        to settle this. Junior: what are we 
                        about to settle?

           Off Junior -- freaked. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        This... 

                                                               JUMP TO:

           125TH ST & LENOX

           The Hyundai comes to a skid stop from across four lanes of 
           traffic. 

           Harry exits the driver’s side door with the vehicle still in 
           motion, like he’s in a movie trailer. 
           SLO MO -- he pulls out two GUNS from under his jacket and 
           points them at:

           A LESBIAN DOG WALKER

           Screams! Dives for cover. 

           The dogs go flying off leash and attack a Postmates guy on a 
           moped, who crashes into a line of parked Citi bicyles, which 
           in turn slam into a farm-to-table food truck. 

           Harry looks around -- 

                                 HARRY
                        What the shit is this?

           Junior exits after putting the lights on. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        This is Harlem. 

           Harry looks around. Confused. Points to a GELATO SHOPPE. 

                                 HARRY
                        That used to be a safe house. 

                                 JUNIOR (WHISPERS) 
                        Killer pistach’. 

           Harry points to a Jamba Juice across the street. 

                                 HARRY
                        Killed my first perp right there. 

           Harry looks around -- at a loss. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Lost my virginity over there. 

           It’s a dirty bus stop. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        That’s probably the same. 

                                 HARRY
                        What happened to Harlem?  

           THREE COLUMBIA STUDENTS on those hoverboard Segway things 
           whip by. Junior puts a hand on Harry’s shoulder. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        WE have a job to do: get you up to 
                        speed to get myself transferred. 
                               (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JUNIOR (CONT'D)
                        You wanted to see the crime scene. 
                        Here it is; now it’s time to go. 

           Pulls out his Startac phone. 

                                 HARRY
                        Time find out who saw what that 
                        night.

           He hears the OUT OF SERVICE automated voice on the other end. 
           Harry dials like ten numbers. All have been changed or 
           disconnected. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Guessing heads had to change phones 
                        or something. 

                                 JUNIOR OS
                        It would mean a lot if you at least 
                        tried to speak modern English? 

           Harry realizes the Startac itself isn’t connected. Junior 
           hands him an iPhone. 

                                 HARRY
                        You on the take? How the fuck can 
                        you afford something like this? 

           He is mesmerized. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Look at Dick Tracy! Dialling a 
                        number from his contacts --

           Junior cuts him off. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Wait. Technically, no one knows 
                        your alive and back. 

           Harry looks up, intrigued. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Maybe it’s in your interest to stay 
                        “dead”. Easier to find who killed 
                        my old man if no one knows your 
                        coming for them. 

           Harry smiles. 

                                 HARRY
                        Shit...The Gun Show had a boy after 
                        all. Smart kid too. 
           Junior blushes. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Cops don’t blush. Let’s check in 
                        with an old informant: Big Cheese. 
                        Runs 159th street projects. 

           Junior shakes his head. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Last stop, then right to the 
                        station. My word. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Last stop. 

           With a nod and a wink -- 

                                 HARRY
                        Always bet on black.

           He hops in the passenger’s seat. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        PASSENGER 57? Really?

                                 HARRY
                        What?

                                 JUNIOR
                        The movie. That’s Wesley Snipes’ 
                        line. Always bet on black. Guy’s a 
                        cop on a plane. Goes to the can and 
                        saves the day or something. 

           Harry is pissed. 

                                 HARRY
                        That’s my idea! I told Wesley 
                        Snipes at the MONEY TRAIN party.  
                        He shitted on it. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        So it goes. 

                                 HARRY
                        ...Don’t tell me he did the other 
                        one about the cop who’s unfrozen 
                        from a cyrogenic jail to stop the 
                        killer who framed him? 

           Junior just looks at Harry. 
                                 JUNIOR
                        DEMOLITION MAN? 

           Harry fumes. 

                                 HARRY
                        When I see Snipes, I’m gonna choke 
                        his ass out with one hand while my 
                        free hand takes a Polaroid of him 
                        confessing to stealing my shit.  

           Junior drives uptown on Riverside Drive. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        God, don’t tell me he did the one 
                        about the cop who shows up for a 
                        murder at the White House?

           BEAT. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        MURDER AT 1600... 

           Harry punches the window --

                                                               JUMP TO:

           SOUTH BRONX 

           No hipsters here. A catacomb of 6-storey buildings that went 
           up in the 80’s and haven’t been updated since. 

           LOOK OUT KIDS circle on dirt bikes.

           ALLEY ACROSS THE STREET 

           The Hyundai comes to a stop across the street. 

                                 HARRY
                        You’re positive this BLADE movie is 
                        about a half-mortal, half-immortal 
                        who’s trying avenge his mother and 
                        kill vampires? 100%?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Daywalkers. Yup. 

           Harry chambers a bullet. 

                                 HARRY
                        You know how to pack? 
                                 JUNIOR
                        Of course...Pack a flashlight and a 
                        badge of common sense. Everyday. 

           Harry stares at him. Lost. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        But we’re not going in there 
                        without backup. Period. 

                                 HARRY
                        If those kids see some cops show 
                        up, we’ll blow our informant. Leave 
                        the car, follow my lead, don’t say 
                        shit. They smell COP, we’re FUCKED. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        NO. I made a promise to Bonnie when 
                        I walked from NARC division...I
                        won’t put my life on the line 
                        unless it’s absolutely necessary.  

                                 HARRY
                        Bonnie your girl?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Wife. I already told you. 

                                 HARRY
                        Thought you were lying. You 
                        actually have sex with a woman?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Why do you keep asking that? 

                                 HARRY
                        Just that you look like someone 
                        that has sex with dudes who have 
                        sex with dudes in cages. 

           Junior tries to follow Harry. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Relax: this is what I do. Two 
                        minutes. Tops.  

           Harry POWER STRUTS across the street. Junior walks like he’s 
           corking a turd. One hand on his MACE hip holster. Trying to 
           look “natural”. 

           A bad pairing. 
           BASKETBALL COURT 

           Harry and Junior roll in. Harry mugs the place, looking 
           convincingly “hard”. 

           A PACK OF TEEN HOODS spot ‘em. KID, 15, whistles twice. 

                                 KID
                        DT! DT! 

           Harry exhales. 

                                 HARRY
                        Shit. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        What?

                                 HARRY
                        They spotted you. I got this. 

           They approach the kids who stand in a small circle. Some sit 
           on dirt bikes. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you calling DT?

           The kids look at Harrys get up. 

                                 KID
                        Y’all shooting a throwback video or 
                        something? Looking real NOT-so-
                        Fresh Prince!

                                 HARRY
                        Not-so funny. I grew up here. This 
                        is my, cousin. He’s...from Maine. 

           Junior waves. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t fucking wave. 
                               (to the Kids) 
                        Say we’re cops again I’m about to 
                        set it off. 

           Harry motions like he’s carrying a gun. Kids are confused. 

                                 KID
                        You look like melted Vanilla Ice. 

                                 KID 2
                        Is that a Starter jacket?  
           Pointing to Harry’s outfit. Harry smiles, whispers to Junior. 

                                 HARRY
                        Classic insult battle. Watch and 
                        learn. 

           Harry walks up to the Main Kid. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Know why E.T. Liked Reeces Pieces 
                        so much?

           None of the Kids do. Harry points to the Fat Kid. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cuz they taste the same as cum on 
                        his planet. Bong! 

                                 KIDS & JUNIOR 
                        Wait/what/huh? 

           Harry whispers to Junior. 

                                 HARRY
                        Get ‘em off balance first. Then hit 
                        ‘em with the old school: Yo Mama...

           Harry walks up the Kid. Sizes him up. Flips off his jacket. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Yo Mama so poor...ducks throw 
                        bread...at her!

           The kids don’t react. To another Kid -- 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Yo Mama so ugly, Santa came down 
                        the chimney, took a look, and said 
                        ho ho hooooollly shit that bitch is 
                        busted!!! 

           He throws off his Kangol hat into traffic.  

                                 KID
                        What? 

                                 HARRY
                        I said, Yo Mama like a Christmas 
                        tree, everyone hangs some balls on 
                        her! Get off me!

           The Kids stand up. Angry. 

           Harry goes to give Junior a pound and they totally miss. 
           Harry gets in another Kid’s face --

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        And you, Yo Mama like a bag of 
                        chips -- FREE TO LAY! I got jokes! 

           Harry is really feeling it. Random PEOPLE stop and stare. 
           Some with phones out. Shooting this disaster. 

           Harry goes one-by-one, rapid fire to the teens --

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Yo Mama so poor, bitch takes the 
                        trash IN! Boom shake the room!

           Gradually, all the kids stand and circle Harry and Junior. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Yo Mama so nasty, she got more clap 
                        than an auditorium! She nasty! 

           Junior tries to motion for him to stop. Harry stands on a 
           bench and really gets in the Kid’s face. Like an inch away. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        And yo Mama -- she’s like a hockey 
                        player. Only showers after three 
                        periods! All day boy! All day!

           Right in his grill. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Now who you calling five-o, Kris 
                        Kross?!

           After a LONG BEAT, the Kid bursts into tears. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        What...

                                 KID
                        My mom’s obese. 
                              (wiping tears)
                        We try to keep a balanced diet but 
                        it’s hard man. Over-eating is a 
                        cycle. She works everyday to beat  
                        it; you just reminded me how mean 
                        people can be. 

           All the Kid’s are super upset, console each other. 

                                 HARRY
                        ...My bad. 
           Kid #2 approaches, holding back his own tears. 

                                 KID #2
                        My mother’s trying to make ends 
                        meet but you know how it is for the 
                        middle-class out here. Tax cuts for 
                        the 1% won’t grow this economy. 
                        Thanks for treating us like second 
                        class citizens, asshole.   

           Harry realizes he just roasted a bunch of really young kids. 

                                 KID #3
                        My mom’s sexual past is her 
                        business. Who are you to judge?

           ALL THE KIDS ad-lib, in tears. 

                                 HARRY
                        It’s just shit talking. It’s cool. 

                                 KID
                        No. Bullying isn’t cool. 

                                 HARRY
                        Then what are you kids doing out 
                        here, clocking? 

           The kids unzip their bags: soft, plush, pashmina blankets.  

                                 KID
                        Boober.

                                 HARRY & JUNIOR
                        Boober?

                                 KID
                        Uber for blankets. Boober!

                                 JUNIOR 
                        That’s a really good idea.   

                                 HARRY
                        What is a boober? 

                                 KID
                        Say someone gets a little chilly, 
                        hit the app, boom, we ride over 
                        with a warm blanket. Boober. 

           The kids rev their delivery mopeds. 
                                 KID (CONT’D)
                        Making NYC warmer, one Boober at a 
                        time.  

                                 HARRY
                        Your clocking blankets? 

           Junior steps in --

                                 JUNIOR
                        Forgive my cousin. He’s from 
                        Boston. Racism is allowed there.  

           Junior gets Harry away from the growing audience. 

                                 HARRY
                        What just happened?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Two decades have happened! You 
                        can’t go around insulting kid’s and 
                        mothers! That was seven legit hate 
                        crimes! 

           Harry looks back at the kids he just assumed were clocking. 
           Their actually running a mobile business. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Pray they didn’t get that on Vine. 

           They enter a BEAT UP LOBBY. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Tell me right now: what are we 
                        doing here?

                                 HARRY
                        My oldest snitch used to run these 
                        towers. He would’ve heard something 
                        the night we got popped. 

           The elevator shows up. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s jostle his memory, then we’re 
                        at the station. Word is bond. 

           They enter. Junior notices the elevator only stops on EVERY 
           OTHER FLOOR. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        It’s the projects. City didn’t 
                        spend a nickel they didn’t have to. 
           Leaving Junior on that revelation. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Not every corner of the city 
                        changed. Believe that. 

           INT. HALLWAY -- CONT’D

           They approach a METAL DOOR at the end of a long hallway. 
           Junior listens to the other side. Hears nothing. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Off-duty protocol is to knock 
                        twice, announce yourself, and 
                        express your desire to speak in 
                        person. Remember: respect their 
                        space. They respect yours -- 

           Harry SHOOTS the handle and kicks open the door. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Oops. Someone left the door open. 

           APARTMENT

           That of a hoarder. In the LIVING ROOM sits an OLD ASS MAN, 
           hooked to a heart machine/breathing apparati. 

           This is BIG CHEESE.

                                 HARRY
                        Yo Cheese. It’s Harry. 

           They step closer. The Old Ass Man is not moving. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Never thought I’d be back. 

           Harry walks up next to Cheese, who’s wearing those big BLUE 
           BLOCKER glass and a Yankee hat. His face is steel. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I need to know what you know from 
                        the night The Gun Show was killed. 

           Nothing. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Someone must’ve heard something. We 
                        walked right into it. They knew we 
                        were cops. 
           Harry puts a loving hand on Cheese’s shoulder. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        We had some times Don. Help me make 
                        this right.  

           Harry holds back his emotions. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        For Ray. Tell me what you know. 

           Cheese’s mouth drops. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        The fuck...

           Junior taps the HEART MONITOR. It’s flatlined. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        That’s bad. 

           Harry jumps back, accidently catching the EKG CABLE, which 
           swings Don’s wheelchair and LAUNCHES THE DEAD CHEESE onto 
           Harry, who’s face slams into Cheese’s. 

           He basically just kissed a dead dude. 

                                 EMT PRELAP
                        Heart attack. No doubt about it. 

                                                               JUMP TO:

           DEAD CHEESE ON A STRETCHER

           Being carted out by TWO EMTS, who address Harry and Junior. 

                                 EMT
                        Caused by a sudden shock. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Like...

                                 EMT
                        Door slams. Backfiring car.  

           They load Don’s body. 

                                 EMT (CONT’D)
                        Gun shot. 

           SLAM go the doors. The EMT VAN peels out, leaving a stunned 
           Harry and Junior. 
                                 HARRY
                        I just killed The Cheese...

                                 JUNIOR
                        How do I write this up?!

                                 HARRY
                        Rule number eight: you don’t. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        We’re key witnesses to the death of 
                        a deep NYPD informant. I have to -- 

                                 HARRY
                        Everyone HAS to go someday. Cheese 
                        had a full serving. We’re not 
                        saying shit -- 

                                 JUNIOR
                        WE? YOU shot the man’s doorknob --

           As Junior lectures Harry, his eyes wander across the STREET 
           where he spots a WHITE CADILLAC come to a slow roll. 

           Heavily tinted windows drop a few inches, as the PASSENGER
           swaps bags with TWO MEN on ALL TERRAIN VEHICLES.  

           Harry taps Junior -- points. 

                                 HARRY
                        That’s a drop. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        You’ve done enough for today. I’ll 
                        radio -- 

                                 HARRY
                        YOU’RE A COP. BE ONE. 

           They run over -- the ATV guys clock them coming.  

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        POLICE! FREEZE!

           They both reach for badges. Junior pulls out a HOME DEPOT 
           CREDIT CARD. Harry holds his hand in a half-circle. 

           The ATV guys pause, pull GUNS, and OPEN FIRE!

           PEOPLE DUCK. The Cadillac SPEEDS OFF. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        SHOW TIME!
           Tossing Junior in, turning the engine over, FLOORS IT!

           LENOX BOULEVARD

           The Hyundai pounds pavement. 

           Our guys are 50 YARDS behind, dodging and weaving. 

           The Cadillac banks right, left, floors it through a 
           FORECLOSED COURTYARD COMPLEX. 

           The Hyundai catches up. 

           The Cadillac Passenger SPRAYS FIRE at the Hyundai POV!

           Our guys duck, Harry returns fire, but just shoots out his 
           own windshield. 

                                 HARRY
                        CALL ME RUSTY!

           Before re-loading and emptying the clip into the tail of the 
           white Caddy!

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        CALL ME RUST FREE! (To Junior) 
                        That’s your line! 

           Both vehicles do a 360 SPIN OUT over a fire hydrant. Whoosh!

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        SIT ON HIS DICK!

                                 JUNIOR
                        What? 

                                 HARRY
                        I’m gonna do the JUST THE TIP! 
                        Classic Gun Show move! 

                                 JUNIOR
                        WHAT?

           Harry opens his door, grabs it and PAVEMENT SKIS by dragging 
           his Tims on the blacktop. 

                                 HARRY
                        Awesome right?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Get back inside!
           A bullet grazes Junior’s head. Another hits Harry in the 
           shoulder. Harry smiles. 

                                 HARRY
                        LET’S NYPDDDDD

           Turns to Junior, who is lost...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        NYPDDDDDDDDDD!!! Say it with me!

                                 JUNIOR
                        Say what?

           They SLAM INTO A SERIES OF PARKED CARS. 

                                 HARRY
                        LET’S NYPD-DO THIS!!!!

           He tosses his own gun to himself. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        What does that do?

                                 HARRY
                        Feels good!

           Doing it again, this time shooting back. He rapid re-loads 
           once again, and then RELOADS AGAIN! For no reason. 

           Junior frantically calls for backup on the radio --

                                 JUNIOR
                        White Cadillac sedan! License plate 
                        Lion Barclay Stanley Virginia 
                        Alfred Grandma!

           Harry thinks on this a beat. 

                                 HARRY
                        LBS VAG. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Pounds vag?

                                 HARRY
                        Heads up!!!

           The Cadillac does a last minute BANK INTO CLOISTERS PARK, 
           leaving our car just outside the thick stone wall.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Now what?
                                 HARRY
                        Little something your ‘ol man 
                        called FINGERING THE CABBIE!

                                 JUNIOR
                        MAKE IT STOP!

                                 HARRY
                        Angle the wheel at forty five 
                        degrees, aim for the next hot dog 
                        cart! DO IT!

           Harry swings the wheel -- RIGHT INTO A DUDE’S HOT DOG CART -- 
           BANG, they tear the thing into pieces. Hotdogs shower people 
           running for cover. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        What time you got? 

           Harry pulls a hotdog from the floor. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I think it’s lunch time! 

           They smash into ANOTHER HOT DOG CART. FAST APPROACHING A 
           PARKED SCHOOL BUS. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        DUCK!

                                 HARRY
                        Is this Spring Break? 

           Junior grabs Harry and lowers their heads just in time -- the 
           ROOF IS RIPPED CLEAR OFF. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        ‘CUZ WE’RE GOING TOPLESS!!!

           They see the Cadillac driving further into the park. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        STOP! THE! FUCKING! CAR!

                                 HARRY
                        We’ll cut in on 86th and CPW! We 
                        can head ‘em off by Wolman Ring! 

           He loads HOLLOW POINT BULLETS. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I AM ALIVE!
                                 JUNIOR
                        PULL! OVER!

           They are RACING towards the ONLY WAY INTO THE PARK. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        NO!!!

           Harry swings the wheel. They overshot it by a LONG SHOT, 
           smashing their TAIL INTO THE ROCK ENTRANCE, violently tossing 
           the into a SPIN CYCLE!

           Before the beat-to-fuck Hyundai comes to a stop. Steaming. 
           The Cadillac races away. 

                                 HARRY
                        Let’s philly hand roll! 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Which means what in 2016? 

           Harry smiles while HOTWIRING the car. Revs the engines. 

                                 HARRY
                        Screen legend and former President 
                        Ronald Reagan once said, “If they 
                        can’t see the light, make ‘em feel 
                        the heat.”

           He shoots a few rounds in the air. For no reason. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Means: let’s heat ‘em up!

           Peeling out. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        NO! 

                                 HARRY
                        Your Dad’s first rule for car 
                        chases: never chase, always lead.

           Flooring it in pursuit of the Cadillac up ahead, rounding the 
           long way through an ALLEY -- 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Time to start smelling what I’m 
                        smelling Junior.  

           Revs the engine FULL THROTTLE. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        We’re not -- 
                                 HARRY
                        We are -- 

           They PUNCH A GATE. Cutting off the Cadillac’s path. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        NO NO NO!!!

                                 HARRY
                        MEANS YES YES YES!!!

           RACING up along side the Cadillac. Both sides exchanging fire 
           at FULL SPEED. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Hold onto your dick! 

           Harry banks left, then right, rolling on two wheels -- 
           getting them airborne, slamming through the stone wall.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        We can pin ‘em ahead! 

           Harry rigs a small EXPLOSIVE UNIT. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Take your seat Junior! 

           Exits through the window. Junior takes the wheel. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        WHAT?

                                 HARRY
                        This show’s about to start!

           Climbs on the roof! Harry crosses himself, and JUMPS ONTO THE 
           CADILLAC’S ROOF with the ticking bomb in his hands! 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Wow...

           Then Junior realizes he is headed right for a rock wall. 

           Harry sees this too. Not good. 

                                 JUNIOR & HARRY
                        SHIT!

           LIGHTNING FAST --

           Harry tosses the IED through the SUNROOF of the Caddy, barrel-
           rolls off the roof, just as KABOOM!
           Sending the Cadillac into the rocks. 

           SAME TIME: Junior’s SLAMS INTO A CEMENT DIVIDER, upending his 
           car ASS AROUND THROUGH THE AIR -- 

                                 HARRY
                        AND THE QUARTERBACK...

           CRASH LANDING IN A SMALL POND --

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        IS TOAST!!!

           A swan is crushed! 

           CENTRAL PARK 

           Harry races to the smoldering Cadillac.

                                 HARRY
                        HANDS UP ASSHOLE!

           A BODY inside: RICK. Wallace’s bodyguard from the teaser.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        RICK? 

           Dying, on his last breath. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Who set us up?! 

                                 BODYGUARD RICK
                        Shouldv’e stayed dead Harry...

           Looks at Harry with a smile, before dying in his arms. 

           Off Harry’s stunned face --

                                 HARRY
                        Something else went down that 
                        night. Something big time.

           Junior and Harry lock eyes through the crime scene. 

                                 JUNIOR PRELAP
                        Agreed. Illegal is an 
                        understatement. 
           PRECINCT

           TIGHT ON a beaten up Harry and Junior. Facing a STEAMING 
           Chief Halls.

                                 JUNIOR
                        But...and this is the important 
                        part, I did not put that operation 
                        into motion. I was practically held 
                        at gunpoint. So I’m asking you 
                        Chief, look at this through a 
                        balanced prism. Who did what?

           BEAT. 

           Chief Halls nods, walks over, and throws a FULL ASHTRAY into 
           Junior’s face. He just sits there, perfectly still. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        That’s your problem Junior. 

           Junior blinks. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        You never act. Only react. Take it 
                        in the ass. Why no one respects you 
                        son. 

           Cowie walks by the office. Gives him the finger without even 
           looking up. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Why I put you two together. 

           Junior and Harry each raise one eyebrow. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        So you could get my top cop up to 
                        speed in 2016. Solve Ray’s case.  

           To Harry --

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        And you could make a legend’s son, 
                        more like the legend. A cop. 

           She sits. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        All you had to do was get a history 
                        lesson; get your badge back. 

           Tosses him her iPhone. It’s a VINE FEED of Harry making those 
           kids cry earlier today. It is VIRAL. 
                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Kids are in touch with their 
                        emotions these days. They also have 
                        something called the internet. 

                                 HARRY
                        Kids used to clock last time I went 
                        to the PJ’s.  

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        Times passed, and you Harry, are 
                        too lost to come back now.

           Harry shrugs. Mouths to Junior “Same ‘ol.”

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, but this comes from above. 

           Harry rolls his eyes. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Never should have put you guys 
                        together. My mistake.  

                                 HARRY
                        I promise, won’t happen again. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        It’s already done. 

                                 HARRY
                        Just like that?

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        Until you can prove your fit to 
                        serve, you’re not fit to serve. 
                        Both of you. 

           Harry realizes she’s not bluffing. 

                                 HARRY
                        Bullshit. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        What did you think was going to 
                        happen?

                                 HARRY
                        Usually...The Gun Show would give 
                        you our shields and then you’d 
                        slide ‘em back under the table. 

           Chief Halls just stares at him. 
                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        You see me sliding anything? 
                        Welcome to 2016. Wake up.  

           Junior holds his head, in so many forms of pain. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Junior, anything happens during  
                        suspension, kiss that transfer 
                        goodbye. 

           Junior turns GHOST WHITE. His heart stops. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Both of you: think about who you 
                        want to be.   

           TIGHT ON Harry and Junior, taking this to the heart. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Because you’re trying to be a man 
                        who’s no longer needed. Go home. 

           SLAM goes the door on their faces. 

                                 TREMONTE OS
                        ...Happens when you try to do 
                        something you’re not ready for. 

           They turn to Tremonte and Park, clearly listening in. 

                                 TREMONTE
                        I’ll talk to Chief. Get you your 
                        mace and notebook back. 

                                 PARK
                        Sitting on traffic cones where you 
                        belong. And tell your wife to call 
                        me. I need to fuck something. 

           Junior turns. Walks away. 

                                 HARRY
                        You let them talk to you like that? 

                                 JUNIOR
                        What can I do? Tremonte runs NARC. 

                                 HARRY
                        They don’t run us. 

           Harry walks up to Park. 
                                 PARK
                        You lost or something, because 1996 
                        is outside, to the left and right 
                        in my dickhole.  

           Super casual, Harry walks up breaks Park’s wrist Bruce-Willis-
           Die-Hard-style. A COP BRAWL BREAKS OUT!

           Halls jumps in -- get a kick in the dick, before stopping it! 

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        JUNIOR! HARRY! GET THE FUCK OUT MY 
                        STATION!!! NOW!!!

           OUTSIDE PRECINCT

           Junior holds his eyes. Harry brushes him shoulders off. 

                                 HARRY
                        Rule #11: always throw the first 
                        punch and never let another man 
                        talk to you like that, or they all 
                        will. Let’s get back to the scene -- 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Are you crazy? 

           Harry winks. Twice. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Listen. Asshole.   

                                 HARRY
                        So now you wanna stand up? 

           Harry gets in his face. They might throw down. COPS look on. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        My career, my entire life, is now 
                        in jeopardy. Because you woke up.  

           Steaming. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Because you had a hunch and decided 
                        to blow up central park over it. 
                        Man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta 
                        do, and someone should have done 
                        this a lone time ago --

           Landing a DRY GULCH HAYMAKER right in Harry’s face. 

           Like 50 COPS gasp. Harry turns, wipes blood, and stares HEAT. 
                                 HARRY
                        If that’s your best shot, you’ll 
                        never be your father’s son.  

           Steps in Junior’s grill. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Ray wanted to help you become a 
                        man. He was too late. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Shame you woke up Harry... 

           Walks towards the SUBWAY STATION. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Now you know how much the world 
                        never needed you. 

           Leaving that stinger. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Good luck. You’ll need it.  

           Giving Harry the finger, who’s suddenly by himself in a very 
           different city...he looks around. 

           People shake their heads. Stare at a man, lost in a city he 
           once ran. 

                                 HARRY
                        Fuck the NY PUSSY DEPARTMENT. 

           POV OF A CELL PHONE SCREEN. Harry curses at people. 

                                                              MATCH TO:

           OFFICE

           We see the backside of the same FIGURE IN BLACK from the 
           night shit went down. He holds the tablet in his hands. 

           We do not see his face. 

                                 FIGURE IN BLACK
                        No shit...welcome back Harry. 

           He zooms in on Harry. It’s him alright. 

                                 FIGURE IN BLACK (CONT’D)
                        But The Gun Show, it ends now. 

           ZOOM in on Junior. 
                                 FIGURE IN BLACK (CONT’D)
                        FOR BOTH BROTHERS. 

           Puffs on a VAPORIZER. The liquid cartridges read: LB$. 

           The fumes drift above the frozen image of Harry and Junior...

           DIVE BAR

           A few drinks in, Harry finishes reading THE BOOK OF MODERN 
           HISTORY Junior compiled. Mind fully blown. 

                                 HARRY
                        Jesus...Gimme three fingers 
                        Drambieu. Hennessey back. 

           BARTENDER slides him two high balls.  

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        How could everything...change? 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Story of New York. Tear one thing 
                        to build the next. Don’t look back. 

           Harry nods, then unfolds the CASE FILE. Scanning through it: 
           comes to Rick’s image. DOA AT THE CRIME SCENE. 

                                 HARRY
                        Man can’t die at the scene and die 
                        again today. Rick got out alive 
                        that night, or faked dying. 

           Taps the photo. Mind working overtime. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        If Rick wasn’t killed that night, 
                        he must’ve known about the set up. 

           Circles Rick’s file photo. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Means other people got out alive or 
                        faked dying as well. 

           Crushes another three finger pour. Slams the glass down. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        You got a credit card?

                                 HARRY
                        What? On a cop’s salary. 
                                 BARTENDER
                        That’s $72. 

                                 HARRY
                        72 for what? 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Shot and half is $18. Four rounds, 
                        $72. Been under a rock guy? 

           Harry cannot believe this. Pulls out his wallet. He’s got a 
           few 1-900-SEX-TALK cards (those existed) and maybe $13. 

                                 HARRY
                        Mentioned I’m a cop, right? 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Prove it. 

           Reaches for his badge that’s no longer there. Bartender 
           exhales vapor smoke. Harry looks around...unsure what to do.  

                                 HARRY
                        Where’s your payphone?

           Bartender pulls out his cell. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Christ. What’s the number? 

           Harry’s mind races. 

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        You got anyone? 

           Harry’s silence confirms he has no one. People look at him. 
           Judging. Curious. Confused. 

           Harry sees Junior’s card inside the History Book with his 
           direct cell number.  

                                 HARRY
                        Maybe I’m not alone. 

           JUNIOR’S APARTMENT

           Junior enters, sees the unknown number and declines the call. 
           He walks into the living room. Finds an upset Bonnie, hanging 
           up the phone. 
                                 BONNIE
                        That was Halls, and this is what 
                        happens when people keep everything 
                        bottled up. It explodes. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        It’s been, a long, long day. 

                                 BONNIE
                        One that nearly killed you. 

           Opens the fridge. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        I just want to go forget I ever met 
                        Harry Johnson. 

           Drinks a glass of water. 

                                 BONNIE
                        Level with me: there’s something 
                        going on with you. Today it came 
                        out, and could have been the end.

                                 JUNIOR
                        It’s a week unpaid suspension. 
                        We’ll get through it.  

                                 BONNIE
                        It’s not WE that I’m worried about. 

           BEAT. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s YOU.

                                 JUNIOR
                        What?

                                 BONNIE
                        I support you, but maybe it’s time 
                        you dealt with this. Your dad. 

           Junior stops in his tracks.  

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Because I miss the Ray who took me 
                        on a first date to Yankee stadium, 
                        without tickets.

           Holds his hand. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        You were happy. Being you.
           Junior nods in agreement. He kisses her forehead. His cell 
           rings again. Junior lets it.  

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe getting past Ray means 
                        dealing with Harry. See who it is.  

           Junior answers the phone, INTERCUT WITH:

           Harry, who’s a little drunk, and a lot excited. 

                                 HARRY
                        Good news and dope news.

                                 JUNIOR
                        I’m done with this -- 

                                 HARRY
                        Good news: I’m buying shots right 
                        now. Dope news: remember that 
                        driver today? That was our 
                        informant’s guy, up until he died 
                        the same night Ray did.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Play that back at half speed?

                                 HARRY
                        If Rick died that night but was 
                        clearly alive the last twenty 
                        years, means he --

                                 JUNIOR
                        Had something to do with whomever 
                        set up dad. But Rick’s dead now. 

                                 HARRY
                        Rick wasn’t smart enough to pull 
                        something like that set up off. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Saying someone else helped him who, 
                        what, is alive? 

                                 HARRY
                        If Rick’s heart was beating today, 
                        trust me -- 

                                 JUNIOR
                        He’s not working alone...
                                 HARRY
                        Gong bong. In other dope news: I’m 
                        at this bar and have no dough. Help 
                        your brother out? 

           Junior holds the phone to his head. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Besides, we got a lead now. Let’s 
                        roll! 

           BEAT.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Junior. I got no one else.

           Junior holds the phone. Sees Bonnie right there, hearing the 
           conversation. 

                                 BONNIE
                        Give him another chance, but you’re 
                        in charge -- or you walk. Deal. 

           He blows her a kiss. Back to the phone -- 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Where you at?  

           DIVE BAR

           Just as Harry’s being TOSSED OUT on his ass, Junior pulls up 
           in a YELLOW CAB. Shows his badge to the Bartender. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        You needed me to cover a bar tab? 

           Harry slides him the case file: Wallace and Rick’s mugshots. 

                                 HARRY
                        Newsflash: if Rick was alive all 
                        this time, he set us up. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        OK, but what else connects today to 
                        that night?  

                                 HARRY
                        This...

           A FILE PHOTO of RICK’S CADILLAC. Harry points to his 
           VAPORIZER. The symbol is a burnt LB$. 
                                 JUNIOR
                        Same as the license plate? LB$. 

                                 HARRY
                        No reason for a criminal who died 
                        two decades ago to rep some crew 
                        called LB$, unless it’s tied to the 
                        vapor thing. I made a call to 
                        evidence. 

           Pulls out the Bartender’s vaporizer. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Smell’s like a cigarette. 

           Junior sniffs. Harry pulls Rick’s burnt vaporizer. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        This one’s from the accident today.  

           Junior’s nose pulls back. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Chemical resin. X. Highly 
                        addictive. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        I’ve seen this before...

           Stares at the LB$ logo carefully -- 

                                                          FLASH-CUT TO:

           125TH ST & LENOX -- YESTERDAY

           When Junior and Cowie pulled over the Millenials. The DRIVER 
           shows Junior his vaporizer...

           FREEZE ON: the vaporizer has an LB$ logo. 

           BACK TO SCENE 

           Junior, seeing the chess board -- 

                                 JUNIOR
                        I pulled over some dorks yesterday. 
                        Had the same logo on their pipe. 

                                 HARRY
                        Means whomever is selling the LB$
                        vapor --
                                 JUNIOR
                        Is selling a form of liquid Molly?

                                 HARRY
                        Who’s Molly? 

                                 JUNIOR
                        We need to get a vaporizer with 
                        this logo and take it in for 
                        testing. 

                                 HARRY
                        Buy and bust. Your ‘ol man’s MO. 

           Harry smiles. Junior doesn’t. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        NO. We tried your way. Now we’re 
                        both out of a job and I’m nearly 
                        out of a fiancee. 

           Harry focuses. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        If we’re checking this lead, we’re 
                        checking it my way only. 

                                 HARRY
                        Bet. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        I paid your tab. Can you make a 
                        little effort to talk like a cop? 

                                 HARRY
                        Word. Where we headed?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Where kids go on a Tuesday.  

                                 HARRY
                        Red Lobster.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Think of the worst neighborhood on 
                        the border of a hip one...

                                 HARRY
                        Like, Williamsburg? 

                                 JUNIOR
                        I’ll call an Uber. 
                                 HARRY
                        Fuck that blanket delivery thing. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Well, my sedan is now evidence so 
                        it’s Uber or the subway. 

                                 HARRY
                        Dude -- your dad was the flyest DT
                        in the city. We’re taking his whip. 

           Junior almost smiles...

                                 JUNIOR
                        Tell me he had a Ferrari? 

                                 HARRY
                        The Ferrari of Singapore. 

                                                               JUMP TO:

           GARAGE

           A dropcloth is pulled back to reveal a beat up, gunshot 
           holed, neon green 1992 Geo Metro. Ghetto Fast N Furious. 

                                 HARRY
                        Geo Metro. Eddie Bauer edition. 

           Not what Junior was expecting. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Spinners keep spinning. 

           The rims actually spin. This was a thing. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Ready to take the wheel?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Does this car-truck...run? 

                                 HARRY
                        It runs women right out of their 
                        panties. 

           BEEP BEEP. Push button start. Engine purrs like shit.  

           Harry opens the driver door for Junior. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for that history book. Never  
                        imagined so much could change. 
           Junior nods, puts it in gear. It spits black fumes. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Hey. I asked: you ready to take the 
                        wheel? 

           Junior revs the engine. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Ready to take back the night man. 

                                 HARRY
                        Weird. What’s a night-man? 

           WILLIAMSBURG WAREHOUSE

           Deserted streets save for the occasion HIPSTER bike crew.

           The Metro rolls up across from a shuttered BANK. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        So this is “The Bank”. The spot 
                        NARC’s been casing for months now.  

                                 HARRY
                        Time to make a deposit. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        There --   

           Two HIPSTERS emerge from a Lyft. 

           They motion to a door with their smart phone. A BARCODER
           reads a TEXT. The door opens and closes. Two seconds flat. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        It’s a pop up. 

                                 HARRY
                        Let’s pop off then. 

           Goes to load a gun. Junior takes the bullets. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        What? It’s a private party. No 
                        sign. Snapchat invite only. 

           Harry is lost. 

                                 HARRY
                        Why the fuck would someone throw a 
                        party and NOT want anyone to know?
                                 JUNIOR
                        To keep nerds like us out. 

                                 HARRY
                        Nerds like you. Not me. 

           Opens the door. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        But you can’t roll up with me 
                        dressed like Caribbean Carlton. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        You’re not going in alone. 

                                 HARRY
                        You’re about your dad’s size?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Wouldn’t know.   

           Harry smiles. 

                                 HARRY
                        Time to find out. 

           QUICK SHOTS

           A trunk is lifted. A Kangol is brushed off. JNCO jeans are 
           fastened. A Diva pager is holstered. Wallabees are laced. 

           Meet -- 

           90’s Junior. Looks like his dad, but really uncomfortable. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Hold up... 

           He tucks in Junior’s shirt, and untucks the gold chain so it 
           rests atop the Tommy Hilfiger turtle neck. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Now you got the juice. 

           Junior, holding his dad’s chain. A light smile creeps up. 

           STREET

           They SLO MO CRUISE across Myrtle Avenue -- looking more like 
           partners, albeit bootleg Fresh Prince and Carlton. 

           They can’t help but have a little swagger. Just the 
           tip...until a RICHSHAW DRIVER whizzes by --
                                 RICKSHAW DRIVER
                        Watch your shit Flavor Flav!!! 

           Swagger dies down. They reach the METAL DOOR. Harry kicks it. 

                                 HARRY
                        Open up motherfucker. 

           A SLAT opens. A PAIR OF DARK EYES stare back. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Open the door man.  

                                 BOUNCER
                        Barcode? 

           Junior hands him his phone. Bouncer checks it out: screen 
           image of Junior and Bonnie riding a CGI whale at Seaworld. 

                                 BOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        Fuck outta here.  

                                 HARRY
                        Fuck you. Make me. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        Who the fuck are you?

                                 HARRY
                        We’re playing tonight. Get Richie
                        out here and tell him DJ Gun Powder 
                        just rolled in. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        You know Richie? 

                                 HARRY
                        Since he was eight. Tell him to 
                        open up or I’m calling his mom.  

           Bouncer peeps Junior. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        ‘Sup with In Living Color? 

                                 HARRY
                        Personal stylist. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        No doubt.  

                                 HARRY
                        Open up. 
                                 BOUNCER
                        Word. It’s throwback night up in 
                        there; you came correct.

           They exit, cruising down a long, neon hallway. People hand 
           out glow sticks. 

                                 HARRY
                        What’s a “throwback”? 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Probably a sex move.  

           They turn the corner into a MASSIVE HIP HOP RAVE. 

           No one over 25. Everyone rocks highly bespoke 90’s gear: the 
           past is en vogue again. Harry smiles ear-to-ear. 

                                 HARRY
                        What’s really good! 

           Junior is blown away by the sheer size of this thing. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Remember: we’re looking for someone 
                        selling a nicotine vapor. 

           Harry waves through a THICK FOG. They both cough. 

                                 HARRY
                        Look for someone who’s not dancing 
                        or smoking: that’s the dealer. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        You got any gum? 

           His mouth is bone dry. 

                                 HARRY
                        We’re catching contact highs. Split 
                        up. Cover more ground. In five 
                        minutes make sure you get some 
                        fresh air. We’re breathing some 
                        kind of synthetic fog juice.  

           Overhead vents pump the shit out. 

           Harry turns back to Junior -- who’s already moving through 
           the thick crowd of kids grinding. And these kids have MOVES. 

           Junior wanders into the crowd, starting to feel the fumes 
           more and more. He touches a dude’s face. Then his own. 
           Harry scans the scene, trying to make a DEALER in a swarm of 
           people. He turns back -- Junior’s GONE. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Where the fuck...

           All he sees are heads moving. He pushes his way through the 
           mosh pit. Some people SILENT RAVE with headphones. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Hell did Junior go?

           Then we hear a SLOW RHYTHMIC “GOLF” CLAP. Harry sees a DANCE 
           CIRCLE FORM. Is that...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Junior? 

           In the middle of the massive dance floor is a STEP UP-style 
           dance off. Harry pushes to the front of the pack to see:

           Junior, trying to do a handstand before TWO BREAK DANCING 
           DUDES, complete with matching Adidas track suits, LL Cool J 
           gold rope “dookie” chains and Kangol velour hats. 

           They watch Junior do a weird head spin move, followed by a 
           FAILED BACK FLIP onto a couch. It’s OK. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        STEP UP, OR STEP DOWN BI-YATCH!!!

           The Breakdancers look at each other, then at Junior. Only 
           then, do we see they are Tremonte and Park, under cover. 

                                 TREMONTE (WHISPER)
                        Get the fuck out of here. NOW. 

           The Narcs walk away, trying not call attention. Junior slaps 
           Park in the face and knocks his Kangol off. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        What’s up now ROO-FEE-OHH!

           Park does kind of look like HOOK’s Rufeo. He steps to Junior, 
           who is rolling. 

                                 PARK
                        You have no idea what you’re 
                        messing with. 

           Harry now sees who this is. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        I’m not taking your shit anymore!
           Harry grabs him -- 

                                 HARRY
                        We need to get outta here without 
                        anybody noticing. 

           Harry moves the crowd back to clear a path out for them. 

           Junior Starts to stretch, then breaks into the following 
           moves: RUNNING MAN, THE CABBAGE PATCH, THE SPRINKLER, THE 
           DUTCH WINDMILL, ending on the JERK OFF.

           Junior gets in Park’s face. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Haters hate! 

           Does a wobbly AC Slater-style spin move. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Slater’s slate! 

                                 TREMONTE
                        Fuck are you doing? Everyone is 
                        looking at us asshole!

                                 JUNIOR
                        Who looks at assholes?! 

                                 HARRY
                        Be cool. Follow me out. Now.  

           He grabs Junior who pushes him into the crowd. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Hands off!

           Shoves Harry into people. EVERYONE looks at Junior...

           Who takes his shirt off. Then his shoes. 

           Junior climbs up on the speakers, and, like a high school 
           production of Pirates Of The Panzer, LEAPS overhead, swings 
           from a CABLE, does a weird half-barrel roll and lands POP

           Right on a dancers pole. 

                                 HARRY/TREMONTE/PARK
                        What the fuck...

           Inverted, Junior does a bizarre SHOWGIRLS move -- giving the 
           entire place that eating vagina finger face thing. 
                                 HARRY
                        He can only be Ray’s kid...

           Before dismounting into a split on the back of the Tremonte’s 
           head, sending them flying into the crowd. 

           Junior Riverdances across the dance circle, and goes back-to-
           back with Harry, like a 90’s album cover. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        And if you don’t know...

           No one says shit, until -- 

                                 JUNIOR & HARRY (MUMBLING)
                        Now you know!

           The crowd just disperses, confused. Staring hate daggers, the 
           Tremonte and Park leave, cover nearly blown. 

           Junior goes to give people hi-fives. 

                                 OLDER RAVER
                        Overkill dude. Way overkill. 

                                 HIP HOP GIRL
                        This close. That’s how close you 
                        were to injuring someone. Think 
                        before you dance. 

                                 SPIRITUAL DANCER

                        Know your place in the world. 

           People shoot them looks. Junior is out of breath. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Bonnie and I take hip hop pole 
                        dancing class. How cool was that?

                                 HARRY
                        Um...Time to leave. NOW.   

                                 JUNIOR
                        My hands feels amazing. 

           BACK ALLEY

           Harry kicks open a door. Junior takes deep breaths, still no 
           shirt on. Or shoes. Throws up a little. 
                                 JUNIOR
                        Top three fantasy food draft picks: 
                        Pizza. Batman. Hotdogs. 

                                 HARRY
                        You realized those guys were cops?

           Junior coughs. Looks up. Sees THE DEALER sell something to 
           TWO RAVERS. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Look!

                                 HARRY
                        Flint and steel. Light this fire. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Let’s tail ‘em. 

                                 HARRY
                        Let’s cap ‘em.  

                                 JUNIOR
                        We have a deal: this is my way. 
                        Let’s just put eyes on where they 
                        go. Nothing more.  

           Harry holsters Ray Sr’s two guns. 

           They creep along the shadows. The DEALER, a shorter guy in 
           fatigues, gets in a Prius Uber. 

           Junior pulls out his phone -- taps the Uber App, hacks in and 
           has the Prius in front of him on his screen. 

                                 HARRY
                        ...Look at Kojak right here.

           They enter the Geo Metro. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        You got two tickets?

           Junior tosses Harry the keys. 

                                 HARRY
                        To what?

           Junior points to his small, cold biceps. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        The ANTI-Gun show! Gimme your 
                        jacket?
           BROOKLYN STREETS

           Cruising. 

           They keep distance from the Sedan, following it further into 
           DUMBO -- a warehouse district turned yuppie-ville.  

                                 HARRY
                        What’s this ‘hood?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Expensive condos, lobster rolls, 
                        and strollers.  

                                 HARRY
                        Connecticut?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Brooklyn. 

           The Sedan drives into a LOADING DOCK. 

           A LARGE METAL GATE shuts behind the car. The place is a high-
           walled factory. 

                                 HARRY
                        A coal plant. Interesting. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        This used to be the Domino Sugar 
                        factory. 

           A blinking sign reads DOMINO SUGAR. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Now it’s the Dumbo Craft Brewery.  

           Harry sees an ELECTRICAL LINE running from a TELEPHONE POLE 
           to the Brewery Courtyard. 

                                 HARRY
                        Ever see TURNER AND HOOCH?

                                 JUNIOR
                        We’re NOT flying in on an 
                        electrical line. No way health 
                        insurance covers that. 

                                 HARRY
                        I just remembered seeing that movie 
                        with my girl. She had a club foot, 
                        but was still hot. Thought about 
                        asking her to move in and shit.

                                 HARRY (CONT'D)
                        In that order. That was our last 
                        night before the coma. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Sorry man.   

                                 HARRY
                        She was dope. Big wagons. Huge can. 
                        Cute lil’ hook hand. Burn victim or 
                        something. Loved that woman. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        She sounds special...olympics.

           Harry stares at the moon. A painful memory. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        You got anyone from before? 
                        Parents? Siblings? 

           Harry shakes his head. 

                                 HARRY
                        Your pops took me in when I was 
                        thirteen. From juvie. 

           BEAT. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Only family I needed was Ray. 

           Junior takes this in. Harry is lost. Alone.  

                                 JUNIOR
                        Marriage and kids have their 
                        valleys with the peaks. 

                                 HARRY
                        Cherish them.

                                 JUNIOR
                        I do. More than anything. 

                                 HARRY
                        Because you never know when that 
                        bullet’s gonna come for you. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Exactly why I just want to put eyes 
                        on this and call it in. Safe. 

           They inspect the exterior. 
                                 HARRY
                        We can slide in after the next 
                        delivery shows up. Get evidence.

                                 JUNIOR
                        How?

           Harry smiles. 

                                 HARRY
                        Not every safe move, is the safest 
                        move. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        That’s what safe means. The 
                        opposite of danger. 

           Harry grabs Junior. 

                                 HARRY
                        Sometimes it takes a little danger 
                        to make something a lot safer. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Sometimes a little danger gets 
                        people shot. 

                                 HARRY
                        Sometimes you gotta trust your 
                        dick. 

           Junior, confused -- 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        And sometimes your Dad’s dick is 
                        really my dick. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Why do you keep saying --  

                                 HARRY
                        Follow me. Remember, just the tip. 

           LATER

           A DELIVERY TRUCK comes to a grinding stop outside the massive 
           gate. 

           In the shadows, from either side, Harry and Junior fire roll 
           under the truck and grab onto the chasis. 

           They look at each other. Junior -- nervous. Harry -- awesome. 
           They cruise inside. 
           After the driver’s leave the truck -- Harry motions, they 
           drop down, and quickly roll away from site. 

           Junior gives Harry a thumbs up. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do that. 

           They move silently up a BACK FIRE ESCAPE until they reach the 
           roof. The DOMINO SUGAR signs flashes behind them. 

           Peeking through a tiny, dirty, blacked out window, they see a 
           massive assembly-line operation. Thousands and thousands of 
           beer bottles are filled with beer. What you would expect. 

           Junior sees something in the deep corner -- 

           A different BOTTLE LINE. TWO CHEMISTS work off to the side. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Look: they fill one bottle 
                        separately, then it’s added to the 
                        others. 

           TRACKING one bottle as it joins five more, becoming a 6-pack. 

                                 HARRY
                        Every pack has one different 
                        bottle...

                                 JUNIOR
                        Check out that reservoir...

           TIGHT ON the Chemist’s TANK. It has an LB$ logo on it. 

                                 HARR
                        Same logo from Rick’s vapor thing. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        AND those dudes I pulled over. 

           They stare, mind’s racing. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        They use the brewery as a 
                        front...every six pack has one 
                        bottle of liquid molly. They can 
                        ship it anywhere. Anytime. 

                                 HARRY
                        Back in ‘91, you could buy a dozen 
                        red roses for $5. 
                                 JUNIOR
                        FOCUS. PLEASE.  

                                 HARRY
                        I AM. Your ‘ol man figured out the 
                        roses were so cheap because they 
                        were shipping drugs inside. Dogs 
                        couldn’t smell anything but roses. 

           BEAT. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        That’s why the beer’s cheaper than 
                        anything else. The guys at the 
                        precinct drink it every day. 

           Junior sits up. 

                                                          FLASH CUT TO:

           INT. POLICE LOCKER ROOM -- YESTERDAY

           Junior goes to give NARC Jonny a pound, only to be met by his  
           hot, wet under shirt in the face. The Detectives cruise by, 
           drinking DUMBO BREWERY beers. 

           BACK TO SCENE

           Junior, lightning bolt hits him --  

                                 JUNIOR
                        The head of Narc might be tied to 
                        this. We need to call Halls. NOW. 

                                 HARRY
                        Fuck no. Don’t give this case away 
                        to someone! This is our bust! 

                                 JUNIOR
                        NO, it’s our illegal stakeout. 
                        We’re not even allowed --

           Harry loads a secret boot gun. Hands a secret butt gun to 
           Junior. 

                                 HARRY
                        On 3 buffalo. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        NO.

                                 HARRY
                        One buffalo, two buffalo --
                                 JUNIOR
                        NO!

                                 HARRY
                        Means yes! Let’s NYPDDDDDDD

                                 JUNIOR
                        NOT DO THIS RIGHT NOW! 

           With a wink --

                                 HARRY
                        You either smoke, or you get 
                        smoked. Feel me. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Did you just WHITE MEN CAN’T JUMP 
                        quote?

                                 HARRY
                        What? No. It’s a LET’S BRING IN 
                        THIS NOISE quote! 

           And with that, the SKY LIGHT automatically opens under them. 

                                 JUNIOR & HARRY
                        DAMN. 

           THEY FREE FALL for several seconds, before CRASH LANDING into 
           a GIANT BARREL OF HOPS. 

           The entire plant stops. 

           15 DUDES WITH GUNS surround our guys, who emerge from a sea 
           of grain, coughing. Junior puts his hands up. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Somebody order a pizza? 

           THE ARMED DUDES stare a BEAT. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Because it certainly looks like 
                        someone just delivered, New York’s 
                        Finest! 

                                 HARRY
                        Was that your one-liner? 

           Junior LIGHTNING FAST pulls out TWO GUNS from Harry’s waist -- 

                                 JUNIOR
                        I think so! 
           Unloading into the PANELS OF GLASS ABOVE, showering everyone 
           with glass shards as the EMERGENCY LIGHTS STROBE to life. 

           Beer and glass cascade. Through the mayhem -- 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        THEY LED US HERE! 

           He shoots back in all directions. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        WHY ELSE WOULD THERE BE SO MANY 
                        ARMED DUDES WAITING?  

           Looking around. They’re fucked from all sides. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        WE NEED TO CREATE A BARRIER!

           Stepping up. SUSPENDED ABOVE -- Junior sees a massive BEER 
           VAT which feeds the entire assembly line. 

                                 HARRY
                        WE NEED TO CALL FOR BACKUP!

                                 JUNIOR
                        NO TIME! FOLLOW ME! 

           Takes careful aim, exhales, and with a SINGLE SHOT -- POOF, 
           hits the Vat, cracking it’s exterior. 

                                 HARRY
                        WHAT WAS THAT?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Take a deep breath!

           He aims, shoots -- TRACK BULLET until it PING -- cuts through 
           the DEAD BOLT CHAIN locking the VAT in place. 

           A SLOW RUMBLE, followed by a metal-on-metal SHRIEK, like a 
           dormant cyborg just come to life. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit. 

           THE GIANT VAT drops through the air, rotating once before it 
           SMASHES INTO THE FLOOR, SENDING A WAVE OF BEER IN THE AIR. 

           The wave of beer crashes into the Guards, flooding the place 
           with TOO MUCH FORCE. Junior drives Harry THROUGH WINDOWS to --
           ALLEYWAY

           Junior lifts Harry to his feet, running. 

                                 HARRY
                        HOLY SHIT! Some motherfuckers are 
                        always trying to ice skate uphill!

                                 JUNIOR
                        IS THAT FROM BLADE?!

                                 HARRY
                        WHAT? NO. But good shit in there! 

           A SHOT WHIZZES past his head. 

           Down the alley -- they SEE THE DEALER. 

           Chasing. Running through the maze of alleys, they get on a 
           rooftop, gaining on the Dealer who shoots back errantly. 

           As the Dealer nears a corner, our guys JUMP FROM ABOVE, 
           sending him to the ground in a heap of broken bones. 

           Slowly, Harry and Junior make their way to the writhing 
           Dealer, who’s back is to them. 

           Junior turns him over. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Hope you like jail. 

                                 HARRY
                        And dicks. In jail.  

           The dealer is in fact PARK. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        What the fuck? Park? 

           Park coughs to life. Shaking. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Talk to me!

           Park spits crimson blood. Harry puts a gun to his head.

                                 HARRY
                        Who else in on the take 
                        motherfucker --  

           BANG!
           A single shot rips through Park’s head, killing him on 
           impact. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        YOU FUCKING SHOT HIM?!

                                 HARRY
                        Wasn’t me! 

           Harry and Junior turn -- just in time to see a FIGURE reload 
           and BANG!

           Junior kicks Harry in the chest, sending him flying into a 
           brick wall, but SAVING HIS LIFE. 

           As the shell exits Junior’s thigh. He screams like a chick 
           with a dick. Thinks he’s dying. Harry checks the wound.  

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        First one. Welcome to the Man Club. 

           Junior looks at his leg. It was barely hit. Like barely. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        It still counts. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Really?

                                 HARRY
                        My first stray hit my nose ring. 
                        Ray told the precinct I took it 
                        like a cop. 

           On their feet. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        And Junior, way to man up back 
                        there. Got your dad’s moves. 

           ACROSS THE ALLEY

           They hear the sniper bolt away. 

           Our guys spring into action -- chasing until they near a 
           waiting GETAWAY SUV. Harry reaches for his boot gun; seeing 
           the windows drop and MULTIPLE MAC 10’s appear. 

           Before the storm -- they see the sniper: 

           TREMONTE, who locks eyes with Junior --

                                 TREMONTE
                        Wrong place. Wrong time. 
           RAT-TAT-TAT!!!

           Harry and Junior dive for cover as GUNFIRE cascades toward 
           them, leveling the entire alleyway. 

           Our guys hold each other behind a DUMPSTER, until the shots 
           finally stop. Tires peel out. 

           They run through thick gunsmoke and fog. Harry sees 
           Tremonte’s SUV turn a corner. 

           He goes BEAST MODE -- hellbent on stopping this dude right 
           here. Lines up his shot -- exhales -- and CLICK.

           EMPTY. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Head’s up!

           Tossing him Harry’s second revolver, which sails right over 
           Harry’s head. Terrible throw. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        My bad.

           Tires screech ahead. The SUV clears the scene. Off the guys -- 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Building’s going up! Run!

                                 HARRY
                        That’s our only evidence!

                                 JUNIOR
                        Not worth dying for! 

                                 HARRY
                        Ray already did! 

                                 JUNIOR
                        IF YOU LIVE HIS WAY, YOU WON’T MAKE 
                        IT ANOTHER DAY! TRUST ME --

           Junior jumps for cover with Harry -- BOOOOOM goes the 
           structure OFF SCREEN! They stare in SHOCK. 

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Tremonte baited us in to that spot.

                                 HARRY
                        Killed his partner. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Corrupt partner. 
                                 HARRY
                        No cop kills another unless it’s 
                        something so deep, no other way.  

                                 JUNIOR
                        This goes all the way to Tremonte. 
                        Who can we even trust in the 
                        department...

                                 HARRY
                        No one. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Chief Halls is family. 

                                 HARRY
                        Sure about that?  

                                 JUNIOR
                        YES. She’s practically been a 
                        mother to both of us. 

           Police lights and helicopters in the distance. 

                                 HARRY
                        We gotta book. Plan?  

                                 JUNIOR
                        We contact Halls; open a file with 
                        IA. I won’t lose everything I 
                        worked for. I trust Halls.  

                                 HARRY
                        Call her, but no one else can know 
                        what we just saw...

           OFFSCREEN, FDNY TRUCKS race to the inferno. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        This is gonna fall on us if we’re 
                        here. We need to disappear for a 
                        night. You got a safe house? 

                                 JUNIOR
                        I have my house, which I’m not 
                        bringing into this anymore. 

                                 HARRY
                        You need to move your family. Now.  

           Terror on Junior’s face. Dials Halls CELL as they peel out in 
           Harry’s ride. 
           HALLS’ HOUSE

           A cell rings. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        What? 

           She sits up. Listening to Harry and Junior on the other end. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        I don’t care if you were following 
                        a lead to kill cancer, you call for 
                        fucking backup! 

           Standing, kicking over an end table is pure anger. Walks out 
           of the BEDROOM.  

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        SHUT. UP. You’re not even active!

           Cruising down the modest hallways to the KITCHEN. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        You just broke a shitload of laws, 
                        and, if we don’t recover any 
                        evidence, which happens with a 
                        fucking inferno, I have nothing but 
                        a giant lawsuit and two cops who 
                        just committed arson. 

           Putting a tea bag into a mug. Pours water into a KETTLE. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        ...We need to figure out what the 
                        fuck your alibi is and then turn 
                        yourselves in. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT 
                        I WANTED TO AVOID BY PUTTING YOU 
                        TWO TOGETHER. FUCK ME!

           CLICK. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Just like their ‘ol man: all or 
                        nothing.  

           Turning on the GAS STOVE. She smells something funny. Notices 
           the dial was already ON, leaking gas throughout the house. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        NO!!!

               BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! 

           Goes a propane cloud from the stove’s RIGGED GAS LINE. 
           BLACK. 

           GEO METRO

           They drive along the FDR in silence. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Halls said we gotta turn ourselves 
                        in. 

                                 HARRY
                        Fuck that. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        I just burned down a factory. We 
                        need to deal with what happened. 

           Harry smiles. 

                                 HARRY
                        You didn’t burn down that factory, 
                        you earned down that factory. Rule 
                        #9: Never look back. Fuck ‘em 

                                 JUNIOR
                        One: that makes no sense, and two: 
                        YOU EVER THINK ABOUT ANYONE ELSE?

                                 HARRY
                        Calm your nerves. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        No. You know what you’re problem 
                        is...you’re only in this for you. 
                        That’s not what a cop is. 

                                 HARRY
                        Says the traffic cop. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Yes. I help people. 

                                 HARRY
                        Help isn’t hiding from danger. You 
                        wouldn’t know what a cop really is 
                        because you never had to be one.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Fuck you Harry. You know why you 
                        and my dad got along so well...

           Harry turns. 
                                 HARRY
                        Because we handle shit when 
                        everyone else runs. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        NO. Because neither of you care 
                        about anything but yourselves. 
                        That’s what got him killed. 

           Harry slams on the brakes. Opens his door, runs around the 
           other side of the car and pulls Junior out, who pulls out a 
           can of MACE and nails Harry in the eyes. 

           Junior then tackles him to the ground. They exchange punches, 
           kicks, and scratches before Harry, the bigger of the two, 
           pins Junior in the mud. 

                                 HARRY
                        RAY WAS MY FATHER BECAUSE I NEVER 
                        HAD ONE! I didn’t get him killed. 
                        SOMEONE SET US UP. 

           Releasing him.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Go back to your bullshit life, with 
                        your wife and kid and pretend we 
                        never met.
                               (beat)
                        Someone asks me about Ray’s son, I 
                        never know he had one. 

           Junior watches Harry leave him in the mud, on the side of the 
           highway. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Because he only loved you.  

           Harry peels out. CLOSE ON his face, pained, drawn. Alone. 

           JUNIOR’S APARTMENT

           Junior enters, turns to see Bonnie, waiting up for him. 

           A moment between them. Then --

                                 BONNIE
                        I met you twenty three years ago. 
                        You were in the academy. 

           He goes to say something. She puts a finger up. 
                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        I asked you why you wanted to 
                        become a cop. Told me the story of 
                        when you were six, the neighbor was 
                        beating his wife. You couldn’t do 
                        anything, but call 9-1-1. 

           BEAT. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        I knew right then you’d be my 
                        husband. Father of my child. 

           She stands.  

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Twenty three years later. You’ve 
                        helped people. Me and Kim included. 

           Holds his hands. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        But you never helped yourself get 
                        past your dad. 

           Closer. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        There’s only one way you’ll ever 
                        get past your father’s rejection. 

           Kisses his cheek. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Put the past to rest. For good. 

           BEAT. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Do what you gotta do, but this 
                        needs to end, before it ends you...

           Holding his hands. Junior brings her close -- BUZZ, a ringing 
           cell cuts this off. It’s the STATION. For a third time. 

           Answering. His face goes WHITE. Click. Eyes wide. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Someone bombed Chief Halls’ house. 
                        Husband’s dead. She’s at ICU. 

           Bonnie, frozen.  
                                 BONNIE
                        Put this to bed, then come back to 
                        me. Promise me Junior. 

           And yet, despite the deck, his eyes convey he is ready to put 
           the past to rest. Forever. 

           Junior opens the closet, opens a SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX. 

           Inside:

           His father’s DEATH CERTIFICATE, and his own BIRTH 
           CERTIFICATE, along with a cracked, faded polaroid of his 
           father, holding his baby -- Junior. The day he was born. 

           There is a smile like no other on Ray’s face. Underneath the 
           photo, his FATHER’S RUSTED BADGE. 

           Junior slides his chain through it, wearing it atop his 
           shirt. Looks at himself in the mirror. Bonnie stands at the 
           door, looking in. A different man is staring back at them. 

           A man that is about to set it off. 

           HOSPITAL ROOM

           Junior enters, stops dead in his tracks to see:

           Chief Halls, hooked up to all sorts of tubes and machines. 
           Hanging by a thread. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        We’ll make this right. 

           Puts a hand on her arm. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        My husband. My best friend. Gone. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Whatever you need.

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        It’s not what you can do. It’s what 
                        you can do, together.

           From the doorway, enters Harry. The two stare at each other. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Something I saw with Ray firsthand: 
                        he loved the shit out of you kid. 

           Junior on her every word.  
                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        But he didn’t know how to be a dad. 

           She exhales. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Only thing that scared him, was 
                        losing you. Why he became a super 
                        cop -- to keep you safe. 

           Junior, emotions bubbling to the surface. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Harry, you became his son because 
                        Ray saw himself in you. He trained 
                        you to be him, so you could protect 
                        yourself when he wasn’t there. 

           Harry now, on the verge of crying. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        I put you together because you both 
                        have the best of Ray.

           Coughs. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        But you brought out the worst of 
                        him, and yourselves. 

           Junior and Ray, both on the verge of crying. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        If there’s any shot of closing the 
                        case that killed Ray, it’s his 
                        sons. But you gotta find the best 
                        in each other, not just yourselves. 

           Chief Halls, now on the verge of crying herself. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        What no one else knows: he loved 
                        you both. Act like it. 

           Harry looks at Junior -- 

                                 HARRY
                        Make us proud. Dad’s last words. 

           BEAT. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        He was talking to us.
                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        Go make this right. Both of you. 

           She sits up. 

                                 CHIEF HALLS (CONT’D)
                        Find them. Hold them down, and 
                        pound their asses to death. 

           The guys look at each other. Nod. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        We’re good now?

                                 HARRY
                        Yep...before we handle this grown 
                        man business, I can’t call you 
                        Junior anymore. 

           BEAT. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Your name’s Ray. Act like it. 

           Junior, NOW RAY, nods. Reveals the shield around his neck. 

                                 RAY
                        You got two tickets? 

           Harry nods. 

                                 HARRY
                        What’re we seeing?

                                 RAY
                        Hottest show in town. 

                                 HARRY
                        Oh you don’t mean...

           In sync --  

                                 HARRY & RAY 
                        THE. GUN. SHOW.

           Harry tosses Ray one of his fathers hand guns. It goes flying 
           against the wall. 

                                 RAY
                        Gimme a fucking heads up before you 
                        throw a gun at my head!

           Puts his hand out. Ray gives him a pound. They roll out. 
           HOLD ON: 

           Chief Halls, sees them head into the night, together, 
           partners, long lost “brothers”... 

           She sheds a single tear, as a smallest of smiles creeps 
           across her lips. Then she’s back to awesome.  

                                 CHIEF HALLS
                        Wet pussies. 

           HOSPITAL ENTRANCE

           Ray and Harry exit. Ray pulls his cell. 

                                 RAY
                        Going right to the source. 

           Harry raises an eyebrow --

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        Tremonte. 

           Ringing on speakerphone. He answers. 

                                 TREMONTE (PHONE)
                        I got a story for you. 

                                 HARRY
                        And I got a story for your mama. 

                                 TREMONTE (PHONE)
                        Someone wants to say hi to your 
                        girlfriend. Give Junior the phone. 

           After a BEAT. 

                                 KIM (PHONE)
                        DAD!

           RAY. GOES. WHITE. 

                                 TREMONTE
                        FDR Island. Hospital Ruins. 

           CLICK. 

                                 RAY (PANIC)
                        He has Kim. 

           Bracing himself on the side of the car. Vision blurred. 
                                 HARRY
                        Listen: I’ve been here before. 
                        We’ll get through this, but you 
                        need to listen to me because this 
                        gets worse. 

           Ray turns. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        He’s baiting us to the bottom of a 
                        deserted island. They’ll bring Kim, 
                        and they will kill us all. That’s 
                        his plan. 

                                 RAY
                        He has my daughter.

                                 HARRY
                        We need the element of surprise. 

                                 RAY
                        I got an idea. 

           Harry listens. 

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        No telling who else is coming with 
                        him. I’m bringing a friend. 

                                 HARRY
                        Crazy enough to do this with us? 

                                 RAY
                        She’s been asking for action since 
                        she joined the PD. 

                                 HARRY
                        She? 

           Off Ray’s EYES -- scared as shit, but no longer alone.  

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Ready for this, partner. 

                                 RAY
                        Don’t call me partner. 

           BEAT. 

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        Call me brother. 

           BEAT. 
                                 HARRY
                        I was gonna say the same thing. 

           FDR ISLAND

           Pitch black. 

           A narrow sliver of land in the East River between Manhattan 
           and Queensbridge Projects. 

           The AIR SERVICE TRAM shuttles back and forth to Midtown, 
           several stories above the East River...

           SMALL POX HOSPITAL

           The southernmost tip of the Island -- where a Hospital once 
           stood hundreds of years ago, now a construction site.   

           A thick fog blankets the area. Parting the waft, Ray and 
           Harry emerge side-by-side, determined. In sync. 

           “Brothers” in arms.  

           COURTYARD

           Harry and Ray stop, notice the exit routes. Armed with 
           Harry’s reserves from the original Gun Show. 

           A whistle breaks the moment. Turn to see Tremonte, solo, 
           approaching in SWAT GEAR. 

                                 TREMONTE
                        Twenty years ago, I just graduated 
                        the academy. Chief of NARC comes to 
                        me, says a huge deal went south. 

           Getting closer. 

                                 TREMONTE (CONT’D)
                        Biggest unrecorded buy and bust in 
                        city history. $20MM cash. $10MM
                        product. But the bust never 
                        happened. 

           Closer. Our guys see RED SITE DOTS on their necks. Snipers. 

                                 TREMONTE (CONT’D)
                        Both undercovers were killed. 
                        Product vanished. Money reported 
                        was just $2MM. It was $20MM.  
                                 RAY (ADRENALINE)
                        Where is she?

           Pulls a pistol. Tremonte steps closer. 

                                 TREMONTE
                        Follow drugs, goes to a source. 
                        Follow money? Goes anywhere.  

                                 HARRY
                        There wasn’t $20MM that night and 
                        no one but Rick survived. 

                                 TREMONTE
                        Someone else did. Built an empire 
                        by using the people who hired him. 

                                 RAY
                        ...NARCS work for informants now? 

                                 HARRY
                        That’s why Park was dealing the 
                        same club you guys were casing. 

                                 TREMONTE
                        Bingo. Years later, city got safer. 
                        We got richer. 

           Ray steps closer, ignoring the dot on his neck. 

                                 RAY
                        WHERE. IS. SHE. 

           Tremonte stares a beat. 

                                 TREMONTE
                        I’ve seen you around the station 
                        for what, ten years? Just now, I 
                        see what people kept telling me. 
                        The Gun Show was not to be fucked
                        with. But the show ends tonight. 

           Tosses a tablet to Ray. We see KIM ON IT, live feed. A 
           Shotgun duct taped around her neck. 

                                 TREMONTE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t care about your kid; I just 
                        wanted say goodbye to Harry. You 
                        were a great cop. One of the best. 

           A MOMENT OF SILENCE. 

                                 HARRY
                        Still am. 
           Spinning in a FLASH, releasing TWO FLASH BANGS, which stun 
           Tremonte.

           Harry tosses a small IED into the courtyard -- BOOMING OFF 
           SCREEN. Debris rains down on them. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        STICK TO THE PLAN!

           Click go THE GUN SHOW’S MATCHING REVOLVERS, except this time, 
           Harry tosses one to Ray. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        MOVE! 

           In sync, moving swiftly now. Bullets ring out from across the 
           courtyard. Tremonte on their tail. 

                                 TREMONTE
                        I’LL KILL YOUR KID RAY! CEASE FIRE!

           Our guys bank to the highest point. Leading all the Narc’s 
           attention right here. 

           They slide for cover behind the brick pile, looking down 50FT
           to the rolling, dark, East River. 

           They look to each other -- 

                                 HARRY & RAY
                        FUCK! 

           Harry sees a giant vintage neon sign that says “IT’S PEPSI
           TIME” with a flashing Pepsi bottle under a working clock.  

           It ticks 12:05. 

                                 RAY
                        WHERE?

           Shots rings down. 

                                 HARRY
                        You hear that?

           Shoots twice. 

                                 RAY
                        Train’s pulling up to the station! 

           Stepping into the LINE OF FIRE, emptying his guns alongside 
           Ray, who finishes his. 
           Out of shells. Discharge smoke clears. Our guys are 
           SURROUNDED by Tremonte and his NARC CREW. 

                                 TREMONTE
                        Every show comes to an end.  

           Doing the unthinkable -- he and Ray STEP OFF THE FALLING 
           LEDGE and FREE FALL to the choppy tides below --

           Leaving Tremonte and his crew atop the Castle, which TUMBLES, 
           bringing down Tremonte’s crew as a bricks chase after them. 

           THUD. 

           Tremonte and his guys get to their feet. Looking around -- 

           Ray and Harry are gone. 

                                 TREMONTE (CONT’D)
                        FIND THEM!  

           Suddenly, the NARC’S faces drop. Because -- 

           Harry and Ray look down from the deck of a small boat. Hurt, 
           but alive. Baiting the NARCS to this spot. 

           They turn back, two guns each, trained at the dirty NARCS. 

                                 TREMONTE (CONT’D)
                        You can’t kill eight cops!

                                 JUNIOR
                        Who said anything about killing?

           NARCS look at each other -- this is too easy. 

                                 HARRY
                        Tremonte. You should know better 
                        then to fuck with -- 

           From inside the boat -- pops COWIE!

                                 RAY/HARRY/COWIE
                        THE. NEW. GUN. SHOW!  

           Cowie unloads RUBBER RIOT PELLETS, stunning the NARCS!

           Ray and Harry move one-by-one, binding the knocked out NARCS 
           in ZIPCUFFS. Looking around -- missing one. 

                                 RAY
                        Where’s Tremonte?! 

           Up ahead: Tremonte, bloody as hell, makes a run for it! 
                                 HARRY
                        He’s on the move! 

                                 JUNIOR
                        GET back up! GO!

                                 COWIE
                        FINISH HIM! 

           Gunning her engines away from the action. 

                                 HARRY
                        You either smoke, or you get 
                        smoked.

           Tremonte nearly hits them with distant shots. We reload. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        And we got smoked!  

                                 HARRY
                        You quote me? 

           Tremonte is getting away. They pursue, running into gunfire.

           Harry and Ray duck behind the FENCE under the giant sign. Out 
           of breathe, sopping wet, shot up. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck this feels good! 

           Shooting back at Tremonte. 

                                 RAY
                        He’s got Kim! We gotta move! 

           JUST AS a new shot nearly punches his ticket from the 
           opposite direction. Pinning them. 

                                 HARRY
                        It’s coming from both sides! 

           Shots rain from two angles now. 

                                 RAY
                        How? We got everyone else!

           Harry lays down on the ground, crawls to get a view from 
           behind a car. FREEZES. 

           The second shooter is THE FIGURE IN BLACK. 
           SHOT UP CAR

           In the chaos -- 

                                 HARRY
                        12 O’CLOCK! 

           Ray looks. Harry reloads. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Ray’s killer is here! 

           Taking a SHOT IN THE HIP. Exit wound. 

                                 RAY
                        Split up! Tremonte has Kim. He’s 
                        mine! Get the shooter!

           Harry nods. 

                                 HARRY
                        Like Ray used to set it off. 
                        Informer on 3. 2. 1 -- 

           Harry and Ray SPRING UP and UNLOAD to Snow’s “Informer” -- 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        INFORMER!!!

           Running ahead before splitting --

                                 RAY AND HARRY
                        You-know-sho-nat-a-me-can-play!

           Shooting back-to-back to the chorus --

                                 RAY AND HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Ill-lickey-boom-boom-nedge!

           The coast clears momentarily -- 

                                 HARRY
                        LET’S NYPDDDDDDD (motions)

           Ray reloads --

                                 RAY
                        SHUT THE FUCK UP! GO! 

           He’s off, chasing Tremonte ahead. Waiting. Ray fires THREE 
           SHOTS to get his attention. 

           Tremonte looks back, shoots errantly, takes off RIGHT AT 
           JUNIOR! 
                                 TREMONTE
                        YOU’RE NOT READY FOR THIS! 

           Coming right for him. Ray stands and faces his nemesis. Both 
           shooting at each other. Getting closer. Running full steam!

           As the last second, Ray jumps ON THE GROUND into a GUTTER. 
           Tremonte races OVERHEAD -- right a DEMO SITE. Crashing 
           through a series of metal beams below. 

           Dust settles. 

           Ray gets to his feet. Pulls a gun. Sees Tremonte clutching 
           his shoulder. On his feet. Duck into the open-air WAITING 
           STATION for the TRAM TO MANHATTAN. 

           Ray can’t get a safe shot off. Lowers his gun. 

                                 RAY
                        I’m coming honey. 

           CREEK

           In the FDR projects. Harry and the Figure In Black exchange 
           shots as the Figure hides behind a DUMPSTER. 

           Harry crawls up. Shots are fired. People duck. Harry sees The 
           Figure bolt, gives chase with EVERYTHING HE’S GOT. 

           WITH A SHOT LEG.  

           They jumps over a large stone fence and, still under the 
           blinking light of the Pepsi Sign, The Figure turns and shoots 
           HARRY A SECOND TIME, right through the arm. 

           Harry trips. Lands his own shot in The Figure’s side, slowing 
           him down. Harry jumps over the hood of a parked car and drags 
           The Figure to his knees. 

           PINNING HIM. 

           Spinning the body over. The Hood finally comes off:

           Off Harry’s WIDE EYES -- 

           It’s WALLACE, from Ray’s deal gone bad. 

           THEY BOTH FREEZE. 

                                                         FLASH-BACK TO:
           INT. HARLEM -- CLUB -- 1996

               A CREW OF THUGS aiming guns at Ray and Harry.  

                                 WALLACE OS
                        RUN!  

           Harry and Ray turn to book it as -- BANG! 

           Wallace clutches his HEART. Blood flows from the impact 
           wound, he lands at Ray’s feet, dead. 

           BACK TO SCENE: 

           Harry and Wallace dive for their guns. Grabbing each other, 
           turning, BANG BANG BANG! Both men CRASH. 

           TRAM STATION

           Careful not to hit any of the waiting PASSENGERS, Ray 
           silently stalks Tremonte, until the Tram arrives. 

                                 RAY
                        NYPD!!! DOWN!!!

           Fires a shot into the air to clear the area. Chaos. 

           Tremonte sees Ray and boards the Tram. In the last possible 
           second, Ray shoots through the side window and jumps through 
           the breaking glass. 

           The two size each other up. Ray attacks. Tremonte is a 
           brawler, and beats the living shit out of the guy, who keeps 
           taking the pounding of a lifetime. 

           Between the blows --

                                 TREMONTE
                        You’re after the wrong guy!

                                 RAY
                        Doesn’t look that way!

           Getting a single shot in to Tremonte’s nose. Blood runs. He 
           responds with a vicious series of body shots. Ray crashes to 
           the floor. 

           The Tram is now 150FT ABOVE THE RIVER. A Second Tram is 
           approaching theirs on a separate line of cables. 200FT OUT. 
                                 TREMONTE
                        Truth is, your old man was the 
                        greatest cop I knew, but he never 
                        found an heir to his badge. 

           The Second Tram getting closer. Tremonte has Ray in a choke 
           hold. He cannot breathe, let alone speak. 

           Tremonte chambers a shot. 

                                 RAY
                        Where’s Kim?! TELL ME!

           Defeated. On last leg. Beaten to a pulp. 

                                 TREMONTE
                        Insurance. 

           Points to the one incoming. 50 FT OUT. 

                                 TREMONTE (CONT’D)
                        Your kid’s on that tram. 

           Close enough where we can see KIM, bound to a safety pole.  

           Seconds away. 

                                 TREMONTE (CONT’D)
                        That’s how this ends Junior.

           Puts the guy to Ray’s head. 

                                 RAY
                        I’m not Junior.  

           Playing possum. 

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        It’s Ray. 

           Distracting Tremonte for a split second. All he needs. 

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        Like my father. 

           In one move:

           Ray plunges Tremonte’s own waist KNIFE into his gut. 

           JUMPS across the OPEN AIR, landing in the second Tram, where 
           he grabs Kim before JUMPING BACK INTO THE FIRST TRAM -- 

           Where he lands and drives the same blade in Tremonte’s chest, 
           who cannot believe his eyes. Ray got the drop on him. 
           Ray then jumps with no time left OFF THE TRAM, floating 
           across the open gap between the two, barely catching the door 
           of the second. Kim pulls him in. 

           He covers her. They look back and see Tremonte holding the 
           knife in his chest, as he tumbles off the tram...

           Slamming into the dark East River. Gone in the abyss. 

           Ray turns to his daughter. She looks at him. Glass covered, 
           shot, bleeding. A miracle dad. 

                                 KIM
                        That...was...awesome. 

           Ray gives us the slightest smile. 

           They pull into the Tram Station. Ray holds her girl.  

                                 RAY
                        I gotta help Harry. 

           Kisses her head. She grabs him; doesn’t want him to go. 

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        He’d do it for us. 

           Whistling over to an APPROACHING POLICE SEDAN. 

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        My daughter's life is in your 
                        hands.

           Grabs the COPS gun from his own holster. 

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        Anything happens: I’ll personally 
                        watch Harry Johnson rape you with 
                        my dad’s dick. Got me?  

           The cops stare at him, speechless. 

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        Get on the radio. Call for backup!

           He books it in the police sedan. Leaving everyone behind. 
           Cops look at Kim. 

                                 COP
                        Who the hell was that?

           Ray’s already out. Kim’s face lights with pride. 
                                 KIM
                        My Dad. 

           PROJECTS

           Wallace and Harry come to, each bleeding out just feet from 
           each other. Two sworn enemies. 

                                 WALLACE
                        You should’ve seen it coming!

           Harry’s eyes come to. They back crawl in extreme pain to the 
           ONE FREE GUN about 6 feet away. 

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        You were too deep! 

           Wallace is closer. Harry struggles. 

                                 HARRY
                        Fuck you. We PROTECTED YOU!

                                 WALLACE
                        Dog eat dog!

           Pulling at Wallace’s leg, pressing into a GUN WOUND. Wallace 
           jams his hand into Harry’s wound. SCREAMS. 

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        I put a bullet in your ass twenty 
                        years ago. 

           Reaching bloody fingers barely grasp the trigger, lifting the 
           metal, pointing it at Harry -- 

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        Next one’s your last. 

           JUST AS

           WHAM! An NYPD SEDAN crashes in. Coming RIGHT FOR THEM. 

           Wallace OPENS FIRE -- hitting the wind shied three times. He 
           checks the chamber. ONE SHOT. 

           The sedan comes to a halt, and, in a single motion a la Harry 
           in Harlem, Ray pops out with a gun drawn and has it trained 
           RIGHT ON WALLACE --

           Who puts Harry in a headlock, gun to temple. 

           STAND OFF. 
                                 RAY
                        You killed my father!

                                 WALLACE
                        How the game goes. 

                                 RAY
                        Fuck you! 

           Ray cocks his gun. Steps closer. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Take another step -- partner dies. 

                                 RAY
                        He’s not my partner. 

           Ready to squeeze the trigger. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Decision time: you kill the man who 
                        got your pops, or you watch Harry 
                        take one in the head. 

           BEAT. 

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        Me or him. Who matters more?

           Harry looks at Ray. DO IT. 

                                 RAY
                        I’m not the one who wants YOU dead. 

           Confusing Wallace for a fraction of a second -- 

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        That’s my brother’s job. Give him 
                        the finger Harry.    

           Wallace clutches Harry -- who’s giving him the middle finger. 
           The black middle finger. The Gun Show’s middle finger. 

                                 WALLACE
                        What the fuck is that?  

                                 RAY
                        That’s The Gun Show, giving you the 
                        finger from the grave. 

           Wallace blinks. 
           Ray tosses his GUN in the air, never once taking his eyes off 
           Wallace -- who reacts and FIRE HIS LAST BULLET into Ray’s 
           chest -- sending him flying backwards. 

           Just as --

           Ray’s gun descends -- Harry grabs it and with one free hand 
           spins the barrel and POP -- 

           Shots WALLACE through the chin. 

           The Gun Show gun-toss classic. Finally worked. 

           Harry crawls to Ray -- clutching his shoulder. Shot. Bullet 
           inside. Both men bleeding to death. 

           They lay in peace for a second. Then, finally --

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you. 

                                 HARRY
                        Fuck you back.   

           Give him the black middle finger. They smile. 

           HELICOPTERS SWARM overhead. NYPD and EMT coming in the 
           distance. Lights reflect off their bloody, victorious faces. 

           ON Ray and Harry, taking in the moment. Brothers.

           A picture of Chief Halls’ late husband sits a top a fresh 
           grave. The service comes to an end. 

           Halls is approached by the guys. Badges proudly swing around 
           their necks. Harry chews Nicorette gum. Ray’s tie is looser. 

                                 HARRY
                        He was a great man.

                        didn’t get away. So would your 
                        father.

           They nod. Ray, proud of himself for once. 

           They walk in silence. Chief Halls slips them paperwork.

                        pension. Case closed. Congrats. 

           The guys just stare at each other.

                        Suppose we both stayed here, can we 
                        make one request?

           The partners cruise through the sea of COPS. Aligned. 
           Respected. Tossing their transfer papers in the garbage. 

           Cowie joins their cool-kids strut through the pit. 

           Harry gives her a pound. Ray gives her a gun.
