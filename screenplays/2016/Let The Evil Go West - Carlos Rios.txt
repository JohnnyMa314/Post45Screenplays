        DAY
        NIGHT
           FADE IN ON

           THE VAST ALPINE-DESERT OF SOUTHEASTERN WYOMING

           Petrified country stretching far back to a jagged horizon.

           We can just make out a horse-drawn wagon -- a speck against 
           the landscape -- moving leftward.  Thin trail of dust in its 
           wake.

           THE COVERED WAGON

           is piloted by HOWARD, late 20s, easygoing.  

           And sitting beside him is

           CURTIN
           30s, cleaning a six-shooter, leaned back.  At ease, but 
           nonetheless his resting face is intense, guarded.

           INSIDE THE WAGON

           prospecting tools CLANK around.

           PAUL
           19, naive, good-natured, perpetually grinning.

           Sitting across from him is

           DOBBS
           30s, uneasy, using a knife to tighten screws driven in at 
           weird angles around the top of a 

           LARGE WOODEN KEG
           with the words “BLACK POWDER” branded on the side.

                                 PAUL
                        Ain’t it funny, Uncle Dobbs?  Us 
                        stumblin across this before we even 
                        make it out West.

                                 DOBBS
                        Us?

                                 PAUL
                        Well, you.  But the particular 
                        person, that was just timing.

                                 DOBBS
                        Timing amounts to quite a bit in 
                        Nebraska.
                                 HOWARD (O.S.)
                            (correcting)
                        Wyoming.

                                 DOBBS
                        Already?

                                 PAUL
                        All I’m sayin is that was a stroke 
                        and a half of good luck for us.

           Dobbs’ countenance darkens at the sound of that word: “us”.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Real good.

           EDGE OF A FOREST

           Wagon pulled over.  Nascent sunset casting spindly shadows 
           over an auburn ground.  

           A few yards away, the four men sit just outside the tree 
           line, eating a supper of biscuits and bacon. 

           Dobbs stares into the wagon, at the black powder keg.  

                                 CURTIN
                        You feelin alright?

                                 DOBBS
                        I’m pondering.

                                 CURTIN
                        What on?

                                 DOBBS
                        What a man could do with all that.

                                 PAUL
                        What four men could each do with a 
                        quarter of all that.

                                 HOWARD
                        Still a whole lot.

                                 CURTIN
                            (wary)
                        And what d’ye figure you’d do with 
                        it?

           Dobbs is staring at the ground, perhaps considering the 
           question, or maybe deep in another thought altogether.
                                 HOWARD
                            (chuckles, to Curtin)
                        I think our friend’s been drinkin 
                        s’more.

                                 PAUL
                        Uncle Dobbs?

           He snaps out of it.

                                 DOBBS
                        We better get that thing tucked 
                        away.  Indians happen by and get a 
                        look, that’ll be the end of us.

           He gets to his feet.

                                 DOBBS (CONT’D)
                        Give me a hand, kid.

           FOREST

           The sinking sun tints the trees almost mauve.

           Paul struggles to drag the heavy keg while Dobbs, holding a 
           shovel, examines a clearing in the forest.

                                 DOBBS
                        This feels right.

           Paul lets out a sigh.

                                 PAUL
                        Thank God.

           He straightens up

           THE KEG
           Its presence dominates the rest of this scene, the remaining 
           action playing out in BG.

                                 DOBBS
                        Do me a favor.  Feel the soil 
                        there.  Tell me if it’s soft.

           Paul crouches, his back to Dobbs.

                                 PAUL
                        Well, how soft is sof--

           CLANG!
           Dobbs cracks the flat of the shovel over Paul’s head, and 
           Paul crumples.

           Dobbs looks over his shoulder to make sure the coast is 
           clear.

           Paul groans.

           CLANG!  CRUNCH!

           Dobbs hits him twice, waits a beat to make sure he’s dead, 
           then stomps the shovel into the earth.

           He grabs Paul’s feet, about to drag him when the sound of a 
           PISTOL COCKING makes him spin around.

           Curtin enters frame, pointing a gun at Dobbs.

                                 CURTIN
                        Goddamn you, Dobbs.  I was tellin 
                        myself I was wrong.

                                 DOBBS
                        The kid was gonna try to take it 
                        from me.
                            (beat)
                        And so are you.

           Dobbs reaches for his own holster, but BANG!

           Curtin shoots him square in the chest and Dobbs drops to the 
           ground.

           Curtin backs away, gun still trained on Dobbs, but the moment 
           he drops his guard, Dobbs snatches his own pistol free from 
           his belt and BANG BANG BANG!

           Dobbs lands three nonfatal shots before Curtin can shoot 
           once, hitting Dobbs in the stomach this time.  

           Curtin stumbles to the ground, falling into a bush.

           Dobbs fires three more times, only one of those bullets 
           finding Curtin, but that’s all it takes.

           CLICK.  Dobbs tries another shot but he’s dry.

           Curtin isn’t moving.

           Dobbs chucks his gun.

           Howard rushes in a moment later.
                                 HOWARD
                        Oh, Jesus.  Aw, Jesus, what the 
                        hell happened?

                                 DOBBS
                        Help.  I need help.

           Howard kneels by Dobbs.

                                 HOWARD
                        Dobbs--

           Dobbs unsheathes a knife and plunges it into Howard’s 
           stomach.  Howard falls back in shock.

           Dobbs gets onto all fours and pulls the knife from Howard’s 
           stomach and jams it into his throat and forces the blade 
           across until Howard is half-decapitated.  

           Dobbs attempts to stand, but he’s too badly wounded.  He 
           crawls to the keg.  Pulls his upper body up onto it and then 
           collapses, slumped over the keg, bleeding, panting.

                                 DOBBS
                        Please...

           Blood oozes down the side of the keg.

           His breathing stops.

           FADE TO BLACK.

           FADE IN ON

           A BIG CORRAL

           Cattle grazing among the chaparral. 

           Evergreen-dotted mountains almost black against a bright, 
           cerulean sky.

           TITLE CARD: 1867

                                 ABNER (O.S.)
                        Few years back, ‘64 or so, I knew a 
                        fella.  Edward.  Company G, 6th 
                        Battalion, Pittsylvania.  Me and 
                        him were color guard, stood 
                        shoulder to shoulder.  Edward spent 
                        five years up in New York before 
                        the war, learnin engineering.
           PULL BACK SLOWLY as V.O. continues.

                                 ABNER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I watched Edward tear clean in half 
                        from cannon fire.  Died before he 
                        could build a goddamn thing with 
                        all that schoolin.  Makes a man 
                        wonder.  There was plenty more like 
                        him.  You see that in a war, and it 
                        makes a man wonder what his thing 
                        is and whether he gets to do it.

           And now we’ve PULLED BACK to the point where we realize we 
           were looking outside through an open door, from within a 
           shack.  Much darker in here than outside.

                                 ABNER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        My wife ain’t much for plans.  Me, 
                        I think a plan’s the only thing you 
                        can’t take away from a man, so I 
                        always had mine.  Marry the girl, 
                        win the war, make somethin of 
                        myself.

           Continue PULLING BACK until we see the man we’ve been 
           listening to -- ABNER ELLIS, late 30s, heavy beard -- a dour 
           intensity to his face and his words.  Wearing whatever a man 
           can find for cheap in 1867.  

           He’s standing in front of a table where a MAN IN A HAT sits, 
           his back to us, listening to Abner too.  

           At Abner’s feet is a blue-merle Border Collie.  Her name is 
           BISCUIT.  She sits patiently, watching the Man in the Hat.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Up ‘til now, my plan was get here, 
                        talk to you ‘bout one of them bulls 
                        outside.  I sold everything but 
                        these clothes to put this money in 
                        my pocket -- everything I brought 
                        with me to Colorado, the piss poor 
                        crops I could get out the soil we 
                        settled on, I even sold my horse.  
                        Walked four days, just me and 
                        Biscuit here, to get to your ranch, 
                        talk about one of them bulls.  And 
                        now I’m here, and the plan is a cow-
                        calf operation.  Raisin’ beef.  Got 
                        my heifers back home -- three of 
                        em, all proven.  A bull from you 
                        sets it in motion. 
           The man at the table leans back in his chair, sizing Abner 
           up.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        You ever wonder if there’s a bigger 
                        thing than you to put your life 
                        toward?  My wife and my boy, I 
                        reckon maybe they’re it.

                                 MAN IN THE HAT
                        Family’s the biggest thing there 
                        is.

                                 ABNER
                        They say the land out here tests a 
                        man.  Puts him on his last legs and 
                        sees if he can still stand.  Well, 
                        here I am.  Standin in front of 
                        you.  It’s right now or it ain’t at 
                        all.  The money I got here, it 
                        ain’t what most fellas would call 
                        “enough”, but it’s every penny I 
                        got to my name.  So I figure what 
                        I’m askin is for you to help a 
                        family man and his family not end 
                        up like that fella Edward.  Passin 
                        on...unspent.

           CATTLE RANCH

           Abner leads his new bull by a rope.  Biscuit keeping pace.  
           The ranch behind them.

           Slung over the bull is a satchel and a holstered rifle.

           On Abner’s face, a yonderly expression we’ll get used to.  

           He notices a foot-long rectangle of torn fabric snagged in 
           dead sagebrush.  He pulls it free.  A fig leaf pattern, sun-
           bleached into near oblivion.  

           Abner cracks a smile, stuffs the cloth into his shirt pocket.

           WILDERNESS

           Abner within the glow of a modest campfire, cooking a single 
           potato in a re-purposed tin.  

           He pulls the potato off the fire, cuts a small chunk off, 
           blows on it to cool it down.  
           He WHISTLES to get Biscuit’s attention, then tosses her the 
           piece.  She catches it.

           HILLY PLAINS

           Abner crests a golden hill and lays eyes on --

           HIS HOME
           A couple hundred yards away.  Isolated.  Modest, even at this 
           distance.  

           And in an animal enclosure near the home, a plume of smoke 
           billows from a heap atop the grass.

           ABNER
           panics.  Drops the bull’s reins and rips the rifle from its 
           scabbard and takes off toward the house.  

           Biscuit giving chase.

           A hundred yards out.

                                 ABNER
                        Elspeth!  Elspeth!

           Closing the gap.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Benjamin!

           And Abner is close enough now to see that in the enclosure is 

           A PILE OF CHARRED CATTLE
           Three of them.  Shotgun holes in their heads.  Tiny flames 
           still licking at the carcasses.

           Abner stops and stares for just a moment, then starts for the 
           house again -- but the sight of the blackened cattle keeps 
           him from leaving.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Elspeth!

           Abner hops the fence into the enclosure, toward the cows.

           Out of the house wanders

           BENJAMIN
           10, freckled.  Insouciant.

           Abner, desperate, flings dirt onto the cows to put out the 
           straggling flames.
                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                            (to Benjamin)
                        Where’s your ma!

           Before the boy can answer

           ELSPETH (29)
           hurries out of the house, ready to allay Abner’s panic.

                                 ELSPETH
                            (Scottish accent)
                        We’re okay, Abner.

           The fire is dead and Abner deflates, realizing now how late 
           he is.

                                 ABNER
                        Cheyenne?  Or Sioux?

                                 ELSPETH
                        I did it.  They got sick, the lot 
                        of em.  First one, then by day 
                        after it was the other two.

                                 ABNER
                        Sick how?

                                 ELSPETH
                        There were sores on their tongues, 
                        their legs.  And they weren’t 
                        acting like theirselves.  They 
                        seemed frenzied.  Dangerous.  
                        Frightening.  I had to do it.  
                        There was something very wrong 
                        /with em.

                                 ABNER
                            (over)
                        You tie em up and keep em separate!  
                        Ain’t no need to... 

           It’s obvious he doesn’t even believe his own argument, but 
           he’s too overwhelmed to be reasonable.

                                 ELSPETH
                        You don’t know if an affliction 
                        like that can pass on to people.  
                        Ben and me were...  

                                 ABNER
                        Were what?
                            (points at dead cattle)
                        That was all of it!  Everything!
           Abner glances over his shoulder, at that bull still up there 
           on the hill -- useless now.

                                 ELSPETH
                            (pleading)
                        I had to kill em, Abner.

           Without a word, Abner walks away, toward the house.

           ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW
           shows Abner inside the spartan farmhouse stacking up blankets 
           and pillows on a bed.  He drops to his knees and buries his 
           face into the pile of bedding and SCREAMS.  Several times.  

           It’s too muffled to tell if these are words or formless 
           guttural noises, but we can still hear the anguish through 
           his attempt to stifle himself.

           He pulls back and collects himself.  Stands.

           He heads outside and stops a few paces past the door.

           He stares at Elspeth.

           He walks over to her.  Places a hand on her shoulder.

                                 ABNER
                        Okay.

           IN THE HOUSE

           Benjamin sleeps while Abner and Elspeth sit at a small table.

                                 ABNER
                        That pile of bones out there, that 
                        was food, and firewood, and 
                        blankets, and supplies.  I mean, 
                        that was...that was our strategy.

                                 ELSPETH
                        I know, love.  

           She squeezes his hand.  She has a sheepish look to her, 
           clearly still feeling guilty.  And Abner’s lamentations 
           aren’t making things any easier.

                                 ABNER
                        What’s next?  I didn’t have another 
                        plan.

                                 ELSPETH
                        We have this family.  That got us 
                        all the way from Virginia.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELSPETH (CONT'D)
                        It got you through a war.  It built 
                        this house.

           That doesn’t seem good enough for Abner.

                                 ABNER
                        I’m set here waitin still, for that 
                        knowledge of what it is I’m here in 
                        this place to do.  It sure don’t 
                        look like cattle-raisin’.

                                 ELSPETH
                        You’re here to survive.

           Abner stews.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        All of us are.  And I know you’ll 
                        do what ye need to.  As will I.

           She notices the fabric stuffed in Abner’s shirt pocket, pulls 
           it out, inspects it.

                                 ABNER
                        Found that.  Reckon you can finally 
                        patch up your dress like you been 
                        wishin you could.

                                 ELSPETH
                        I sold me needle and thread weeks 
                        ago.  For those potatoes.
                            (smiles)
                        But you’re sweet for thinkin of it.  
                        Is this a fig leaf pattern?  

           Abner gives a weak nod.  He stares out through a window.

                                 ABNER
                        Captain once told me -- this was in 
                        Richmond or thereabout, after the 
                        6th took a beatin -- he told me a 
                        man who believes there’s a bigger 
                        purpose to himself is often harder 
                        to kill.  I told him back, “If 
                        you’re right, Cap’n, then I reckon 
                        I can’t never die.”

           He smirks at his own cleverness.  But that light in his eye 
           is brief.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                            (beat)
                        More and more that’s seemin like a 
                        punishment.
           ANIMAL ENCLOSURE

           KSSHT!  A shovel plunges into the earth.

           Abner flings a pile of dirt out from a chest-deep hole.  He’s 
           sweaty, angry, pensive.

           The burnt cows are still on the surface, waiting to be rolled 
           into the mass grave.

           Benjamin watches from the other side of the fence, mimicking 
           Abner’s movements, using a large stick as his shovel.  

           Abner tosses another pile of dirt.  He notices Benjamin, and 
           his face softens, the anger fading.

                                 ABNER
                        You waitin for me to finish?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Can we play a battle?

                                 ABNER
                        I got this to do.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Will you get sick if you touch 
                        them?

                                 ABNER
                        No, your ma burnt that all away.
                            (beat)
                        You don’t have to be scared.

           Benjamin unlatches the gate and walks over to Abner.  The boy 
           eyes the cows.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Will you bury them upside down?

                                 ABNER
                        Why would I do that?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        If you bury a horse upside down 
                        then your soul gets to ride it 
                        after you die and the devil won’t 
                        never catch you.

                                 ABNER
                        Says who?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Ma told me.
                                 ABNER
                        Your ma’s got superstitions I ain’t 
                        never even heard of.  You know what 
                        superstition means?

           Benjamin nods.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t bother with em.
                            (re: cows)
                        These are goin in the ground any 
                        which way they fall.  They ain’t no 
                        horses.  And I ain’t gonna raise 
                        cattle in the afterlife, I can tell 
                        ya that.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Will I raise cattle when I get 
                        bigger?  

                                 ABNER
                        You get to decide that.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        James says he’s gonna do whatever 
                        his Pa’s doing in Chicago.

                                 ABNER
                        James got folks that don’t know no 
                        better than to tell him that.  
                        Don’t pay him no mind.  Just hear 
                        me.  A man -- and you’ll be one 
                        soon -- he needs to have a thing in 
                        mind and then put every bit of 
                        himself to gettin that thing.  
                        Don’t let no one convince you 
                        different, not James, not even your 
                        ma.  There ain’t enough time in 
                        life to not know what you’re gonna 
                        do when you wake up in the mornin.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        What if I don’t know?

                                 ABNER
                        Then you might as well be a piano 
                        key.  And what does a piano key do?

           Benjamin shrugs.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Whatever the fella playin it wants 
                        it to do.  And that ain’t no kinda 
                        life.
                                 BENJAMIN
                        Well I wanna be...

           He furrows his brow, as deep in thought as a nine-year-old 
           can be.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        Hmm...

                                 ABNER
                        You’ll figure that out.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I will?

                                 ABNER
                        That’s why we moved West.  Land of 
                        opportunity. 

           WIDE on Abner standing in the grave, the dead cattle beside 
           him awaiting their burial.

           THE WOODS

           A rifle barrel glides across frame until we see the face of 
           the man holding it:

           ABNER
           aiming down the sights as he stalks through the trees.

                                 ABNER
                        You hear that?
                            (beat)
                        There’s someone in here.  In the 
                        trees.  

           BENJAMIN
           stands abreast of his father, holding his large stick as a 
           rifle now, mimicking Abner’s stance.

           He points his “rifle” in a new direction.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Over there!

           He makes a gunshot noise with his mouth and runs up to a 
           tree.

           Abner runs with him, drops to one knee and makes a gunshot 
           noise.

           Benjamin fires again.
                                 ABNER
                        You got him.  

           They walk to a spot on the ground and look down at the dirt.  
           Abner mimes nudging a body with his foot.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Well done.  I ain’t even seen him.

           Benjamin beams with pride.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I think I’ll be a soldier.  

                                 ABNER
                        When you get older?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Like how you were.

                                 ABNER
                        Need a war on first.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        It’s either that or...hmmm...

           The boy reaches into his pocket and pulls out a penny.

                                 ABNER
                        What are you doin?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Flipping this to choose what I’ll 
                        be when I get big.

           He flips it up high and Abner snatches it out of the air.

                                 ABNER
                        Where’d you get this?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I won it from James because I beat 
                        him in a race up the hill.

                                 ABNER
                        You know what this is?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        A penny.

                                 ABNER
                        It’s money.  Even this.

           Abner scrutinizes the penny.
                                 BENJAMIN
                        I won it fair and square.  And 
                        James didn’t take it neither.  He 
                        got it from his grandpa for milking 
                        their cow last week.

           Abner stares at the boy intensely, struck by a sudden 
           thought.

           THE ELLIS HOME IN BACKGROUND

           As Abner walks away from it.

           REVERSE ANGLE
           shows us he’s making his way to another house.  His 
           “neighbor” in this vast landscape.

           OUT FRONT OF NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE

           Abner KNOCKS on the door.  He stares at the penny in his 
           hand.  

           A COWBELL JINGLES.  Abner looks up at a single cow in a small 
           enclosure adjoining the house.

           SOUND OF A LATCH on the other side of the door.  Abner hides 
           the penny in his pocket before

           THE DOOR OPENS
           And standing in the doorway is JIM -- late 50s, smiling.

                                 JIM
                        Abner.

                                 ABNER
                        Hey, Jim.  Ask you a question?

           INSIDE JIM’S HOUSE

           The men at a table.  Windows behind them frame a woman and 
           young boy out back, tending to the cow.

                                 JIM
                        Cow-calf operation, that’s...you’re 
                        talkin a business.  Business need 
                        hell of a lot more’n two piece o’ 
                        inventory.  What happened to your 
                        heifers is the reason why.  And my 
                        bull a few months ago.  Bit by a 
                        rattler.  Naw.
                                 ABNER
                        My bull, your cow, that’s only the 
                        beginning.  It sounds small, but 
                        you gotta start small, don’t you?  
                        Only way to get bigger.

                                 JIM
                        I don’t got the stomach for 
                        endeavors.  My daughter and 
                        grandson, that’s enough occupation.

                                 ABNER
                        I’m okay with runnin things myself.  
                        Nothin’ll change for you, ‘cept the 
                        money you’ll be makin.

                                 JIM
                        I’m old enough to know that’s never 
                        how these things work out.

                                 ABNER
                        How’s that?

                                 JIM
                        The way one plans em.

           Abner stares out the window, frustrated.  There’s no 
           convincing this man.

                                 ABNER
                        What’ll you leave behind for em 
                        when you pass?  This claim that 
                        can’t grow nothin?  This house?  
                        One cow?

                                 JIM
                        Yes.  And on top of that I’ll leave 
                        em every day that I spent with em.  
                        Everything I taught her, and she 
                        passed onto him.  And maybe that 
                        don’t cut it for some, but dammit 
                        that’s a sight better than my 
                        father left me.

                                 ABNER
                        You’re right.

                                 JIM
                        Oh?

                                 ABNER
                        That ain’t enough for some.

           Beat.
                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        How’m I supposed to make somethin 
                        outta nothin?

                                 JIM
                        Ain’t that the question.  This 
                        country...  A man come out here 
                        naked and penniless, well, that’s 
                        probably how he’ll leave the world, 
                        and not long after.
                            (beat)
                        Hell, I don’t mean to discourage 
                        ya.

           Abner waves it off.

                                 ABNER
                        Been thinkin about the war.  Say 
                        what you will about that, but it 
                        put money in my pocket.

                                 JIM
                        If war’s what you’re lookin for, 
                        there’s one up north, in Julesburg.  
                        War against nature.  Up in them 
                        plains.

           Abner looks confused.  

           Jim’s lips peel back a xanthic grin.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Railroad’s comin.  They fixin to 
                        build it all the way West to 
                        California.

                                 ABNER
                        Railroad...

           Jim nods.

                                 JIM
                        Mornin, night.  Way I hear it, they 
                        never stop.  You’d fit right in.

           INSIDE A WAGON

           Full of hopeful workers.  Thin shafts of light outlining the 
           dust within, kicked up by the horses that are pulling this 
           thing.

           ABNER 
           Squeezed between two men.  
           He’s turning the penny over in his hand.  A Native American’s 
           head on one side, “ONE CENT” on the other.

           FRONT OF TRACK

           A FOREMAN cups hands over mouth.

                                 FOREMAN
                        Down!!

           We get a glimpse of all the different jobs as WORKERS build:

           Hauling the rails into place.

           Dropping rail spikes at regular intervals.

           Setting cottonwood ties under the iron.

           Tipping over empty carts so a horse at full gallop can 
           deliver the next one.

           All to the ceaseless drumbeat of sledgehammers pounding 
           spikes into the ground.

           Advancing the track almost as quickly as a man can walk.  In 
           perfect synchronicity -- a singular organism.  It’s a sight 
           to behold.

           LAND on DAN & JACK -- brothers, Irishmen, 40s, dressed in fur-
           trimmed military jackets.

           They size up Abner, who stands before them.

                                 DAN
                        No.

                        No?

                                 DAN
                        No.

                        Ye don’t have the build fer it.

                                 ABNER

                        any man makes the journey up here.

                        fer it.

                        I can swing a sledgehammer.

                                 JACK
                        How quickly?  How many times a day?

                                 JACK
                        Central Pacific -- that’s the rail 
                        comin this way from Sacramento -- 
                        they’re buildin their line East 
                        even as we build ours West.  So 
                        we’ve got to build faster’n them.  

                                 DAN
                        No, there’s no place for you on the 
                        front of track.  But we can put you 
                        to work on the grading team.

                                 ABNER
                        What’s that.

                        Fellas who’ve got the build fer it.

           Abner looks off into the distance as he considers.

                                 ABNER
                        Where do I go to take that job?

           MEDICINE BOW FOREST

           Looking out over a cliff edge.  Smooth, variegated tors jut 
           out from a dense evergreen forest below.

           PANNING LEFT across the gorgeous vista --

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Fire in the hole!

           -- until we’re looking at what’s up here on this rocky cliff 
           top.

           A COUPLE DOZEN GRADERS
           Dirt-cloaked, sweaty clothes matted to their skin.  Some 
           crouched, some standing, crowding together watching something 
           O.S.

           BOOM!  Somewhere ahead of them, an explosion.  A few of the 
           men gawk or grin, but for the majority of them the novelty of 
           exploding granite has worn off.

           The CLACKING of airborne rock returning to Earth.

           The men disperse.  Back to work.  Among them is ABNER, 
           holding a pickaxe.

           A CLOUD OF DUST
           hangs in the air from the explosion.  
           Some men pile rock bits into wheelbarrows.  Others drill the 
           next hole for explosives.

           Abner finds a stone chunk and CRACK! busts it up with his 
           pickaxe.  Other men do the same.

           He finds another rock that’s too large to lift.  CRACK! 
           CRACK!  It crumbles.

           A BOOM reverberates from somewhere in the distance.  Another 
           grading crew further ahead.

           A GANG BOSS oversees the work, and right next to him is 

           NATHANIEL
           40, black, wearing tattered Union blues and holding up a 
           wheelbarrow.  He scans the sky.  Something catches his 
           attention.  And then he claps eyes on Abner.

                                 NATHANIEL
                        Over there!  Get out the way!

           Abner looks at him, confused.

           Nathaniel drops the wheelbarrow and sprints toward Abner and 
           TACKLES him to the ground.  A split second later --

           CRUNCH!  A melon-sized, jagged hunk of granite smashes into 
           the spot where Abner was just standing.

           Abner stares at the impact mark, in shock.  A couple of the 
           Graders laugh.

                                 GANG BOSS
                        To work, fellas!  You too, 
                        Nathaniel.  That ground ain’t no 
                        bed!

           Nathaniel stands.  Abner sits up, still recovering.

                                 NATHANIEL
                        You new?

           Abner nods.

                                 NATHANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Well, that crew up ahead of ours, 
                        they use too much powder.  The 
                        bosses don’t do nothin about it 
                        because they’re clearing more rock 
                        that way.  But every time they set 
                        it off, we gotta watch the skies.
                                 ABNER
                        Yeah.

                                 NATHANIEL
                        You alright?

           Abner nods.

                                 ABNER
                        Thank you.

           GRADING CAMP

           Dozens of campfires, more men sitting at some than others.  
           Supper time.

           At a fire on their own are Abner and Nathaniel.

                                 ABNER
                        This don’t bother you none?

                                 NATHANIEL
                        You get used to the food.

                                 ABNER
                        I ain’t talkin about the food.  I’m 
                        talkin about all this.  Wake up, 
                        work, supper, sleep, then do it 
                        again.  A man needs a goal.

                                 NATHANIEL
                        In this wilderness, survival’s a 
                        lofty enough goal.  Country out 
                        here ain’t like settled places.  
                        There's somethin ancient about it 
                        all.  The land watches you back, 
                        out here.  Should give a man pause 
                        to lay track through this.  
                            (beat)
                        Not the Union Pacific.

                                 ABNER
                        Why are you out here?

                                 NATHANIEL
                        The War done put back together 
                        North and South, but this still 
                        ain’t a country ’til they connect 
                        East with West.  That’s what we a 
                        part of.

                                 ABNER
                        Us and a couple thousand other men.  
                                 NATHANIEL
                        I don’t fuss over having my name on 
                        the record.  I get to go back home 
                        to my children and tell them I 
                        built the railroad.  I had a part 
                        in the greatest thing men ever 
                        made.  

           He raises his eyebrows.

                                 NATHANIEL (CONT’D)
                        How’s that for a goal?  And in the 
                        mean time, I’m just tryna earn.  

                                 ABNER
                        Earn two dollars a day.

                                 NATHANIEL
                            (facetious)
                        Hey, that’s a competitive rate.

           Both men start laughing.

           MOUNTAIN CUT

           Early morning mist.

           A crowd of GRADERS stare at

           A MAN ON HORSEBACK
           GRENVILLE DODGE.  Early 30s, Union Army coat and cavalry hat.

           Near Dodge, the Gang Boss stands, arms crossed like an 
           officer staring his men into submission in the company of a 
           high-ranking guest.

                                 DODGE
                        Reason I traveled up here from the 
                        track is because Mr. Durant -- and 
                        for those of you who don’t know, 
                        that’s the man paying you -- Mr. 
                        Durant asked me to come here to 
                        tell you all about the deal he has 
                        with the government.  See, the 
                        Union Pacific takes in money from 
                        what you gentlemen are doing -- 
                        money it uses to pay you for your 
                        hard work so you can do more of it, 
                        and then to pay for the rail our 
                        other boys lay on the ground you 
                        clear.  You see, that’s a system.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DODGE (CONT'D)
                        But the Union Pacific doesn’t earn 
                        money on every inch you clear, or 
                        even every mile.  Washington only 
                        pays for every 50 miles of graded 
                        land.  That’s continuous grade.  
                        Now, you’ve all got less than a 
                        half-mile of granite between your 
                        two teams.  Call me proud but I 
                        think you can close the gap by 
                        supper tonight.  

           A few graders shake their heads at Dodge’s gall.

                                 DODGE (CONT’D)
                        They tell me you’re blasting at 
                        both ends, and I think that’s a 
                        fine idea, but there’s one angle 
                        you’re forgetting.  That’s up top.  
                        So what we’re doing today is taking 
                        a third of the men from both teams 
                        here and forming another gang.  
                        Those boys’ll blast their way down, 
                        and then start working outward from 
                        the inside.

                                 IRISH GRADER
                        We’re already dodgin rocks all day 
                        as it is.  Me nephew lost his leg 
                        on account o’ the black powder.  
                        Men’ll die today.

                                 GANG BOSS
                        Quit your complaining!  He calls 
                        the shots!

           Dodge holds up a hand to calm Gang Boss.

                                 DODGE
                        I want to ask you gentlemen to take 
                        a look at me.  Now, he’s right.  I 
                        call the shots.  I ride the horse.  
                        But do you know what separates you 
                        all from me?  Absolutely nothing.  
                        I ended the war as a Major General, 
                        but I didn’t start it that way.  
                        Work hard.  Show the Union Pacific 
                        your devotion.  Any one of you can 
                        become me.  
                            (nod to Nathaniel)
                        Even a negro can pull himself up by 
                        his bootstraps.
                                 NATHANIEL
                        Once I can afford the boots, I’ll 
                        try it.

           Some of the men laugh.

                                 GANG BOSS
                        That’s enough out of you!

                                 DODGE
                            (upset now)
                        Every mile the CP and their 
                        Chinamen build, that’s a mile we 
                        don’t build.  That’s a mile Mr. 
                        Durant doesn’t draw government 
                        bonds off.  A mile you all don’t 
                        clear.  Now are you more capable 
                        than a Chinaman or are you not?  
                        Because every mile they cash in on 
                        is a mile we don’t.  So get to 
                        work.

           LATER ON

           CLANG!  CLANG!  CLANG!  Abner holds a drill bit up to an 
           outcropping of stone while another man pounds it in with a 
           sledgehammer.

           BOOM!  An explosion nearby.  Rocks tumbling everywhere.  

           Men working frantically.

                                 GANG BOSS
                        You heard the man!  We’re gettin 
                        this rock out our way today!  We 
                        deserve this, boys!  The railroad 
                        and the glory!  Faster now!

           The man hammers Abner’s drill faster.  CLANG CLANG CLANG 
           CLANG!  A swing just barely hits the drill, glancing off it 
           and sending the sledgehammer into the stone right by Abner’s 
           hands.

                                 GANG BOSS (CONT’D)
                        At pace now, ya goddamn Nancies!

           The two men exchange nervous glances.  CLANG CLANG CLANG 
           CLANG CLANG CLANG!  Another miss.

           CLANG CLANG CLANG CLANG!  And right as we think the next 
           swing will miss and crush Abner’s hands --
                                 GANG BOSS (CONT’D)
                        Powder!

           Abner pulls the drill out.  Nathaniel comes over, pours black 
           powder into the hole, sticks a fuse in and --

                                 GANG BOSS (CONT’D)
                        Fire in the hole!

           -- lights the fuse.

           THE MEN
           gather at a safe distance, watching 

           THE FUSE 
           being eaten away.  And right as it reaches the hole in the 
           rock, it stops burning.

           A pregnant beat.  

           THE MEN
           Nervous.  This is dangerous.  They exchange looks and all 
           eyes fall on Nathaniel.

           He inches toward the fuse.

           Finally he’s there and he pulls the fuse out a little 
           further...

           AN EXPLOSION echoes from one of the teams further up ahead.  

           Nathaniel relights the fuse, and at that moment --

           SPLAT!  

           AN ARM
           or at least half of one, lands on the ground near Nathaniel.  

           He stares at it, mortified.

           FSSSSS!

           THE FUSE.

           Nathaniel snaps out of his daze and runs, but

           BOOM!

           the rock blows, sending him staggering sideways and over the 
           edge of the cliff.

           The men gawk, stunned.

           Abner runs to the edge.
                                 ABNER
                        Nathaniel!

                                 IRISH GRADER
                        I told you it would happen didn’t 
                        I?

                                 ABNER
                        Shout somethin if you’re alive!

                                 GANG BOSS
                        He’s gone.  There’s nothing to be 
                        done.  We’re losing daylight.

                                 ABNER
                        Nathaniel!

           A PAINED WAIL echoes from the trees below.

           THE SIDE OF THE CLIFF

           as Abner rappels down the nearly vertical 40-foot slope.  

           Several men up top belaying him.

           As Abner descends, the SOUNDS OF PICKAXES, WHEELBARROWS, ETC 
           fade until he’s at the forest floor and the grading happening 
           above is almost inaudible.

           The trees are dense down here, blocking out much of the 
           sunlight.

           Abner spots

           NATHANIEL ON THE GROUND
           His breathing labored.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Nathaniel, rope tied around his waist and chest, is lifted up 
           slowly.

           Abner looks around the forest as he waits.  

           Something catches his eye.  

           He takes a few steps forward, squinting at a peculiar sight

           DEEPER IN THE FOREST
           A leg.  Sticking out from behind a bush.
           Abner skulks past trees into the core of the woods, his eyes 
           fixed to that leg, and when he gets close enough he stops, 
           aghast at the sight of 

           FOUR DEAD MEN
           scattered within a few feet of one another.  Shot, stabbed, 
           bludgeoned.  A while since death but seemingly unmolested by 
           scavengers.

           One body is slumped over a standing 50-pound wooden keg which 
           has the words “BLACK POWDER” branded on the side.

           ABNER
           On alert now.  He wrests a pistol from the deathgrip of the 
           corpse by the bush.  Crouches and swings his gaze in a 360.  

           After a moment of tense paranoia, Abner straightens up again 
           and moves to the powder keg.  

           He shoves the body off it.  

           There’s a stain on top where blood pooled and then dried.  A 
           streak down the side of the keg.  

           The top of the keg appears to have been pried off and then re-
           secured with screws.

           Abner lays the gun atop the lid and pulls out his penny.  
           Uses it to undo the screws.  Pulls up the lid and looks 
           inside where there is only

           DIRT
           Red, sort of sandy.  Not local dirt.  This traveled here.

           Abner places the lid on the ground.  He looks from body to 
           body and then back at the keg.  He runs his fingers through 
           the dirt, absentmindedly.

           But he feels something underneath.  Pulls out a 

           ROCK 
           just slightly bigger than his penny.  

           He brushes some of the dirt off the rock and his eyes widen. 

           He spits on the rock, rubs it on his pant leg, holds it up.

           GOLD.

           He digs into the keg and comes up with a handful of gold 
           nuggets of varying sizes.  He plunges his other hand in and 
           pulls out more.

           His breathing intensifies.  
                                 DISTANT VOICE (O.S.)
                        Ellis!

           The men calling to him through the canopy.  Back at the cliff 
           slope, the rope waits for 

           ABNER
           who opens his mouth, but stifles himself before uttering a 
           word.

           The briefest malaise.  And then he scoops up fistfuls of dirt 
           from the forest floor and sprinkles it into the keg, 
           obscuring the gold once more.

           He uses the pistol handle to HAMMER the screws back in place 
           instead of twisting them in, to save time, and then DRAGS the 
           keg -- deeper into the forest, away from the cliff and the 
           rope and the graders as they CALL OUT to him.

           Dragging the heavy powder keg.

           But suddenly he stops.  Something occurring to him.

           He hurries back to one of the bodies and digs into the dead 
           man’s pockets and pulls out a couple dollars and stuffs the 
           money into his own pocket.  And moves on to the next corpse.

           EDGE OF THE FOREST

           Looking at the tree line from outside the woods.

           A SOFT SCRAPING sound, growing louder until Abner emerges 
           with the keg.  

           A HORSE NICKERS.  Abner whips around, startled, and sees a

           PERLINO MUSTANG
           Emaciated, yoked to a covered wagon.  It’s standing within a 
           circle of dirt surrounded by grass, having eaten every bit of 
           flora its tethers would allow it to reach.

           Beside the mustang is a 

           DEAD HORSE
           This one a bluish roan, also tethered.  Chunks torn out of 
           its neck and belly. 

           THE PERLINO’S SNOUT
           is smeared with blood.  

           Desperate times.
           Abner approaches, his hands out before him in a calming 
           gesture.

           The mustang shies away.  Abner rips up some grass and holds 
           it out.  

           The horse eats.  Abner pets its neck.

           He crouches by the dead one and begins undoing its bridle.

           MOMENTS LATER

           A heap of chattel outside the back of the wagon.  

           Abner appears and tosses out some clothes and blankets.

           He hops out of the wagon and sizes up the 

           POWDER KEG
           Now fitted tightly with the dead horse’s harness.

           He grabs it by the straps and lifts, letting out an exertive 
           GROAN as he hefts the keg until it clears the wagon floor and 
           he rolls it in.

           Something’s missing.  Abner stares at all the junk on the 
           ground.  He grabs a filthy blanket and climbs inside the 
           wagon.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Abner settles into the driver’s seat of the wagon.  He 
           disengages the break lever.

           The horse NEIGHS and begins walking, the wagon crawling 
           behind it.

           THE WAGON INTERIOR

           is totally empty, save for the powder keg under that blanket.  

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           ARID VALLEY

           We can just make out a horse-drawn wagon -- a speck against 
           the landscape -- moving leftward.  Thin trail of dust in its 
           wake.
           THE WAGON

           TIGHT ON ABNER
           That simmering disquietude we’ve seen before.  

           And then something more erupts to the surface: confusion, 
           worry.  He looks over his shoulder into the wagon, as though 
           expecting someone to be in there.

           Nothing.  He turns back to the road ahead.

           ABNER’S EYEBROWS
           Furrowed again in confusion.

           He slides to the left and leans past the side of the wagon to 
           get a good look behind them.  Is someone following?

           Nothing but the empty landscape.

           But Abner can’t let this feeling go.  He tugs on the reins, 
           slowing the horse to a stop.  

           He pulls the break lever and hops off and marches back just 
           past the wagon.  

           Scrutinizing the land without obstruction.  

           He is alone out here.

           A SMALL CAMPFIRE

           But nobody in the vicinity.  

           PUSHING IN on the wagon which sits nearby, until we’re 
           inside, and by flickering firelight we can make out

           ABNER
           half-draped in the blanket, back against the powder keg.  

           Dead man’s pistol at the ready.  Leering at that fire, at 
           anything that might enter its glow.

           MORNING

           Abner asleep now.  

           He twitches.  One eye opens, then the other.  Groggy.  And 
           then he JOLTS upright.  Rips the blanket off, making sure the 
           keg is still there and intact.

           He lets out a SIGH of relief.
           THE ELLIS HOME FROM AFAR

           The perlino hauling Abner and the wagon steadily toward that 
           little house.

           ABNER
           notices something up ahead.  He waves.

           BENJAMIN
           waves back enthusiastically and then breaks into a sprint for 
           Abner.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Pa!

           Abner pulls the horse to a stop.

           Benjamin reaches the wagon.  The boy is ecstatic at the sight 
           of his father.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        Pa, you’re home!

                                 ABNER
                        That’s right.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Is that your horse?

                                 ABNER
                        Our horse.  And our wagon.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Can you teach me to drive it?

           Abner smiles.

                                 ABNER
                        I can do that.  But first, go fetch 
                        your ma for me.  I got good news.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Ma’s at the lake, filling buckets.  
                        Can I ride in the wagon?

           He runs around to the back and peers into the wagon and then 
           freezes, staring at the blanket with curiosity.

                                 ABNER
                        Hey.  Go on, now.  Tell her I’m at 
                        the house.
                                 BENJAMIN
                            (reluctant)
                        Okay.

           Benjamin runs off.

           Abner watches his son.

           By degrees, the fatherly twinkle in his eye dissolves, and 
           something else creeps onto his face -- that same paranoid 
           expression we saw earlier.  As if he just discovered some 
           horrible truth.

           BEHIND THE HOUSE

           The mustang hitched to a post.  Wagon unattended.

           PANNING LEFT until we find Abner, once again dragging the 
           keg.  Away from the house.  Toward a cluster of trees.

           THE WOODS

           As Abner shovels the last few heaps of dirt out of a hole and 
           then rolls the keg into it.  

           He scrapes the dirt back over the keg as quickly as he can.

           He grabs a gnarled stick and stabs it into the earth above 
           the keg.

           BACK BY THE HOUSE

           Elspeth and Abner.  Benjamin petting the horse in BG.

                                 ELSPETH
                        They wouldn’t take ye on?

                                 ABNER
                        They did.  ‘Bout a week.  But after 
                        that, I got cut.  Couldn’t afford 
                        to pay us all.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Enough for that horse and wagon, at 
                        least.

                                 ABNER
                        Figured in the long run they’d 
                        help.
                                 ELSPETH
                        For runnin post and deliveries 
                        again?  

                                 ABNER
                        I ain’t doin that no more.

                                 ELSPETH
                        What then?  

                                 ABNER
                            (stern)
                        I ain’t doin that no more.

           Elspeth takes a beat, caught off-guard by Abner’s sudden 
           brusqueness.

                                 ELSPETH
                        A good day’s work is its own 
                        reward.  And it’d buy you time 
                        until ye found the next job.

                                 ABNER
                        Next job.  Show me someone with 
                        faith and I’ll show you someone 
                        with no plan.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Faith doesn’t need a plan.

                                 ABNER
                        Well...I do.

           INSIDE THE ELLIS HOME

           As the family eats supper by candlelight.

                                 ABNER
                        Every week -- on the rail -- every 
                        week, they get a hundred men.  By 
                        the end of the same week, hundred 
                        men run off in search of gold.  Up 
                        in them mountains.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Do they find any?

                                 ABNER
                        Maybe some do.
                            (beat)
                        You imagine if I were to find some?
                                 ELSPETH
                        I don’t think I could.  Hard work 
                        and me family’s fine enough, 
                        though.

           She winks at Benjamin, never missing a chance to teach him 
           something.

                                 ABNER
                        You ain’t got dreams?

                                 ELSPETH
                        What’s the use for em?

                                 ABNER
                        The hell they teach little girls in 
                        Scotland?

                                 ELSPETH
                        How about cattle?  Ye could buy 
                        cattle and start that up again.  
                        That business of yours.

                                 ABNER
                        I reckon with enough gold -- the 
                        right amount -- I could do somethin 
                        else altogether.

                                 ELSPETH
                        We came out here for your cow-calf 
                        business.

                                 ABNER
                        Cattle was just a path to what we 
                        came out here for.
                            (beat)
                        Cattle.  What happens to them 
                        cattle when I’m dead?

                                 ELSPETH
                        Nothing ye’d have to worry about.

                                 ABNER
                        I want somethin that’s mine.  I 
                        want a piece of this country that’s 
                        really mine.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Ye’ve got that already.

                                 ABNER
                        This don’t amount to nothin.
                                 ELSPETH
                            (hurt)
                        This is our home.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Pa?

                                 ABNER
                        Mm.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Who was in the wagon?

           Beat.

                                 ABNER
                        What d’you mean “who”?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        In the wagon, sleeping under the 
                        blanket.

           Elspeth reacts.

                                 ABNER
                        There weren’t nobody in the wagon.  
                        Only thing under that blanket was 
                        some firewood, lil straw for the 
                        mustang.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        But I saw someone.  Their shape.  
                        Under the blanket.

                                 ABNER
                        I don’t know what to tell ya, Ben.
                            (beat)
                        Hey, you wanna go out and pet that 
                        horse?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Yeah!  

           They get up from the table.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        Can we name him Riley?

                                 ABNER
                        Riley ain’t no name for a mustang.

           Their voices fade as they head outside.

           Elspeth watches them leave.  Perturbed.  Suspicious.
           MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Abner and Elspeth asleep.  

           Moonlight wandering in through the dust-speckled windows.

           And the tranquility is shattered by BARKING outside.

           Elspeth stirs, sits up.  Concerned, she nudges Abner awake.

           It takes a moment, but he snaps into alertness, jumps out of 
           bed clad in long johns, grabs his rifle, and without any 
           shoes on he hurries

           OUTSIDE

           where Biscuit is pulling taut her leash (a rope) and BARKING 
           at something in the woods.

           Abner squints at the

           TREES
           but from here all looks calm and well.

           ABNER
           pulls off the leash and 

           BISCUIT
           shoots off like a fucking slingshot, straight for the trees.

           Abner hangs back, waiting, but the dog doesn’t slow down.

           Abner sets his rifle to half-cock, opens the breech to check 
           that there is a bullet inside.

           THE WOODS

           Abner ducking past low-hanging branches.  Much less moonlight 
           here.

           He finds 

           BISCUIT
           GROWLING, rooted to her spot now.

           Abner follows the dog’s eyeline up to the top of a tree.  

           He aims his rifle at the tree and pulls the hammer back to 
           full-cock.
           BACK AT THE HOUSE

           Elspeth steps out into the night and looks around for Abner.  
           Her eyes land on the wagon.

           THE WOODS

           Abner leans in, squints at the treetop.  But there’s nothing 
           there.  He lowers the rifle.

           Biscuit circles around and Abner realizes that the dog is 
           actually glaring at an empty point in space.

           Just a few feet away.

           A point in space that hovers above the gnarled stick which 
           marks the buried powder keg.

           He points his rifle at the empty space.

           THE WAGON

           Elspeth looks inside.

           THE FILTHY BLANKET
           in a bundle on the floor.

           She climbs aboard.

           THE WOODS

           Abner stretches a hand out to that spot in the air, 
           approaching painfully slowly, reaching for whatever he might 
           not see.  

           THE WAGON

           Elspeth, staring down at the blanket.  She reaches out.

           Grabs it with both hands.

           And then she yanks it away and shakes it out.

           There’s nothing underneath.

           THE WOODS

           Biscuit growls as Abner reaches out, but  
           ABNER’S HAND
           touches nothing.  Only empty night air.

           Abner eyes the dog.  Then he kneels, sets the rifle down, and 
           digs the dirt up with his bare hands.

           BISCUIT
           Now backing away as she snarls.

           THE POWDER KEG
           Partially visible now.  Abner yanks it upright by the tethers 
           that are still wrapped around it.

           BISCUIT
           barks, her teeth fully bared.

                                 ABNER
                        Hell’s botherin you, girl?

           He takes a step forward but her bark gets even more 
           ferocious.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Git.
                            (beat)
                        Git!

           Biscuit bolts, deeper into the forest.

           ABNER
           inspects the keg.  Lid still held in place.  Nothing amiss.  
           His gaze lingers.  

           He undoes the harness around the keg and pries out the screws 
           (which are now loose from being hammered in), his actions 
           becoming more and more frenetic.  

           He shoves the lid off and swipes away the top layer of dirt 
           inside the keg, and finally he is looking at his treasure.

           With great care, he tips over the keg and pours out  

           THE GOLD
           And just in case we weren’t convinced, it’s now crystal clear 
           that this keg is filled to the fucking brim with nothing but 
           gold nuggets.

           Abner is captivated.

           SMALL LAKE

           Abner stands in the lake, right at the edge, the water just 
           below his waist.  
           On the bank is the empty keg.  Next to the keg, on the dirty 
           blanket, is the massive pile of gold.

           Abner takes a single gold nugget and dips it into the water, 
           shakes it dry and then drops it THUNK! into the keg.  He 
           continues doing this, carefully, meticulously, one piece at a 
           time.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           THE HOUSE

           Benjamin scans the land around him.

           He walks to the empty animal enclosure, where Abner sits on 
           the fence, scribbling in a journal.

           Abner shakes his head, scratches something out, mutters under 
           his breath.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Pa?

                                 ABNER
                            (after a few seconds)
                        Mm.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Where’s Biscuit?

                                 ABNER
                        She got riled up last night, 
                        wouldn’t let me tie her back up.  
                        Likely wanderin around.  She’ll be 
                        back when she’s hungry.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Can we play a battle?

                                 ABNER
                        I got this to do.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        What’s that?

                                 ABNER
                        Things I needa figure out.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        What things?
                                 ABNER
                        The dog’ll be back, boy.  Play with 
                        her, or on your own.

           OFF Benjamin, eyes downcast from his father’s rebuff.

           THE WOODS

           A large stick glides across frame until we see the face of 
           the person holding it:

           BENJAMIN
           Skulking through the forest, holding his stick as a rifle.  

           He aims down the barrel, lining up a shot.  He makes a 
           gunshot noise with his mouth and then runs and ducks behind a 
           tree.  He “fires” twice more.

           He runs into an invisible crossfire and then spins and falls 
           to the ground, clutching his arm as though he were just shot.

           He crawls up to a hollow log -- some fallen ancient tree, 
           partially buried in the dirt -- and, using his “good” arm, 
           drags himself

           INSIDE THE LOG

           where he mimes bandaging his wound.

           FOOTSTEPS nearby.  Benjamin freezes.  

           A beat, and then he smiles.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Pa?

           He crawls toward the other end of the log, but he stops once 
           he hears the FOOTSTEPS DIRECTLY ABOVE.

           And now he’s scared.  

           The footsteps continue atop the log, walking the length of 
           it.  And then they’re back on the ground, walking away. 

           Benjamin doesn’t move a muscle until the footsteps have 
           faded.  

           When he starts moving again, he goes cautiously, trying to 
           make as little noise as possible.  

           Finally he emerges back into 
           THE WOODS

           and scans the trees, searching for whatever it was he just 
           heard.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Biscuit?

           But there’s nothing there.

           BACK AT THE HOUSE

           Elspeth uses a spoon to dig into the soil by the front door.  
           She pulls a half-potato from a bucket with only a couple more 
           spuds inside, and plants it in the hole.  

           She glances at Abner, still sitting on the fence, busy with 
           his journal.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Where’d ye get off to last night?

                                 ABNER
                        See what the dog was barkin after.

                                 ELSPETH
                        And what was it?

                                 ABNER
                        Don’t know.

                                 ELSPETH
                        You were gone all night.

                                 ABNER
                        Well, I wanted to know.

                                 ELSPETH
                        But you don’t.

                                 ABNER
                        Maybe it was nothin.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Maybe it was something to do with 
                        that horse.  

                                 ABNER
                        Weren’t barkin at it durin the day.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Or the wagon.
           Abner looks up from his journal.

                                 ABNER
                        The wagon?

                                 ELSPETH
                        At whatever was inside.

                                 ABNER
                        What was inside?

                                 ELSPETH
                        Well, I don’t know, do I?

           He scribbles in the journal again.

                                 ABNER
                        ‘Course you do.  I told you at 
                        dinner.  Kindlin for the journey.

                                 ELSPETH
                            (beat)
                        Benjamin claimed he saw someone 
                        sleeping.

                                 ABNER
                        And I set him straight.  You were 
                        there.

                                 ELSPETH
                        He wouldn’t make that up.

                                 ABNER
                        He’s a boy.  Always playin war 
                        games out here, usin sticks for 
                        rifles.  ‘Course he’ll see a body 
                        under that blanket.  

                                 ELSPETH
                        Tell me -- and not word of a lie, 
                        Abner, I want the Lord’s truth -- 
                        tell me how you came to be in 
                        possession of that horse and that 
                        wagon.

           Abner snaps his book shut.

           He looks away, lets out a sigh.

                                 ABNER
                        Thing I had under the blanket in 
                        that wagon was a keg.  Black powder 
                        keg I found up in Wyoming.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ABNER (CONT'D)
                        Only it wasn’t fulla black powder 
                        it was fulla...it was fulla dirt.  
                        But mixed in with all the dirt was 
                        a couple pieces a gold.  

           And that hits Elspeth with an almost physical force, her brow 
           wrinkling, her body language shifting, leaning forward in 
           anticipation of the answer to the question:

                                 ELSPETH
                        How much?

                                 ABNER
                        Not a lot.  But some.  

                                 ELSPETH
                        How much, Abner?

                                 ABNER
                        Handfulla nuggets.  

           A jittery, excited laugh escapes her as she clasps her hands 
           together.

                                 ELSPETH
                        How’d ye find it?

                                 ABNER
                        It was in the woods, in them 
                        foothills where we were gradin the 
                        land.  I went off on my own and 
                        found it there.

                                 ELSPETH
                        It must’ve belonged to someone.

                                 ABNER
                        Weren’t nobody around for it to 
                        belong to.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Why’d ye say nothin of this til 
                        now?

                                 ABNER
                        I was waitin til I knew what to do 
                        with it.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Where is it?

                                 ABNER
                        It’s safe.
                                 ELSPETH
                        Where?

                                 ABNER
                            (end of discussion)
                        It’s safe.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Is that why you were sayin all that 
                        at supper?  About findin gold?

                                 ABNER
                        We can do more than just raisin’ 
                        beef.  Somethin bigger’n cattle.  
                        Somethin bigger’n the gold itself, 
                        even.

                                 ELSPETH
                        What’s bigger than gold?

           Abner thinks on this one for a moment.  

           And then it hits him:

                                 ABNER
                        More gold.

                                 ELSPETH
                        How d’you suppose /we--

           He leaps off the fence.

                                 ABNER
                            (over)
                        I’m goin in the house.

           He goes to the door.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        And I’ll be busy in here, you 
                        understand?  Got some plannin to 
                        do.

           He enters and shuts the door behind him.

                                 ELSPETH
                            (sotto voce)
                        Right.  I’ll be here.  Doin this.

           She kneels and plants another half-potato, a foot from a 
           withered sprout -- dead before it could become anything.

           She stops mid-action.  Fuck it.  Pulls the potato out of its 
           hole and tosses it back into the bucket.
           Stands, brushes the dirt from her dress.

           She walks over to the wagon, eyes it intensely.  The blanket 
           on the floor in the back.  She stoops low and looks 
           underneath the wagon, scrutinizing the dirt.

           FOOTSTEPS close by.  At first she doesn’t notice.  But when 
           the pace quickens to a run and they’re right behind her, 
           Elspeth whips around just as

           BENJAMIN
           zips by.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Pa!

                                 ELSPETH
                        What’s wrong, me love?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Where’s Pa?

                                 ELSPETH
                        Look at you, Ben, you’re filthy.  
                        Pa’s inside.  He’s busy.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I heard Biscuit in the woods!  She 
                        was walking and then she was on top 
                        of the log and then she /jumped 
                        onto the grass again and went away--

                                 ELSPETH
                            (over)
                        I’ve told you not to play in that 
                        log.  You’re filthy with dirt and 
                        God knows what.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        What if she’s lost?  Pa has to find 
                        her!

                                 ELSPETH
                        He’s busy.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        But she’s lost!

                                 ELSPETH
                        Did I say somethin, or didn’t I?
                            (softens)
                        I’ll help you look for her.  Come.
                                 BENJAMIN
                        I want Pa.

           Elspeth holds her hand out.  

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        But Pa has a gun.

                                 ELSPETH
                            (beat)
                        Why does that matter?

           Benjamin backs away.

           Elspeth turns to face the woods, disconcerted now.

           THE WOODS

           As Elspeth forges a serpentine route through the trees, eyes 
           darting about in search of

                                 ELSPETH
                        Biscuit!

           THE HEM OF HER DRESS
           catches on a twisted stick half-buried in the ground -- 
           Abner’s marker.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        Biscuit!

           The stick tears through the fabric.

           Elspeth turns and yanks her dress back.  She notices the 
           stick.  Curious, she stoops down and wiggles the stick to get 
           it loose.  As she does, it scrapes against something hard.

           What the hell?

           She clears away the dirt until she notices wood under it.  
           She taps the stick against it.

           She digs more, widening until she’s found the edges of the 
           powder keg.

           She stands the keg upright, the gold inside shifting audibly 
           as she does so.  

           She undoes the harness wrapped around it.  And at this point, 
           the screws holding the lid slide out easily.

           She lifts off the top and is instantly transfixed.
           THE GOLD
           No longer obstructed by that top layer of dirt.  Its luster 
           gorgonizes Elspeth.  It beckons to her.

           ELSPETH
           snaps out of her trance, and a flurry of conflicting thoughts 
           plays out on her face.   

           She sets the lid back on the keg.

           IN THE HOUSE

           Abner at a rickety table, scribbling in his journal.

           A KNOCK at the door.  Abner stops writing, annoyed. 

           Another KNOCK.

           OUTSIDE

           The door swings open.

                                 ABNER
                        Dammit, Elsie, didn’t I--  

           Standing at the door is Jim (the neighbor).

                                 JIM
                        Bad time?

                                 ABNER
                        Depends.

                                 JIM
                        I was just hopin for a minute ‘n’ a 
                        half.

                                 ABNER
                        For?

                                 JIM
                        Well, Tabitha and the grandson are 
                        headin to Chicago tomorrow mornin, 
                        visit m’son-in-law.  Thought I’d go 
                        with em. 

           ELSPETH
           emerges from the woods, notices Jim at the front door, heads 
           toward him.
                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        And I was thinkin on your cow-calf 
                        business and how you need a heifer 
                        and, well, I noticed ya have a new 
                        horse.

                                 ABNER
                        You’re sayin you wanna trade.

                                 JIM
                        Well, I just know ya need the 
                        heifer.

                                 ABNER
                        And there I was, beggin you for her 
                        not long ago.

           Jim takes off his hat, fiddles with it self-consciously.

                                 JIM
                        Things is different now.

                                 ABNER
                        Truly they are.  Y’ain’t wrong 
                        about that, Jim.

           Abner stares Jim down, forcing the old man to break the 
           silence.

                                 JIM
                        I reckon ya want sumpin extra 
                        thrown in.

                                 ABNER
                        I don’t have a mirror to check by, 
                        but I can imagine I got a look on 
                        my face right now.  You may not 
                        recognize it yourself, but that’s 
                        the look of a fella got a lot 
                        bigger things to do.

                                 JIM
                        What are you sayin?

           ELSPETH
           is within earshot now.

                                 ABNER
                        Jim,
                            (he leans in)
                        I wouldn’t take that shit cow of 
                        yours if you were throwin in your 
                        goddamn house and family with it.
           Abner shuts the door.

           Elspeth is aghast at what she just heard.

           Jim notices Elspeth, stares at her for a beat, dumbstruck, 
           then walks away.

           IN THE HOUSE

           As Abner eats dinner, Elspeth watches him with equal parts 
           concern and bewilderment.

           LATER ON

           Elspeth is staring at the ceiling, Abner asleep beside her.  

           A single cricket CHIRPING outside, emphasizing the long 
           hollow silences in between.    

           She glances at Abner.  Carefully...slips out of bed.

           THE WOODS

           Elspeth, staring at the gold inside the open keg.

           She looks over her shoulder.  

           PRE-DAWN FOG
           hangs between the trees.  

           She reaches into the keg and pulls out a single nugget.

           She shudders, imbued with whatever force this treasure holds.

           OUTSIDE

           The sun just beginning its rise as Elspeth, barefoot, makes 
           the quarter-mile walk to 

           JIM’S HOUSE

           where Jim, Tabitha, and James load up a wagon with a few 
           supplies and belongings.

           One by one, they notice Elspeth approaching.

           When she arrives, she goes straight to Jim.
                                 JIM
                        Mrs. Ellis?

           Glances at the Ellis home.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Somethin wrong?

                                 ELSPETH
                        I’ve an offer for ye, but ye can’t 
                        ask any questions.

           ELLIS HOME

           Sunlight.

           Benjamin wakes from his sleep.

           Something draws his attention out the window.

           A COW
           Not the bull, but a smaller female.  Cowbell RINGS softly as 
           the animal stoops down to graze.

           OUTSIDE

           Benjamin stops a few paces short of the cow.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Pa got another cow?

                                 ELSPETH
                        No, I-- Mr. Dooney gave us this 
                        cow.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        For free?

                                 ELSPETH
                        He gave it to us as a gift.

           Something dawns on Benjamin.  

                                 BENJAMIN
                            (beat)
                        Biscuit’s gone, isn’t she?  You 
                        have a new pet.

                                 ELSPETH
                        No, Benny, of course /not--
                                 BENJAMIN
                            (over)
                        I hate it!  I want Biscuit back!

                                 ELSPETH
                        This is not a replacement, the cow 
                        is our business.  With her, we can 
                        get right back to--

                                 ABNER (O.S.)
                        What’s this?

           ABNER
           behind them, regarding the cow with suspicion.

                                 BENJAMIN
                            (devastated)
                        It’s a cow, Pa.

                                 ABNER
                            (to Elspeth)
                        Whose is it?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Mr. Dooney’s, but he gave it to us, 
                        and I hate it /and I just want 
                        Biscuit to come back instead of 
                        this stinky old cow.

                                 ABNER
                            (over, to Elspeth)
                        Why would he do that?

                                 ELSPETH
                            (over Benjamin, to Abner)
                        He was leavin for Chicago.  

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Pa, I heard Biscuit in the forest 
                        yesterday, /I swear I did.

                                 ABNER
                            (over)
                        Where’s the horse?

           He takes a few steps out to look past the corner of the 
           house.  He lays eyes on the mustang.

                                 ELSPETH
                        There was no trade, he gave it to 
                        us.

                                 ABNER
                        I told him I didn’t want it.
                                 ELSPETH
                        Perhaps he had sense enough to 
                        realize we still needed it.

                                 ABNER
                        I don’t need him takin pity on me.

                                 ELSPETH
                        What’s it matter why we have this 
                        heifer?  We’ve got the mate for the 
                        bull now.  You were right about 
                        havin somethin like a business.  
                        It’d be good for us.  Ye found that 
                        gold for a reason.  Ye can use it 
                        to buy /a dozen more--

                                 ABNER
                        We ain’t raisin’ no cattle.  I got 
                        somethin better in mind.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Somethin better in mind?  That’s 
                        what you said when you told me we 
                        were movin out here.  To raise 
                        cattle.  Now, it’s clear you’ve got 
                        your eye on greatness, but you can 
                        be great in Colorado.

                                 ABNER
                        I don’t wanna be great.  I wanna be 
                        remembered.

           He lets that sink in.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        And I got it figured out now.  It 
                        came to me, like someone was tellin 
                        me all about it, how to do it 
                        right.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Do what right?

                                 ABNER
                        What’s bigger’n gold?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Biscuit!

           Benjamin takes off toward

           BISCUIT
           wagging her tail and limping to Benjamin.
                                 ELSPETH
                        Benjamin, be careful!

           She starts after him, but --

                                 ABNER
                        Elspeth!

           She turns back to Abner.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        What’s bigger than gold?

                                 ELSPETH
                            (sighs)
                        More gold.

                                 ABNER
                        What’s bigger’n that?  What’s 
                        bigger’n all the gold a man could 
                        have?

                                 ELSPETH
                            (tired of this game)
                        I dunno.

           Abner digs his fingers into the earth and gouges out a chunk 
           of dirt and grass.  He holds it up and lets it sift through 
           his fingers.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        Land.

           BENJAMIN & BISCUIT
           cavort and roll in the grass, the boy ruffling his friend’s 
           fur, the dog licking Benjamin’s face.

                                 ABNER
                        It ain’t just land.  It’s people.  
                        It’s futures.  

                                 ELSPETH
                        We have land.

                                 ABNER
                        I need the right land.  And a lot 
                        of it.  

                                 ELSPETH
                            (playing dumb)
                        How much land could a handful of 
                        gold buy ye?
                            (beat)
                        Or do ye have more?
                                 ABNER
                        I have enough.

                                 ELSPETH
                        And I suppose you know where to 
                        find the “right land”.

                                 ABNER
                        Wyoming.  ‘Round where I was 
                        workin, there’s land that could 
                        turn gold into more gold.

                                 ELSPETH
                        And when you have more gold what’s 
                        to stop you chasin the next 
                        increment?

           Abner smiles.

                                 ABNER
                        Exactly.

                                 ELSPETH
                        We have a home here.  We settled 
                        down.

                                 ABNER
                        We set up camp.  That’s four walls 
                        and a roof.  It ain’t no home.

                                 ELSPETH
                        I thought it was.  Y’know, a person 
                        is allowed to be satisfied, Abner.

                                 ABNER
                        That what your folks taught you in 
                        Scotland?

           Beat.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        We can make a home over there in 
                        Wyoming.  A real one.  A proper 
                        one.

           Benjamin runs up to them.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Pa, Biscuit’s back!

           Bicuit keeps her distance from Abner, whining quietly, tail 
           between her legs.

           Abner remains focused on Elspeth.
                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        Pa!

                                 ABNER
                        I can see her, Ben.

           Benjamin seems confused that Abner isn’t reciprocating.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Elsie...

           ELSPETH
           Still mulling over Abner’s proposal.

                                 ELSPETH
                        What’d ye see in Wyoming that we 
                        couldn’t find here?

           Beat.

                                 ABNER
                        The railroad.

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           INSIDE THE HOUSE
           Stripped of its meager furnishings.

           OUTSIDE
           As Father, Mother, and Son carry armfuls to the wagon.  
           Gorgeous landscape in BG.

           THE HOLE
           in the woods where the keg was buried until now.  The gnarled 
           stick nearby.

           THE WAGON
           Packed half-full.  It’ll take us a moment to notice the 
           blanket covering the keg, tucked behind a little table.

           BEHIND THE HOUSE
           Biscuit shying away from Abner as he carries a chair to the 
           wagon.

           WAGON SEAT
           Abner gripping the reins, flanked by 

           ELSPETH
           wearing the unmistakable look of uncertainty, and 

           BENJAMIN
           leaning past the edge of the wagon cover and watching the 
           house recede in BG behind them.
           INSIDE THE HOUSE
           PUSHING IN until we’re TIGHT on a corner.  And in that 
           corner: the Indian Head penny.

           PLAINS

           Horse and bull pulling the wagon.

           BUMP in the road.  A CLATTER behind them.  Benjamin turns, 
           looks into the wagon.  

           His eyes fix on Biscuit, her ears perked, staring attentively 
           at the 

           BLANKET
           covering the powder keg.  Only, for some reason it looks less 
           like an upright keg and more like a person -- curled into a 
           fetal position, fabric stretched taut over shoulder, knee, 
           head.

           Benjamin leans forward to get a closer look at the keg.  

           He holds out a hand --

                                 ABNER
                        Ben, stop foolin with the 
                        belongings.  It’ll rattle even more 
                        if you loosen it up.

           Benjamin faces front.

           Abner looks him over.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        You wanna drive?

           Benjamin smiles.

           Abner hands him the reins and then lifts the boy onto his 
           lap.  Benjamin is loving it.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Where to?

                                 ABNER
                        Quick stop in Fort Collins.

           He glances at Elspeth.

                                 ELSPETH
                        The house.  Will it be big?

           Abner nods.
                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        And fancy?

           Abner smirks.

           ASSAY OFFICE

           Abner has his keg in front of him, the lid off.  

           An ASSAYER stares down at the exposed treasure.

                                 ASSAYER
                        Look, I don’t wanna get dead center 
                        in some mixup.

                                 ABNER
                        Ain’t no mixup here, fella.

                                 ASSAYER
                        That’s a whole lotta gold.

                                 ABNER
                        That’s why I’m talkin to you.

                                 ASSAYER
                        Where’d you find all this?

                                 ABNER
                        Somewhere.

                                 ASSAYER
                        We couldn’t even afford to pay you 
                        for that.

                                 ABNER
                        And I wanna know exactly how much 
                        you can’t pay me.

           WILDERNESS

           The Ellis family huddled around a fire, eating potatoes.

           Abner stares at a receipt in his hand.

           Biscuit is tied to the wagon, far from the fire.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Pa?

                                 ABNER
                        Mm.
                                 BENJAMIN
                        How come Biscuit can’t be warm by 
                        the fire with us?

                                 ABNER
                        She’s a dog.  Her fur keeps her 
                        warm.

           This upsets Benjamin.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I don’t wanna eat potatoes.  If you 
                        have so much money now, how come 
                        you don’t buy us bacon?  Or apples?

                                 ABNER
                        This money ain’t for bacon or 
                        apples.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        What’s it for, then?

                                 ABNER
                        That’s a surprise.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I don’t believe you.  I never even 
                        seen the gold.

                                 ABNER
                        You’ll believe it when you see what 
                        it does.

           They eat quietly.

           Biscuit WHIMPERS.

           Benjamin notices.  He follows the dog’s sightline past Abner, 
           into the night.

           And the campfire carries just enough effulgence to throw the 
           faintest glow upon a

           FIGURE
           looming behind Abner.  Corporeal but obscured in shadow.  A 
           partial outline is all that can be made out, and even that 
           will take a moment to register.

           Benjamin notices this figure.  He leans forward, trying to 
           get a closer look, straining his eyes in the dark.  

           A POP! from the fire startles Benjamin and he lets out a 
           frightened yelp.
                                 ELSPETH
                        Benny--

           Biscuit starts BARKING.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Pa, there’s someone behind--

           But there’s nothing there anymore.

           Abner whips around.

                                 ABNER
                        Where?

                                 ELSPETH
                        There’s nothin there.

            Benjamin shoots to his feet.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        He was right behind Pa.

                                 ABNER
                        Ain’t nothin here, Ben.

           Benjamin backs away.  Then he turns and runs behind the 
           covered wagon.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Benny!

           Biscuit still BARKING.

                                 ABNER
                        If he’s tryna make it so we turn 
                        and head back home, it ain’t gonna 
                        happen.  
                            (beat)
                        Quiet, Biscuit!

           The dog shuts up.

           Elspeth goes behind the wagon.

                                 BENJAMIN
                            (sheepish)
                        I saw him.

                                 ELSPETH
                        But there’s nothin there.  It was a 
                        trick of the fire.

           Benjamin peeks past the wagon.
           ABNER
           Alone.  No one else in sight.

           BENJAMIN
           Confused.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I saw him.

           FRONT OF TRACK

           measuring, squaring, and pounding the rail, most clad in

           unrelenting in their forward movement.  The train idling on

           PASSENGER LOCOMOTIVE (STATIONARY)

           DOC DURANT -- clean-shaven, nice suit and stovepipe hat -- 
           front and center.  Behind him, three other sharply dressed 
           BUSINESSMEN.  

                                 DURANT
                        Mr. Ellis, I’m a Christian man and 
                        I serve God, but the Union Pacific 
                        serves Mammon, if you understand 
                        what I mean by that.

           ABNER
           nods, though from the look of it, he doesn’t know what Durant 
           means by that.

                                 DURANT (CONT’D)
                        Good.  It’s our understanding 
                        you’re in possession of quite a bit 
                        of money.  

           Leaning against a bureau over Durant’s other shoulder is 
           Grenville Dodge (guy on horseback who gave the speech on 
           pg24).

                                 DODGE
                        You’ll need a boodle and a half if 
                        you intend to make a dent in the 
                        railroad.

                                 DURANT
                        Forgive Mr. Dodge.  He’s our chief 
                        engineer, and possesses a certain 
                        frankness.

                            (to Dodge)
                        I intend to make a big one.

                                 DODGE
                        It takes a lot of raw materials to 
                        make even a small one.  

                                 ABNER
                        Raw materials?
                                 DODGE
                        Iron rails, spikes, wood ties, 
                        telegraph wire.  At the rate we lay 
                        it down, we’re in constant need.

                                 ABNER
                        That’s all my money’d be doin?

                                 DODGE
                        How else do you suppose we build a 
                        rail?

                        You’ll forgive me any antagonism, 
                        but I’ve seen no shortage of men 
                        intent on setting their name in 
                        stone with no understanding of how 
                        a chisel works.

                                 ABNER
                        I ain’t one of them.  I know what a 
                        thing costs when I set out to do 
                        it.

                                 DURANT
                        We guarantee a ten percent return 
                        on investment within one year.  
                        That’s competitive.

                                 ABNER
                        Doesn’t a fella get a say how his 
                        investment’s put to use?

                                 DURANT
                        Well, normally that’s left to our 
                        discretion.

                                 ABNER
                        Normally?  Do fellas normally show 
                        up to the front of track with a keg 
                        fulla gold and tell you they wanna 
                        put it in the rail?

           Durant lets out a polite laugh.

                                 DURANT
                        I suppose not.

           He exchanges glances with the men behind him.
                                 DURANT (CONT’D)
                        It’s just that the way we do things 
                        here is precise to an infinitesimal 
                        degree, if you understand what I’m 
                        saying.  It’s all very mechanical, 
                        you see.  We can appreciate that an 
                        investor likes an input in the 
                        company he buys a stake in, but our 
                        engineers and our accountants have 
                        it all worked out that the way we 
                        do things is the most efficient and 
                        in all other manners simply the 
                        best possible way to go about it.  
                        It’s a system.  That’s the nature 
                        of an operation like ours.

                                 ABNER
                        That it ain’t exciting?

           Dodge chuckles.

                                 DURANT
                        That it’s systematic.  
                            (beat)
                        But don’t be mistaken, Mr. Ellis -- 
                        when you’re a part of this, it’s 
                        plenty exciting.  
                            (beat)
                        And do you know why?  

           He leans forward in his chair.

                                 DURANT (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t America yet.  Not until 
                        you can get from Philadelphia to 
                        San Francisco without having to 
                        shoot an Indian in Nebraska or take 
                        a boat through Panama.  We’re not 
                        just making America accessible... 
                        we’re making America.  And we’d 
                        like you to make it with us.

           Durant stands, holds out his hand to Abner.  

                                 DURANT (CONT’D)
                        So what do you say to a hundred 
                        shares in the Union Pacific 
                        Railroad Company?

           But Abner remains seated.

                                 ABNER
                        Way I hear it, the Central Pacific 
                        got ten thousand of them Chinese.

                        seen.  I’ll bet they’d even hire 
                        another ten thousand if they could 
                        find the money to do it.

           Now he stands.  

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        I fought in the war.  For the 
                        South.  Not for any reason other 
                        than fightin in the war was the 
                        purpose they gave to me at the 
                        time, so I set myself to it.  Well, 
                        we all know what the score was.  
                        But I tell you, when I came home 
                        after that, I decided: next thing I 
                        did, I’d do it right.  Next thing I 
                        went for, I’d accomplish.  So, 
                        fellas, I’m aimin to get what I’m 
                        after.  You’re at war now, with 
                        that Central Pacific.  And in a 
                        war, one side’s always willin to 
                        give a little more to a fella makin 
                        an offer.

           He turns to leave.

           Durant’s face betrays the briefest glimpse of panic at 
           Abner’s departure.

                                 DURANT
                        Mr. Ellis!
                            (composes himself)
                        You’re right.  This isn’t a typical 
                        situation and we’ve lost sight of 
                        that.  Please, have a seat.

           Abner does.

                                 DURANT (CONT’D)
                        I happen to believe that the 
                        American People are entitled to 
                        this.  To our Transcontinental 
                        Railroad.  We deserve this.  But of 
                        course my company has to build it 
                        first.  And it’s important to me -- 
                        to all of us -- that you’re here 
                        and offering to help us in that 
                        endeavor.  
                            (beat)
                        So.  How do you think your money 
                        would best serve the Union Pacific?
           Abner savors the moment before answering.

                                 ABNER
                        A town.

                                 DURANT
                        Which town?

                            (to Abner)
                        Am I right?

                                 ABNER
                        On your railroad.  And that part’s 
                        important.

                                 DURANT
                        You mean a stop.

                                 ABNER
                        A destination.  ‘Tween Chicago and 
                        Salt Lake, there ain’t nothin for a

                        empty land with no guarantees to 
                        it.  But this town’ll--this city’ll 
                        be it.  Where a man’ll go to 
                        achieve, make his mark.

                                 DURANT
                        What will be in this city?

                                 ABNER
                        Everything there can be.

                                 DURANT
                        How do you get the people there?

                                 ABNER
                        What d’you mean?  The train.

                                 DODGE
                        I think he means: what will there 
                        be to make people come?  What makes 
                        your town the destination rather 
                        than a stop?

                                 ABNER
                        That’ll work itself out.  
                                 DURANT
                        I see.  
                            (feigning)
                        Well that’s a fine idea, Mr. Ellis.

           Durant flashes an ophidian smile.

                        And I think that at five hundred

                        That is a boodle and a half.

                                 DURANT
                        You’ve given the sense that you’re 
                        aiming to make a loud proclamation.  
                        Money is how a man shouts without 
                        raising his voice.  Now, you’ve got 
                        a keg full of gold, and the deeper 
                        you go into it, the louder you’ll 
                        be and the more people will hear 
                        you.  And with a five-hundred-share 
                        stake in the Union Pacific 
                        Railroad, people will hear you from 
                        New York to Sacramento.

           Abner smirks.

           FLAT LANDSCAPE

           Abner on a raised, flat ridge -- graded land waiting for the 
           rail to be laid -- gazing upon his new home 

           AS THE SUN BEGINS TO SET
           over the broad expanse of land.  A few lone trees scattered 
           throughout.  River in the distance.  

           Abner beams.  Nods, satisfied.

                                 ABNER
                        This feels right.  

           ELSPETH & BENJAMIN
           at normal ground level, a few feet below the track bed.

                                 ELSPETH
                        How much of this is ours?

                                 ABNER
                        Six-hundred forty acres.
                                 BENJAMIN
                        Is this where we’re going to live, 
                        Pa?

                                 ABNER
                        This is where we’re gonna build.

           He turns to

           DODGE
           Standing near Abner.  A wagon full of railroad spikes behind 
           him.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        I can see it.

                                 DODGE
                        Good soil here.  Sturdy.  You’ll 
                        want to be wary of the Cheyenne.   
                        They’re nothing to underestimate.  
                        Tore up a half-mile of rail a few 
                        nights ago.  Scalped two men and 
                        rode off.

                                 ABNER
                        When’ll the workers be here?

                                 DODGE
                        Few days’ time.
                            (beat)
                        Oh--

           He goes to the wagon, pulls out a box, brings it to Abner.

                                 DODGE (CONT’D)
                        A gift.

           Abner takes the box.

                                 DODGE (CONT’D)
                        From Durant.  He apologizes in 
                        advance if the fit is off.

           Abner pulls the lid off and admires a folded suit inside.  He 
           runs his fingers over the fabric, smiles, bemused.

                                 ABNER
                        That material...

                                 DODGE
                        The waistcoat’s made of silk.

                                 ABNER
                        They always this soft?
                                 DODGE
                        Only the expensive ones.

           Abner grins.

                                 DODGE (CONT’D)
                        So tell me... What’ll you name your 
                        city?

           Abner waits a beat before responding, sounding it out in his 
           head first.

                                 ABNER
                        Ellis.

           MONTAGE

           ABNER
           tapping a rail spike halfway into the dirt and moving on a 
           few feet and doing it again.  Benjamin behind him, pulling 
           twine around the spikes, outlining a street.  A few building 
           foundations already staked out on either side.

           ELSPETH
           using a piece of charcoal to draw a star on that rectangular 
           scrap of fabric with the faded fig leaf pattern.  Beside the 
           star is written the word “HOME”.  She underlines the word 
           several times -- almost looks like stripes.  A homemade flag.

           ABNER
           scribbling in his journal.

           FATHER & SON
           laying down a large footprint at the end of Main Street.  At 
           the center of this footprint, Elspeth’s flag ripples in the 
           breeze.  Nearby stands a hefty but leafless deciduous tree.

           THE WOODEN FRAME OF A TRAIN STATION
           We peer through it from atop the elevated ridge.  Sign 
           propped against a beam reads: ELLIS STATION.  PAN RIGHT, 
           looking straight down the rail bed, perfectly flat and still 
           bare, stretching out into the empty horizon.

           ELSPETH
           hammering a wooden post into the ground.  Dozens more posts 
           outline a cattle pen.  In BG, a small team of men raise a 
           frame for a shop.  

           MORE BUILDINGS
           framed along Main Street.

           THE TRAIN STATION
           Partially walled.  
           A team of workers using canvas to seal the roof and remaining 
           sides off from the elements.  ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Abner 
           staring intensely at this building.

           LOOKING DOWN THE RAIL BED AGAIN
           But this time we can start to make out a train and workers 
           laying rail just before the horizon.

           BENJAMIN
           holds a dead branch like a rifle, stalking through the bones 
           of this fledgling town.  He perks up, looks off to the side.  
           Abner is calling to him.  He drops his toy and goes to his 
           father.

           MAIN STREET
           The small town all framed up.  At one end is the now 
           completed train station.  On the other end is the roped-off 
           footprint of the Ellis house.  The only building yet to be 
           started.  ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Elspeth staring longingly at 
           this empty space.

           LOOKING DOWN THE RAIL BED
           The rail crew has gotten closer.  Only a couple dozen miles 
           away now.

           OUTSIDE

           Pitch black.  A lit torch stabbed into the earth.  

           Elspeth squats within the firelight, her nightgown gathered 
           up around her waist, peeing on the grass.

           She stands, pulls the torch out of the ground, and heads back 
           to the station. 

           Just outside the door, Elspeth notices

           ABNER’S JOURNAL
           on a battered wooden chair.

           Elspeth hesitates before she picks it up.  

           By firelight, she can read the pages.  And at first it seems 
           ordinary enough -- short entries, random ideas.  But as she 
           turns the pages, the writing gets sloppier, more frenetic, 
           and the entries longer and longer, until it’s totally 
           illegible and each entry is pages long -- essays of chicken 
           scratch.

           Elspeth, disturbed now, skips further ahead, and now the 
           words are replaced by tally marks -- dozens, hundreds of 
           them, in one massive unending journal entry.
           WIDE on Elspeth -- journal in one hand, torch in the other -- 
           the only glow amidst the ink-black night.  

           She looks up from the journal, scanning the shadows around 
           her.

           Off her paranoid expression,

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           MAIN STREET

           Abner, eyeing a building frame as he jots something down in 
           his journal.

                                 WORKER (O.S.)
                        Mister Ellis?

           Abner turns to see a group of six men, hats in hand, 
           clustered together.  His WORKERS.  

           One slightly out ahead of the others.

                                 WORKER (CONT’D)
                        Well...we ran outta lumber.  Got 
                        the siding up on part of that 
                        hotel.  Y’know, the big one yonder.  
                        But we’re fresh out now.  Gonna 
                        have to talk to the boys up ahead 
                        for more.

                                 ABNER
                        That it?

                                 WORKER
                        Well...  The boys and me, we was 
                        talkin.  Well, this work up here, 
                        it ain’t just bustin up rocks.  
                        We’re out here buildin up a whole 
                        town and doin a bang-up job, and we 
                        all think that two dollars a day 
                        just ain’t as fair as it could be. 
                            (off Abner’s silence, 
                              uneasy)
                        Y’know we’re out here buildin a 
                        town.

                                 ABNER
                        You’re buildin a city.  My city.  
                        And two dollars a day, that’s 
                        competitive.

                        mountain passes and watchin the 
                        skies for flyin rock, there’s 
                        plenty of fellas waitin to trade 
                        you for this here.

           Silence.  The workers looking at their shoes.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        That it?

                        Yessir.

           They start walking away.

                                 ABNER
                        Thank ya for the opportunity, Mr. 
                        Ellis.

           The workers turn around.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                            (angrily)

                        And if you want them two dollars, 
                        get back here with more lumber.  
                        And be fast about it.

           OUTSIDE (ESTABLISHER)

           Biscuit sits leashed to the flagpole in the footprint of the 
           unbuilt house.

           PAN 180 degrees to FIND the train station at the other end of 
           Main Street, cloudless sky bathing the building in moonlight.

           EMPTY TRAIN STATION

           Benjamin asleep in bed.  A peaceful slumber.  

           Until
           AN EERIE MOAN
           rouses him from his sleep.  Brief, as though someone has 
           shouted themselves awake from a nightmare.

           As Benjamin gets his bearings, it takes him a moment or two 
           to become aware of SOFT FOOTSTEPS elsewhere in the room. 

           He sits up.  Looking around.  

           Nothing out of the ordinary.  

           He gets out of bed, and pads toward a corner of the room 
           segregated by sheets hanging from the ceiling -- his parents’ 
           “bedroom”.  

           REVERSE ANGLE
           through the hanging sheets.  We can see only the foot of the 
           bed.  Benjamin is a shadow on the other side.

           BENJAMIN
           reaches a hand toward one of the dividing curtains, but then 
           he notices that

           THE FRONT DOOR IS WIDE OPEN.

           He walks over, sticks his head out.

                                 BENJAMIN
                            (whispering)
                        Pa?  Ma?

                        Biscuit?

           Growing worried now, he shuts the front door and returns to 
           the hanging sheets.

           He reaches out.  Scared.  Anxious.

           His fingers curl around the edge of a curtain.

           He pulls it aside, slowly.

           By moonlight, we notice a bedpost.  Blanket.  Elspeth, 
           asleep.  Abner beside her, sleeping on his side.  And when 
           enough of the curtain is pulled back, we see

           A BONY FOREARM
           resting on Abner, a claw-like hand cupped over his shoulder, 
           almost as if someone were spooning Abner.  Though all we can 
           see -- and it’s just barely a glimpse -- is that ghoulish 
           arm.

           Benjamin SCREAMS and runs back to his bed and jumps in and 
           pulls the covers over his head.
           A few seconds later, Elspeth emerges from behind the 
           curtains, followed by Abner.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Benjamin!  What’s wrong?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        The hand!

                                 ELSPETH
                        The what?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Someone’s in your bed!

                                 ABNER
                        There’s nothin there.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        But I saw it!  I saw it in the bed, 
                        right next to Pa!

                                 ABNER
                        Understand me now, boy, there ain’t 
                        nothin in that bed.

           Benjamin looks to Elspeth for support.

                                 ELSPETH
                        It’s just me and your pa.

                                 ABNER
                        Whatever mess you got in your head 
                        makin you see things, you best get 
                        it outta there.

           Abner marches back to bed.

                                 BENJAMIN
                            (to Elspeth)
                        Do you believe me?

           Elspeth tucks Benjamin in.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Go back to sleep, me love.  There’s 
                        nothin here gonna harm ye.

           She goes back to Abner and the bed, disappearing behind the 
           curtain.

           BENJAMIN
           Alone.  
           ELSPETH
           In bed.  Pensive.  Abner beside her, eyes shut.  She glances 
           at him.  Wondering.

           CATTLE PEN

           Elspeth unlatches the gate, then lugs two large buckets full 
           of water to a wooden trough.

           Something catches her eye.  

           THE ELLIS HOME FOOTPRINT
           Still nothing more than spikes and twine.

           ELSPETH
           stares at it wistfully.

           She dumps water into the trough.

           She looks at the bull on one side of the pen, and the heifer 
           on the opposite end.  Totally disinterested in one another.

                                 ELSPETH
                            (angry, at the cows)
                        Well, are ye’s gonna do it or 
                        aren’t ye!

           RIVER

           A one-hundred-foot-wide, slow-flowing body of water.

           ABNER
           Clothes dripping wet, standing under a twisted elm tree on 
           the far river bank, holding a rope.  He begins tying the rope 
           around the trunk of the elm.

           The other end extending from Abner’s hands into the water.

           ON THE OPPOSITE RIVER BANK
           the powder keg lies on its side, tied up several times over 
           with the rope.

           FOOTPRINT OF THE ELLIS HOME

           Benjamin, holding a stick, leads Biscuit around the twine 
           border of their future house.

                                 BENJAMIN
                            (pointing with stick)
                        That’s where there’s gonna be a 
                        fireplace.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                        And that’s where we’re gonna eat 
                        dinner.  And Ma and Pa’s room is 
                        gonna be up over there, on the 
                        second floor.  And my room is gonna 
                        be far away on the other side 
                        because...

           His thought worries him.  Beat.  He forces a smile, trying to 
           play it off, but it looks more like a grimace.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        So I don’t have to hear Pa when he 
                        snores sometimes.  

           He ruffles Biscuit’s fur.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        And you can sleep in there with me, 
                        I don’t mind.

           Benjamin walks over to the big, leafless tree just outside 
           the footprint.

           Open crates of rail spikes are stacked at the foot the tree.  
           The perlino mustang is also bridled to a rope tied around the 
           wide trunk.

           Benjamin sizes up the crates then stares up at the treetop.  
           He climbs onto the crates, using them as steps, and from 
           there he stands on the horse.  The animal shifts 
           uncomfortably, causing Benjamin to wobble, but he manages to 
           hoist himself up onto the lowest tree branch.

           BISCUIT
           watches from below as

           BENJAMIN
           makes his way up the tree.

           RIVER

           Abner pulls on the rope, and when it’s fully taut, it rises 
           up just over the river’s surface, and the keg drags across 
           the dirt and into the water.

           Abner continues pulling the keg through the river.

           THE TREE

           Benjamin, higher up now.
           From up here we get a wide view of the beautiful Wyoming 
           landscape.  

           Benjamin reaches for another branch, but pauses when he 
           notices 

           ABNER
           on the far bank of the river, pulling the keg through the 
           water and toward him.  

           The keg breaks the surface on the other side...

           ...only now it’s not a keg at all.  

           Even from this distance, it’s clear that the thing Abner is 
           pulling from the water is 

           A HUMAN BEING 
           Or at least a humanoid figure.  Completely naked and an 
           unnatural dark grey in color.

           We get only a fleeting glance before

           CRACK! 

           The branch sags under Benjamin’s weight and the boy loses 
           balance and falls, just barely managing to grab a lower 
           branch.  He tries to pull himself up, but he loses his grip 
           and lands on the grass below.

           The mustang nickers.

           Biscuit runs over.  She barks and then licks Benjamin’s face.

           Benjamin pets Biscuit’s head, sits upright.  Some scratches 
           on his arms, and perhaps a few bruises developing, but no 
           serious injuries.

           He scrambles to his feet, and runs, Biscuit chasing behind 
           him, until he can see

           ABNER
           at the river.  Shoveling dirt back over a hole.

           Whatever Benjamin saw, it’s either gone or buried in the 
           ground.

           MAIN STREET

           Abner, shovel in hand and soaking wet, approaches Elspeth.

           She stops in her tracks at the odd sight.
                                 ELSPETH
                        You’re soaked through.

                                 ABNER
                        Yeah.

           He continues right past her.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Abner.

           He stops.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        When d’you figure them shops and 
                        everythin’ll be finished?

                                 ABNER
                        Soon as the boys get back here with 
                        that lumber.  

                                 ELSPETH
                        When’ll that be?

                                 ABNER
                        Week’s end.

                                 ELSPETH
                        And what about the house?

           He turns around to face her.

                                 ABNER
                        What about it?

                                 ELSPETH
                        The rest is up and makin progress, 
                        /but our house--

                                 ABNER
                            (over)
                        It’ll get there.

                                 ELSPETH
                        When’ll that be?

                                 ABNER
                        When’ll that be?

                                 ELSPETH
                        Yes.  When’ll that be.
                                 ABNER
                        When them other buildings are up.  
                        First things first.

                                 ELSPETH
                        I thought it would be first.  

                                 ABNER
                        We’re doin just fine outta the 
                        /train station.

                                 ELSPETH
                            (over)
                        That station’s not a house.  You 
                        promised me we’d have a h-- a big, 
                        /fancy house. 

                                 ABNER
                            (over)
                        You’ll get your house.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Our house.

           Abner’s grip tightens around the shovel handle.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        You’ve spent so much money and so 
                        much time on your town.  How much 
                        is left?  Will you ever be 
                        finished?

                                 ABNER
                        Our town.  

           Abner takes a step toward her.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Our city.  That sign’s carryin all 
                        our names, not just mine.

                                 ELSPETH
                        I never asked for a city.  Just 
                        that house.

           She walks off.

           Abner glares at her.  White-knuckling the shovel.

           EMPTY TRAIN STATION

           Abner strips off his wet clothes.
           He opens the box that Dodge gave him.  Inside is the suit.  
           Abner gazes at it.  Into it.  

           He straightens up his posture.

           LATER

           The family at dinner.  

           ABNER 
           in his suit.  Watch chain dangling from weskit, wrists and 
           ankles somewhat exposed.  The suit’s too small.  His face 
           dirty, hair matted.  He’s a perverse sight.

           They eat in silence.

           Elspeth watches Abner who is focused on his meal.  

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Did they give you a hat?

                                 ABNER
                        Reckon I’ll have to get my own.

                                 ELSPETH
                        I think I’ve figured out why them 
                        cattle don’t associate.

           She waits a beat.  No one asks her to elaborate.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        Jasmine’s pregnant.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        How can you tell?

                                 ELSPETH
                        When a bull leaves a female alone, 
                        sometimes it means the girl’s 
                        already pregnant.  Maybe she was 
                        when Jim gave her to us.  He used 
                        to have his own bull too.

                                 ABNER
                        Didn’t realize they weren’t couplin 
                        up.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Well you’ve been busy.  Buildin 
                        your town.

                                 ABNER
                        Alone.
           Benjamin’s eyes snap up to something in the corner of the 
           room.  He tenses up.

                                 ELSPETH
                        I’m tendin to the cattle.  Alone.  
                        And without the benefit of anythin 
                        your gold /could buy.

                                 ABNER
                            (over)
                        Ain’t no money to spare for that.

           Benjamin pushes his chair back, as if to leave.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                            (to Benjamin, threatening)
                        Y’ain’t goin nowhere til you’re 
                        done that supper.

           Benjamin stays put.  His head swivels slowly, as if he’s 
           following someone who is inching toward the dinner table.  
           And with each passing moment he grows more and more 
           distressed.

           Elspeth doesn’t notice this.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Cattle are what’ll get us the 
                        money, not this town you’ll /never 
                        fin--

                                 ABNER
                            (over)
                        City!
                            (beat)
                        And the money ain’t none of your 
                        concern.

                                 ELSPETH
                        I’m killin meself with these cattle 
                        because it is.

           Benjamin is now looking at 

           THE SPACE ABOVE ABNER
           Empty air, framed as though someone were supposed to be 
           standing right behind the man.  

           Benjamin sees something we don’t.

                                 ABNER
                        What happened to “good work is its 
                        own reward”?
                                 ELSPETH
                        Once you get more, you’re allowed 
                        to want more, aren’t ye?

                                 ABNER
                        “Allowed”...  It ain’t no option 
                        for me. 

           Benjamin averts his eyes, staring straight down at the table.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        I’m keepin what money I got left, 
                        so I can use it to get more.  My 
                        way.  ‘Cause what we got ain’t 
                        enough.

           Tears are cutting though the dirt on Benjamin’s cheeks.

                                 ABNER  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You and them goddamn cattle.

           Benjamin is trembling.

           ABNER’S FACE
           warps with incredulity at some sudden revelation.

           BENJAMIN
           whimpers.

           ELSPETH
           finally notices the state her son is in.

                                 ELSPETH
                        It’s alright, Benny.  Your Pa’s had 
                        a difficult--

                                 ABNER
                        Where...

           Elspeth turns back to Abner.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Where...how...did you end up with 
                        that heifer?

                                 ELSPETH
                        Jasmi--

                                 ABNER
                        How!

                                 ELSPETH
                        Abner, you’re scarin the boy.
           He rises from his seat.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        Jim didn’t fancy carin for it 
                        anymore.  I told you.  He wanted us 
                        to have it.

           Abner glowers.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        You’re scarin the boy.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        It’s here again.

                                 ABNER
                        Quiet.

           Abner picks up his knife and presses its point into the table 
           until it’s buried deep.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        How much gold would a cow like that 
                        /fetch ya?

                                 ELSPETH
                            (over)
                        I didn’t use none of your gold.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Pa--

           Abner slams his hands on the table.

                                 ABNER
                        Enough!  Enough outta you, boy!
                            (to Elspeth)
                        I’m runnin low as it is.  So how 
                        much did you take from me, woman?  
                        And understand me that I’m askin 
                        this question just the once, and 
                        your answer now’s the one you’re 
                        held to later.

                                 ELSPETH
                        I swear to you, I took none of your 
                        gold.

           After staring at her for a beat, Abner’s face softens.  He 
           sits.  

           He tugs the knife out of the table --
                                 ABNER
                        Let’s finish this supper, then.

           -- and tucks into his meal.

           Benjamin’s tears are falling onto his plate, but he tries to 
           remain quiet.

           Elspeth slides her hand onto Benjamin’s.  He flinches.

           Elspeth looks at the space Benjamin was staring at a moment 
           ago.  But she can’t see whatever he saw.

           LATER

           Benjamin in bed.

           Elspeth sitting on the edge, a candle in hand.  

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Can Biscuit sleep here with me?

                                 ELSPETH
                        You know your pa doesn’t want her 
                        in here.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Why not?

                                 ELSPETH
                        I don’t know.  But it seems as 
                        though she’d rather not be around 
                        him anyway.
                            (beat)
                        Do ye know why that is?

           Benjamin shrugs.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        Somethin tells me ye do.

           She glances at the curtains across the room, the ones that 
           define her and Abner’s private space.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                            (quietly)
                        At supper, you said “it’s here 
                        again.”  What is “it”?

           Benjamin looks down, reticent.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        Is it the person you saw before?
                                 BENJAMIN
                        You don’t believe me.

                                 ELSPETH
                        I’ll believe you if you tell me 
                        exactly what you seen.

           Benjamin hesitates.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        Benny, I promise you, me love.  
                            (beat)
                        Is it the person you saw before?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        It’s not a person.

           This hits Elspeth.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        It looks a little like one, but 
                        it’s not.  And it follows Pa around 
                        sometimes and talks to him.

                                 ELSPETH
                        What does it say?

           Benjamin shrugs.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                            (beat)
                        Is it here right now?

           Benjamin shakes his head.

           But Elspeth is still tense.  She gazes at the dividing 
           curtains.

           She stands, and with palpable trepidation she crosses the 
           room--

                                 BENJAMIN
                        It’s not, ma, I swear.

           --and pauses at the curtains.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        Ma...

           Elspeth raises a hand to pull back a curtain.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                            (crying)
                        Please, ma, don’t open it.
           Elspeth comes to her senses.  Rushes back to Benjamin and 
           hugs him tight, devastated to see him in the grip of such 
           fear.  

                                 ELSPETH
                        I’m sorry, Benny.  It’s alright.  
                        It’ll be alright.

           BENJAMIN
           sniffles.  Safer now in his mother’s arms.

           ELSPETH
           The picture of uncertainty.

           THE BIG TREE

           Right by the Ellis home footprint.

           THWACK!  An axe blade takes a bite.

           Abner pries it out and swings again.

           THUNK.

                                 ELSPETH
                        May I speak with ye?

                                 ABNER
                        What is it?

           She waits for him to stop working, but he doesn’t.

           THUNK.

           The perlino mustang, still tethered to the tree, flinches at 
           every hit.

                                 ELSPETH
                        It’s about Benjamin.

           THUNK.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        Ye’ve been different since you came 
                        back from the railroad.  With that 
                        gold.

                                 ABNER
                        Thought you said this was about 
                        Ben.
                                 ELSPETH
                        It is.  It’s about Ben.  And your 
                        gold.

           THUNK.  Abner leaves the axe buried in the tree and turns to 
           Elspeth.

                                 ABNER
                        What about my gold?

                                 ELSPETH
                        There’s a change in you.  And Benny 
                        saw it long before I did.  But it 
                        is there.  And it’s on account of 
                        that gold, I know it.

                                 ABNER
                        You ain’t one for plans, so you 
                        don’t know a thing about this here.  
                        But it’s bigger’n you.  Bigger’n 
                        Ben.  Bigger’n me.  This is the 
                        biggest thing there is.

                                 ELSPETH
                        What is?

           He stabs a finger into the air, pointing at his town.

                                 ABNER
                        This.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Me sister was like you, always 
                        makin plans.  The problem was that 
                        any time she got somethin she 
                        wanted, she was already wantin the 
                        next thing.  

                                 ABNER
                        That’s why I tried for her hand 
                        first.

           That stings Elspeth -- a mixture of hurt and disbelief on her 
           face.

                                 ELSPETH
                            (beat)
                        There’s an evil in that gold.  Old 
                        Scratch tempts /mankind by--

                                 ABNER
                            (over)
                        Old Scratch-- The devil take me now 
                        if that gold’s his.
                                 ELSPETH
                        Don’t speak it!

                                 ABNER
                        I found that powder keg out in the 
                        woods.  Fella it used to belong to, 
                        he was dead right beside it.  So 
                        ain’t nobody comin for it.  And 
                        even if they was, this is the 
                        frontier -- you take it, it’s 
                        yours.  Man or devil himself.  I 
                        own this now.  Ima do with it what 
                        I set to.

                                 ELSPETH
                        And what of your son?

                                 ABNER
                        He ain’t the one gotta worry.

                                 ELSPETH
                        He already does.  That’s no 
                        coincidence, Abner.

                                 ABNER
                        None of this is.  Look at it all.  
                        This here’s work.  It’s plannin.  
                        It’s money.  And it ain’t nobody’s 
                        design but mine.  You’re set there, 
                        tellin me to give this up like it’s 
                        somethin I stepped in.  I made this 
                        happen.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Then make it stop!  I’m not askin 
                        you to pitch the gold.  Just spend 
                        it all instead of plottin and 
                        plannin.  Buy every cow and bull in 
                        the state.  We’ll never need 
                        anythin else.

                                 ABNER
                        That ain’t my plan.  This city--

                                 ELSPETH
                        Who’re you even buildin this for?

                                 ABNER
                        Everyone!  Goddammit!  Everyone!

           He pulls the axe from the tree.
                                 ELSPETH
                        You’re doin this for one person 
                        only.
                            (incredulous)
                        “Look at it all...”  What a grand 
                        city it is, indeed.  
                            (beat)
                        I want that big house, and I want 
                        what’s inside it to be deservin of 
                        its bigness.  I won’t stand for a 
                        shack no more.  Or a city full of 
                        em.  Something’s amiss with ye and 
                        you’re too busy play-actin a 
                        railroad tycoon to notice it.

           Abner flings the axe to the ground.

           He snatches his rifle from its scabbard, cocks it.

           ELSPETH
           goes pale, frozen stiff.  

           Abner strides up to her and gets real fucking close.

                                 ABNER
                        If it’s my eternal soul you’re 
                        rusltin over, I’ll put ya at ease.

           He levels the rifle at the horse’s head and FIRES.

           BLACK.

           ELSPETH
           Wide-eyed, backing away, utterly horrified.

           BLACK.

           THE TREE BY THE ELLIS HOME FOOTPRINT

           Abner’s body heaving as he catches his breath.  SPECKLES OF 
           BLOOD pepper his face and shirt.

           THE BULL
           strains against its yoke, around which is tied a rope leading 
           back to something behind the bull.

           A TREE BRANCH
           acts as a fulcrum.  The rope slithering over it as the bull 
           pulls O.S.

           A SHOVEL
           breaks bloody ground.  A boot kicking it deeper into the 
           earth.
           WIDER ON ABNER
           knee-deep in a hole.  Hacking at tree roots with his shovel.  
           Drops of blood rain from somewhere above him.

           THE MUSTANG
           is hog-tied, hanging upside-down from the tree branch, over a 
           narrow hole.  Head fucked up and dripping blood.

           ABNER
           looks up at the horse.  Unsheathes a knife.  

           And he SLASHES the rope and the horse drops and we

           CUT TO BLACK.

           THE MUSTANG’S GRAVE

           A hoof pokes out from the dirt.

           BENJAMIN
           stands at the grave, looking up at the

           TREE BRANCH
           where the rope still hangs, cut at both ends.

                                 ABNER (O.S.)
                        Buried him upside down.

           The boy flinches, spins around.  He freezes, eyes wide, 
           horrified.

           ABNER
           smiling, but not with his eyes.  Mustang’s blood still on 
           him.  Rifle in hand.

           And behind Abner looms

           A CHARCOAL-GREY HUMANOID BEING
           Faceless.  Sexless.  Tall and creepily osteal.  Skin 
           grotesquely perforated, like a lotus pod.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        You know your ma and her 
                        superstitions.

           BENJAMIN
           is terrified, quietly shaking.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes a fella’s gotta do 
                        somethin to shut a woman up.
           THE CREATURE
           lifts a gnarled hand up to its face and utters mouthless 
           whispers into Abner’s ear.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        I got somethin important to show 
                        you.

           Benjamin doesn’t move.

           But Abner doesn’t either.

           Benjamin relents, takes hesitant steps toward Abner.

           TALL GRASS

           As Abner leads Benjamin somewhere.  

           The creature in BG, out of focus, following them.

           RAIL BED

           Still without a track, but not too far in the distance is the 
           steam locomotive and its rail crew, closer than ever.

           And Abner stands there pointing them out to Benjamin.

                                 ABNER
                        You see that?  It’s almost here.

           He looks to Benjamin for a reaction but the boy is too 
           uneasy, keeping tabs on his peripherals.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        You know what makes that possible?

           Behind them the thing still looms.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        You know what makes that possible.

           Benjamin’s panic multiplies by the second, making each 
           response more and more rushed.

                                 BENJAMIN
                            (unsure)
                        Men building it?

                                 ABNER
                        And why are the men here?
                                 BENJAMIN
                        Because it’s their job?

                                 ABNER
                            (tinge of annoyance)
                        And what’s a job?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        It’s where you do the same work 
                        every day.

                                 ABNER
                        For?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Money!

           Abner points at him: “there it is”.

           TWO-SHOT BEHIND FATHER & SON
           Camera CREEPING IN very slowly as the scene plays out.

                                 ABNER
                        And the company owns the rail--you 
                        know what a company is?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Yes.

                                 ABNER
                        The company owns the rail, why are 
                        they buildin it?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        So that the train can go across?

                                 ABNER
                        And people’ll ride the train.  
                        After they buy tickets from the 
                        company that built the rail.  You 
                        understand what I’m sayin?  And the 
                        company that built the rail gets...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Money.

           Abner smiles, proud.

                                 ABNER
                        That’s called a system.  Remember 
                        when I told you ‘bout how every man 
                        needs to have a plan?  A system’s a 
                        plan that’s workin.  
           He crouches, points to the train and the men advancing the 
           rail.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        And that’s one that’s so big and 
                        workin so good that everybody knows 
                        about it.  And your son and his 
                        son, they’ll know about it too.  
                        And this city I’m buildin, it’ll be 
                        the same way with that.  And it’ll 
                        carry your name.  So everyone’ll 
                        know it comes from you and yours.  
                        And you know what’s makin that 
                        possible?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Money.

                                 ABNER
                        You get it.  Your ma don’t.  She 
                        ain’t one for plans.  But that’s 
                        okay.  As long as you know what’s 
                        what.  And you do.  Don’t ya?

           Benjamin nods.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Say it.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I know what’s what.

           Mostly Benjamin in FRAME now, camera PUSHING IN toward the 
           back of his head.

                                 ABNER
                        Fella told me the other day that 
                        money...all money is, is speech.  
                        And that gold of mine, it’s loud.  
                        That’s the key.  That’s the heart 
                        of this.  It’s doin good things.  
                        Ain’t nothin wrong with it.  Okay?  
                        Gold is good.  
                            (beat)
                        Gold is good.

           Benjamin nods.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Say it.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Gold is good.
           Right as we’re only inches behind the boy, he whips around.

           The creature is gone now.  

           Or at least Benjamin can’t see it.

           He looks around, but it’s just him and Abner now.

           Abner spins the boy back around to face the railroad in the 
           distance.  Puts an arm around his son’s shoulder.

                                 ABNER
                            (re: the railroad)
                        It’s comin.

           EMPTY TRAIN STATION

           Benjamin in bed. 

           Awake.

           He glances around.  Empty.  

           On the bed beside him lies Elspeth.

           Benjamin leans close to her face, confirming she’s asleep.

           He inches out of bed, careful not to wake his mother.

           Stalks throughout the station, in search of something.  But 
           whatever it is, he can’t find it.

           Eyes the dividing curtains in the corner.  

           He creeps toward them, his trepidation setting him at half-
           speed.

           He waits a beat, then shuts his eyes before pulling back a 
           curtain.  

           Deep breath.  And then he opens one eye.

           ABNER
           in bed, asleep.  No creature.  Nothing else there.  Except 
           for

           ABNER’S RIFLE
           propped against the wall.

           BENJAMIN
           locks on to the rifle.  Bingo.
           UNFINISHED TOWN

           A rifle barrel glides across frame until we see the face of 
           the person holding it:

           BENJAMIN
           Weaving through the bones of the half-built town, real gun in 
           his hands now, pointed ahead.  

           A sheet of canvas hung from a beam ripples in the evening 
           breeze.  Benjamin peeks behind it.  Nothing there.

           FOOTPRINT OF THE ELLIS HOME

           Benjamin ensures that the coast is clear before he crouches 
           by Biscuit and pets her.  She wakes up, looks up at him 
           sleepily, tail half-wagging.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Stay here where it’s safe.

           He kisses the dog on her head, gets back up and stalks away.

           RIVER

           Benjamin, walking along the bank.  

           The peaceful babble of the slow-flowing water sounds eerie in 
           the empty darkness.

           He stops, looks out across the water at the twisted elm.

           Benjamin searches the ground, picks up a piece of driftwood 
           almost as long as he is tall.  He dips it vertically into the 
           water, measuring the river’s depth.  The full length of the 
           stick plus Benjamin’s arm still aren’t enough to touch 
           bottom.

           It’s deep.

           But Benjamin is on a mission.

           He undresses down to his underwear, slings the rifle scabbard 
           over his shoulder, takes a breath, and jumps into the water.

           WIDE
           as he cuts across the placid surface, from right bank to 
           left.

           He reaches the other side.  Pulls himself up and goes to the 
           elm tree.
           He digs with his bare hands until he hits something and jerks 
           his hands away with fright.  

           He stands and points the gun at the hole.  He uses his foot 
           to clear away more dirt.  But then he notices something.  The 
           texture.  It’s hard.  This is...wood?

           He crouches to get a better look at what’s buried here.

           He knocks on the keg.  It’s not a human or a demon or a 
           ghost.

           Benjamin glances around, confused, searching for his quarry.

           A beat.

           And then he backs away from the hole and dives into the 
           water, heading back to his side.

           EMPTY TRAIN STATION

           Benjamin tiptoes right up to Abner and carefully places the 
           rifle back against the wall.  

           As soon as he turns to leave,  

           ABNER’S EYES
           snap open.

           BENJAMIN
           nudges through the curtains. 

           ABNER
           Furious.  He turns his attention to that rifle.  He knows 
           what Benjamin’s been up to.  

           He looks out the window.

           BENJAMIN
           climbs carefully back into bed.

           THE DIVIDING CURTAINS
           still rippling.  

           BENJAMIN
           brings Elspeth’s arm over him and then shuts his eyes.

           BACK ON THE CURTAINS.

           HOLD for a beat...

           But nothing emerges from behind them.
           OUTSIDE

           Elspeth carrying buckets of water, sleeves rolled up.

           She notices something up ahead and perks up.  Sets the 
           buckets down and runs up to 

           A NEWBORN CALF
           struggling to stay on its feet as its mother licks it clean.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Jasmine!

           ELSPETH
           is smitten, staring at this calf with a mixture of pride and 
           profound gratitude.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        How’d ye’s get out?

           She continues up the slight hill, to the 

           CATTLE PEN

           And then her face falls, jubilation contorting into 
           confusion, then disbelief, then horror.

           EMPTY TRAIN STATION

           Benjamin sleeping.

           PANNING around the big, hollow room, we LAND on the front 
           door right as it BURSTS open.

           Elspeth runs in and heads straight for her son.  

                                 ELSPETH
                        Benjamin.

           She shakes him.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        Benjamin!

           The boy wakes up.

           Elspeth is anxious, rushed.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        Wake up.  We have to leave.
                                 BENJAMIN
                        Where are we going?  /Where’s Pa?

                                 ELSPETH
                            (over)
                        We’re going somewhere else.  /Pa’s 
                        outside and he can’t come with us, 
                        okay?

                                 BENJAMIN
                            (over)
                        Where’d Pa go?  How come?  /Is he 
                        hurt?

                                 ELSPETH
                            (over)
                        Benny, put on your shoes.

           Benjamin gets out of bed and walks toward the door.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        Don’t go outside!

           We can see in Benjamin’s eyes that he’s assembling some 
           horrible scenario in his head.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        It got Pa?  The thing /got Pa?

                                 ELSPETH
                            (over)
                        No.  We’re just going somewhere, 
                        you /and m--

                                 BENJAMIN
                            (over)
                        I have to help him get away!

           Benjamin opens the door and runs out.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Benjamin!

           She hurries

           OUTSIDE

           and sees Benjamin sprinting down Main Street.  She’ll never 
           catch him.

           But she’s gonna fucking try.
           BENJAMIN
           hauling ass like only a scared ten-year-old on a mission can.  
           Looking in every direction, searching for his father.

           Elspeth SHOUTING protestations somewhere behind the boy.

           Benjamin spots his father from afar, in the cattle pen.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Pa...

           Benjamin gets closer --

           and then he stops so suddenly he almost topples over.  He 
           looks ahead in terror, at

           THE BULL
           On its side in the grass.  Dead.  

           But what’s got Benjamin horrified is

           ABNER
           Bloodied railroad spike clutched in one hand, mallet in the 
           other.  He’s still wearing his suit, only now an animal pelt 
           adorns his head.  

           Not just an animal -- a dog, its face pulled down over 
           Abner’s as a mask, ragged holes where its eyes once were.  
           Upper teeth still fixed in place.  

           And not just any dog.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        Biscuit!

           Abner turns his head slowly, and then starts for the boy.

           Benjamin runs back where he came from, whizzing past his 
           mother.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Benjamin!

           She notices Abner coming and she spins around and follows 
           Benjamin back into the

           EMPTY TRAIN STATION

           where Elspeth drags the bed over to the front door.

           But Abner shoves it open and squeezes inside.  Heaving and 
           staring them down from under the maw-visor of his former dog.
                                 ABNER
                        Don’t you know I gotta hold ya 
                        accountable to your choices.

           Elspeth grabs the rifle and cocks back the hammer.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        That ain’t loaded, Elsie.

           He tucks his mallet into his belt loop and pockets the 
           railroad spike.

           Elspeth eyes the bullet pouch hanging from a hook behind 
           Abner.  

           She lowers the rifle, changes her grip to better use it as a 
           blunt weapon.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Abner, don’t harm the boy.

                                 ABNER
                        You two are a sight, for sure.  
                        Should see how silly you look.  Set 
                        there, afraid.  But afraid’s got 
                        you payin attention now, huh?  This 
                        is what happens when you fight me.  
                        When you go doin things you 
                        oughtn’t.  You forced me to get ya 
                        to that place.  I’m sorry it’s what 
                        it took.  I am.  But I’m tryna 
                        multiply a fortune here.  And now  
                        you’re payin attention, maybe you 
                        finally realize that this is what 
                        the cusp of success looks like.

           He takes a step toward them.  

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        I ain’t askin for your understandin 
                        no more.  That track’s gonna get 
                        here in days, and not long after, 
                        crowds of folk lookin to get out 
                        West.  Where the opportunity is.  
                        Where a fella can multiply a 
                        fortune.  And they’re gonna land 
                        here.  And they won’t have to go no 
                        further.  ‘Cause they found Ellis.  

           He moves closer.

           Elspeth backs away, pushing Benjamin back with her.
                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                            (beat)
                        So the both of you’re gonna stop 
                        fightin me and bein so concerned 
                        with somethin I can’t even figure 
                        what.  Frettin over somethin ain’t 
                        there.  ‘Cause this is yours, too.  
                        Do you want it or don’t you?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        You killed Biscuit!

                                 ABNER
                        You killed her!  What you force me 
                        to do, that’s on you. 
                            (beat)
                        I got a system here.  And you got 
                        your part to play, boy.  The both 
                        of ya.
                            (beat)
                        Shit, I thought for sure this’d 
                        help you listen--
                            (reaches for bullet pouch)
                        --but maybe you oughta stay scared--

           CRACK!  Elspeth smashes the butt of the rifle into Abner’s 
           head.  He drops.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Come, Benjamin!

           They both dash for the door, but Abner grabs Elspeth and she 
           trips, hitting the ground.

           Benjamin stops.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        Leave!

           The boy wiggles past the bed and through the door.

           Elspeth and Abner writhe on the ground, the latter grabbing 
           at Elspeth’s clothes, hair, wrists, legs as she tries to get 
           back onto her feet.

           She rips the headdress off and scratches his face.

           He elbows her in the nose with a CRUNCH.

           Abner overpowers and straddles Elspeth, pinning her down.

                                 ABNER
                        What’d I ever do wrong!  Ain’t this 
                        what we’re here for?! 
           OUTSIDE

           Benjamin moving even faster than before, ducking through 
           framed buildings and then cutting across the open field.  

           Headed straight for the river.  

           EMPTY TRAIN STATION

           Abner snatches the rifle from Elspeth’s grip.

           She expirates red mist with each huff and puff, still 
           fighting against Abner’s weight.

           On Abner’s face, a dawning comprehension.

           He gets off of Elspeth and snatches up his bullet pouch and 
           pulls the bed aside and leaves.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Don’t hurt him!

           RIVER

           Benjamin hesitates at the water, but then he dives in, 
           clothes and all, and starts to swim toward the bank on the 
           other side, a hundred feet away.

           ABNER
           sprinting in the same direction.

           BENJAMIN
           restricted and weighed down by his clothes.

           ELSPETH
           Twenty yards behind Abner.

           BENJAMIN
           makes it to the other side, drags himself ashore, crawls to 
           the gnarled elm tree and digs.

           ABNER
           closes in.

           BENJAMIN
           hits the keg and strains to get it upright.

           ABNER
           sees Benjamin with the keg.

                                 ABNER
                        No!
           BENJAMIN
           pulls the horse tethers off the keg and throws the lid off.  
           Less than half empty inside.  

           He reaches in and grabs two handfuls of gold and hurls it 
           into the river.

           ABNER
           reaches the river bank.  Takes a bullet from his pouch.

           BENJAMIN
           flings another bunch of gold nuggets.  They disperse in the 
           air and PLUNK! into the water.

           ELSPETH
           hesitates, almost pained as she watches the ripples on the 
           surface wash away with the river’s steady flow.

           ABNER
           aims his rifle, quivering with desperation.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Benjamin, stop!

           The boy halts.

                                 ABNER
                            (screaming, unhinged)
                        Leave it alone!  Leave it alone and 
                        swim back over this side!

           Benjamin doesn’t move.

           Abner aims the rifle at Elspeth.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                            (to Benjamin)
                        God damn you, boy, do what I’m 
                        sayin!

           It works.  Benjamin wades into the river and begins swimming 
           back.

           And over his SPLASHES, there is a

           RUMBLING.  Rhythmic, distant.  A GALLOP.

           Abner turns in the direction of the sound.

           TWO RIDERS
           in the distance.  Horses along the bank, on Abner and 
           Elspeth’s side of the river.

           Approaching fast.
           Two young Native American men -- friendly PAWNEE, though the 
           concern on Abner’s face as they approach suggests that he 
           doesn’t know this.

           BENJAMIN
           reaches their side of the river.  Elspeth hurries to him, 
           helps the exhausted boy onto his feet.

           THE PAWNEE MEN
           slow their horses and dismount a few yards away from 

           ABNER
           as he raises his rifle at them.

           The two men move forward, arms held in the air pacifically.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Whatchall want?

           They speak in their native language, though we’ll get 
           subtitles.

                                 FIRST PAWNEE
                        A group of Cheyenne is not far from 
                        here.

           Abner obviously doesn’t understand.

                                 FIRST PAWNEE (CONT’D)
                        They’re dangerous.  How many other 
                        men do you have here to protect 
                        this place?

                                 ABNER
                        You after my gold too?

           The Pawnee men exchange confused looks.

                                 FIRST PAWNEE
                        We came to warn you.  

           He points Northwest across the river.

                                 FIRST PAWNEE (CONT’D)
                        The Cheyenne may come this way.
                            (pointing, emphatic)
                        Cheyenne.

                                 ABNER
                        You Cheyenne?  Come for the keg?  
                        Yeah, I know what you’re here for.
           The second Pawnee man notices the blood on Abner’s suit and 
           the scratch across his face, the blood all over Elspeth, the 
           soaking wet boy.

           He nudges his friend and brings these things to his attention 
           with a few surreptitious nods of the head.

           ABNER
           sees them see it all.

                                 SECOND PAWNEE
                        We must leave.  Goodbye.

           They nod politely and back away toward their horses.

                                 ABNER
                        Whoa, whoa.  Now, I can’t have you 
                        goin back to your buddies and 
                        tellin em ‘bout that keg.

           They continue backing away.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           He lifts his gun.

           The Pawnee men run to their horses.

           BLAM!

           Abner shoots First Pawnee dead.

           THE HORSES
           startle and take off.

           SECOND PAWNEE
           chases after his horse while

           ABNER
           reloads his rifle.  He gets the bullet in and the blast cap 
           in place just as

           SECOND PAWNEE
           jumps onto his horse and sets off at a gallop.

           ABNER
           aims.............BLAM!

           THE HORSE
           takes the bullet and falters, topples over, catapulting its 
           rider to the ground.
           But the man stumbles back onto his feet and limps away as 
           fast as he can.

           ABNER
           readies another shot.

           BLAM!

           Misses.  Too far.

           He throws his rifle to the ground and gives chase.

           ELSPETH
           grabs Benjamin’s hand.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Come with me!

                                 BENJAMIN
                            (pulling away)
                        But I have to--

                                 ELSPETH
                        Leave the gold be!  Leave it be!  
                        Ye can’t save your pa!  I promise 
                        you!  Ye can’t save him!

           Benjamin hesitates.

                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        Benjamin!

           He relents.  Elspeth takes his hand again, and they run.

           CATTLE PEN

           Abner closing the gap to the fleeing man, getting closer and 
           closer until they reach the

           FOOTPRINT OF THE ELLIS HOME

           and Abner tackles him to the ground.

           They grapple, entangled in each other’s limbs.  Hands and 
           feet fighting for purchase.  

           Abner pulls the mallet from his belt loop and swings, but the 
           man catches his wrist.  He wrests the mallet from Abner’s 
           grasp and SMASHES it into Abner’s collar bone.
           Abner falls back.  His opponent brings the mallet up, but 
           Abner pulls the rail spike from his pocket and pelts it at 
           the man’s head and he stumbles backward.

           Abner crawls back over him and the men get into another lock.  
           By degrees becoming smeared in each other’s blood.  

           Abner finds the rail spike and hammers the man’s wrist and 
           hand with it and pulls the mallet from his weakened grip.

           Pawnee, pinned down by Abner, raises both arms and begins 
           strangling his assailant.  

           Abner hammers Pawnee’s hands, but he doesn’t relent.

           Abner sets the spike tip on Pawnee’s forehead and raises the 
           mallet and

           CLANG!

           Pawnee goes slack.

           Abner falls to the side, wheezing.

           Behind him Elspeth’s “HOME” flag billows and FLAPS in a mild 
           breeze.  

           MAIN STREET

           As Elspeth and Benjamin, hand in hand, run away -- from the 
           gold, from Ellis, from Abner.

           AERIAL SHOT

           of Abner supine in the dirt, recovering, still clutching the 
           mallet.  

           The Pawnee man, spike through his head.  

           Blood in the soil.  

           All within the twine border of the Ellis home.

           FRONT OF TRACK

           Elspeth and Benjamin, still holding hands as they trudge 
           along the dusty railbed, a stone’s throw from where a group 
           of men pour ballast and lay rail ties in position.

           One of the front-most men notices them approaching.  Then 
           another looks up.  Soon the whole group halts and watches.  
           Jack and Dan (the Irish brothers in their fur-trimmed 
           jackets) order the men back to work, but then they too notice 
           Elspeth.

           Jack runs to meet her.

                                 JACK
                        Holy shit, lady, are ye alright?

                                 ELSPETH
                        My husband.  The town back there...

                                 JACK
                        You’re Mrs. Ellis?

                                 ELSPETH
                        He’s danger--
                            (beat)
                        What’d you say?

                                 JACK
                        Dangerous?

                                 ELSPETH
                        How’d ye know my name?

                                 JACK
                        Well, hell, everyone and his auntie 
                        knows about the Ellis family buyin 
                        up all that land yonder.  They say 
                        it’ll be a big city when all’s said 
                        and done.

           And Elspeth, for one fleeting, surprising instant, rollicks 
           in this unexpected moment of celebrity.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Ellis, ye got blood on yer... 
                        Well, on a lot o’ ye.

           Elspeth gazes at the rail gang still slaving away behind 
           Jack.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                            (beat, re: blood)
                        Is that the mister’s doin?

           She looks away, nods.

           A look of aggressive disgust takes over Jack.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        And he’s up there alone?
           She nods again.

           Jack walks back to Dan.  

           Elspeth and Benjamin watch as the men talk amongst 
           themselves.  Then Jack returns with Dan.

                                 DAN
                        Mrs. Ellis, me brother and me, 
                        we’re gonna go see about yer 
                        husband.  You’ll be safe here.  But 
                        until we sort this out, keep to 
                        yerself.  And if anyone asks, it 
                        was Injuns did that to ye.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Are you gonna put my pa in jail?

                                 JACK
                        Or somethin.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        It’s the gold that made him turn 
                        bad.

                                 DAN
                            (beat)
                        The gold?

                                 JACK
                            (beat)
                        The gold?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I tried to throw it in the river 
                        but there was too much of it and Ma 
                        told me to leave /when the Injuns--

                                 DAN
                            (over, to Elspeth)
                        The gold’s there with him?

                                 ELSPETH
                        It is.

           The brothers share a look, and that’s all we need to see to 
           know that the objective just changed.

           MINUTES LATER

           Elspeth and Benjamin in FG watching Jack and Dan, on 
           horseback, speed away toward Ellis.
           CAMPFIRE

           Elspeth cooks a potato over the flame.  Benjamin nearby, 
           lying on his stomach, propped up on his elbows.

           DOZENS OF CAMPFIRES AROUND THEM
           Each one with curious men sneaking glances at the mother and 
           her son.

           ELSPETH
           cuts off a hunk of potato and blows on it and hands it to 
           Benjamin.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        What if they don’t come back?

                                 ELSPETH
                        We’re doin nothing else until I 
                        know your father’s not out there 
                        anymore.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        But what if they don’t come back?

           Off Elspeth’s uncertainty,

           FRONT OF TRACK

           Morning again, the rail gang laying track some distance 
           behind Elspeth who stares off down the bare grade in the 
           direction of Ellis.

           Benjamin comes up behind her.

           She looks back at him, worried but resolute.

           BEHIND THE EMPTY TRAIN STATION

           Elspeth and Benjamin descend the slope from the grade to the 
           edge of the unfinished town of Ellis.

           Elspeth stops.  Peeks through a window into the train 
           station.

                                 ELSPETH
                        Wait here.  Hide yourself, and 
                        don’t ye move one bit.

           Benjamin backtracks around the corner and crouches, head 
           peeking out to keep and eye on Elspeth.
                                 ELSPETH (CONT’D)
                        If anything scares ye, run like all 
                        fuckin hell until you reach the 
                        train, d’ye understand meh?

           Benjamin nods.

           He watches Elspeth step out onto 

           MAIN STREET

           She glances all around, 

           HER EYES
           darting about nonstop.  

           Her pace is molasses.

           A breeze causes the half-built stores, hotels, and saloons on 
           either side of her to CREAK and GROAN occasionally, each 
           sound yanking her wide eyes in that direction.

           She finally nears the end of the street and from here a FAINT 
           CRUNCH can be heard.  Rhythmic.  Every few seconds. 

           Elspeth rounds the corner of the last building and before she 
           can see what’s causing the noise, she nearly stumbles over a

           DEAD BODY
           Chest bloody.  Bullet holes.  Gun still gripped in hand.  Fur-
           trimmed jacket.  It’s Dan.

           UP AHEAD
           A few dozen yards away is Jack.  Dead too.  And just beyond 
           him

           ABNER
           On his knees and digging a hole, one hand clutching a shovel 
           and the other held over his stomach.  Even from this distance 
           it’s clear that he is drenched in blood, even more so than 
           before.

           KRSSHT!  He scoops the shovel in the hole.

           ELSPETH
           pries the revolver from the dead man’s hand.

           She approaches.  Carefully.

           ABNER
           oblivious to her presence.  He digs, heaving the shovel with 
           one shaky hand.
           Closer now, Elspeth notices that this is the same hole the 
           mustang rests in, just outside the footprint of the Ellis 
           home.  

           THE HORSE’S CORPSE
           upside down and partially exhumed now.

           ABNER
           drops the shovel and staggers onto his feet.

           Shambling, his one arm still pressed against his stomach, 
           over to the keg a few yards away.

           He grips the keg with his free hand, then stretches out his 
           other hand, wincing with pain.  

           He drags the keg, grimacing and GRUNTING, clearly very weak 
           and badly injured.

           His legs nearly give out, but he regains his balance.  Keeps 
           on dragging the keg.

           But then he stops.  Suddenly aware.  He turns slowly to face 
           Elspeth.

           Frightened, she aims the gun at Abner.

           He barely seems to recognize her, his wounds rendering him 
           docile and myopic.

           They stare at one another for a beat, Abner’s LABORED 
           BREATHING the only sound.

           And then he turns back to the keg and continues dragging it 
           toward the mustang’s grave.  

           At the edge of the hole, Abner stumbles and collapses 
           backward into the grave.

           THE KEG
           tips over, its lid popping off, some of the gold inside 
           spilling out into the soil.  

           A few nuggets dance over the edge of the hole, landing on 
           Abner’s chest.

           Elspeth comes closer, gun still outstretched at Abner.

           ABNER
           finally, truly notices Elspeth.

                                 ABNER
                        Elsie...
           ELSPETH
           watches, pitying but wary.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        We deserve this.  We deserve this 
                        city.

           There is blood in his half-grin.

           ELSPETH’S EYES
           watching Abner exhale his last wheezing breath.

           ABNER
           dead on his mustang.

           Elspeth’s gaze drifts back to 

           THE GOLD
           That ostentiferous treasure.  And even now it shimmers and 
           transfixes.  Beckons.

           The anemic MOOOO of the newborn calf steals Elspeth’s 
           attention.  

           She looks up and sees 

           THE CATTLE
           back in their enclosure -- the heifer and her offspring, 
           staring at the dead bull.

           And then Elspeth glances down again.  At the gold.

           SALT FLATS, UTAH

           A vast, cracked, gleaming landscape.  Horizon an unbroken 
           horizontal, impossibly far.

           We can just make out a horse-drawn wagon -- a speck against 
           the landscape -- moving left.  Thin trail of dust in its 
           wake.

           COVERED WAGON

           Elspeth driving through the empty wilderness, Benjamin at her 
           side.  

           Two horses pulling.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Ma?
                                 ELSPETH
                        Yes.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        What’s in California?

                                 ELSPETH
                            (long beat)
                        More.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        More what?

           But Elspeth is distracted.  On her face spreads a simmering 
           disquietude we’ve seen before.  

           And then something more erupts to the surface: confusion, 
           worry.  A dour epiphany.  

           She looks over her shoulder into the wagon where their 
           belongings are packed up.

           She eases the horses to a stop.  Gets off and scans the land 
           behind them.

           Benjamin watches her, bemused.

           Elspeth throws him a concerned look.

           Benjamin tenses.

           He slides to the far end of the seat and peers past the side 
           of the wagon.

           Nothing.

           He looks at Elspeth and shakes his head.

           She lets out a sigh of relief.  Climbs back onto the wagon 
           and sets the horses in motion.

           HOLD for a while.  (Don’t be afraid to let the audience 
           marinate here.)

           And suddenly Elspeth stiffens.  No confusion, no paranoia.  
           She knows there’s something there.

           ANGLE FROM INSIDE WAGON
           As Elspeth spins to look over her shoulder into the wagon -- 
           staring directly into CAMERA.

           HOLD.

           And then
           CUT TO BLACK.

           END.
