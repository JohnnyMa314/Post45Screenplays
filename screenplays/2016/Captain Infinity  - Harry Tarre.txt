           CLOSE ON A DIMPLED, GAP-TOOTHED GRIN --

           WIDEN TO REVEAL the owner of the grin, A FIVE-YEAR-OLD BOY. 
           GUATEMALAN-AMERICAN. Tiny with wild, curly jet black hair. 
           Decked out in a MAKESHIFT SUPERHERO OUTFIT. This is BENJY 
           RUIZ and he’s poised at the edge of a...

           EXT. ROOF, RUIZ HOME - DAY

           TOES curl. KNEES flex. Benjy looks to the heavens, raises his 
           arms in a SUPERMAN POSE ready to leap into the abyss. A HERO. 

           MUSIC CRESCENDOES blending with the sounds of SIRENS--

                                 OSCAR (O.S)
                        BENJY, BAJAR El TECHO!!!

           CRANE UP PAST BENJY and find a depressed Los Angeles suburb, 
           gawking NEIGHBORS shaking their heads in their driveways, and-

           OSCAR RUIZ(18) Benjy’s older brother, on the YARD BELOW. Same 
           jet black hair swooped to the right. Handsome with a boyish 
           charm, but uptight-- crushed by too much responsibility.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Get off the roof Benjy!

                                 BENJY
                        No Oscar. I wanna fly!

                                 OSCAR
                        YOU CAN’T FLY! 

           A SQUAD CAR pulls up to the CURB. 

           Oscar approaches LAPD OFFICER FIRESTONE (50’s, weathered) in 
           the DRIVER’S SEAT--

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        False alarm Officer Firestone. 
                        Everything is A-Okay.

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        What’d I tell you about keeping an 
                        eye on the little fella? This is 
                        the third time in a month. 

                                 OSCAR
                        We’re fine. Really--

           Suddenly, the GUTTER groans under Benjy’s weight and he 
           TEETERS off balance...  
           Oscar rushes to Benjy’s aid, ready to catch him if he falls-

           Benjy steadies himself. Oscar breathes a sigh of relief.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        What’s it going to take to get you 
                        off of the roof?

                                 BENJY
                        Ummmm... I want a fish!

                                 OSCAR
                        Done.

           Benjy smiles. Heads through the window where he came, as 
           Oscar turns back to the CROWD to clean up Benjy’s MESS--

                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        My brother Oscar is my Alfred and 
                        I’m...
                             (a la Michael Caine)
                        Masta Wayne.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. BATHROOM, RUIZ HOME - DAY

                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        Alfred is there when Batman’s tummy 
                        hurt ‘cause he ate too much glue...

           Benjy is hunched over the toilet. Oscar rubs his back.

           INT. BEDROOM, RUIZ HOME - DAY

                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        ... or when he stick a Lego up his 
                        nose...

           Oscar kneels below a crying Benjy. He looks up into his NOSE.

                                 OSCAR
                        I’m not even mad. Just, how?

           INT. BEDROOM, RUIZ HOME - DAY

                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        ... or to make Bob better when he 
                        get sick...

           TIGHT ON: BOB, A DEAD GOLDFISH in a bowl of murky water. 
                                 BENJY (O.S.)
                        What’s wrong wit’ Bob?

           Benjy holds the FISHBOWL up to Oscar.

                                 OSCAR
                             (lying)
                        Bob’s just tired. He needs a nap. 
                        Let him rest.

           Benjy accepts this as the truth and gleefully darts away 
           giving us a tour of the closet of a bedroom they share: TWIN 
           BEDS and SHITTY IKEA FURNITURE--

                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        I actually don’t like Batman that 
                        much. I like Marvel betta. Can I 
                        start ova’ wit’ the story?

           BENJY’S WALL is littered with MARVEL SUPERHEROES -- POSTERS 
           of THE FANTASTIC FOUR, WOLVERINE...

                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        Oscar is Mr. Fantastic and I’m the 
                        Thing...

           OSCAR’S WALL is swathed in CLASSIC ROCK POSTERS -- THE CLASH, 
           THE RAMONES, THE STONES.

           Oscar strums an upbeat toon on an OLD GUITAR. He’s good. The 
           music carries us through a series of scenes...

                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        ... or no, he Professer Xavier, and 
                        I’m Wolverine... WAIT NO! He the 
                        Wolverine when Wolverine became 
                        Captain Universe...
                             (beat, satisfied)
                        Yeahhhhh. That’s it!

           ... the most prominent of all Benjy’s Superheroes-- a life-
           size cut-out of CAPTAIN UNIVERSE, a blue and white superhero 
           with the slogan: 

           “The Hero That Could Be You!

                                                               SLAM TO:

           TIGHT ON: DEAD BOB in a TOILET BOWL... 

           A STREAM of yellow whiz treats Dead Bob like Target Practice. 
           Oscar smiles as he pees, the simple things in life.
                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        Basically, Professer Xavier clean 
                        up after Wolverine makes a mess. 

           INT. KITCHEN, UPSCALE ITALIAN RESTAURANT - DAY

           A HUSKY MANAGER and Oscar walk and talk as they weave in and 
           out of the busy kitchen clean up crew.

                                 MANAGER
                        Oscar, my restaurant isn’t a day-
                        care. If you can’t get a baby-
                        sitter I’m going to have to let you 
                        go.

                                 OSCAR
                        But we can’t afford a baby-sitter.  
                        Listen, I know Benjy’s a bit of a 
                        handful, but he’s been really well 
                        behaved this last week.

                                 MANAGER
                        He lit a menu on fire last Tuesday.

                                 OSCAR
                        Please. You know I need this job.

           Manager exhales, okay. 

           SMASH! A loud crash from off screen. Manager and Oscar share 
           a look before they open up the KITCHEN DOORS and find --

           INT. DINING ROOM, UPSCALE ITALIAN RESTAURANT - DAY

           UTTER DEVASTATION. Plates and glasses are shattered. A WAITER 
           gingerly gets up and gathers his TRAY. 

           Benjy freezes on top of a TABLE, caught. 

                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        We have to leave places sometimes 
                        because they don’ like superheroes. 
                        Too many bad guys there, I guess.

           EXT. STREET, UPSCALE ITALIAN RESTAURANT - DAY

           Oscar silently fumes as they exit the restaurant.

                                                               WIPE TO:
           SHOTS OF OSCAR AT BENJY’S SOCCER PRACTICE, SWIMMING, AND 
           KARATE--  

           INT. KARATE STUDIO - DAY

                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        Oscar takes me everywhere, because 
                        he loves watchin’ me play the 
                        sports...

           Oscar looks miserable sandwiched in the middle of A LONG LINE 
           OF MOM’S who all swoon over the handsome SENSEI CHAZ (mid 
           20’s) half Golden Retriever half bro, as he leads Benjy and 
           the other little ninjas in intense jab moves. 

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. PET-STORE - DAY 

                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        He so busy being my fan, he say he 
                        don’ have time for a girlfriend.

           TIGHT ON: A SLEEVE OF TATTOOS handing a PLASTIC BAGGY with a 
           NEW, LIVE GOLDFISH to Oscar. 

           The Tattoos are straight out of a Graphic Novel, and are all 
           SUPER HEROINES (Invisible Woman, Black Widow, etc.) The owner 
           of the tattoos, LOLA FIRESTONE (24) is the pet-store manager. 
           We may see the resemblance to her father, Officer Firestone.

                                 LOLA
                        Your brother is a goldfish serial 
                        killer. 

           Oscar smiles awkwardly, intimidated by this force of nature.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be a bitch, just nut up and 
                        tell him the truth. Life is 
                        fleeting. Fish die. He’ll 
                        understand. 

                                 OSCAR
                        ... I’ll do that. Thanks.

                                 LOLA
                        Honesty is always the best policy.

           She punches his shoulder. It hurts.
                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        Really I think he just too busy 
                        working out...

           INT. BASEMENT, RUIZ HOME - DAY

           Oscar BENCH PRESSES in a makeshift gym. Benjy tiptoes down 
           the stairs.

                                 OSCAR
                        Get out Benjy. You know you’re not 
                        allowed down here.

                                 BENJY
                        Why?

           Benjy investigates the FREE WEIGHTS, before--

           KNOCKING A BARBELL ON THE FLOOR, SMASH!!!

                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        ... or playing games I not allowed 
                        to play.

           INT. BEDROOM, RUIZ HOME - NIGHT

           TIGHT ON: Oscar MASTURBATING under the SHEETS. 

                                 BENJY (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?

           WIDEN to reveal Benjy at the foot of the bed. Oscar freaks, 
           frantically tries to make it look like nothing is happening.

                                 OSCAR
                        Er, nothing! I was just, uh, 
                        playing a game. 

                                 BENJY
                        Oh fun, can I play?

                                 OSCAR
                        NO!

                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        Oscar say that super powers run in 
                        our family. He has telephone-
                        esis...
           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Oscar and Benjy are stopped at a STOPLIGHT on his BICYCLE. 
           Benjy’s arms are wrapped around Oscar’s chest. 

                                 OSCAR
                        I can make the light turn green 
                        with my mind in five seconds: 
                        Five, four, threeeeeeeeeeeeeeee--

           Oscar clocks the OPPOSING STOPLIGHT turn RED, so he--

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                             (rapid-fire)
                        --two-one.

           -- just as the stoplight turns GREEN. Benjy oo’s and ah’s.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. LIVING-LIVINROOM, RUIZ HOME - DAY

                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        He can even use his mind to shut 
                        off the internets.

           Benjy sits at the FAMILY COMPUTER and the INTERNET isn’t 
           working-- NETWORK CONNECTION ERROR...

                                 OSCAR
                        I turned off the internet with my 
                        mind because you’ve been playing 
                        too many video games and not doing 
                        enough homework.

                                 BENJY
                        But there’s no school. It’s summa.

           TIGHT ON: A TIME WARNER CABLE NOTICE - SUSPENDED SERVICE 

           Oscar is YELLED AT in a flurry of English and Spanish <<the 
           Spanish will be subtitled>> by their striking Guatemalan 
           mother, SANDRA RUIZ (30’s). She’s beautiful but not vein, and 
           lives for her children.

                                 SANDRA
                        <<You were supposed to pay the Time 
                        Warner bill. You can be so 
                        irresponsible sometimes Oscar...>>

           Oscar takes the abuse.
                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        My Mami Sandra. Her super power is 
                        that she always right. Always. And

                        English. She working on English. 

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY

           Oscar, Benjy, and Sandra sit in a PEW wearing their SUNDAY 
           FINEST, except Benjy, who wears a CAPE instead of a tie. 

                                 BENJY
                        Is there a God?

                                 SANDRA
                        <<Of Course>>

                                 BENJY
                        Huh?

                                 SANDRA
                        Of course there is. Now sh!

                                 BENJY
                        But, but --

                                 SANDRA
                        Shhh!

           Benjy SNEEZES loudly. SNOT hangs from his nose. He flails 
           around for a tissue-- 

           Sandra offers up her SLEEVE. Benjy blows his nose with gusto. 

           LATER: 

           Benjy SNORES on Oscar’s shoulder as the Priest, FATHER JOHN, 
           gives his sermon--

                                 FATHER JOHN
                        Is suicide a sin? Yes. God gives 
                        life, “I have come that they may 
                        have life, and have it to the full” 
                        (John 10:10). Now is it 
                        unpardonable or unforgiveable? No.

           Oscar searches his mom’s eyes, but she remains intensely 
           focused on the PODIUM.
           EXT. - PARKING LOT, CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY

           Oscar walks with Benjy up on his shoulders while Sandra walks 
           by their side.

                                 BENJY
                        How do you know there’s a God?

                                 SANDRA
                        <<You have to have faith in our 
                        Lord>>

                                 BENJY
                        Huh?

                                 SANDRA
                        You have to have faith in our Lord 
                        hijo.

                                 BENJY
                        Why?

                                 SANDRA
                        Because faith keeps you moving 
                        through the bad times.

                                 BENJY
                        Why are there bad times if there a 
                        God?

           Oscar smiles. Smart kid. Shares a look with his mom. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Well...

                                 OSCAR
                             (cutting in)
                        So that you’ll appreciate the good 
                        times.

                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        ... My daddy work full time as a 
                        Superhero. That’s why I never see 
                        him.

           TIGHT ON: a CRUCIFIX in the middle of a DINING ROOM TABLE.

           Moonlight juts through the window illuminating Sandra washing 
           DISHES.

           They have a MAKESHIFT FORT set-up in between their two beds. 
           A light is on INSIDE THE FORT--

           Oscar reads from a LETTER..

                                 OSCAR
                        “... I’m not sure when I’m coming 
                        home but just know that I love you

                        she’s always right. XoXo Papa.”

                                 BENJY
                        Is papa really a superhero? 

                                 OSCAR
                        Oh yeah. Definitely. 

                                 BENJY
                        Do you think he’ll teach me how to 
                        become one on my birthday?

                                 OSCAR
                        Maybe. But only if you know how old 
                        you’re turning?

                                 BENJY
                        Four... No, Five? 

                                 OSCAR
                        Bingo.

                                 BENJY
                        I love you Oscar.

                                 OSCAR
                        Uh Huh.

           Oscar kisses Benjy good night. The light goes out.

           INT. KITCHEN, RUIZ HOME - MORNING

           Benjy’s FIVE BIRTHDAY CANDLES are in a STACK OF PANCAKES. He 
           blows them out to much fanfare. Sandra kneels down to Benjy 
           dressed in her HOTEL MAID UNIFORM.

                                 SANDRA
                        Hijo, I wish I could spend your 
                        special day with you, but Mami has 
                        to <<pay the bills>>. 

                                 BENJY
                        Aw Mami!

                                 SANDRA
                        Guess what? Because it’s your 
                        special day Oscar will take you to 
                        pick out any comic you want.

                                 BENJY
                        ANY COMIC?! Are you serious!? THIS 
                        IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE!?

                                 OSCAR
                        Really setting the bar low there 
                        Benjy. 

           Sandra checks her wallet -- it’s EMPTY.

                                 SANDRA
                        <<Oscar do you have any cash? I 
                        forgot to stop by the bank.>>

                                 OSCAR
                        <<Uh. Yeah. I’ve got some.>>

           INT. BEDROOM, RUIZ HOME - SAME

           Oscar rummages through his DRAWER, and finds a PIGGY BANK 
           JAR. Scoops out a FEW BILLS. His eyes linger on--

           A THICK ENVELOPE from NYU’S CLIVE DAVIS INSTITUTE OF RECORDED 
           MUSIC, peaking out beneath a few ratty T-Shirts. 

           It’s been collecting dust here for a few months. It’s not 
           clear if Oscar keeps this envelope here for safe keeping, or 
           in an effort to forget. Oscar’s face is unreadable.

                                                               SLAM TO:
           EXT. COMIC BOOK STORE - DAY

           Benjy runs dangerous circles around the SHELVES.

                                 OSCAR
                        SLOW DOWN BENJY! YOU’RE GOING TO 
                        HURT YOURSELF!?

                                 LOLA (O.S.)
                        Oscar?

           Lola, from the pet-store, notices Oscar as she’s perusing.

                                 OSCAR
                        Lola, Hey!

           Oscar talks to Lola distracted -- keeping an eye on Benjy.

                                 LOLA
                        Find anything good?

                                 OSCAR
                        Me? Oh no, just here for my lil’ 
                        bro Benjy. I’m not into comics.

                                 LOLA
                        So where’s the Jeffrey Dahmer of 
                        fish?

           Oscar laughs a little too hard -- she makes him nervous.

                                 OSCAR
                        Er, Benjy’s off picking out his 
                        birthday present. My treat.

                                 LOLA
                        Aw. That’s so sweet of you. 
                             (she gets closer)
                        Hey, do you want to come over and 
                        smoke some weed when you guys are 
                        done? YOU, not Benjy, obviously. 

                                 OSCAR
                        ... Er, I don’t do weed. 

                                 LOLA
                        Well you don’t “do” weed Oscar, you 
                        smoke it. Actually, I make these 
                        amazing pot brownies that will make 
                        you lose your motor skills, like 
                        really wipe you out--
                                 BENJY
                             (interrupting)
                        I got it, I got it, I got it! I 
                        found the one I want.

           Benjy notices Lola and hides behind Oscar’s knee, shy.

                                 LOLA
                        Hi there Benjy!  

                                 OSCAR
                        He gets shy around girls. 

           Benjy elbows Oscar’s knee. 

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Ow!

                                 BENJY
                        You get shy around girls, dummy!

           Lola laughs. Oscar glares at Benjy.

                                 LOLA
                        Which comic did you choose Benjy?

                                 OSCAR
                        Captain Universe is his favorite 
                        Superhero. Right Buddy?

                                 LOLA
                        Really? 

           Lola bends down so she’s eye level with Benjy.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Why is Captain Universe your 
                        favorite?

                                 BENJY
                        Well, uh... I like that Captain 
                        Universe can be anyone... a dog, a 
                        neighbor... even me. 

                                 LOLA
                        That uni-power comes in handy. My 
                        favorite was when mutant girl X-23 
                        was the host for Captain Universe. 
                        It was a fucking bloodbath--

           Benjy gasps!

                                 BENJY
                        You said the F-word!
                                 LOLA
                        Ooops. Sorry I’m like a sailor 
                        sometimes. 
                             (correcting herself)
                        Freakin’ bloodbath.

           Lola starts taking her shirt off, trying to find a TATTOO on 
           her back--

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got X-23 as Captain Universe 
                        on my back somewhere... Do you see?

           Benjy looks at Lola’s back like a treasure map. He props up 
           closer to get a better look.

                                 BENJY
                        Spider-Girl, Invisible Woman, Black

           Benjy doesn’t respond. He’s landed on a Superhero he doesn’t 
           recognize -- this never happens.

                        What’s died? Like “Death” the

                             (changing the subject)
                        We really should get going. So nice 
                        to see you Lola. 
                                 BENJY
                             (to Lola)
                        Wanna come to the park wit’ us for 
                        my birthday?

                                 OSCAR
                        She doesn’t want to do that.

                                 LOLA
                        Sure. Why not?

                                                               SLAM TO:

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

           Oscar and Lola sit on a PARK BENCH, looking after a very 
           active Benjy darting around the JUNGLE GYM. Lola pulls out a 
           VAPE PEN. Takes a long drag. Blows SMOKE RINGS. Oscar freaks.

                                 OSCAR
                        What are you doing!? 

                                 LOLA
                        Want a hit?

                                 OSCAR
                        We’re on a freaking playground. 
                        That’s illegal.

                                 LOLA
                        I smoke with like half the cops on 
                        the force. You need to relax. 
                        You’re way too high strung. This 
                        may do you some good.

           Benjy squeals on the MONKEY BARS, oblivious. 

                                 BENJY
                        Look at me Oscar!

                                 OSCAR
                             (cheery)
                        Doing great buddy! Two thumbs up!

                                 LOLA
                        Have you ever tried? You might like 
                        it.

                                 OSCAR
                        I’ve tried it... Once.
                             (beat, then)
                        Is it that obvious?
           SFX PRE-LAP: OSCAR HAS A COUGHING FIT...

           EXT. EDGE OF THE WOODS, PARK - DAY

           Lola pats Oscar on the back as he wheezes. 

                                 LOLA
                        Stick with me kid, I figure we’ve 
                        got two months together to get you 
                        blowing perfect O’s in the college 
                        girls faces next year. Where are 
                        you going this fall?

                                 OSCAR
                        Um... I’m actually not going 
                        anywhere. Still saving up to afford 
                        tuition. Even with financial aid 
                        college is too expensive.  

                                 LOLA
                        Where did you want to go?

                                 OSCAR
                        I got into The Clive Davis School 
                        at NYU.  

                                 LOLA
                        The music school? Wow. That’s a 
                        great school. What do you play?

                                 OSCAR
                        Guitar. 

                                 LOLA
                        And New York is a great city. Have 
                        you ever been?

                                 OSCAR
                        No... I’ve never been anywhere 
                        really. Never even been on a plane. 

                                 LOLA
                        What kinda stuff do you play?

                                 OSCAR
                        I play whatever-- jazz, blues, but 
                        I’m really into classic rock. 
                        Clapton. Stones. The Clash. 

                                 LOLA
                        Hells yeah. 
           She passes him back the Vape Pen. Oscar takes a deep hit, and 
           giggles.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           THE JUNGLE GYM--

           Benjy rides the SPINNING WHEEL. The rusty metal squeaks as it 
           spins dangerously fast. Benjy’s hair blows in the wind. He’s 
           having the time of his life, until--

           His face goes pale and his eyes roll to the back of his head.

           BACK TO THE WOODS--

           Oscar and Lola have ventured farther away from the Jungle 
           Gym.

                                 OSCAR
                             (continuing)
                        I haven’t even told my mom I got 
                        in.

                                 LOLA
                        What? Why? 

                                 OSCAR
                        There’s no point. Even if I had the 
                        money I wouldn’t go. Benjy and my 
                        mom need me here. 

                                 LOLA
                        Screw college. It’s overrated. When 
                        I went, I stressed about grades and 
                        boys, was an active member of greek 
                        life--

                                 OSCAR
                        Greek life? Really?

                                 LOLA
                        I know, crazy right? The second I 
                        graduate my mom dies and I wind up 
                        right back here taking care of my 
                        dad so I feel you. 

                                 OSCAR
                        I’m sorry.

                                 LOLA
                        That’s okay. It was awhile ago now.

           Awkward Beat.
                                 OSCAR
                             (changing the subject)
                        So big bad Officer Firestone can’t 
                        take care of himself, eh?

                                 LOLA
                        Please, he can barely tie his shoes 
                        without me. And he’s not who you 
                        think he is. He named me after a 
                        Kinks song--

                                 OSCAR
                        “Lola.” Weird song considering...

                                 LOLA
                             (explaining)
                        Yeah, He really wanted me to be a 
                        boy. 

                                 OSCAR
                        It’s a great song. I can play it. 

                                 LOLA
                        I’d love to hear you play some 
                        time. 

           They lock eyes for a beat too long. Oscar goes beet-red. 

                                 OSCAR
                        Hold up. Do you hear anything?

                                 LOLA
                        Could you be more specific?  

           Oscar’s face instantly changes, panicked.

                                 OSCAR
                        BENJY?! 

                                                               SLAM TO:

           The Wheel is EMPTY. It slowly spins and creaks to a stop...

           Several yards away, Benjy gingerly teeters around. His ears 
           RING and the LIGHTS become bright and intense, as he 
           COLLAPSES. We are high above in a--

           BIRDS-EYE VIEW --

           -- of Benjy who looks an awful lot like one of those GOLDFISH 
           in a TOILET BOWL in his GOLD T-SHIRT...

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:
           BIRDS-EYE VIEW

           -- of Benjy wearing a HOSPITAL GOWN, lying on a TABLE. Benjy 
           enters the loud whirring and buzzing MRI MACHINE.

                                                               WIPE TO:

           INT. OFFICE, HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

           We’re a fly on the ceiling, observing Oscar and Sandra 
           sitting across from a DOCTOR who points to a dark spot on an 
           MRI.

           The sounds are MUFFLED as he delivers the worst news a family 
           can receive.

           We may hear snippets -- “Ana Astrocytoma,” “Stage Three”, 
           “Aggressive Radiation Therapy.”

           Sandra falls into Oscar’s arms.

           LATER: 

           Sandra and Oscar are left alone in the Doctor’s OFFICE. Oscar 
           stares off, catatonic. Sandra approaches on egg shells.

                                 SANDRA
                        <<Oscar. Oscar. Look at me. Look at 
                        me>>

           He can’t.

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        <<Everything is going to be okay. I 
                        know it doesn’t seem that way right 
                        now, but God tests us in all sorts 
                        of ways. We have to have faith that 
                        everything will work out.>>

                                 OSCAR
                             (snaps to)
                        What God would give a five-year-old 
                        cancer!? Are you serious mom? 

                                 SANDRA
                        I know you’re angry. I am too.

           Oscar fights hot tears with CLENCHED FISTS. 

           Sandra walks over to a BOOKSHELF, and out of the blue--
           TOPPLES THE BOOKSHELF OVER, SMASH!

           Oscar pops up, shocked.

           Sandra proceeds to TEAR THE ROOM APART, until she pauses out 
           of breathe--

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        I clean up people’s mess all day 
                        long... It’s my turn to make a 
                        mess. 
                             (she smiles 
                              conspiratorial)
                        Help me.

           Oscar joins in-- throwing ITEMS around the room. They may 
           enjoy themselves, before--

           Tiring out and collapsing on the floor. 

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        <<You can’t let anger consume you. 
                        Love is the only way to fight this. 
                        Love and Faith>>

                                 OSCAR
                        Faith? Love and Faith? That’s Bull 
                        Shit. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Oscar Ruiz!

           Sandra crosses herself.

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        <<I need you to be strong. The 
                        treatment is going to be very 
                        expensive. I’m going to have to 
                        pick up more shifts at the hotel to 
                        cover the costs.>> I’ll be around 
                        even less.

           Oscar looks up. Knows what this means and it crushes him.

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to need you now more than 
                        ever. Do you understand? 

           Long beat. All of Oscar’s plans evaporate as he nods, yes-- 
           ever the dutiful son.

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        I love you Oscar.
                                 OSCAR
                        Uh huh.

                                 SANDRA
                        Let’s clean this mess.

           They start cleaning together. 

                                 OSCAR
                        So what are we telling Benjy? 

                                 SANDRA
                        He’s sick, and needs treatment to 
                        get better. The Doctors say we need 
                        to be honest with him about the 
                        changes that will be happening -
                        <<for all of us>>

           THE DOOR OPENS, and THE DOCTOR enters--

           He notes the WRECKAGE. Dramatic beat where Sandra and Oscar 
           brace themselves for trouble--

                                 DOCTOR
                             (compassionately)
                        I’ll get somebody to clean this up.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           EXT. HALLWAY, HOSPITAL - DAY

           Oscar speaks with a NURSE at the end of a long hallway. She 
           points to a room down the hall.

           EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Oscar takes a moment before entering. Deep breath. Musters a 
           smile. Opens the door, and is greeted with--

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 BENJY (O.S.)
                        Oscar! 

                                 OSCAR
                        Hey buddy!

           Benjy, in his HOSPITAL GOWN, sits in a bed smothered with 
           COMIC BOOKS. He opens up his arms, needing a hug. They hug. 
           Oscar sits at the edge of the bed.
                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        How ya doing?

                                 BENJY
                        Terrible.

           Oscar can’t help but smile -- this kid is so honest.

                                 OSCAR
                        I know, I know.

                                 BENJY
                        Mami said I’m sick and I need  
                        treatment to get better. I don’t 
                        wanna be sick. I wanna go home and 
                        eat brownies. 

                                 OSCAR
                        We’ll get you home soon. Don’t 
                        worry.

                                 BENJY
                        What’s wrong with me? 

                                 OSCAR
                        When the doctors put you in that 
                        loud machine... they uh found 
                        something.

                                 BENJY
                        What?

                                 OSCAR
                        They, uh, found a mutation in your 
                        cells that makes them grow faster 
                        than they should. I don’t really 
                        understand it. 

                                 BENJY
                        A MUTATION!? 

                                 OSCAR
                        Yeah, but--

                                 BENJY
                        Like the Fantastic Four?

                                 OSCAR
                        It’s uh...

           Oscar looks at the cover of the comics Benjy is holding: the 
           characters glow with radiation.

           Oscar’s eyes light up, he has an idea.
                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Exactly like the Fantastic Four. 
                        And so here’s the thing. Because of 
                        this mutation you have, this very 
                        rare mutation, the doctors think...

           Moment of truth...

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        ... You’d be a good fit to join 
                        their special program.

                                 BENJY
                        Really? 

                                 OSCAR
                        Yes. This whole thing, the 
                        hospital, the doctors, the 
                             (he uses air quotation 
                              marks)
                        “sickness”, it’s all a cover up for 
                        the program. 

                                 BENJY
                        But, what kind of program?

                                 OSCAR
                        Well I don’t know if you’re quite 
                        ready yet.

                                 BENJY
                        I’m ready. 

                                 OSCAR
                        It’s going to be hard. It’s going 
                        to make you want to quit. 

                                 BENJY
                        I won’t quit.

                                 OSCAR
                        You’re going to have to be brave, 
                        because only the bravest kids are 
                        accepted into this program. 

           Benjy pops out of bed, excited. He flexes and roars like a 
           lion.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        I think you’re ready to join the 
                        program.
                                 BENJY
                        Tell me what the program is 
                        already!?

                                 OSCAR
                        ... It’s a top secret program to 
                        become a Superhero.

           Benjy’s eyes bulge. He dances around the room.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        But there are rules. 

                                 BENJY 
                        What rules?

                                 OSCAR
                        Er, you’ll learn them as you go, 
                        but number one, and it’s the most 
                        important rule of all, you can’t 
                        tell anyone about this program. 

                                 BENJY
                        Why?

                                 OSCAR
                        Because the top secret superhero 
                        society needs to know you can keep 
                        a secret. The way superheroes stay 
                        super is that they know how to keep 
                        secrets. Can you do that?

                                 BENJY
                        I won’t tell. Promise. 

                                 OSCAR
                        Not the doctors. Not the other kids 
                        in the program. Not even mom. 

                                 BENJY
                        Why can’t I tell mom?

                                 OSCAR
                        Because it’s rule number one. If 
                        you can keep a secret, you’re one 
                        step closer to being a superhero.

                                 BENJY
                        I can!

           Benjy thinks.

                                 BENJY (CONT’D)
                        Will I have super powers?
           Oscar paces around. He didn’t think about this.

                                 OSCAR
                        Yes... yes. Of course you will. The 
                        doctors are going to give you 
                        treatment that will give you super 
                        powers.

                                 BENJY
                        Will I be able to fly?

                                 OSCAR
                        NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT. That’s the one 
                        super power you won’t have.

                                 BENJY
                        But, but I want to fly.

                                 OSCAR
                             (flustered)
                        Look no more questions. For now, 
                        you have to rest.

           The door opens. Sandra enters. Oscar mimes zip the lips, 
           behind Sandra.

                                 SANDRA
                        There’s my beautiful hijo.
                             (Benjy and Sandra hug)
                        So I spoke with the doctors and 
                        they want to start your treatment 
                        Monday, so you can get better as 
                        soon as possible.

                                 BENJY
                        Aw, can’t we start right now!? 

           Sandra looks at Benjy, stunned.

                                 SANDRA
                        You are my brave ángel. 

                                                               SLAM TO:

                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        Oscar say that we have to pretend I 
                        was sick, otherwise everyone would 
                        want to join the program.

           EXT. PORCH, RUIZ HOME - NIGHT

           TIGHT ON: Benjy in the WINDOW, looking out --
           --at Lola and Oscar on the PORCH. Lola gives Oscar a bear 
           hug. He sinks into her arms. They both cry...

                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        But I didn’t wanna make anyone sad.

           ON BENJY

           Taking this in, confused.

           Oscar turns around, notices Benjy watching from the window, 
           and quickly feigns cheeriness. He gives Benjy a thumbs up, 
           and wipes the tears from his eyes.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. BEDROOM, RUIZ HOME - NIGHT

           OFF SCREEN we hear Sandra on the phone with PATIENT BUSINESS 
           SERVICES.

                                 SANDRA (O.S.)
                             (distressed)
                        I want to apply for discounted 
                        care... Si, I’ll hold --
                             (beat)
                        Can I speak to someone who speaks 
                        L’Espagnol?...

           We now hear snippets of Sandra’s conversation in SPANISH in 
           the background as Oscar reads Benjy a letter in THEIR 
           MAKESHIFT FORT--

                                 OSCAR
                        “Congratulations Benjy! I am so 
                        proud of this major accomplishment 
                        and all of what you will soon 
                        achieve. You will make for a 
                        powerful Superhero. Just know, like 
                        Spiderman, with great power comes 
                        great responsibility. So always be 
                        a careful Superhero. Love, Papa.”

                                 BENJY
                        Do you think Papa will show up to 
                        my Superhero graduation?

                                 OSCAR
                        Maybe. Now, let’s get some rest.

           LATER: 

           DARKNESS. Oscar and Benjy lie wide awake.
                                 BENJY (O.S.)
                        Oscar? Oscar?

                                 OSCAR
                        Yeah?

                                 BENJY
                        Are you awake?

                                 OSCAR
                        NO. Go to bed.

           Long beat...

                                 BENJY
                        Can you play me a song? I can’t 
                        fall asleep.

                                 OSCAR
                        Okay.

           Oscar scoops his guitar of the hook on the wall. 

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        What should I sing?

                                 BENJY
                        Anything.

           Oscar goes into an ACOUSTIC VERSION OF THE STONE’S RUBY 
           TUESDAY--

                                 OSCAR
                             (like a lullaby)
                        Goodbye Ruby Tuesday / Who could 
                        hang a name on you? / When you 
                        change with every new day / Still 
                        I'm gonna miss you...

           Benjy falls asleep, snoring loudly...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           SFX PRE-LAP: FURIOUS KNOCKING...

           EXT. BATHROOM, RUIZ HOME - MORNING

           Benjy pounds the bathroom door--

                                 BENJY  
                        Oscar, I don’t wanna be late on my 
                        first day. 
           INT. BATHROOM, RUIZ HOME - SAME

           Oscar dry heaves into the toilet. Washes his face. He’s a 
           mess from anxiety. 

           INT. RUIZ CRAPPY CAR - DAY

           Sandra buckles Benjy into his CAR SEAT. Oscar enters still 
           silently freaking out.

           INT./EXT. RUIZ CRAPPY CAR - IN MOTION - DAY

           We track their progress through TOWN, past middling 
           storefront after middling storefront, past the PET-STORE--

           Benjy notices the WATER TOWER in the distance-

                                 BENJY
                        After I get my super powers I’m 
                        gunna fly off that WATER TOWER. 

           Oscar’s eyes bulge. Sandra isn’t really listening -- too much 
           is on her mind. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Of course hijo. Whatever you say.

           Oscar breathes a sigh of relief. Benjy hasn’t blown their 
           cover.

           EXT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - DAY

           ESTABLISHING. A post-modern building with a cheery PLAYGROUND 
           and tranquil PARK in the front.

           The RUIZ’s CRAPPY CAR pulls into the PARKING STRUCTURE --

           INT. PARKING STRUCTURE, CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - DAY

           Sandra takes a ticket from a MACHINE. Drives past car after 
           car on LEVEL ONE -- No empty spots. She heads to --

                                 SANDRA
                        Keep a look out for an open spot.

           LEVEL TWO. Same thing. No empty spots. Oscar furrows his 
           brow, looking for that hidden spot, a diamond in the ruff.  

           No dice. Car after car. Mercedes. Honda Civic. Minivan. 
           Cadillac. Spot after spot. Level after level. All filled. 
           Level Four, Level Five, Level Six...

           They end up on the ROOF before they find an open spot. They 
           park. Sandra exits, closes the door. Leaving just Oscar and 
           Benjy.

                                 BENJY
                        Jeeze. There must be a lot of kids 
                        in this Superhero Program, huh?

           He’s right. Too many.

           INT. LOBBY, CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - DAY

           Oscar, Sandra, and Benjy walk up to the WELCOMING DESK, where 
           they are greeted by a GUEST SERVICES REPRESENTATIVE. 

           The Representative hands the group their OUTPATIENT VISITOR 
           BADGES and sends them on their way to the ELEVATOR BANK.

           INT. WAITING ROOM - LATER

           THE HOSPITAL WALLS are an OCEANIC theme. Oscar, Benjy, and 
           Sandra sit next to a picture of a GOLDFISH and a streak of 
           SEAWEED. Benjy kicks his legs impatiently. A door opens--

                                 NURSE (O.S.)
                        Benjamin Ruiz?

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ 
                        Up Top Benjy!

           DR. RABINOWITZ (oncologist, late 50’s) the glasses and 
           receding hairline do little to hide the fact that he is a big 
           kid at heart. His arm is raised for a HIGH FIVE--

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ (CONT’D)
                        Come on Benjy! Let me have it. 
                        Let’s see your best high five!

           Benjy is nervous. He goes for the high five--

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ (CONT’D)
                        Owww!!!

           Dr. Rabinowitz feigns breaking his ARM. His dramatic 
           squirming cuts the tension in the room. He’s a pro.
                                 DR. RABINOWITZ (CONT’D)
                        Benjy don’t laugh. You just broke 
                        my arm! You’ve got to be the 
                        strongest kid I’ve ever met.

                                 BENJY
                        No way. 

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        Yes way.

                                 BENJY
                        Well I’m not sorry. 

           They all chuckle-- Benjy is the cutest.

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        Benjy, I’m going to be your primary 
                        physician, so you’re going to be 
                        seeing a lot of me. How does that 
                        sound?

           KNOCK KNOCK-- a NURSE interrupts the conversation.

                                 NURSE
                        Dr. Rabinowitz. You wanted me to 
                        remind you--

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        Right, right. The paperwork. Mrs. 
                        Ruiz--

                                 SANDRA
                        Sandra. Call me Sandra.

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        Sandra. That’s a beautiful name for 
                        a very beautiful woman. 

           Sandra blushes. Oscar notices.

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ (CONT’D)
                        Sandra, there’s a little bit more 
                        paperwork the hospital needs you to 
                        fill out when you apply for 
                        discounted care. 

                                 SANDRA
                        More paperwork?

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        My sincerest apologies. 
                             (to the Nurse)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. RABINOWITZ (CONT'D)
                        Jessica, can you give Oscar and 
                        Benjy the tour while I finish up 
                        the paperwork with Sandra?  

                                 NURSE (JESSICA)
                        Of course.

           Sandra kisses Benjy, and exits with Dr. Rabinowitz.

                                 OSCAR
                        Jessica, before we start can I talk 
                        to you outside for a second?

           EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Oscar stands with Jessica. He peaks in the WINDOW to make 
           sure Benjy can’t see their exchange. 

                                 OSCAR
                        I think it wold be best if I give 
                        Benjy the tour myself. He’s really 
                        nervous about the treatment, and 
                        feels most comfortable with me.

                                 JESSICA
                        Uh, yeah. Of course. You know him 
                        best. Go explore together, and if 
                        you have any questions don’t 
                        hesitate to reach out to any of the 
                        staff here.

                                 OSCAR
                        Thank you so much Jessica... and 
                        this is a weird request, but can I 
                        borrow your lab-coat?

           Jessica looks at Oscar perplexed.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Oscar enters wearing Jessica’s LAB-COAT. Benjy perks up.

                                 OSCAR
                        So, it’s time to come clean with 
                        you Benjy... My name is actually, 
                        Agent Oscar Ruiz and I’m the head 
                        of the Top Secret Superhero 
                        Program. Welcome to T.S.S.P.

           Benjy’s jaw drops to the floor. He buys it.
                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Before we start, all new superhero 
                        applicants need to sign this 
                        document here with the rules and 
                        regulations we expect new recruits 
                        to follow. 

           Oscar hands Benjy a piece of computer paper with HANDWRITTEN 
           RULES.  We notice, on the top of the page--

           “TOP SECRET RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR INCOMING SUPERHEROES”

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                             (re: the document)
                        Sign here, and initial here. And so 
                        we begin... 

           Benjy can’t sign fast enough.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. HALLWAY, HOSPITAL - DAY

           Oscar improvises the tour -- explaining the rules of the 
           program like a drill instructor. 

                                 OSCAR
                        You are already aware of rule 
                        number one, correct?

                                 BENJY
                        Uh huh, don’t tell no one.

                                 OSCAR
                        Bingo. It is of the utmost 
                        importance that you keep this 
                        program a secret. Can I count on 
                        you?

           Benjy nods, yes. 

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        This hospital is a superhero 
                        training facility--

           They peak in a PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM, where --

           A YOUNG GIRL picks her nose and stares off into space. 

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        That girl just got her treatment 
                        and can now read minds.  
           A very SKINNY BOY stretches.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        He is now... elastic.

                                 BENJY
                        Woh! Can I go talk to them?

                                 OSCAR
                        NO. Benjy you are not to interact 
                        with the other prospective 
                        superheroes?

                                 BENJY
                        Why not?

                                 OSCAR
                        They’re your main competition. You  
                        don’t want them to get in your 
                        head, do you? 

                                 BENJY
                        No way.

                                 OSCAR
                        Not everyone gets to be a 
                        superhero. Only those who pass the 
                        program. 

           Oscar leads him down the HALLWAY, and proceeds--

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Rule number two. Once you undergo 
                        your treatment you are going to 
                        start discovering your super 
                        powers. You are only allowed to 
                        test and practice your powers with 
                        a certified specialist. Me. 

                                 BENJY
                        Cool.

                                 OSCAR
                        This program is designed to scare 
                        you Benjy. You’re going to be 
                        meeting lots of Doctors who are 
                        going to be intimidating, but just 
                        know that it’s all a test. There’s 
                        nothing to be afraid of.

           Benjy nods, feeling comforted.
                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Third Rule. Under no circumstances 
                        are you allowed to fly.

                                 BENJY
                        But, but--

                                 OSCAR
                        Which leads me to rule number four.
                        You cannot question the rules of 
                        the program. They are law. Are we 
                        clear?

           Benjy nods, yes.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           Oscar stumbles upon an empty CONFERENCE ROOM with STADIUM 
           SEATING in front of a giant WHITE ERASE BOARD.

                                 OSCAR
                        This is, uh, where you will be 
                        taking Superhero 101. You’ll have 
                        assignments each week and there 
                        will be a final examination at the 
                        end of the program.

           Looks like high school cafeteria but there are HOSPITAL STAFF 
           in SCRUBS.

                                 OSCAR
                        You’re going to have to eat up if 
                        you want to be a healthy superhero.

           A CHILDREN’S WONDERLAND: video games, board games, toys

                                 OSCAR
                        This is the game room where our 
                        prospective Superheroes unwind 
                        after their treatment- which brings 
                        me to rule number five -- you must 
                        always remember to have fun...

                                                               SLAM TO:

           Benjy meets his CANCER TEAM. This includes the CLINICAL STAFF 
           (Nurses, Therapist, Psychologist), as well as the PHYSICIAN 
           STAFF (Pathologists, Radiologists, and a few Attendings).

           They’re all huddled around a CAKE, “WELCOME BENJY”.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL  - LATER

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        It is hard work being a superhero, 
                        so sometimes you’ve got to step 
                        back and enjoy yourself.

           Benjy has a big smile on his face, as he starts his 
           CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENT. He is hooked up to an I.V. and 
           holding hands with SANDRA and OSCAR. He has taken the “fun” 
           rule to heart and is thoroughly enjoying himself. 

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. BEDROOM, RUIZ HOME - NIGHT

           Sandra’s bedroom door is opened a crack, and we may clock 
           PRESCRIPTION PILL BOTTLES on her NIGHT-STAND, as Oscar tucks 
           her in. Her MASCARA is smeared.

                        <<Can you please make Benjy dinner? 
                        I’m too exhausted from today>>

                                 OSCAR
                        Of course.

                        Who could that be?

                                 BENJY (O.S.)
                        I’ve got it!!!

           INT. HALLWAY, RUIZ HOME - DAY

           Oscar pads to the FRONT DOOR. He hears VOICES as he rounds 
           the corner and finds Lola and Benjy, who abruptly stop 
           talking upon seeing Oscar.

                                 BENJY
                        --I wasn’t tellin’ Lola all about 
                        the superhero program just now.

                                 OSCAR
                             (smacks his own head)
                        Rule number 1 Benjy, come on!

                                 BENJY
                        Sorry. Her Mami is a superhero. I 
                        thought it would be okay.

           EXT. PORCH, RUIZ HOME - DAY

           Lola and Oscar talk in hushed whispers on the porch.

                                 LOLA
                        You’re lying to Benjy!

                                 OSCAR
                        What’s wrong with making it “a 
                        game” for him?

                                 LOLA
                        Wake up. Cancer isn’t a game Oscar. 
                        It sucks. Chemo sucks. 

                                 OSCAR
                        I know that.

                                 LOLA
                        No you don’t. Not yet. It’s going 
                        to get hard. When my mom got sick--

           She stops, can’t finish the thought. 
                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        I came tonight because I wanted to 
                        cheer Benjy up after his first day 
                        of chemo. 

                                 OSCAR
                        This “lie” is cheering him up. 
                             (beat, he tries a new 
                              tactic)
                        Listen, Lola I’m going to need your 
                        help. Please. You know everything 
                        about comics. You’ll know what will 
                        make it feel real for Benjy. 

                                 LOLA
                        I really do not know if I’m cool 
                        with this man.

           Oscar notices something through the window.

                                 OSCAR
                        Benjy?

           INT. LIVING-ROOM, RUIZ HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Benjy sits on the couch Indian-style holding a SPOON. He 
           looks like he’s about to pop a blood vessel.

                                 OSCAR 
                        Benjy, are you okay?

           Oscar approaches, while Lola hovers by the doorway unsure of 
           her next move.

                                 BENJY
                        I’m trying to blow this spoon up 
                        with my mind. 

                                 OSCAR
                        Well that sounds like a pretty 
                        advanced super power. Why don’t you 
                        start smaller? Like mind reading. 
                        What am I thinking?

                                 BENJY
                        Well, I think you’re... hungry.

                                 OSCAR
                        Yes! How did you know?

                                 BENJY
                        ... and you want to eat Mac and 
                        Cheese.
                                 OSCAR
                        Wow. Spot on. Try Lola. Read her 
                        mind.

                                 LOLA
                        No that’s okay. I think I’m going 
                        to leave--

                                 BENJY
                        Well, Lola, she’s hungry too.

           Beat. Lola gives Oscar a look like I’m not okay with this.

                                 BENJY (CONT’D)
                        ... and you want hotdogs.

           Lola looks at Benjy. Takes a breath. Nods, yes.

                                 BENJY (CONT’D)
                             (continuing)
                        But instead of Ketchup and Mustard 
                        on your hotdog, you want Whip 
                        Cream, Syrup, Mayonnaise, Vinegar, 
                        and Reese’s Pieces.

                                 LOLA
                        What?

           Oscar gives Lola a NUDGE--

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, er yeah. You’re absolutely 
                        right.

           LATER--

           TIGHT ON: THE HOTDOG CONCOCTION --

           Lola grimaces, about to take the first bite. Benjy and Oscar 
           eat their Mac and Cheese, happy. 

                                 BENJY
                        Lola, how is it? 

                                 LOLA
                        It looks, er, delicious.

                                 BENJY
                        Eat it Lola. 

                                 OSCAR
                        Yeah Lola. 
                             (pointed)
                        Eat it.
           Lola takes a big bite, and forces a smile while chewing. She 
           realizes the hotdog concoction is pretty good, and eats the 
           whole thing.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           Lola and Oscar stand by her beat up VW BEETLE.

                                 LOLA
                        That mind reading shit was weak. 

                                 OSCAR
                        Agreed.

                                 LOLA
                        We’re going to give Benjy some kick 
                        ass super powers.

                                 OSCAR
                        You’re in?

           Lola nods, yes. Oscar WHISTLES, excited. 

                                 LOLA
                        Maybe we should give him Captain 
                        Universe’s powers: telekineses, 
                        super strength, super speed, and 
                        invisibility. Whaddya think?

                                 OSCAR
                        Hells yeah! Thank you so much.
                             (beat, thinking)
                        So, uh, how are we going to 
                        convince him he has all those 
                        powers?

                                 LOLA
                        Why are you asking me? I have 
                        absolutely no idea. You got us into 
                        this mess. Figure it out. 

                                 OSCAR
                        Oh. Right.

                                 LOLA
                        You can do it. You’re creative. 

           Lola gives Oscar a kiss on the cheek before heading out.
           INT. KITCHEN, RUIZ HOME - LATE AT NIGHT

           Oscar has COMIC BOOKS and his OLD LAPTOP splayed out all over 
           the DINING ROOM TABLE like he’s cramming for a midterm exam. 

           INSERT PAGES--

           -- THE FLASH darts across the page with his Super-speed.

           -- THE HULK throws a car clean over his head Super-strength.

           -- INVISIBLE WOMAN evades an enemy with her Invisibility.

           ON OSCAR 

           Overwhelmed, taking it all in. 

           He exes out of the WEB BROWSERS dealing with comics and goes 
           to his FACEBOOK PAGE.

           His PROFILE PICTURE is a shot of Benjy on his shoulders, all 
           smiles.

           Oscar types into the SEARCH BAR and pulls up a FACEBOOK GROUP 
           PAGE -- INCOMING NYU FRESHMAN “CLIVE DAVIS INSTITUTE OF 
           RECORDED MUSIC”

           He scrolls longingly through the PROFILES of the students who 
           would have been his classmates. Stews in what could have 
           been. We may sense an anger bubbling under the surface of his 
           stoic face.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           A CRAPPY 2004 TOYOTA sits in the driveway. Sandra tosses THE 
           KEYS to Oscar. He looks at them like he’s been handed the 
           keys to a MERCEDES BENZ.

                                 OSCAR
                        For me? Really? 

           Sandra nods, yes.

                        But we can’t afford this?

                        Your Tio gave it to us. It’s the 
                        least he could do. Literally the 
                        least.

                        didn’t ask for any of this, and 
                        it’s unfair. You probably want to

                                 OSCAR
                        Uh huh.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - DAY

           Dr. Rabinowitz is mid check up with Benjy, using his 
           STETHOSCOPE. Oscar sits in the chair next to them.

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        Deep Breathe... 
                             (Benjy breathes in and 
                              out)
                        Good. 

           LATER:

           Benjy, hooked up to an I.V., undergoes his second round of 
           chemotherapy. He’s just as excited as he was the first round. 

           Oscar speaks with Dr. Rabinowitz OUTSIDE THE ROOM--

                                 OSCAR
                        When do you think we should be 
                        expecting the, uh, nastier side 
                        effects?

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        Well nausea, vomiting, hair loss, 
                        fatigue, and mouth sores are all 
                        common-- but everyone reacts 
                        differently. Benjy’s responding 
                        very well to the treatment.

                                 OSCAR
                        Okay. That’s good.
                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        Our team will do our best to manage 
                        those effects.

                        I need to run some errands today. 
                        Would it be possible for me to 
                        leave Benjy alone here for a few 
                        hours?

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        Of course.

           Oscar stands in front of Benjy wearing a LAB-COAT again. 
           “SUPERHERO 101” is written on THE WHITE BOARD.

                                 OSCAR
                        Before I run, it’s time for your

                        kind of Superhero you become. Now 
                        get to work!

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. HOME DEPOT - DAY

           Oscar and Lola peruse the aisles pushing a SHOPPING CART. 
           Lola picks out a few items: a ROD, STYROFOAM, BLACK SPRAY 
           PAINT CANNISTER.

           INT. GAME ROOM, CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - DAY

           Benjy sits at a table smothered in arts and crafts supplies. 
           He draws furiously, designing his SUPERHERO OUTFIT. He 
           crumples up his most recent attempt. Throws it in the TRASH.

           INT. HALLOWEEN STORE - DAY

           Oscar and Lola pick out different SUPERHERO COSTUMES (The 
           Flash, Wonder Woman, Iron Man) as they barrel down the 
           aisles, on a mission-- having a blast.
           INT. GAME ROOM, CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - DAY

           A BOY with a BALD HEAD from chemo interrupts Benjy.

                                 BALD BOY  
                        What are you doing?

                                 BENJY
                        I’m not supposed to talk to you, 
                        but I need to know what happened to 
                        your hair?

                                 BALD BOY
                        I lost it when I got the cancer?

                                 BENJY
                        What’s the cancer?

                                 BALD BOY
                        It’s why we’re here. You have it 
                        too.

                                 BENJY
                        That’s not true. 

                                 BALD BOY
                        Yes it is.

                                 BENJY 
                        Wanna know why we’re really here?

           Benjy looks around cautiously. Then whispers into the Bald 
           Boy’s ear. The Bald Boy lights up, excited!

                                 BALD BOY
                        I KNEW IT!

           INT. GARAGE, RUIZ HOME - DAY

           Oscar and Lola wear SCIENTIFIC GOGGLES as they SPRAY PAINT 
           something OFF SCREEN.

           EXT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - DAY

           Benjy stands in front of the Children’s Hospital like he’s 
           waiting for the SCHOOL BUS. OSCAR’S CAR pulls up--

           INT. OSCAR’S CAR - IN MOTION - DAY

           He drives with Lola in the passenger seat and Benjy secure in 
           his car-seat.
                                 BENJY
                        What’s the cancer?

           Oscar and Lola share a concerned look.

                                 BENJY (CONT’D)
                        Deadpool had the cancer, but what 
                        is it? I’m confused.

                                 OSCAR
                             (changing the subject)
                        Er... Speaking of Deadpool, have 
                        you come up with your Superhero 
                        name yet buddy?

                                 BENJY
                        No. My head is all cloudy. I can’t 
                        think of anything.

                                 OSCAR
                        What about Kangaroo Boy... or The 
                        Little Lion Man?

                                 LOLA
                        Ugh those are awful names. 

                                 OSCAR
                        I thought animal names were cool 
                        for Superheroes. No? Like the 
                        Phoenix. No one messes with the 
                        Phoenix...
                             (to himself)
                        Yeah, I’ll stop. 

                                 LOLA
                        What about Captain Universe? Why do 
                        you like his name Benjy?

                                 BENJY
                        I dunno.

                                 LOLA
                        He’s the Guardian of Eternity, The 
                        Avenging Angel, The Hero That Could 
                        Be You... What do you want to be 
                        the Guardian of?

                                 BENJY
                        I dunno. I guess, it will be easier 
                        to come up with a name when I know 
                        all my powers.
           INT. OSCAR’S CAR - NIGHT

           Oscar pulls up to Lola’s HOUSE, where --

           IN THE DRIVEWAY--

           Officer Firestone plays PICKUP BASKETBALL with a few other 
           OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICERS. This is the first time we’ve seen 
           Officer Firestone out of his uniform, and he looks oddly 
           normal and “Dad”-like. He notices Oscar’s car come to a STOP--

                                 LOLA
                        Thanks for the ride.
                             (whispers)
                        Break a leg tonight.

           She gives him a flirtatious wink and EXITS. Officer Firestone 
           approaches the car--

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                             (to Lola)
                        The Fitbit said I walked ten miles 
                        today sweetie. You impressed? 

                                 LOLA
                        Those are rookie numbers Dad. Bump 
                        ‘em up and maybe I’ll give you a 
                        gold star. 
                             (waves to the Officers)
                        Night fellas’!

           Officer Firestone waits for Lola to enter the HOUSE, before 
           he pokes his head in Oscar’s WINDOW--

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        Hi Oscar. Hi little fella’.

                                 OSCAR / BENJY
                        Hi Officer Firestone. 

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        So Oscar, are you dating my 
                        daughter now, or what?

           Oscar laughs, nervously.

                                 OSCAR
                        No.... No way...

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        What? She’s not good enough for 
                        you?

           Oscar sputters. 
                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE (CONT’D)
                        I’m messing with you. Lola told me 
                        about-- How are you feeling Benjy? 

                                 BENJY
                        Er... 
                             (beat)
                        ... Really sick... Definitely not 
                        in a special top secret program. 

           Officer Firestone furrows his brow, confused.

           Benjy FAKE COUGHS.

                                 OSCAR
                        We should really get going. 

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        Of course. Stay outta trouble guys.

           Oscar peels away. 

                                 BENJY
                        I followed rule number one! Are you 
                        impressed. 

                                 OSCAR
                        Very nice work buddy. I think this 
                        means you’re ready.

                                 BENJY
                        Ready for what?

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. BASEMENT, RUIZ HOME - NIGHT

           TIGHT ON: THE BENCH PRESS, looking the same as it did in the 
           opening. Benjy and Oscar sidle up to it.

                                 BENJY
                        I thought I’m not allowed down 
                        here?

                                 OSCAR
                        That was before you started the 
                        program. You’re ready now. Here. 
                        Come spot me. 

                                 BENJY
                        Spot you?
                                 OSCAR
                        Yeah. Spot me. Watch my back. If 
                        the weight gets too heavy you have 
                        to help me lift it up.

                                 BENJY
                        I don’t know if I can do that.

                                 OSCAR
                        Of course you can.

           Oscar sits down on the BENCH PRESS.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Go around behind me so you have a 
                        good angle to lift. You want to put 
                        your hands here.

           Oscar demonstrates proper grip.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        And you need to remember to breathe 
                        in and exhale. 

                                 BENJY
                        Like at the Doctors.

                                 OSCAR
                        Exactly. So if I’m having trouble 
                        you have to grab the barbell, and 
                        guide it to the rack. Got it.
                             (Benjy nods)
                        Okay, here we go. One. Two. Three. 
                        Up!

           Oscar lifts the weight. He does one repetition, breathes in, 
           exhales. He starts to do the next repetition, and struggles-- 
           the weight must be over TWO HUNDRED POUNDS.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                             (face turning blue)
                        One... more!

           Oscar racks the weight.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Okay now it’s your turn. 

                                 BENJY
                        What!?

           Is Oscar insane!? This kid is only six!?
                                 OSCAR
                        Give it a try.

                                 BENJY
                        I can’t lift that much. Look at me.

                                 OSCAR
                        Strength is all mental. If you 
                        believe you can lift the weight, 
                        you can lift the weight.

                                 BENJY
                        But--

                                 OSCAR
                        Trust me. Okay?

           Benjy nods. They switch places. Benjy sits down. He takes a 
           few deep breaths to warm up. 

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Okay. One... Two... Three... Up.

           Benjy lifts the weight. He does one rep. Beat. That wasn’t 
           too bad. He goes for another. Again, easy.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Holy crap! You’re doing it.

           Benjy does another, and another, and another. He has a huge 
           grin on his face. 

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        You must have super strength!

           They have a blast.

           WE PUSH IN CLOSER ON WEIGHTS--

           AND REVEAL they are FAKE -- made of STYROFOAM and painted 
           BLACK. THIS IS WHAT THEY WERE PAINTING--

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. BEDROOM, RUIZ HOME - THE NEXT DAY

           THE VIEW OUT OSCAR AND BENJY’S WINDOW--

           A serene morning is interrupted by an EIGHT-YEAR OLD GIRL who 
           is crying because her CAT is stuck in the TREE.

           Oscar wakes up, popping up into frame slowly, as he rubs the 
           sleep from his eyes. 
           In the background, THROUGH THE WINDOW we see Benjy walk up to 
           the girl, while--

                                 OSCAR
                        Benjy? Where’d you go Buddy?

           THROUGH THE WINDOW-- 

           Benjy says something to calm the girl down we can’t hear. He 
           rolls up his sleeve. Marches toward the TREE determined. 

           OSCAR whips around and sees Benjy start climbing the tree 
           like an Orangutang.

           Benjy DANGLES DANGEROUSLY FROM A BRANCH--

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                             (panicked)
                        Benjy? What the --!?

           Oscar darts out of the bedroom--

           EXT. NEIGHBOR’S LAWN - CONTINUOUS

           Oscar arrives in a huff, just as Benjy reaches the TOP BRANCH 
           and scoops up the CAT. 

                                 OSCAR
                        Benjy get down from there!!! You’re 
                        going to get hurt!!!

                                 BENJY
                        In a sec’-- 

           We are on Oscar’s face, as he follows Benjy’s progression 
           down the tree. Oscar’s eyes dart from left to right. 

           FINALLY, Benjy hops to the ground and LANDS with a THUD, 
           rolling over and SCRAPING HIS KNEE, all the while keeping the 
           Cat safely tucked in his arms.

           Benjy pops up, and reunites the unharmed Cat with the Girl. 
           She gives Benjy a big hug, overjoyed. 

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        You’re my hero!

                                 BENJY
                        Oh no. I not a hero. Not yet.

           The Girl gives Benjy a KISS on the cheek, and then sashays 
           away. 
           Oscar grabs Benjy by the arm. 

                                 OSCAR 
                        Benjy- what were you thinking? 

                                 BENJY
                        I have super climbing abilities.

                                 OSCAR
                        What? No. Super climbing isn’t a 
                        thing. You scared the crap out of 
                        me.

                                 BENJY
                        Yes it is. Spiderman has it.

                                 OSCAR
                        No it’s not.

                                 BENJY
                        Yes it is.

                                 OSCAR
                        Super climbing isn’t a super power. 
                        I don’t want you to do that again. 

                                 SANDRA (O.S.)
                        Do what again?

           Sandra crosses the FRONT-YARD in her work uniform--

                                 OSCAR
                        ... Nothing. 

           Sandra notices the SCRAPES on Benjy’s knees from the fall. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Hijo, what happened?

                                 BENJY
                        I saved the day!

           INT. BATHROOM, RUIZ HOME - DAY

           Sandra puts NEOSPORIN on Benjy’s SCRAPE. Dresses the wound 
           with a few PINK BAND-AIDS, before she sends him on his way 
           out of the bathroom, past Oscar in the DOORWAY. Sandra and 
           Oscar are mindful not to let Benjy hear them.

                                 SANDRA
                        What happened?
                                 OSCAR
                        We were playing a game.

                                 SANDRA
                        Oscar.

                                 OSCAR
                        What? It’s not a big deal. It was 
                        just a scratch.

                                 SANDRA
                        Benjy needs his rest. He’s very 
                        sick. 

                                 OSCAR
                        I know that. I’ve actually been 
                        meaning to tell you about 
                        something. This game we’ve been 
                        playing--

                                 SANDRA
                        <<Oscar you cannot be playing 
                        games. Benjy needs two things right 
                        now, rest and prayer.>>

           Oscar scoffs. 

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        <<Is something funny?>>

                                 OSCAR
                        No.

                                 SANDRA
                        <<I need you to be responsible with 
                        your little brother when I’m not 
                        around>>

                                 OSCAR
                        <<Of course I am. Jesus Christ!>>

                                 SANDRA
                        <<Do not raise your voice with me, 
                        or use the Lord’s name in vain.>>

                                 OSCAR
                        There you go again with that Lord 
                        shit. I hate to break it to you mom 
                        but the Lord and prayer are not 
                        going to get us through this. 

                                 SANDRA
                        You need to have faith Oscar.
                                 OSCAR
                        Well I don’t have faith. But I will 
                        be there for Benjy like I have been 
                        for the past five years, since his 
                        birth.

                                 SANDRA
                        I don’t have time to argue. I’m 
                        late for work.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           EXT. PET STORE - DAY

           Oscar and Lola walk and talk mid-conversation--

                                 OSCAR
                        I haven’t even told my mom, and you 
                        want me to tell Sensei Chaz? Are 
                        you insane?

                                 LOLA
                        Just hear me out?

                                 OSCAR
                        Fine.

                                 LOLA
                        We are limited here. I mean we are 
                        a low budget operation, so we have 
                        to be creative. We can’t have Benjy 
                        race a high speed train, or stop a 
                        bullet. So what can we do?

           Oscar shrugs, what? They arrive at the WINDOW OF THE KARATE 
           STUDIO, where-- 

           INT. KARATE STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           SENSEI CHAZ is doing intense lunges. 

                                 LOLA (O.S.)
                        We have Chaz, who is the spitting 
                        image of Barry Allen?

                                 OSCAR (O.S.)
                        Who?

                                 LOLA (O.S.)
                        The Flash. Jesus you really are 
                        hopeless.
           BACK ON THE STREET--

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Chaz is perfect. His cheek bones 
                        look like they were chiseled by 
                        Michelangelo.

                                 OSCAR
                        He’s not that chiseled--

                                 LOLA
                        Trust me. We need him.

                                 OSCAR
                        I really don’t think we should let 
                        anyone else in on this.

                                 LOLA
                        Superheroes don’t do it all on 
                        their own. The Avengers. Guardians 
                        of the Galaxy. X-Men... You need to 
                        stop shutting yourself off if you 
                        want this to work.

                                 OSCAR
                        I don’t shut myself off.

                                 LOLA
                        When’s the last time you hung out 
                        with anyone who’s name wasn’t 
                        Benjy?

                                 OSCAR
                        Right now.

                                 LOLA
                        --Or Lola?

           Oscar considers this. He looks back in the WINDOW--

           As Chaz smashes his face into a BLOCK OF WOOD, we--

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

           TIGHT ON: THE FLASH...

           ... or really SENSEI CHAZ dressed up in a FLASH COSTUME. His 
           suit is too small for him so his ankles are showing, and the 
           seams are busting, but to Benjy-- he is real.
           Benjy and Oscar stand on THE TRACK watching The Flash warm 
           up.

                                 OSCAR
                        The Flash is the fastest person in 
                        the world. If you beat him we’ll 
                        know you have super speed.

           Chaz darts over to a TRASH CAN on the sidelines, dry heaving. 

                                 BENJY
                        What’s wrong with the Flash?

           Oscar darts off to CHAZ’s SIDE --

                                 OSCAR
                        What the hell Chaz?

                                 CHAZ
                        Sorry, had a pretty rough night 
                        last night. I don’t want to get 
                        into it--

                                 OSCAR
                        Please don’t.

                                 CHAZ
                             (continuing)
                        But I was balls deep in--

           A FOG HORN BLAST interrupting Chaz’ story... 

                                 LOLA (O.S.)
                        I come bearing gifts!

           They turn to find Lola strutting up to the group with a 
           FOGHORN in one hand and a SIX PACK OF BUD LIGHT in the other.

                                 OSCAR
                        There you are Lola. What’s that?

                                 CHAZ
                        Hair of the dog.

           Chaz expertly SHOTGUNS a beer. Takes it down in one long 
           gulp. Burps. Benjy arrives on the scene.

                                 BENJY 
                        What is that you drinking Flash?

                                 CHAZ
                        Beer.  
                                 BENJY
                        What’s beer?

                                 OSCAR
                        It’s his, uh, secret drink that 
                        helps him run faster. You better 
                        bring your A game Benjy.

                                 BENJY
                        Can I have some?

                                 OSCAR
                        NO.

           LATER: ON THE TRACK --

           Benjy and THE FLASH line-up to RACE. 

                                 OSCAR
                        The winner of this race, is 
                        officially the fastest person on 
                        Earth. 

                                 CHAZ
                        You’re going down little Dude!

           Lola holds the Foghorn. 

                                 LOLA
                        On your mark... Get Set... Go!

           And they’re off...

           Chaz does his best impression of Usain Bolt, and is having a 
           blast, until he realizes Benjy is actually starting to outrun 
           him --

                                 CHAZ
                        Hey! Hey! Slow down!

                                 LOLA
                        Run Benjy Run!!!

           Benjy won’t quit. He gallops past the FINISH LINE.

                                                               SLAM TO:

                        Let’s toast!
           INT. DINING ROOM, UPSCALE ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Oscar, Lola, and Benjy raise their GLASSES.

                                 OSCAR
                        To the fastest kid in the world!

                                 LOLA
                        Here here.

                                 BENJY
                        And I didn’t even need to drink the 
                        beer.

           Oscar and Lola smile. Then out of the blue--

                                 OSCAR
                        BENJY? WHERE’D BENJY GO!?

                                 BENJY
                        I’m right here.

                                 LOLA
                        I dunno. I can’t see him either. 

                                 OSCAR
                        Where are you Benjy? You 
                        disappeared.

                                 BENJY
                        Helloooo. I’m right hereeee.

           Benjy wipes his hand in front of Oscar’s face. No reaction.

           So Benjy hops up on the TABLE to get Oscar’s attention. The 
           CUTLERY rattles. Again, no reaction.

           Across the room, the Manager from the opening appears to 
           catch wind of what’s going on. He approaches their table and 
           doesn’t look happy. Is he going to ruin their fun?

           Benjy freezes in place, just as the Manager arrives at the 
           table. 

                                 MANAGER
                        How is everything?

                                 OSCAR
                        Uh, great.

                                 MANAGER
                        And where is Benjy tonight? I miss 
                        that little guy.
                                 OSCAR
                        He just disappeared on us. 

                                 MANAGER
                        Well, if he reappears tell him he’s 
                        always welcome in my restaurant. 
                        Superheroes eat on the house. 

                                 OSCAR
                        Well he hasn’t passed the program 
                        yet, but thank you. I’ll let him 
                        know. 

           Manager was in on it all along--

           Benjy can’t contain his excitement. He has the time of his 
           life, hopping from table to table, as everyone in the 
           restaurant plays along. The mood is cheery and light, until--

                                                               SLAM TO:

           TIGHT ON: A CLUMP OF BLACK HAIR IN A SHOWER DRAIN...

                                 BENJY
                             (screaming)
                        OSCAR! OSCAR! 

           INT. BATHROOM, RUIZ HOME - NIGHT

           Benjy is crying. Huddled naked in the corner of the bathroom.  
           Oscar arrives, out of breath.

                                 OSCAR
                        What’s wrong!? What’s going on?!

                                 BENJY
                        I... my hair.

           Benjy’s hands are full of clumps of his once luscious, jet 
           black hair. 

                                 OSCAR
                        It’s okay buddy. That’s supposed to 
                        happen. You’re going to be okay.

           Oscar wraps Benjy in a TOWEL.

           LATER --

           Oscar and Benjy stand at the sink and look into the mirror as 
           Oscar buzzes all of Benjy’s hair off. It’s as somber as a 
           funeral.
           TIGHT ON BENJY: FULLY BALD. He’s ready to explode.

                                 BENJY
                        I look like a Super Villain.

                                 OSCAR
                        No you don’t. 

                                 BENJY
                        They’re going to kick me out of the 
                        program. I know it.

                                 OSCAR
                        You look like Professor Xavier-- 
                        he’s a good guy.

           Benjy can’t hold it anymore -- he erupts in tears and wails.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Shhhh... Shhh.. Benjy it’s all part 
                        of the program. 

                                 BENJY
                        How?

           Oscar has his work cut out for him to explain this one.

                                 OSCAR
                        Well, uh, they need you to know 
                        what it feels like to be a villain 
                        if you want to beat them.

                                 BENJY
                        Huh?

                                 OSCAR
                        You need to take a walk in a 
                        Villains shoes if you want to 
                        outsmart them. It’s part of 
                        Superhero 101.

           Benjy calms down. He sniffles now.

                                 BENJY
                        I guess that makes sense...

                                 OSCAR
                        And you know what else?

                                 BENJY
                        What?

                                 OSCAR
                        I have to do it too.
           Oscar hands Benjy the BUZZER.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        It’s my turn. Shave my head.

           Benjy has a mischievous smile. He shaves Oscar’s head. 

           (NOTE: Benjy will be BALD for the rest of the script)

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. LIVING-ROOM, RUIZ HOME - NIGHT

           Benjy is fast asleep drooling on Oscar as they sit on the 
           couch watching GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY.

           The DOORBELL RINGS, Benjy stirs but doesn’t wake up. 

           INT. FOYER, RUIZ HOME - NIGHT

           Oscar opens the door to find Lola. She takes in his new 
           HAIRCUT.

                                 LOLA
                        Damnnnn. You look bad-ass.

                                 OSCAR
                        Thanks. What are you doing here?

                                 LOLA
                        We came to cheer you up!

                                 OSCAR
                        We?

                                 CHAZ (O.S.)
                        Hey Bro!

           CHAZ locks his car and crosses the FRONT LAWN--

                                 OSCAR
                             (under his breath)
                        Why’d you invite him?

           Chaz arrives in the doorway brandishing his CASE OF BEERS--

                                 CHAZ
                        Let’s get wasted!

                                 OSCAR
                        Er, my mom doesn’t really let me 
                        have parties when she’s out. 
                                 CHAZ
                        Parties? It’s just the three of us.
                             (looking into the living-
                              room)
                        Is that Wii!? Oh man, I’m going to 
                        smash bro.

           Chaz darts past Oscar straight for the NINTENTO WII CONSOLE.

                                 OSCAR
                        Be quiet. Benjy’s fast asleep--

                                 BENJY (O.S.)
                        No I’m not!

                                 CHAZ
                        There’s my lil’ dude!

                                 BENJY
                        Sensei Chaz!

           Chaz and Benjy bow. They do intricate punch moves in unison.

                                 LOLA
                        I brought you a present Benjy.

           Lola pulls out an old COMIC BOOK -- Captain Marvel “THE DEATH 
           OF CAPTAIN MARVEL”.

           Benjy approaches it like it’s a sacred scroll. Gives Lola a 
           big hug. Oscar gets a better look at the Comic.

                                 OSCAR
                        The Death of Captain Marvel!? 
                             (under his breath to Lola)
                        Are you serious?

                                 LOLA
                        What?

                                 OSCAR
                        Can I talk to you in private for a 
                        sec’?

           Chaz and Benjy start to play Wii in the background.

                                 LOLA
                        Sure. Ooo can we go on the roof?

                                 OSCAR
                        Absolutely not.

                                                               SLAM TO:
           EXT. ROOF, RUIZ HOME - MAGIC HOUR

           Lola strides onto the ROOF basking in the picture perfect 
           SUNSET. Oscar hovers in the window.

                                 OSCAR
                        Come back here Lola. 

                                 LOLA
                        Don’t be such a wimp. Check out the 
                        view!

           Against his better judgement, Oscar tiptoes over to Lola. 

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        So what did you want to talk about?

                                 OSCAR
                        I appreciate you coming over to 
                        cheer us up. I really do. 

                                 LOLA
                        But?

                                 OSCAR
                        You can’t give a kid with cancer a 
                        book with Death in the title. 

                                 LOLA
                        Why? Death is a Marvel character.

                                 OSCAR
                        It’s not a character Lola. Death is 
                        a horrible thing.

                                 LOLA
                        Why is it horrible?

                                 OSCAR
                        I mean, do I really have to 
                        explain?

                                 LOLA
                        Believe me, I know all about death, 
                        but I don’t think it’s some 
                        “horrible” thing, and I don’t think 
                        you need to tiptoe around it with 
                        Benjy. He’s a sharp kid. 

                                 OSCAR
                        Death is the end. Period. Benjy’s 
                        too young to know about horrible 
                        things like that. 
                                 LOLA
                        Cancer is horrible. Suffering is 
                        horrible. Death is the beginning. 

                                 OSCAR
                        You may like to be delusional. But 
                        I don’t have that luxury. 

           Oscar and Lola sit on the edge of the roof. Thinking. 

                                 LOLA
                        When my mom got sick she was 
                        battling aggressive bone cancer, 
                        and she was fighting like a champ. 
                        I was so lost, and confused. My dad 
                        tried to console me because he’s a 
                        fixer, always putting things back 
                        together and helping people -- but 
                        nothing worked.

                                 OSCAR
                        I’m sorry.

                                 LOLA
                        I was lost until I found my first 
                        comic book. That comic book. The 
                        beauty of comics are that they take 
                        all of this, everything, and make 
                        sense of it. It makes everything-- 
                        okay. And now I’m a fixer too, and 
                        I look after my dad instead of the 
                        other way around, but I’m not 
                        afraid to live my life to the 
                        fullest. 

           Out of nowhere, Lola pops up and does a HANDSTAND on the 
           roof. She is framed up against THE WATER TOWER in the 
           background. 

                                 OSCAR
                        Jesus, are you trying to kill 
                        yourself!? 

                                 LOLA
                             (still upside down)
                        When’s the last time you did 
                        something crazy Oscar? 

                                 OSCAR
                        What?

           Lola rights herself. 
                                 LOLA
                        You spend all this time worrying 
                        about your brother, but when’s the 
                        last time you said fuck it and took 
                        time for yourself?

                                 OSCAR
                        Are you saying I should just say F-
                        U to my brother who has cancer?

                                 LOLA
                        You’re so busy acting like Benjy 
                        could drop dead at any moment, that 
                        you’re the one who’s dead.

                                 OSCAR
                        You think I like having to be 
                        Benjy’s father, looking after him, 
                        worrying every second of every day? 
                        You think I like that pressure?

                        Sometimes I can’t breathe. It feels 
                        like someone’s sitting on me. And I 
                        want to go somewhere and be alone, 
                        and scream. But there’s nowhere to 
                        go. I’m trapped.

                        afraid of everything Oscar. I wish 
                        he’d rub off on you a little.

                        Well you’re going to need a

           Oscar and Benjy, wearing his cape as a tie per usual, snooze 
           in a back pew as Father John gives his sermon. Sandra nudges 
           them awake, annoyed.
           EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY

           The congregation files out. Sandra hangs back, chatting with 
           Father John. They approach Oscar with Benjy on his shoulders.

                                 SANDRA
                        Oscar-Benjy, I’m going to head to 
                        work, but I thought it might be 
                        nice for you to spend a little time 
                        with Father John.

                        Er, now is not a good time. We were 
                        planning on going to the Pet-Store. 
                        It’s really important.

           INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH, CATHOLIC CHURCH - LATER

           Father John and Benjy have their heads bent down in prayer, 
           eyes closed. Oscar glances at his watch. Taps his foot 
           impatiently.

           Oscar pulls out his FLIP PHONE and shoots Lola a TEXT: 
           Running 30 minutes late. Let’s call off the Robbery. 

           Lola Responds: I can’t reach Chaz. He’s gone Rogue.

           Oscar mouths shit to himself, as --

                                 FATHER JOHN
                             (wrapping up their prayer)
                        ... Amen. So Benjy, how are you 
                        doing buddy?

                                 BENJY
                        Good... I guess.

                                 FATHER JOHN
                        Do you want to talk about what’s 
                        going on in your life. 
                                 BENJY
                        Not really.

                                 FATHER JOHN
                        That’s alright. We don’t have to 
                        talk about anything right now. But 
                        if you’re feeling uneasy about 
                        anything, I just want you to know 
                        that I’m here for you. 

           Benjy looks down, embarrassed.

                                 BENJY
                        Well, actually I feel... a little 
                        scared.

           Oscar reacts, never considering that Benjy might feel this 
           way.

                                 FATHER JOHN
                        Benjy, you know there’s nothing to 
                        be afraid of, right? 

           Benjy is talking about the Superhero program, while Father 
           John is talking about Cancer. The sentiment works both ways. 

                                 BENJY
                        I know. It’s just... sometimes I 
                        worry that I’m not going to pass 
                        the program, and become a 
                        superhero.

                                 FATHER JOHN
                        Well, I think you have to realize 
                        that you’re already a Superhero 
                        Benjy. No matter what happens.

           Oscar can’t believe that the Father’s speech reinforced his 
           charade. He wipes the sweat from his brow.

                                 FATHER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Now Oscar, you haven’t given a 
                        confession since your father --

                             (cutting Father John off)
                        I don’t need to talk. And I haven’t 
                        confessed because I don’t believe 
                        in God, or any of this.  I just 
                        come to Church to keep mom off my 
                        back.
                             (to Benjy)
                        That’s between us.
                                 FATHER JOHN
                        Well, that’s why your mom wanted me 
                        to talk to you.

                                 OSCAR
                        So she roped you into this? 
                        Classic. Well we’re really in a

                        you if you need.

                                 CHAZ
                        Give me the money in the safe. Now.

                        What safe? This is a pet-store.

                                 CHAZ
                        The register-whatever. Give me the 
                        money or I’ll blow your brains out.

                        Of course! Please don’t hurt us.

           Lola rushes to the register to prepare bills for Chaz. 

                                 CHAZ
                             (noticing the Father John)
                        Why is there a priest here?

           EXT. PET STORE - DAY

           Officer Firestone approaches cautiously. He flicks open his 
           GUN HOLSTER thinking this might actually be a robbery.

           INT. PET STORE - DAY

           Benjy steps up to Chaz, defiant.

                                 BENJY
                        Get outta here you big bully!

                                 CHAZ
                        And who’s going to make me?

                                 BENJY
                        Well, I don’t have a name yet... 
                        but me.

                                 CHAZ
                        HA! You don’t scare me. 

                                 BENJY
                        Don’t make me hurt you mister 
                        bully. I’m warning you.

                                 CHAZ
                        Come and get me.

           Benjy strides at Chaz, just as THE DOOR OPENS --
           Officer Firestone un-holsters his GUN and points it at the 
           GROUP.

           Officer Firestone surveys the room--

           Benjy is on top of CHAZ THE BURGLAR, smothering him with 
           punches, while--

           Father John prays to himself on the floor, and --

           Officer Firestone and Father John stand with Lola and Oscar. 
           THROUGH THE WINDOW we see Chaz and Benjy on the sidewalk 
           waiting impatiently for the others. 

                                 FATHER JOHN
                        I’m very disappointed in both of 
                        you.

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        Do you know how dangerous it is to 
                        tell a boy with cancer he’s got 
                        magic powers? Especially that 
                        little Tasmanian Devil.

                                 OSCAR
                        We’re Guatemalan. That’s offensive.

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        Shut up.

                                 OSCAR
                        Okay. 
                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        You’re better than this Lola. I 
                        warned you about hanging around bad 
                        apples like him. 

                                 OSCAR
                        ME? The bad apple? 

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        Shut up.

                                 OSCAR
                        Sure.

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        Now I can empathize with your 
                        situation Oscar. Lord knows I can. 
                        But it’s time to end this charade 
                        before someone gets hurt. 

                                 FATHER JOHN
                        I agree with Officer Firestone. You 
                        need to be honest with Benjy.

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        You’re just lucky you escaped 
                        without a bullet in that thick 
                        skull of yours Oscar. 
                             (to Lola)
                        Let’s go Lola.

           They exit. Oscar turns to Father John. 

                                 OSCAR
                        I think I’m ready for that 
                        confession Father John, as long as 
                        there’s some sort of Confessor-
                        Confessee confidentiality?

           Father John rolls his eyes at Oscar.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Okay, I’ll come clean.

           INT. PLAYGROUND, CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - DAY

           Oscar and Lola are mid confession to Dr. Rabinowitz--
                                 OSCAR
                        I came up with this stupid lie, 
                        really STUPID, like brain dead 
                        stupid, BUT I didn’t want him to 
                        have to know what he’s up against 
                        because it’s bleak, and horrible, 
                        and unfair, and I know my baby 
                        brother and he’s not ready. He’s 
                        just not. So I said “you’re going 
                        to be joining a top secret program 
                        to become a superhero” not thinking 
                        about how I could possibly keep up 
                        a lie of that magnitude--

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        --I’m in.

                                 OSCAR
                        Good. Let’s just go in there, and 
                        tell him the truth. Because that’s 
                        what’s right.

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        Oscar, I’m in. Let’s do it.

                                 OSCAR
                        Wait, what?

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        Let’s help Benjy become a 
                        Superhero.

                                 OSCAR
                        But it can’t be a good idea. Can 
                        it? 

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        We’re here to help Benjy get 
                        better. And I’ve learned over the 
                        years that one of the most 
                        effective healing tools is hope. 
                        What could give Benjy more to look 
                        forward to than becoming a 
                        Superhero? Though, we can do a 
                        better job of controlling the 
                        situations. Clearly.

                                 OSCAR
                        Right. And on that subject, I think 
                        it’ll be best if I explain all of 
                        this to my mom. She’s pretty 
                        emotionally distraught right now, 
                        so I’ll need to be delicate with 
                        her.
                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        Sure. Whatever you think is best.

                                 OSCAR
                        Thanks.

                        Well now it’s time for me to put

                        first mission. 

           The LIGHTS GO OUT--

           Dr. Rabinowitz uses a PROJECTOR to outline the mission--

           1st SLIDE-- A PICTURE OF THE MARVEL CHARACTER “DEATH”

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ (V.O.)
                        Death has enlisted his crony Dr. 
                        Doom to do his bidding...

           2nd SLIDE-- “DR. DOOM” (DR. RABINOWITZ DRESSED IN COSTUME)

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ (V.O.)
                        ... and what is he after? The fifth 
                        Infinity Gem.

           3rd SLIDE-- AN INFINITY GEM (A RING POP)

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ (V.O.)
                        Our reconnaissance has lead us to 
                        believe the Gem is located here...

                        We need you to find the ring before 
                        Dr. Doom does. The fate of the 
                        world and the universe hangs in the

           Beat they all take this in.

                        I love it Benjy, and I took a look 
                        at some of your initial suit 
                        designs. 

           Dr. Rabinowitz brandishes the HAND-DRAWN SUPERHERO SUIT. It’s 
           a crude mix between Batman and Superman in blue and gold. 
           Oscar brings out the REAL THING-- the SUPERHERO SUIT based on 
           the designs and it’s BAD ASS.

                        What do you say? Are you ready to 
                        save the world?

           EXT. PARK, CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - DAY

           Benjy, in his new superhero suit, scours the park for the 
           Infinity gem with Oscar and Lola, when DR. DOOM approaches 
           brandishing the RING POP (INFINITY GEM).

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ/DR. DOOM 
                        Were you looking for this Captain 
                        Infinity?

                                 BENJY 
                        Hand it over Dr. Doom.

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ/DR. DOOM.
                        Make me.

           The scene plays out the way Benjy’s imagination sees it...

           -- STRAIGHT OUT OF A MARVEL MOVIE --

           The shots are stylized. The colors saturated.

           Benjy and Dr. Doom engage in a FIST FIGHT that would make 
           Tarantino proud. They utilize ITEMS FROM THE PLAYGROUND-- 
           Benjy climbs the MONKEY BARS. FLIPS THROUGH THE AIR and FLIES 
           at DR. DOOM ending in a HIGH KICK. WAM. 

           Dr. Doom recovers and grabs the CHAINS from the SWING SET. He 
           rips them off and swings them at Benjy who DUCKS just in 
           time.

           The two have an EPIC BATTLE, fighting on the SLIDE, THE 
           SPINNING WHEEL, THE UNEVEN BARS, and ultimately Benjy defeats 
           Dr. Doom winning the INFINITY GEM...

           BACK TO REALITY--

           Benjy holds the ring pop HIGH IN THE AIR, victorious.

           Dr. Rabinowitz makes dramatic noises with his mouth before 
           PLAYING DEAD. 

           Oscar and Lola celebrate, cheering Benjy on. The mood is 
           triumphant, until --

           Benjy gets queasy...

                                 BENJY
                        I don’ feel... so... good. 

           Then he VOMITS...

                                 SANDRA
                        You’re okay hijo! Mami’s here.

           Oscar stands horrified in the corner. Dr. Rabinowitz enters.

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ 
                        His white blood cell count is very 
                        low, and he’s not holding any of 
                        his food down. We’re going to need 
                        to do a blood transfusion.

           INT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - DAY

           Benjy does a SCAN. His face is contorted due to the pain. 
           INT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - DAY

           Benjy is under for a BLOOD TRANSFUSION. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Dr. Rabinowitz speaks to Oscar--

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        We’re going to have to take a break 
                        on the Superhero hi-jinks until 
                        Benjy is feeling better.

                                 OSCAR
                             (lying)
                        Got it. I actually, uh, just spoke 
                        with my mom and she thought the 
                        same thing. 

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        Good. Have you given any thought 
                        into Benjy’s Make-A-Wish?

                                 OSCAR
                        Wait, he’s not terminal is he?

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        No, no, no -- he just needs rest.

           Sandra wheels Benjy out in a WHEELCHAIR, wearing a HOSPITAL 
           MASK over his mouth. 

           INT. BATHROOM, RUIZ HOME - NIGHT

           Benjy hurls, bent over the toilet while Sandra pats his back. 
           Oscar watches from the doorway.

                                                               SLAM TO:
           INT. ROOF, RUIZ HOME - NIGHT

           Oscar sits on the edge of the roof, pensive. He spots that 
           WATER TOWER again. Thinks. Then takes out his PHONE.

           TEXT MESSAGE TO LOLA: Been a tough week. Are you free 
           tonight?

           Lola enters, holding a TRAY OF BROWNIES.

                                 LOLA
                        Thought these might cheer you up. 

                                 OSCAR
                        Aw that’s sweet of you, but I’m not 
                        hungry. Cleaning up puke all day 
                        kind of ruins your appetite.

                                 LOLA
                        Trust me, you’re going to want to 
                        eat these brownies.

           Lola and Oscar make their way to the COUCH. 

                                 OSCAR
                        Benjy and my mom are both asleep so 
                        we have to be quiet.

                                 LOLA
                        Well in that case--

           Lola cuts herself a BROWNIE piece and starts eating.

                                 OSCAR
                        Those Brownie’s smell weird, are 
                        they--?

                                 LOLA
                        “Special”. Yeah.

           Oscar get’s it now-- she brought POT BROWNIES. He scoops a 
           piece of BROWNIE for himself. Nibbles it.

                        So Chaz is throwing a little get 
                        together tonight at his place. He 
                        invited us.
                                 OSCAR
                        You should go.

                                 LOLA
                        No YOU should go. You need to take 
                        a night off Dr. Ruiz.

                                 OSCAR
                        Benjy’s been feeling pretty crappy 
                        lately. It’s not a good idea. You 
                        go. Thanks for stopping by. You 
                        really did cheer me up. But go have 
                        fun with Chaz. I don’t want to hold 
                        anyone else back.

                                 LOLA
                        I’m not going without you. When’s 
                        the last time you went to a party 
                        with kids your own age...
                             (beat)
                        We’re going.

           Lola drags Oscar up on his feet.  

                                 OSCAR
                        Fine, fine. Let me just put this 
                        tray away and save it for later.

           Oscar places the Tray of Brownies above the REFRIGERATOR in a 
           place seemingly too high for Benjy.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           EXT. CHAZ’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           The thump of a HOUSE PARTY vibrates CHAZ’ HOUSE. Lola and 
           Oscar walk up to the FRONT DOOR--

                                 OSCAR
                        Cops are going to bust this party 
                        in a second. It feels like an 
                        earthquake.

                                 LOLA

                                 OSCAR
                        Right.

           They push the FRONT DOOR open, and step inside to find--
           INT. CHAZ’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           A KEGGAR in full swing replete with beer pong, flip cup, and 
           a dance floor in the LIVING ROOM--

           Oscar is an alien discovering this magical world for the 
           first time. Lola senses his trepidation and touches his HAND.

                                 CHAZ (O.S.)
                        Oscar! 

           Chaz slaps his arm around both Chaz and Lola. 

                                 CHAZ (CONT’D)
                        I’m so glad you made it man.

                                 OSCAR
                        Of course. Thanks for having me.

                        Oh no sorry, I’m not drinking. I 
                        drove.

                        Oscar, mi casa is your casa. You 
                        are sleeping over and leaving your 
                        car here. That’s an order. 

                                 OSCAR
                        Uh, sure. I guess that’s alright.

           He grabs the Tray of Brownies. Digs in with both hands.

           Lola and Chaz teach Oscar various beer games: Flip Cup.

                        my brother from another mother, 
                        Oscar Ruiz, is going to play 
                        something special for us. 

           Oscar stands in front of the crowd with his GUITAR, scared 
           shitless.
           He starts to strum LOLA by The Kinks

           Then dives into it with a confident and raw rendition --

                                 OSCAR
                        I met her in a club down in North 
                        Soho
                        Where you drink champagne and it 
                        tastes just like cherry cola
                        See-O-L-A cola.
                        She walked up to me and she asked 
                        me to dance.
                        I asked her name and in a dark 
                        brown voice she said, "Lola"
                        L-O-L-A Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
                        Well, I'm not the world's most 
                        physical guy,
                        But when she squeezed me tight she 
                        nearly broke my spine
                        Oh my Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola...

           Oscar oozes charisma. He was born to be on STAGE.

           The AUDIENCE whistles and cheers.

                        Well, I'm not dumb but I can't 
                        understand
                        Why she walk like a woman and talk 
                        like a man
                        Well, we drank champagne and danced 
                        all night,
                        Under electric candlelight,
                        She picked me up and sat me on her 
                        knee,
                        And said, "Little boy won't you 
                        come home with me?"

           Lola and Oscar lock eyes. The tension between them is 
           electric... 

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. OSCAR’S CAR - NIGHT

           THE CHORUS to the song LOLA kicks into high gear over the CAR 
           RADIO, as Oscar and Lola attack each other’s faces, making 
           out intensely. 

                                 OVER THE RADIO
                        Well, I'm not the world's most 
                        passionate guy,
                        But when I looked in her eyes,

                        Well I almost fell for my Lola,
                        Lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
                        Lola lo lo lo lo Lola lo lo lo lo 
                        Lola

           They peel off their CLOTHES as they try to maneuver 
           comfortably in the BACKSEAT. This is part ballet, part 
           animalistic dance.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN, RUIZ HOME - SAME

           Benjy, high from the pot brownies, is dancing around the 
           kitchen in sync with the MUSIC. He’s like a mini Tom Cruise 
           in Risky Business, but with a face covered in CRUMBS.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OSCAR’S CAR - SAME

           Oscar and Lola’s bodies entwine as they fight to get as close 
           as possible to one another. They THRUST and MOAN in pleasure. 

           BLUE and RED lights dance in the reflection of the windows as 
           if this long overdue interaction brought on FIREWORKS.

           Lola’s FACE contorts, close to an orgasm, while-- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN, RUIZ HOME - SAME

           Benjy keels over, and VOMITS uncontrollably onto the floor, 
           sick from the POT BROWNIES, as--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OSCAR’S CAR - SAME

           Oscar and Lola realize too late, that these dancing lights 
           are not fireworks at all -- they are POLICE LIGHTS.

           A KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK rattles the CAR WINDOW from none other 
           than Officer Firestone. 

           It takes him a moment to register who he just found in the 
           BACKSEAT, while busting up the party...
           We don’t linger on his wordless reaction, because we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN, RUIZ HOME - SAME

           THE LIGHTS are on in the whole house as Sandra is awake 
           cleaning up the mess.

           She clocks the TRAY OF POT BROWNIES as she mops the floor. 
           Sniffs. Knows what they are.

           INT. BEDROOM, RUIZ HOME - DAY

           Sandra tucks Benjy into bed. He’s looking a little better 
           than before.

                                 SANDRA
                        I’m going to kill Oscar.

                                 BENJY
                        Don’t get Oscar in trouble. I don’t 
                        want to be kicked out of the 
                        program.

                                 SANDRA
                        What program?

                                 BENJY
                        You don’t know? 

                                 SANDRA
                        What program?

                                 BENJY
                        The “sickness” is a fake. I thought 
                        you would’a known by now. I’m in a 
                        program to become a superhero. I’m 
                        gunna make papa so proud.

                                 SANDRA
                        Benjy, I’m so sorry to tell you 
                        this but there is no program. You 
                        have cancer. You are very sick, and 
                        you need rest.

                                 BENJY
                        But it’s real. I have super 
                        strength, and speed, and 
                        invisibility. Just ask Oscar.
           Sandra doesn’t know how to handle this, and she’s interrupted 
           as A PHONE RINGS...

           INT. HOLDING CELL, POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Oscar pleads with Officer Firestone who is filling out 
           paperwork at his DESK-- 

                                 OSCAR
                        Please. If I have an arrest on my 
                        record, I’ll never get into 
                        college. Please.

           Officer Firestone ignores him, revelling in Oscar’s agony. 
           Oscar punches the BRICK WALL. Ow. He immediately regrets it.

           INT. LOBBY, POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Sandra checks in at the FRONT DESK holding Benjy who looks a 
           little better than before.

                                 CLERK
                        What’s with the kid?

                        2am. I’m here for Oscar Ruiz.

           Clerk directs her to have a SEAT.

           Sandra sits Benjy down.
                                 SANDRA
                        I’m going back there to pick up 
                        Oscar. Stay put. Okay?

                                 BENJY
                        But I need to talk to Oscar. 

           INT. HOLDING CELL, POLICE STATION - DAY

           Officer Firestone opens up the DOOR to the holding cell for 
           Sandra with a CLINK.

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        I’ll give you two a minute.

           Officer exits leaving Sandra and Oscar alone. 

           Oscar can’t make eye contact. They stand there, breathing 
           deeply for a moment -- an epic standoff. He finally looks up, 
           and starts to cry. It’s tough disappointing someone you love. 

                                 SANDRA
                        <<I can’t believe you right now... 
                        Benjy ate those brownies and got 
                        very sick. I’ve been taking care of 
                        him all night.>>

           Oscar’s stomach churns with guilt.

                                 OSCAR
                        I’m so sorry, Mami...

                                 SANDRA
                        <<And I can’t even begin to tell 
                        you how mad I am at you for lying 
                        to him. Shame on you Oscar.>>

                                 OSCAR
                        I didn’t--

                                 BENJY (O.S.)
                        Oscar!

           Benjy hustles into the room.

                                 OSCAR
                        Benjy.

                                 BENJY
                        Tell Mami about the program. It’s 
                        real right? I’m a superhero, right?
                                 OSCAR
                        I--

                                 BENJY
                        You didn’t lie. I told mom lying is 
                        for villains. You’re not a villain. 
                        Are you?

           Oscar’s no response, is a guilty verdict. 

           This betrayal takes a moment to sink in for Benjy, but when 
           it does, he freaks out -- starts crying, and--

                                 SANDRA
                        Don’t cry Benjy!

           Benjy charges at Oscar, punching him in the stomach. 

                                 BENJY
                        You a liar. I hate you.

                                 OSCAR
                        No-I...

           Benjy finishes and dashes out--

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

                                 BENJY
                        I’m running away.

                                 SANDRA
                        No you’re not hijo.

           -- and he’s out the DOOR. 

           Oscar is left with Sandra. 

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe you would lie to a 
                        him. 

                                 OSCAR
                        You’re a hypocrite. 

                                 SANDRA
                        A what?

                                 OSCAR
                        You talk about lying-- you haven’t 
                        mentioned dad once in three years. 
                                 SANDRA
                        Oscar!

                                 OSCAR
                        He killed himself mom. And you 
                        won’t even acknowledge that it 
                        happened. Meanwhile, I’ve been 
                        playing “Dad” for Benjy’s whole 
                        life and I’m tired of it. I want to 
                        just be a normal kid. Go to 
                        parties. Drink beer. Go to college. 
                        Have a girlfriend. But I can’t do 
                        anything. Sometimes I just wish 
                        Benjy would die already --

           Sandra breaks down crying. Oscar can’t believe he just 
           revealed a deep and painful truth.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t.. mean that. I didn’t mean 
                        that... I’m so sorry Mami. 

           He tries to touch her, but she recoils.

           Oscar wants to console her, but he remembers Benjy is out 
           there. He darts out after Benjy--

           EXT. POLICE STATION - SAME

           Benjy cries as he runs as fast as he can in the middle of the 
           street. His little legs kick up dust. He’s a block away from 
           the Station, when --

           Oscar exits, and chases after him.

                                 OSCAR
                             (yelling)
                        Come back Benjy!

           Benjy doesn’t have the energy to respond. He’s confused. 
           Devastated. Lost. 

           His legs lose steam. He coughs. Wobbles. Collapses in the 
           MIDDLE OF THE STREET. 

           Oscar sprints -- arrives at Benjy’s side. He wraps Benjy in a 
           HUG, but Benjy fights it-- flailing his arms in protest. 
           Crying.

           Benjy gives up. Falls into the hug. Exhausted of all 
           emotions.

           He goes catatonic as Oscar holds him in his arms.

                        We’ve completed 14 rounds out of 18 
                        and the good news is we’ve shrunken 
                        the tumor to a manageable size. Now 
                        it’s risky, but I recommend

           Oscar marches off -- pissed off at the world. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Thank you Doctor.

                                 DR. RABINOWITZ
                        You know it’s my fault. The whole 
                        superhero program. I thought it was 
                        a good idea. 

           Sandra thinks about this.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY

           Oscar stands SOAKED in front of his father’s GRAVE-SITE -- 
           devoid of emotion. Rain falls. He doesn’t notice.

                                 SANDRA (O.S.)
                        I thought I might find you here.

           Sandra walks up to Oscar with an UMBRELLA. She offers it. He 
           declines. Long beat.

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        Your father was the most charming 
                        man I’d ever known. <<He was 
                        magnetic.>>

           Oscar looks up. 

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        <<But he was unstable. Tormented.>> 
                        He couldn’t just be happy- stay 
                        put. So I let him go... the first 
                        time. He needed to travel the world-
                        - and he had so much to offer it. 

           Oscar really listens now -- this is the first time his mother 
           has opened up about his father. 
                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        <<I didn’t want to let him back 
                        into our lives, but I loved him so 
                        deeply. I took him back and he gave 
                        us a miracle.>>

                                 OSCAR
                        <<A miracle?>>

                                 SANDRA
                        Benjy. Benjy is our miracle.

           Oscar nods in agreement. 

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        This world was too much for him. So 
                        he left again.

                                 OSCAR
                        You mean killed himself. 

           Beat.

                                 SANDRA
                        <<Yes. I was so mad. So furious. So 
                        heartbroken. I pushed it out of my 
                        mind. I never accepted it. I’m 
                        sorry hijo.>> 

           Oscar doesn’t respond, but he gets it.

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        I get why you lied to Benjy. 
                        Sometimes a white lie isn’t so bad. 
                        You’re not a liar. 

                                 OSCAR
                        I am. 

                                 SANDRA
                        No.

                                 OSCAR
                        I’m more like Papa than you know.  

                                 SANDRA
                        Don’t be scared hijo. Have faith.

                                 OSCAR
                        How? How can you believe in God? 
                        Benjy might die tomorrow. 
                                 SANDRA
                        I have faith that if the Lord 
                        decides to take Benjy, he will go 
                        to a better place. 

                                 OSCAR
                        That’s a fairy tale. A comic book. 
                        There’s nothing after this. 
                        Nothing.

                                 SANDRA
                        <<You see I thought about it, and I 
                        was thinking about what you did.>> 
                        Telling Benjy this whole Superhero 
                        story to make him believe. Maybe 
                        that’s all I do too. But it’s that 
                        belief that makes it real. Belief 
                        in God. Belief in stories. There 
                        may be nothing after this life 
                        Oscar, but nothing is everything. 
                        Nothing is Infinity.

           This doesn’t make Oscar feel any better. He’s still lost.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. HALLWAY, CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - DAY

           Sandra, Lola and Oscar speak to Officer Firestone. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Thank you for coming. Nothing is 
                        cheering him up, and he needs to be 
                        in good spirits before the surgery.

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE 
                        Happy to help. Honestly Oscar, if I 
                        was going to walk in on my daughter 
                        and any young punk, I’m glad it was 
                        you. 

           Officer Firestone holds out his hand for Oscar. They shake.

                                 OSCAR
                        Thanks. I’m going to wait out here. 
                        Benjy still won’t talk to me.

           Oscar and Lola exit, while Sandra opens the door for the 
           Officer Firestone--
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - DAY

                                 SANDRA
                        Benjy? I have a guest for you.

           No response. Officer Firestone enters and pulls up a CHAIR 
           next to Benjy’s HOSPITAL BED. Takes off his HAT. 

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        Hi Benjy.

           Benjy studies Officer Firestone.

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE (CONT’D)
                        I hear you’re all bummed out. Is 
                        that right? You want to be a 
                        Superhero, huh? Well, what if I 
                        told you that you don’t have to be 
                        a Superhero to be a Super Hero. 

                                 BENJY
                        I’d say you’re stupid. 

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        Police Officers- we risk our lives 
                        every day to protect the people of 
                        this town. We don’t have super 
                        powers, just a will to do some 
                        good. It takes grit. It takes 
                        toughness. And it’s not easy. I 
                        have to tell you, I see potential 
                        in you.

                                 BENJY
                        Me?

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        Yes sir. That’s why I’m here -- to 
                        deputize you.

                                 BENJY
                             (weakly, but excited)
                        Really?

           Officer Firestone brandishes a BADGE and a WALKIE TALKIE.

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        You can have these but only after 
                        you recite the Police Officer’s 
                        Oath. Repeat after me -- I Benjamin 
                        Ruiz do swear... 

                                 BENJY
                        Is this real? I’m tired of lies.
           Officer Firestone nods. 

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                             (repeating)
                        I Benjamin Ruiz do swear... 

                                 BENJY
                        I Benjamin... Ruiz do swear... 

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        I will well and truly serve

                                 BENJY
                        I will... uh--

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        Well and truly serve our sovereign 
                        country and state.

                                 BENJY
                        ... Well and truly suv our sov’n 
                        country and state.

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        Good... 
                             (then intense and 
                              inspiring)
                        AS A POLICE OFFICER WITHOUT FAVOR 
                        OR AFFECTION - MALICE OR ILL-

                                 BENJY

                        FICTION - MALLS OR ILL-WILL?

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        SO HELP ME GOD.

                                 BENJY
                        SO HELP ME GOD.

           Officer Firestone puts the BADGE and WALKIE TALKIE in front 
           of Benjy.

           He twists a knob and the Walkie Talkie SQUAWKS TO LIFE--

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        Congratulations. You’re deputized.
                        Ready to be a real hero?

           Benjy nods, excited.
                                 DISPATCH
                             (crackly)

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        And that’s me. After your surgery 
                        we’ll go on a ride along. How does 
                        that sound?

                                 BENJY
                        Good.

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        Stay outta trouble, and get some 
                        rest.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           EXT. PLAYGROUND, CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - DAY

           Oscar and Lola sit on the swings. Oscar broods. 

                                 LOLA
                        What are you thinking about?

                                 OSCAR
                        Nothing... Everything.

                                 LOLA
                        I know.

           She swings higher and higher.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Come, let’s see who can jump 
                        farther.

                                 OSCAR
                        No.

                                 LOLA
                        Don’t be a bitch.

           They swing higher and higher, before LEAPING-- 

           THEY LAND. Oscar out-jumped Lola.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        I let you win to cheer you up.
                                 OSCAR
                        Nothing is going to make me forget 
                        that this could be the last night I 
                        have with my brother and he’s not 
                        speaking to me.

                                 LOLA
                        Well, that doesn’t mean you can’t 
                        speak to him.

           EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM, CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - MAGIC HOUR

           Sandra is fast asleep in the chair by Benjy’s bedside. Benjy 
           is fast asleep as well, looking angelic but frail. 

           Oscar pulls a chair up next to the bed. He holds A LETTER, 
           like those written from his dad earlier.

                                 OSCAR
                        Hi Buddy... If you can hear me I 
                        just wanted to read you a letter -- 
                        from ME this time. “Dear Benjy... 
                        I’m sorry... for everything. I love 
                        you so much. I never meant to hurt 
                        you by lying to you, I just wanted 
                        to protect you, but the truth is 
                        you don’t need me to protect you. I 
                        need you. I need you badly. And I 
                        know I lied about papa, but I 
                        didn’t lie about something else... 
                        you ARE a superhero. That was REAL. 
                        You are my hero. You are all 
                        strength and I’m weak. I need you 
                        buddy. I need you.” 

           Oscar wipes a few tears from his eyes. Gives Benjy a kiss on 
           the head. 

           He looks OUT THE WINDOW-

           We see the WATER TOWER peaking out over the trees.

           Oscar is mesmerized. He exits the ROOM-- 

                                                               SLAM TO:

           EXT. WATER TOWER - DUSK

           Oscar stands at the base of the WATER TOWER. Cranes his neck. 
           He takes a SWIG from a BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS. Then climbs, 
           rung after rung while he hums the song, LOLA, to himself.
           He throws open the HATCH that leads to a BALCONY. Stands 
           looking out over Los Angeles. The SUNSET is breathtaking.

           Oscar is tormented. Wild eyed. 

           He holds onto the rail, and steps up OVER THE EDGE. 

           He takes another long gulp. Raises the BOTTLE UP IN THE AIR--

                                 OSCAR
                        Cheers God!

           He peaks over the edge-- woh! He’s too drunk to realize how 
           dangerous this is.

           THE BOTTLE drops, and SMASHES!

           SFX PRE-LAP: SIRENS RING OUT...

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - SAME

           THE WALKIE TALKIE chirps to life on the HOSPITAL TABLE--

                                 DISPATCH 
                        We’ve got a potential 10-56A on the 
                        Water Tower. Repeat 10-56A. 
                        Hispanic Male in his 20’s. Looks 
                        like he’s going to jump. Calling 
                        all available cars. 

           Benjy WAKES. This is a call to action. 

           He looks over at his mom, still asleep in her chair. He 
           shoots out of bed. Sandra stirs, and then falls back asleep 
           as Benjy exits.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           EXT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT

           Oscar sees a LINE OF POLICE CARS in the distance.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. HALLWAY, CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - DAY

           Benjy tiptoes down the hallway. The RECEPTIONIST is awake, 
           guarding his only exit. 
                                 BENJY (V.O.)
                        I know they said I didn’t have 
                        powers... but then I realize-- 
                        there’s always that point in the 
                        story where the superhero is 
                        tested, and don’t think they have 
                        what it takes... I knew it was a 
                        test. My test. And I have to pass.

                                 BENJY
                             (to himself)
                        Invisibility on.

           This time Benjy actually goes INVISIBLE. 

           The Receptionist is surprised when the electronic door opens, 
           as if by magic--

           INT. STREET, DAY

           Benjy RE-APPEARS. He eyes the Water Tower over the trees.

                                 BENJY
                             (to himself)
                        Super speed on.

           Benjy engages his SUPER SPEED -- the background becomes a 
           blur as he kicks up dust and arrives--

           EXT. WATER TOWER - DAY

           -- at the base of the Water Tower. He hides behind a BUSH as 
           he sees TWO SQUAD CARS. One is Officer Firestone’s, who looks 
           deeply concerned. 

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE 
                             (to another Officer)
                        I know Oscar-- he’s not going to do 
                        it, he’s just being an idiot. Let’s 
                        give him some space. Okay. Don’t 
                        startle him. I’m going to get my 
                        daughter here...

           Officer Firestone is distracted calling Lola.

           Benjy looks up at his brother -- leaning precariously over 
           the edge. Benjy ambles over to the Water Tower. 

                                 BENJY
                             (to himself)
                        Super climbing on.
           He SUPER-CLIMBS the rungs of the ladder that lead up the 
           water-tower.

           One of the other OFFICERS notices--

                                 OFFICER
                        We’ve got another one.

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        Shit. 

           EXT. BALCONY, WATER TOWER - DAY

           Oscar hears a knock at the HATCH, gets confused.

           EXT. WATER TOWER - DAY

           Underneath the BALCONY.

                                 BENJY
                             (to himself)
                        Superstrength on.

           Benjy RIPS the hatch off like it’s made of PAPER MACHE. 

           EXT. BALCONY, WATER TOWER - DAY

           Oscar’s eyes go wide as Benjy steps out on the balcony.

                                 OSCAR
                        Benjy!?

                                 BENJY
                        Oscar I’m sorry I was mean to you. 
                        I know it was just a test.

                                 OSCAR
                        But-- but-- how’d you get here?

                                 BENJY
                        I’m a Superhero dummy.

           Oscar can’t control the tears that fall.

                                 BENJY (CONT’D)
                        Why are you so sad?

                                 OSCAR
                        Because you’re sick.
                                 BENJY
                        I’m going to be okay Oscar. I got 
                        the infinity ring. Death isn’t 
                        going to beat me...
                             (beat, dramatic)
                        I’m Captain Infinity. Come fly with 
                        me.

                                 OSCAR
                        ... You can’t fly. Rule number 3.

                                 BENJY
                        I can do anything if I want to. You 
                        told me that.

                                 OSCAR
                        You can’t fly.

                                 BENJY
                        Yes I can. Come...

           Benjy takes Oscar’s hand.

                                 BENJY (CONT’D)
                        You have to have faith.

           They both stand out on the EDGE...

           EXT. WATER TOWER - DAY

           Down below Officer Firestone is freaking out.

                                 OFFICER FIRESTONE
                        Woh woh woh! Don’t you dare do it! 
                        I’m warning you both, I will kill 
                        you if you do something stupid like 
                        jumping!!!

           LOLA’S VW BEATLE PULLS UP--

           She gets out rushes to her father’s SIDE.

           EXT. BALCONY, WATER TOWER - DAY

                                 BENJY
                             (to Oscar)
                        Ready?

           Oscar isn’t sure.

                                 BENJY (CONT’D)
                        1, 2... 3
           They both take a LEAP OF FAITH...

           And FLOAT ON AIR...

           Oscar opens his eyes-- he can’t believe it.

           They are FLOATING ON AIR--

           They test out their powers swimming around like it’s water.

           Then, Oscar and Benjy ROCKET INTO THE SKY--

           JETTING PAST CLOUDS--

           UP INTO THE UPPER STRATOSPHERE--

           THEY FLY ALONGSIDE A COMMERCIAL AIRLINER--

           A YOUNG PASSENGER in the WINDOW points to them, and looks out 
           in awe.  

           They STAND ON TOP OF THE PLANE IN MOTION--

                                 OSCAR
                             (yelling over the NOISE)
                        THIS IS MY FIRST TIME ON A PLANE! 

           They laugh and have more fun flying around--

           -- and then Benjy takes Oscar’s HAND and guides him THROUGH 
           THE CLOUDS--

           They float gently to the ground...

           Officer Firestone and the Deputy can’t believe it. Their jaws 
           drop.

           Neither can Oscar. He looks at Benjy. 

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        <<You are a miracle>>

           Oscar sees Lola. He rushes to her--

           They embrace and kiss SILHOUETTED by the MOONLIGHT...

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. MAKE A WISH - OFFICES - SEVERAL MONTHS LATER

                                 BENJY 
                        And that’s exactly how it happened. 
                        Right Mami?
           WE PULL BACK from a prominent SCAR on Benjy’s head that is 
           several months old, and notice that Benjy looks healthier 
           than we saw him last. The surgery was a success.

           Benjy finishes telling his story to a room full of MAKE-A-
           WISH EXECUTIVES, and there’s not a dry eye in the house, 
           including Sandra. Sandra nods and wipes a tear from her eye.

                                 SANDRA
                        That’s right hijo. 

           We notice POSTERS on the WALLS of wishes that have been 
           granted. Smiling MAKE-WISH-KIDS meeting ATHLETES, throwing 
           PARTIES...

                                 BENJY
                        So that’s why I don’t need anything 
                        for my make-a-wish. It already came 
                        true cause of my brother Oscar. I 
                        became a Superhero. So I wanna give 
                        him what he’s always wanted... I 
                        want him to get to go to music 
                        school, and travel the world. Can 
                        you do that? 

           Beat.

                                 VOICE OFF-SCREEN
                        We can make that happen.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           EXT. FRONT-YARD, RUIZ HOME - DAY

           Their CAR is filled to the brim with COLLEGE MOVING BOXES. 
           Sandra slams the TRUNK SHUT. We may notice an NYU sticker on 
           the BACK WINDOW.

                                 SANDRA
                        <<We need to hit the rode, or we’re 
                        going to be late! This is a seven 
                        day rode trip. Let’s not make it 
                        fifteen.>>

                                 OSCAR
                        Give me a second, Mami. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I love you hijo, but hurry up.

           This time Oscar stops and kisses his mom on the FOREHEAD.
                                 OSCAR
                        Love you too.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           CLOSE ON A DIMPLED, GAP-TOOTHED GRIN --

           WIDEN TO REVEAL Benjy is decked out in his Captain Infinity 
           suit, and--

           WIDEN EVEN FURTHER TO REVEAL Oscar stands on the edge of the 
           roof too, decked out in his own Superhero suit.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        We’re just going to go for a quick 
                        spin.

           They both bend their knees, and LAUNCH INTO THE AIR, as we--

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                         THE END
