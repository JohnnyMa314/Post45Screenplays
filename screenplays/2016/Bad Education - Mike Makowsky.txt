           INT. EAST HILLS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT

           We open on a long hallway cast in a sickly fluorescent glow. 
           It’s after hours at East Hills Elementary.

           The walls are adorned with a litany of children’s art 
           projects. Crude renderings of family portraits, dream pets, 
           at least one trip to the moon.

           The silence shatters as a monolithic heavy-duty buffing 
           machine crawls into view, its twin brushes whirring and 
           grinding against the blue tile floor.

           The contraption, powered by a faceless night janitor, emits a 
           withering cacophony of howls and squeals and hisses with each 
           forward movement. An ancient beast in the throes of death.

           The janitor pushes on down the hall, a pair of headphones 
           blocking the unseemly noise from his ears.

           He drifts past a bathroom door marked BOYS. A crack of light 
           pours from the base of its wooden frame. It’s OCCUPIED.

           INT. BOYS’ BATHROOM - EAST HILLS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT

           FRANK TASSONE, early 50s, stands at the kiddie sink in a 
           tight undershirt and tailored dress slacks.

           He crouches to examine himself in the mirror. Sucks in his 
           considerable paunch. Combs back his hair. Inspects the dark 
           circles under the eyes.

           He unclasps his briefcase. Fetches a small grooming kit. 

           He hums a tune as he dabs his face with cover-up. Tweezes a 
           rogue hair from his nose. Spritzes himself with cologne.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - EAST HILLS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT

           WILLIAM ‘BIG BILL’ BLAUSTEIN, 50s, school board president, 
           commands the podium. He addresses a seated assembly of 
           parents and taxpayers.

                                 BIG BILL
                        That’s just a taste of the kinds of 
                        acceptances we saw for last year’s 
                        outgoing senior class. Pretty 
                        remarkable stuff, huh?
           Bill fishes a newspaper from the podium’s bottom shelf.

                                 BIG BILL (CONT’D)
                        Now let’s talk about why we’re here 
                        tonight. This morning’s Wall Street 
                        Journal, hot off the presses.

           He waves the paper up high.

                                 BIG BILL (CONT’D)
                        Roslyn Public Schools ranked fourth 
                        in the nation, based on SAT scores 
                        and percentage of students that get 
                        into their first-choice colleges.

           He smirks.

                                 BIG BILL (CONT’D)
                        Folks, there’s no simpler way for 
                        me to put it. Our kids are getting 
                        smarter. That’s why Roslyn’s number 
                        four in the country, and number one 
                        in Long Island overall. Thanks for 
                        playing, Jericho! Sorry, Syosset!

           The crowd eats this up.

           INT. EAST HILLS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT

           Frank’s black patent leather shoes squeak against the newly 
           buffed floor. He’s now donned in a full suit.

                                 BIG BILL (V.O.)
                        I’d like to bring out the man 
                        behind the curtain. In his twelve 
                        years at Roslyn, he’s reformed our 
                        education system from pre-K all the 
                        way on up through the high school.

           Frank pauses to admire the vibrant, imaginative children’s 
           artwork that papers the walls. The product of first graders.

           He runs a hand along the swirling contours of the crayon 
           drawings. Grinding the waxy resin between his fingers.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - EAST HILLS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT

                                 BIG BILL
                        Please join me in welcoming our 
                        district superintendent, and my 
                        personal friend, Frank Tassone.
           Frank takes the stage to resounding applause.

           He gives the room a hearty wave, smiling broadly. His fingers 
           coated with a layer of crayon residue.

                                 FRANK
                        Thank you, Roslyn. This would’ve 
                        never been possible without your 
                        tireless support.

                                 CROWD
                        Number four! Number four! Number 
                        four! Number four--!

           PRE-LAP: Beep. Beep. Beep.

           INT. GYM - NIGHT

           Frank paces on a treadmill, breathing heavily. A personal 
           trainer stands beside him, monitoring his heart rate.

           The gym is otherwise empty.

           INT. FRANK’S CAR - NIGHT

           Frank emerges from the Lincoln Tunnel, coasting past the toll 
           booths and into Long Island. He drives a black Mercedes.

           It’s the crack of dawn. The early morning sun just barely 
           inching out from over the treetops.

           EXT. ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Frank’s car sails past the fleet of school buses as they pull 
           into the roundabout, teeming with students.

           The chyron below reads:

                                    ROSLYN HEIGHTS, NY
                                      SEPTEMBER 2002

           INT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Frank strides into the building. The bullpen is swarmed with 
           balloons and gift baskets bearing the number “4.”

                                 FRANK
                        All right everyone, let’s keep the 
                        momentum up. The next budget vote’s 
                        only nine months away, people!
           His personal secretary, MARY ANN, flanks him as he walks 
           through the office. She carries a small note pad with her.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Hi Mary Ann. Do we know if Mr. 
                        Hale’s wife gave birth last night?

                                 MARY ANN
                        Twins. Boy and a girl.

                                 FRANK
                        Perfect. Let’s fire off a card to 
                        their home address, and maybe one 
                        of those edible arrangements.

                                 MARY ANN
                        You still haven’t sent over the 
                        discussion questions for Dickens. 
                        They’re meeting at six today.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s right. Which book are we 
                        reading this month?

           Mary Ann glances down at the note pad.

                                 MARY ANN
                        “Martin Chizzlewick”?

                                 FRANK
                        It’s Chuzzlewit. Okay, let’s see. 
                        Question one, how does the novel’s 
                        picaresque approach extend to each 
                        of its characters?

           Mary Ann scribbles furiously.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Two, to what extent do we identify 
                        with the motives of Pecksniff? Do 
                        his actions strike us as uniformly 
                        appalling, or might we-- excuse me 
                        just a sec, Mary Ann.

           He stops at the cubicle belonging to PAM GLUCKIN, 50s, the 
           district’s business manager. Her desk is mobbed with photos 
           of her family and myriad pet dogs.

                                 PAM
                        Good morning, Dr. Tassone.

                                 FRANK
                        Mrs. Cremona.
                                 PAM
                        It’s Gluckin now. Third time’s the 
                        charm, or so they say.

           She motions to her brass nameplate. The surname portion has 
           recently fallen victim to a sloppy case of Wite-Out.

                                 FRANK
                        You know we can get that replaced.

                                 PAM
                        But it’s much funnier like this, 
                        isn’t it?

           Frank smirks.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Any receipts for me to reconcile?

           He pats down his pockets.

                                 FRANK
                        Looks like I’m clean out. I’ll let 
                        you know if anything surfaces.

                                 PAM
                        Good boy.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Happy Friday, Dr. Tassone!

           DEBBIE RIGANO, 30s, a new hire, stands at her adjacent 
           cubicle in a gaudy leopard-print blouse. Smiling clumsily. 
           Lipstick smeared across her two front teeth.

                                 PAM
                        Deb, sweetie?

           Pam taps on her own teeth. Debbie blanches.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Shit. Shit!

           She retreats back into her cubicle.

                                 MARY ANN
                             (to Frank)
                        Did you say picturesque--?

                                 FRANK
                        Picaresque. Mary Ann, is there any 
                        way you could pick up a smoothie 
                        from Holiday Farms? I was running 
                        late this morning.
                                 MARY ANN
                        Yeah. What do you want in it?

                                 FRANK
                        Oh, I don’t know. Some blueberries, 
                        almond milk, shredded coconut, flax 
                        seeds-- maybe just say it’s for Dr. 
                        Tassone. They know what I like.

           Frank whips out his wallet. It’s stacked to the brim with 
           credit and debit cards of every color.

           He plucks one in specific, a GOLD CORPORATE CARD, and hands 
           it to Mary Ann. Pam watches from her workstation.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Okay. Before I go, there’s a mother 
                        camped out in the conference room. 
                        I told her we need the space for 
                        your 8:30 but she says she won’t 
                        leave until she speaks with you.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh boy. Who is it this time?

                                 MARY ANN
                        Cindy Schweitzer.

                                 PAM
                        I’ll get the plunger.

                                 FRANK
                        Be nice, Pam. It’s committed 
                        parents like Cindy Schweitzer that 
                        keep the lights on around here.
                             (a pause)
                        On second thought -- if I’m not 
                        back in an hour, call 911.

           He disappears into the conference room.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           CINDY SCHWEITZER, 40s, paces the room with a frenetic energy. 
           Frank tracks her from a spot in the corner.

                                 CINDY
                        I’m telling you, I’m so upset I 
                        could throttle someone. That awful 
                        Ziporkin. She’s intimidated by him, 
                        that’s what this is. She misspells 
                        words and he calls her out on it. 
                        Believe me, this is political.
                                 FRANK
                        I hear where you’re coming from, 
                        but Barbara Ziporkin is more than 
                        qualified to teach the third grade. 
                        I hired her myself, straight out of 
                        Columbia Teacher’s-- my alma mater--

                                 CINDY
                        She’s horrendous. Chad’s place is 
                        in OMNI with the other gifted kids.

           Frank serves up one steaming pile of “the usual”:

                                 FRANK
                        Yes. But a child’s placement in our 
                        accelerated program isn’t solely 
                        based on teacher recs. It’s also 
                        standardized testing scores--

                                 CINDY
                        She wouldn’t give him a bathroom 
                        break during the test. He has a 
                        hyperactive bladder. I have a 
                        doctor’s note in my purse.

           Cindy reaches into her handbag, starts fishing.

                                 CINDY (CONT’D)
                        It’s in here, just a second--

                                 FRANK
                        Miss Schweitzer...

           She stops, looks up at him.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Miss Schweitzer, has Chad mastered 
                        his time tables?

                                 CINDY
                             (reluctant)
                        Of course he has.

                                 FRANK
                        Cindy.

           He doesn’t break his gaze. She softens.

                                 CINDY
                        I’m afraid, Dr. Tassone. If he’s 
                        not in OMNI-- if he starts seeing 
                        himself as subpar-- he’s such a 
                        remarkable boy, Dr. Tassone, I know 
                        if you’ll just meet with him--
                                 FRANK
                        If he’s your son, I’m sure he’s 
                        very remarkable indeed.

           Cindy smiles faintly.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I’ll talk with Barbara, see if we 
                        can’t schedule a make-up test for 
                        Chad. In the meantime, here’s some 
                        literature on how you can foster 
                        your child’s sense of self-worth.

           He hands her a pamphlet from a nearby shelf. She gives it a 
           cursory glance, pauses at the byline.

                                 CINDY
                        You wrote this?

                                 FRANK
                        It’s a bit of a spare hobby.

                                 CINDY
                        We could all learn a little 
                        something from you, Dr. Tassone.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh, I find I’m the one who’s 
                        constantly learning. This community 
                        never ceases to surprise me.

           INT. FRANK’S OFFICE - CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Frank takes a seat behind his polished wood desk.

           The back wall is coated with advanced degrees, commendations, 
           photographs of Frank posing with state politicians, sports 
           figures, Geraldo Rivera. Souvenirs from various exotic trips.

           He gazes at the lone framed photo on his desk. It’s a ‘60s or 
           maybe ‘70s era bridal portrait of a very pretty young woman.

           The photo exudes an uncanny stock-photo quality, as if it 
           once served in a print ad for the perfect nuptials.

           Frank twists the wedding ring on his finger, deep in thought.

           He procures his copy of the prior day’s Wall Street Journal. 
           Locates the public school rankings. Roslyn listed fourth.

           He stares down at the paper, a measure of dissatisfaction on 
           his face. His pen hovering over the preceding three schools, 
           making small circles in the air.
           Frank brings the pen down over the number one spot. Lets it 
           linger there. Watches the ink BLEED THROUGH the PAGES...

                                 RACHEL (O.S.)
                        Hi.

           Frank looks up to see RACHEL KELLOGG, 16, standing in the 
           doorway. A bulging blue backpack slung over her shoulder.

                                 FRANK
                        Hello.

                                 RACHEL
                        Sorry. I’m Rachel Kellogg, with the 
                        Hilltop Beacon. I scheduled an 
                        interview with Mary Ann...?

                                 FRANK
                        Mary Ann’s out on an errand. That’s 
                        fine, I have an open door policy 
                        when it comes to students.

           He gestures for Rachel to enter. She sits across from him.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        What’s on your mind, Rachel?

                                 RACHEL
                        Right. Sorry. I have a list of 
                        questions prepared...

           Rachel shuffles through her notes. Frank watches.

                                 FRANK
                        Any relation to Jeremy Kellogg?

                                 RACHEL
                        He’s my brother.

                                 FRANK
                        You know, I taught Jeremy how to 
                        cross the street. He must have been 
                        seven, eight years old. Didn’t look 
                        where he was going, strolled right 
                        out in front of the bus. He nearly 
                        put the driver in cardiac arrest.

           He laughs to himself.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        How’s Jeremy these days? Is he 
                        keeping himself out of trouble?
                                 RACHEL
                        He’s a junior at Northwestern.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s fantastic. Good for Jeremy. 
                        Do you remember who he interviewed 
                        with there? Was it Mulvihill, or--?

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m not sure.

                                 FRANK
                        Please give him my best. And your 
                        father... he’s big into finance, 
                        right? Works on Wall Street?

                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah.

                                 FRANK
                        I’ve never had much of a head for 
                        numbers. English was always my 
                        favorite subject in school. I guess 
                        that’s why I’m here as opposed to 
                        there... Wall Street, I mean.

                                 RACHEL
                        Okay. I’d like to ask you about the 
                        building renovations outlined in 
                        last May’s budget plan.

           Frank leans back in his chair.

                                 FRANK
                        Fire away.

                                 RACHEL
                        Do you mind if I record this?

           Rachel sets a bulky recording device on the desk. Frank gives 
           it a double-take, smiles.

                                 FRANK
                        Go right ahead.

           Rachel clicks the RECORD button. The tape begins to roll.

                                 RACHEL
                        So there’s a new wing being added 
                        at the middle school.

                                 FRANK
                        We’re expanding to meet the needs 
                        of a growing student population. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                        More families are choosing Roslyn 
                        than ever before.

                                 RACHEL
                        And the SkyWalk at the high school? 
                        The second-story bridge that’ll 
                        connect the Social Studies and 
                        Science wings...?

                                 FRANK
                        Yes. That’s the result of my talks 
                        with students who claimed it was 
                        exceedingly difficult to get across 
                        the building in four minutes flat.

           Rachel checks her notes.

                                 RACHEL
                        The SkyWalk construction is 
                        projected to cost north of seven 
                        and a half million dollars.

                                 FRANK
                        I’d need to have the budget in 
                        front of me, but yeah, that seems 
                        more or less accurate.

                                 RACHEL
                        Why not just give the students five 
                        minutes in between classes instead 
                        of four?

           Frank’s smile fades.

                                 FRANK
                        You don’t like the SkyWalk?

                                 RACHEL
                        It’s not that I don’t like it--

                                 FRANK
                        The poll conducted in last June’s 
                        Beacon showed a 100% approval 
                        rating among students...

           He digs out a copy of The Hilltop Beacon, Roslyn’s student 
           newspaper, from his desk drawer. It’s marked in Post-Its.

                                 RACHEL
                        No, it’s-- I guess I’m just not 
                        sure why we need a seven and a half 
                        million dollar SkyWalk when our 
                        classrooms are still leaking.
                                 FRANK
                        Leaking?

                                 RACHEL
                        Like, with water.

                                 FRANK
                        Right. The leaks were unfortunate, 
                        but we are handling them--

                                 RACHEL
                        But it just seems like you’re--

                                 FRANK
                        You asked me a question. Am I 
                        allowed to answer it?

           Rachel tenses.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. The leakages are a 
                        rather unfortunate by-product of 
                        the building’s age. But we have a 
                        repairs team that deals with all 
                        that. You should talk to Jack 
                        Lombardo, our grounds supervisor.

                                 RACHEL
                        It just seems like administration 
                        is more concerned with cosmetics 
                        than doing actual maintenance.

           An awkward beat hangs in the air. Frank stares back at her, 
           unsure of how to respond. He looks hurt.

                                 FRANK
                        I-- I’m not--

           There’s a knock on the door.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Sorry, Dr. Tassone. I have your 
                        smoothie here.

           Mary Ann crosses past Rachel, sets the smoothie on Frank’s 
           desk. It’s an unappetizing dark brown color.

                                 MARY ANN (CONT’D)
                        They were all out of flax seeds.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s okay. Thank you, Mary Ann.
                                 MARY ANN
                        Also, your 8:30’s waiting for you 
                        in the conference room.

           Frank checks his watch. He looks to Rachel.

                                 FRANK
                        Would it be all right with you if 
                        we continued this another time?

                                 RACHEL
                        Sure.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m sorry for the interruption. Do 
                        you need a pass for next period? 
                        Mary Ann can write you a note.

                                 RACHEL
                        I’ll make it in time. Thank you.

           He stands, offers a hand to Rachel. She accepts it.

                                 FRANK
                        Thanks for your feedback, Rachel. 
                        But I really do think you’ll like 
                        the SkyWalk once it’s finished.

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m sure I will.

           EXT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Rachel exits the building. She descends the hill to the high 
           school campus, where the SkyWalk construction is underway.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Frank sits at the head of the table, flanked on either side 
           by local real estate agents.

                                 FIRST AGENT (JOYCE)
                        The demand is insane. Skyrocketing. 
                        We’re seeing homes go for over a 
                        million in Roslyn Heights.

                                 SECOND AGENT (SHAWN)
                        You don’t get those kinds of 
                        numbers in Syosset or Jericho.
                                 FRANK
                        But those towns are also further 
                        from the city, a longer commute...

                                 THIRD AGENT (IRENE)
                        Not Manhasset. Not Great Neck.

                        It’s the public schools. The better 
                        the school, the higher the price 
                        tag. Simple as that.

                                 SECOND AGENT (SHAWN)
                        I’ve got buyers calling me off the 
                        hook about Roslyn. Whatever you’re 
                        doing here, it’s working.

                                 FIRST AGENT (JOYCE)
                        We owe you a steak dinner, Dr. 
                        Tassone. You’re making our jobs 
                        very easy right now.

           Frank takes a long sip from his smoothie.

                                 FRANK
                        Just out of pure curiosity, how 
                        much can you make a year as a real 
                        estate professional?

           The agents exchange a series of looks.

           EXT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Frank and Pam eat lunch at a secluded picnic table. Frank 
           shakes his head, stabbing his straw into the smoothie.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s not right.

                                 PAM
                        I know.

                                 FRANK
                        We have the most important job in 
                        the world. We sculpt the minds of 
                        children. But nobody wants to be a 
                        teacher, ‘cause the money’s shit.

           He stares off into the distance.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Are we the schmucks?
                                 PAM
                        Don’t talk like that. Do you even 
                        realize the impact you’ve had on so 
                        many kids’ lives over the years?

                                 FRANK
                        They never come back afterwards.

                                 PAM
                        Doesn’t matter. All that matters is 
                        that you sent them off right.

           Frank looks to her.

                                 FRANK
                        How come every time there’s a screw 
                        loose in my head, you’re standing 
                        right there with a toolkit?

                                 PAM
                        Please. You can save your mixed 
                        metaphors--

                                 FRANK
                        I’m serious. They put my name in 
                        all the papers, but you’re the one 
                        that keeps this place afloat.

           Pam cracks a smile.

                                 PAM
                        It might be nice to have my name in 
                        the papers every once in a while.

                                 FRANK
                        Trust me, it’s not worth the 
                        aggravation.

           Frank takes one last draw from his smoothie. He grimaces.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        This diet’s killing me.

           Pam offers up her pastrami sandwich.

                                 PAM
                        I won’t tell anyone.

           Frank leans in, takes a bite. They both laugh.
           INT. CAFETERIA - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Rachel eats her lunch alone at a corner table, playing back 
           the interview through a pair of headphones. She transcribes 
           quickly, her hands splattered in blue ink.

           Out of the corner of her eye, she spots JACK LOMBARDO, 50s, 
           the grounds supervisor. Heavyset. Cheap suit.

           She packs her bag quickly. Rushes up to him.

                                 RACHEL
                        Mr. Lombardo, I was hoping you’d 
                        grant me an interview--

                                 LOMBARDO
                        Here’s something for you to print. 
                        It’s a haiku. Seventy, sunny. Birds 
                        are chirpin’, grass is greenin’. 
                        Grounds ain’t never looked better.

                                 RACHEL
                        That’s too many syllables.

                                 LOMBARDO
                        You don’t have very many friends, 
                        do you, Rachel?

           He waves her off.

           Rachel follows him, discreetly.

           INT. LIBRARY - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Lombardo argues with MRS. DWYER, the school librarian, deep 
           in the stacks. Rachel spies on them from the adjacent row, 
           between two encyclopedia volumes.

                                 MRS. DWYER
                        I sat there and watched them do the 
                        repairs myself, and they’re using 
                        the same rinky-dink materials--

                                 LOMBARDO
                        This is a library. You might want 
                        to watch your decibel level.

                                 MRS. DWYER
                        Can you please explain to me why 
                        every time there’s a light drizzle 
                        outside, the sky falls down?
           She reaches a hand out in Rachel’s direction. Rachel quickly 
           DUCKS... The librarian grabs one of the books in her vantage.

                                 MRS. DWYER (CONT’D)
                        Look at this water damage. See 
                        those smudges? I’ve had to throw 
                        away entire catalogues of books.

                                 LOMBARDO
                        It’s not grounds’ fault your books 
                        are shit quality.

                                 MRS. DWYER
                        My books-- my books are not--!

                                 LOMBARDO
                        Calm down, Chicken Little. The 
                        sky’s not going anywhere.

           He wanders out. Mrs. Dwyer lingers behind, exasperated.

           Rachel talks through the stacks, still masked from view.

                                 RACHEL
                        Mrs. Dwyer? I don’t think your 
                        books are shit quality.

                                 MRS. DWYER
                        Thanks, Rachel. But you really 
                        shouldn’t spy on people.

           INT. BEACON OFFICE - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Student editors crowd the tiny basement space, tinkering with 
           rudimentary layout and clip art on bulky desktop computers.

           NIK AGGARWAL, 17, junior editor, reviews Rachel’s article. 
           Jaded beyond his years. His feet propped up on the desk.

                                 NIK
                        You were just supposed to ask him 
                        about his favorite hobbies. What’s 
                        all this crap about the budget?

                                 RACHEL
                        I found a story.

           Nik slides the article back her way.

                                 NIK
                        You know we have to submit every 
                        issue to the principal before we go 
                        to print, right? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NIK (CONT'D)
                        He kicks it up to Tassone, and Pam 
                        Cremona, or Gluckin or whatever...

                                 RACHEL
                        They can’t censor us.

                                 NIK
                        It’s not censoring. It’s symbiosis. 
                        The school pays for us to exist, so 
                        we repay them by not writing crap 
                        that makes them look bad.

                                 RACHEL
                        What about journalistic autonomy?

                                 NIK
                        There is no autonomy. We’re a high 
                        school paper, one of five bajillion 
                        extracurriculars Roslyn offers. We 
                        come here every day to socialize in 
                        a controlled group setting and then 
                        tack it on to our college resumés. 
                        It’s a beautiful thing, really.

           Rachel glowers at him.

                                 NIK (CONT’D)
                        Listen. I know you want there to be 
                        some big conspiracy. But these are 
                        just a bunch of boring old people 
                        doing their jobs. Nobody cares.

                                 RACHEL
                        I care.

                                 NIK
                        I know. That’s what makes you so 
                        special. Now get me something on 
                        homecoming before five.

           He gets up, pats her on the back.

                                 NIK (CONT’D)
                        We’re all counting on you, Kellogg.

           INT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           The office staff clears out for the evening.

           Pam remains at her desk. She watches her colleagues depart. 
           Her fingers trembling in anticipation.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - SHARON’S HOUSE - DAY

           Frank leads a salon gathering over traditional tea and 
           scones. He presides over a cadre of Roslyn mothers, talking 
           excitedly amongst themselves.

           A neat stack of Dickens discussion worksheets rests on the 
           coffee table, virtually untouched.

           Frank clears his throat. The chatter dies down.

                                 FRANK
                        So, what did we all think of Martin 
                        Chuzzlewit?

           The women glance nervously at one another.

           Frank picks up on their collective unease. He soldiers on.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        One of Dickens’ very best works. 
                        The book is notable, in particular, 
                        for its picaresque qualities...

           He’s greeted with an instant chorus of assents, emphatic 
           assents, and one or two remarks on the vivid imagery.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Why don’t we start by 
                        discussing Seth Pecksniff?

           Crickets.

           INT. KITCHEN - SHARON’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Frank empties a plate of half-eaten scones into the trash. 

           The salon’s host, SHARON FARKAS, 40s, washes the dishes 
           beside him. The other women have cleared out for the evening.

                                 SHARON
                        You can’t feel bad about it. If 
                        these women can’t appreciate the 
                        culture Dickens has to offer, 
                        that’s their problem.

                                 FRANK
                        Did I get through to anyone?

                                 SHARON
                        Sure. You have a real passion for 
                        the material. That shows.
           She sets down her last dish. Turns to Frank.

                                 SHARON (CONT’D)
                        Can I ask you a personal question? 
                        It’s just-- so it’s been sixteen 
                        months and change since Peter left, 
                        and my kids seem to be coping with 
                        it much better...

                                 FRANK
                        I’m glad our Banana Splits program 
                        is working out for them.

                                 SHARON
                        Right.

           She takes a beat.

                                 SHARON (CONT’D)
                        But I guess what I’m trying to say 
                        is-- y’know what, never mind. I’m 
                        an idiot for even thinking...

                                 FRANK
                        You can talk to me, Sharon.

           Sharon meets his gaze. Her lower lip quivers.

           She leans in. Frank recoils.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I-- I’m sorry.

                                 SHARON
                        No, it’s not... I’m such a...

           She inhales sharply, suppressing tears.

                                 FRANK
                        Stop that. You’re a strong woman 
                        who just wants the best for her 
                        kids. There’s no shame in that.

           He draws his wedding ring into view.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I don’t talk about Joanne often.

           Sharon nods, her eyes drying.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        It’s been almost thirty years now, 
                        but the pain-- well, the pain’s 
                        still very real.
                                 SHARON
                        I can only imagine.

                                 FRANK
                        You have to find other outlets to 
                        get through the day. My work keeps 
                        me fulfilled. The students, and 
                        doing the best I can by them. I 
                        guess it’s my way of honoring her.

                                 SHARON
                        You don’t ever think about, y’know, 
                        about trying to move on...?

                                 FRANK
                        No, I don’t. Not when the only 
                        thing between us and that number 
                        one spot is a six to seven percent 
                        increase in our annual budget.

                                 SHARON
                        Fourth place is still pretty good.

                                 FRANK
                        I like the sound of first better.

           Sharon places a hand on his shoulder.

                                 SHARON
                        The kids are lucky to have you.

                                 FRANK
                        Thanks, Sharon.

           INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

           Rachel peruses the frozen foods section. She dumps a pile of 
           microwaveable pizzas into her shopping cart.

           She checks out the items. Pays with her own cash.

           INT. KITCHEN - RACHEL’S HOUSE - DAY

           Rachel and her father DAVID, 40s, feast on the pizzas at the 
           cluttered kitchen counter.

           David sports a few days’ stubble. He has a drink with dinner.

                                 DAVID
                        How was your interview? Did you ask 
                        if they needed any help over there?
                                 RACHEL
                        It didn’t come up.

                                 DAVID
                        What do you mean?

                                 RACHEL
                        It just never came up.

                                 DAVID
                        Rachel...

                                 RACHEL
                        You’re over-qualified.

           David massages his forehead.

                                 DAVID
                        I’ve gotta get out of this house.

           He clears both their plates.

           Rachel sees a pile of bills on the counter. She tears open an 
           envelope from Roslyn Public Schools.

           A notice of outstanding school tax payments. Bold lettering, 
           underlined, italicized. Fifteen thousand dollars.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        They’re pushing for eighty-two 
                        million next year. Education’s the 
                        biggest industry in town.

           He drops the dishes in the sink.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I’ll call tomorrow, see if they 
                        have any openings.

           INT. FRANK’S CAR - NIGHT

           Frank sits in traffic on the Long Island Expressway, making 
           the tedious crawl back to the city.

           He stares straight ahead, gripping the wheel tight.

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

           Frank pulls the Mercedes into its designated space. The 
           taillights slowly fade.

           He sits in silence for a moment.
           EXT. FRANK’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           Frank enters the lobby of an apartment complex. He waves to 
           the doorman, who triggers the elevator.

           INT. ELEVATOR - FRANK’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           Frank stands alone in the elevator, facing forward. He 
           removes his wedding ring. Buries it deep in his pocket.

           INT. FRANK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Frank unlocks the door to his apartment. He sees a pot roast 
           on the dining table. Two place settings.

                                 FRANK
                        Hello?

           His voice echoes through the empty space.

           Suddenly, we catch a glimpse of a MAN, 50s, as he CREEPS UP 
           on Frank FROM BEHIND... CLOSING IN... and PRESSES a FINGER 
           into the BACK of HIS TEMPLE.

                                 MAN
                             (voice distorted)
                        Gimme your wallet, prick. I’m not 
                        fucking around.

           Frank doesn’t react. The man sulks.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        I can’t scare you.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s that new cologne. The Kenneth 
                        Cole. It’s a dead giveaway.

           The man gets out in front of Frank. He’s baby-faced, with a 
           relaxed posture. We’ll come to know him as STEVE.

           He sizes Frank up and down.

                                 STEVE
                        You look nice.

           He grabs Frank by the lapels. Kisses him.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        I picked up your dry cleaning.
                                 FRANK
                        Thanks. I’ll reimburse you.

                                 STEVE
                        What’s wrong?

                                 FRANK
                        Nothing. I’m just tired.

           He gives Steve a peck on the cheek.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Let’s eat.

           INT. BEDROOM - FRANK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Frank sits up in bed, reading a book.

           He gazes across the room, where the bathroom door hangs 
           slightly ajar. Steve’s taking a shower, singing to himself.

           Frank purses his lips. He returns to his reading.

           INT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - NIGHT

           The lights have been shut off for the night, save for the 
           halogen lamp at Pam’s desk.

           Pam pulls up a spreadsheet on her computer. An exhaustive 
           line-item list of district expenses, typed in minuscule font.

           She extracts a handful of receipts from her desk drawer. Each 
           of them charged to P. GLUCKIN.

           Pam inputs their contents into the spreadsheet:

                       THE SHARPER IMAGE ROOSEVELT FIELD -- $472.22
                            FORTUNOFF OLD COUNTRY RD -- $287.53
                             ROSA MEXICANO BELLMORE -- $96.52
                             LESLIE’S POOL SUPPLIES -- $124.98
                              SHELL GAS MERRICK RD -- $38.22

           She gazes at the expenses. Takes a sip from her coffee mug.

           Her finger hits the backspace key. Stays there.

           The cursor races leftward, wiping out the SHARPER IMAGE text 
           in one fell swoop.

           She thinks.

           The cursor blinks idly on the screen.
           She brings her finger down. Tap. Tap. Tap.

           In the place of Brooks Brothers, the spreadsheet now shows a 
           $472.22 expense belonging to

                              McGRAW HILL / TEXTBOOK RESUPPLY

           She feeds the original receipt INTO the SHREDDER. Hovers the 
           cursor down to the FORTUNOFF line item. Just as she prepares 
           to hit the backspace key once more...

                                 CUSTODIAN (O.S.)
                        Sorry, Pam. I didn’t realize you 
                        were still in here.

           Pam withdraws her hand from the keyboard. She peers up at the 
           elderly CUSTODIAN, clearing out trash bags.

                                 CUSTODIAN (CONT’D)
                        Another long night?

           She speaks in a measured, restrained tone.

                                 PAM
                        You know me. Burning the midnight 
                        oil whenever I can help it.

           She watches as he circulates the bullpen, a hobble in his 
           step. Moving very slowly.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Any fun weekend plans?

                                 CUSTODIAN
                        Yeah, I’m gonna enjoy our last few 
                        rays of sunshine before fall rolls 
                        around. You?

                                 PAM
                        Oh, I think I’ll see my family. 
                        Have a quiet weekend at home.

           She smiles.

           We hear the off-screen ROAR of a JET-SKI.

           EXT. QUANTUCK BAY - DAY

           TIGHT on PAM, having the TIME OF HER LIFE.

           She commands a turbo-powered KAWASAKI, face drenched in salt 
           water, hair thrashing about in the breeze. A wild joker’s 
           grin from ear to ear.
           WHOOSH! As she SOARS over a WAVE in SLOW MOTION.

           We’re treated to similar action shots of four additional 
           family members, charging ahead on separate jet-skis.

           They’re identified via CHYRONS in FREEZE-FRAME, each captured 
           in the throes of ecstatic, exhilarating bliss:

           HENRY GLUCKIN, 50s, Pam’s new husband, wiry and diminutive, 
           sporting an unconvincing spray tan;

           JOHN ‘JOHN BOY’ McCORMICK, 20s, Pam’s son, puffy-faced and 
           hopelessly good-natured;

           AMBER McCORMICK, 20s, Pam’s daughter, a strawberry blonde 
           with her mother’s looks;

           and DEBBIE RIGANO, 30s, Pam’s niece, whom we already know 
           from her brief introduction at the administrative office.

           The five of them veer their Kawasakis in a synchronized 
           circle, following one another in close succession, creating a 
           formidable eddy in their center.

           EXT. BACK PATIO - PAM’S BEACH HOUSE - DAY

           Pam and Henry host a pool party at their Hamptons home.

           Kids scurry about on the deck, assailing each other and the 
           countless pet dogs with complicated high-tech toy weapons. 
           John Boy joins in on the fun, a big kid himself.

           Jack Lombardo splays out on a floatie, sipping on a frozen 
           margarita. He finds himself unwittingly caught between two 
           youngsters in a Super Soaker battle.

                                 LOMBARDO
                        Watch it, or I’ll take that thing 
                        and bash you over the head with it.

           Elsewhere, Henry fires up bison burgers on the grill. He’s 
           accompanied by a friend, another dad.

                                 HENRY’S FRIEND
                        Single best stretch of beach on the 
                        island, I’ve always said. I know a 
                        guy paid eight hundred for his, but 
                        that was only a two-bedroom. This 
                        property-- jeez, it must’ve cost 
                        you a frickin’ fortune.
                                 HENRY
                        Nah, not bad. Not too bad. It was a 
                        foreclosure, so.

                                 HENRY’S FRIEND
                        C’mon, help me out here. How does a 
                        used car salesman afford a place on 
                        Dune Road? I mean, I know Pam’s a 
                        civil servant...

           Henry turns to his friend, offended.

                                 HENRY
                        Firstly, the Jeeps, Oldsmobiles and 
                        Chevys I deal in aren’t used. At 
                        worst, at very worst, they’re 
                        lightly pre-owned. And, now that 
                        you mention it, I happen to do some 
                        consulting in my spare time.

                                 HENRY’S FRIEND
                        What kind of consulting?

           Henry takes a beat.

                                 HENRY
                        Y’know. Futures and shit.

           Pam loiters at the bar, entertaining friends of her own. They 
           shout over the sound of the blender, gnashing ice.

                                 PAM
                        To be honest, I’m not crazy about 
                        the second level. We’re doing a big 
                        remodel after the season’s through.

                                 PAM’S FRIEND
                        Who are you using?

                                 PAM
                        John Boy.

                                 PAM’S FRIEND
                        John Boy’s a contractor?

                                 PAM
                        Oh yeah. He’s emerging as a real 
                        force in the industry. They’ve got 
                        him spearheading some pretty major 
                        heavy-duty projects--

           They observe as John Boy’s tackled by an onslaught of kids, 
           groaning dramatically as he sinks to his knees.
                                 JOHN BOY
                        Ma! Help me, ma! They’ve destroyed 
                        my All-Spark! Ahh!

           Pam returns to her friends.

                                 PAM
                        Like I was saying, he’s finally 
                        found his niche. But then again, 
                        he’s always been very creative, 
                        very handy with construction. You 
                        should see him with the-- what’s it 
                        again-- the K’Nex sets. He barely 
                        even needs the manual.

           Debbie appears beside Pam.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Girls, have you met my sister’s kid 
                        Debbie Rigano? The two of us work 
                        together now. You know, in Roslyn.

                                 PAM’S FRIEND
                        That’s great. What are you doing 
                        over there?

                                 DEBBIE
                        I’m district clerk. I’m very new.

                                 PAM
                        They love her. She’s a star.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I’m okay. Getting better. Aunt Pam, 
                        can we talk in the house a sec?

                                 PAM
                        Sure. Excuse me, ladies.

           INT. DEN - PAM’S BEACH HOUSE - DAY

           Pam straightens a painting of two horses galloping that hangs 
           above the fireplace. Debbie waits for her on the couch.

                                 PAM
                        This is an original Christian Riese 
                        Lassen print. Henry and I bought it 
                        from a dealer in Maui.

           She steps back to admire the art.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        I find it very evocative.
           Pam sits down next to Debbie.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        So what’s going on?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Honestly, I feel bad even bringing 
                        it up. See, Jared’s birthday’s in a 
                        couple of weeks, and he’s been 
                        asking for this Sony PlayStation 
                        whatever... and he keeps saying how 
                        all his friends already have it...

                                 PAM
                        The video game system.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Yeah. So money’s been kinda tight 
                        lately, and you know how those 
                        things are so frickin’ expensive--

                                 PAM
                        Charge it to the card. Leave the 
                        receipt on my desk Monday morning.

           Debbie grows tense.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Right, but I was wondering if you 
                        couldn’t just loan me the money, 
                        y’know, out of your personal? I’d 
                        pay you back as soon as I’m able--

                                 PAM
                        Debra. Stop.

           She places a hand on Debbie’s. They make eye contact.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Do you trust me? You trust me, 
                        don’t you?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Yeah. Yeah, I trust you. Of course 
                        I trust you.

                                 PAM
                        Then trust that I know what I’m 
                        doing. And that there’s absolutely 
                        nothing for you to be afraid of.

                                 DEBBIE
                        He just wants that PlayStation so 
                        goddamn much, y’know?
                                 PAM
                        You can’t put a price on a child’s 
                        smile. It’s priceless.

           Debbie nods.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Yeah.

                                 PAM
                        Yeah indeed.

           INT. CLASSROOM - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Frank convenes with the seven-person school board. Men and 
           women. Parents. Big Bill, front and center.

                                 FRANK
                        As you all know, this is our most 
                        important budget yet. This is the 
                        one that’ll define us. We need to 
                        work together to sell this thing.

                                 BIG BILL
                        This is why you called us all here 
                        on a Saturday? Christ, Frank, the 
                        vote’s nine months away.

                                 FRANK
                        Exactly. We can’t let it sneak up 
                        on us again. You all remember what 
                        almost happened in ‘01.

                                 BIG BILL
                        Okay. What did you have in mind?

                                 FRANK
                        This time, we go to the mattresses.

           Frank picks up a piece of chalk. He pivots to the chalkboard 
           behind him. Starts sketching with a wild energy.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        The whole town has to feel a strong 
                        personal stake in the future of our 
                        schools. We’ve gotta get out in the 
                        streets and shake every hand, kiss 
                        every baby, tout every achievement--

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)
                        Say cheese!
           INT. VARIOUS - DAY

           Frank poses with the winners of the middle school science 
           fair. With the student cast of The Pirates of Penzance. With 
           the all-county varsity basketball team.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

           The marching band parades through the streets, campaigning 
           for the budget. Blocking cars. Stopping traffic.

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

           Big Bill schmoozes with the mayor and a few other municipal 
           officials. All the men puff on fat cigars.

           INT. RETIREMENT HOME - DAY

           Frank cranks the bingo cage, the numbered marbles swooshing 
           and rattling before him. He plucks one out.

                                 FRANK
                        B-5! It’s B-5! Come on up, Muriel!

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SHARON’S HOUSE - DAY

           Frank spearheads a lively discussion on Great Expectations. 

           He cracks a joke. The room erupts in laughter.

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - DAY

           Frank is honored as the Roslyn Rotary Club’s Man of the Year.

           He presents his trophy for the flashing cameras, flanked on 
           either side by drunk elderly vets in fezzes.

           INT. TEMPLE SINAI SYNAGOGUE - DAY

           Frank stands at the podium, clad in a yarmulke. He’s flanked 
           by the young Bat Mitzvah, BECCA BLAUSTEIN, and a RABBI.

           Frank reads from the sacred scroll laid out in front of him, 
           donning a pair of glasses.

                                 FRANK
                        Baruch atah adonai, eloheinu melech 
                        ha’olam, asher bachar banu...
           INT. CATERING HALL - NIGHT

           Becca and her adolescent friends clutter the dance floor, 
           bopping and hopping, as a bored party DJ spins tunes.

           Her father Big Bill lingers on the perimeter, drinking 
           steadily. Frank’s seated beside him, sober for the night.

                                 FRANK
                        Thanks for having me. Becca’s grown 
                        into quite the young woman.

                                 BIG BILL
                        You’re family. Amy never would’ve 
                        had a snowball’s chance at Penn if 
                        you hadn’t pulled those strings.

                                 FRANK
                        Amy was a talented student.

                                 BIG BILL
                        She was just so-so. Maybe Syracuse 
                        or Binghamton grade, definitely not 
                        Penn material. You put her there. 
                        You made the difference.

           He looks out at his younger daughter on the dance floor.

                                 BIG BILL (CONT’D)
                        I don’t ask for much in this life, 
                        but I’m counting on you stepping in 
                        again when it’s Becca’s turn.

                                 FRANK
                        Of course. But I maintain a school 
                        superintendent’s only as capable as 
                        his board president.

                                 BIG BILL
                        Let’s see how the re-election bid 
                        goes. Judy Rothman’s already taking 
                        out full-page ads against me in the 
                        paper, the fuckin’ mongrel.

           Bill downs the rest of his drink.

                                 BIG BILL (CONT’D)
                        Scary times we live in. You hear 
                        the news about Dave Kellogg?

                                 FRANK
                        That’s Rachel and Jeremy’s father, 
                        right? Works in financials?
                                 BIG BILL
                        He did. For a little trading 
                        company called Enron.

           Frank processes this.

                                 BIG BILL (CONT’D)
                        Can you believe he had no idea? The 
                        guy lost his life savings in the 
                        span of an afternoon. I hear he 
                        reported to the top brass directly.

                                 FRANK
                        You think maybe we can find him 
                        something? The board treasurer 
                        position’s opening up...

                                 BIG BILL
                        Better not to invite that kind of 
                        heat. You know how people talk.
                             (a pause)
                        I mean, how can you be so close to 
                        something and just not know? I have 
                        sympathy for the guy, but c’mon...

                                 FRANK
                        It could have happened to anyone.

                                 BIG BILL
                        Maybe. Not me. Not when I’ve got a 
                        family to feed.

           Bill gets up. He storms the dance floor, arms outstretched.

                                 BIG BILL (CONT’D)
                        Where’s my father-daughter dance?

           INT. KITCHEN - RACHEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Rachel fishes a drink from the fridge. David enters, hands 
           dug into his pockets.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey. They’re showing the house 
                        tomorrow. If you wouldn’t mind 
                        straightening your room a little...

                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah. No problem.

           She brushes past him into her bedroom.
           INT. BEDROOM - RACHEL’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Rachel browses her room, picking items up off the floor. 
           Beneath a pile of clothes, she finds an old, bent photo of 
           their family on the front porch of the house.

           Rachel’s a toddler, Jeremy a few years older. David’s dressed 
           in a suit, trim and clean-shaven. Professional. His arms 
           wrapped around a woman we haven’t seen before.

           Four smiling, happy faces.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DEBBIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Debbie watches as her son and his friends play a video game 
           on the new system. Utterly absorbed.

           She can’t help but smile.

           INT. FRANK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Frank loosens his tie, kicks off his loafers.

                                 STEVE (O.S.)
                        Did you have fun?

                                 FRANK
                        I was working.

           Steve appears in the doorway.

                                 STEVE
                        What did they serve?

                                 FRANK
                        During the reception there was a 
                        sushi bar, and for dinner we had a 
                        choice between salmon and gnocchi.

                                 STEVE
                        That’s great. I had oatmeal for 
                        dinner, in case you were wondering. 
                        I had oatmeal and you had gnocchi.

                                 FRANK
                        Actually I had the salmon. It was 
                        dry. You wouldn’t have liked it.

           Steve glares at him.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You could have gone out.
                                 STEVE
                        Or you could have brought me.

                                 FRANK
                        I told you it was a work function. 
                        It wouldn’t have been--

                                 STEVE
                        Appropriate?

           Frank doesn’t respond.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        You’re a coward.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m a coward who loves you.

                                 STEVE
                        You don’t.

                                 FRANK
                        I do. You know I do.

                                 STEVE
                        But you’re not--

           Frank kisses him. Tender. Committed.

           Steve pulls away, smiling.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        You taste like dry salmon.

                                 FRANK
                        I can fix that.

           He goes to the bathroom. Gargles mouthwash. Spits.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Hey, are you tired yet? I could use 
                        your help with something.

           INT. BEDROOM - FRANK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Steve sits on the bed, a Roslyn yearbook perched on his lap. 
           He’s opened to the faculty section, which is neatly annotated 
           with an array of flags, tabs and Post-Its.

           Frank paces before him.

                                 STEVE
                        Jamieson.
                                 FRANK
                        That’s too easy. He’s been around 
                        since the stone age.

                                 STEVE
                        Okay. Schiffer.

                                 FRANK
                        Mel Schiffer, social studies. Ninth 
                        grade global history. He coaches 
                        little league, likes old westerns.

                                 STEVE
                        Caruso.

                                 FRANK
                        Iris is eleventh grade pre-calc. 
                        Regents level-- no, honors. She 
                        lives in Glen Head, in a charming 
                        old converted farmhouse.

                                 STEVE
                        Really? I love that.

                                 FRANK
                        Don’t get too excited. There’s no 
                        central air.

                                 STEVE
                        Figueroa.

           Frank stops.

                                 FRANK
                        Figueroa... Figueroa...

           INT. CAFETERIA - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           The school faculty gathers for a district-hosted brunch. The 
           room’s centerpiece is an overflowing chocolate fountain.

           Frank presides over one of the many faculty tables.

                                 FRANK
                        Mr. Figueroa! How’s your squash 
                        game holding up? Still competing in 
                        those tournaments?

                                 MR. FIGUEROA
                        Oh yeah. Every weekend.
                                 FRANK
                        That’s great. So important to keep 
                        fit. Hey Karina, are they having 
                        you back on Jeopardy any time soon?

                                 SECOND TEACHER (KARINA)
                        Just the once, unfortunately.

                                 FRANK
                        Aw, that’s a shame. You and Alex 
                        had some rapport. You made our 
                        school look very good that night.

                                 SECOND TEACHER (KARINA)
                        Thanks, Dr. Tassone.

           The caterer pops in, offering a tray.

                                 CATERER
                        Broiled lobster tails?

                                 FRANK
                        None for me, thanks. Excuse me a 
                        sec. Jim! How are the twins--?

           Frank strides over to the next table. The teachers turn to 
           one another, mystified.

                                 SECOND TEACHER (KARINA)
                        Lobster tails? Are you kidding me?

                                 MR. FIGUEROA
                        The guys in custodial told me he 
                        covers it all out of pocket. He 
                        knows how to treat his people.

                                 SECOND TEACHER (KARINA)
                        No kidding. Back in Jericho we were 
                        lucky if we got cold cuts.

           DOUG BRESSLER, 40s, high school principal, spies Frank from 
           across the room. He beelines toward him.

                                 BRESSLER
                        You’ve outdone yourself this year.

                                 FRANK
                        As any administrator worth his salt 
                        will tell you, happy teachers 
                        equals happy schools.

                                 BRESSLER
                        Ain’t it the truth. Hey, I’ve got 
                        something to run by you.
           He hands Frank a print-out brochure.

                                 FRANK
                        The National School Conference 
                        Institute? I haven’t heard of them.

                                 BRESSLER
                        It’s a new outfit. They’re putting 
                        up a big speaker series next month. 
                        I’m thinking our presence could 
                        make for some healthy PR...?

           Frank flips through the pages.

                                 FRANK
                        Well, Principal Bressler, this 
                        certainly seems like an interesting 
                        opportunity for Roslyn. I’d love to 
                        expand our national scope.

           He looks up at Bressler.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Where’d you say it was being held?

           INT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Debbie’s on the phone with a travel agency. She gives the 
           conference brochure a once-over.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I’d like to book three round-trip 
                        tickets to Las Vegas.

                                 TRAVEL AGENT (O.S.)
                        Sure, we’ll get that squared away 
                        for you. Would you like to hear 
                        about our VIP deluxe package?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Gee. VIP? I’m sure they’re not 
                        looking for anything too fancy...

                                 TRAVEL AGENT (O.S.)
                        Are you an outside agent?

           Debbie furrows her brow.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I’m, uh, I’m not--
                                 TRAVEL AGENT (O.S.)
                        As an outside agent, you’ll earn a 
                        five-percent commission on today’s 
                        travel booking. That is, provided 
                        you’re contacting us on behalf of 
                        your clients.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Oh.

           She bites her lip. Leans back in her chair, props her feet on 
           the desk. Twirls the phone cord with her finger.

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        You know what, why don’t we go 
                        ahead and book three VIP deluxes. 
                        For my clients.

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Homecoming is in full swing. Students and community members 
           pack the bleachers, swathed in Roslyn blue and white.

           The marching band performs a rousing halftime show, complete 
           with cheerleaders and baton twirlers. The school’s bulldog 
           mascot cartwheels across the astroturf.

           Frank and Pam confer on the sidelines, distanced from the 
           pandemonium that defines the scene.

                                 FRANK
                        Did you ever play an instrument?

                                 PAM
                        Seven years’ clarinet. I loathed 
                        every minute of it.

                                 FRANK
                        Growing up, my school didn’t have a 
                        music program. I think I would’ve 
                        really excelled at the saxophone.
                             (a pause)
                        You’re upset with me.

           Pam’s head stirs.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Pam. Tell me what’s going on.

                                 PAM
                        Y’know, my dad tried to discourage 
                        me from administrative work. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAM (CONT'D)
                        He said it’d always be a guy in a 
                        suit at the top of the chain. That 
                        I’d get stuck in the steno pool.

                                 FRANK
                        Is this about the conference?

                                 PAM
                        When’s my turn, huh? I’ve been here 
                        even longer than you. When do I get 
                        to be the face for once?

                                 FRANK
                        That was never up to me.

           He looks out at the crowd.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        They love the suit. The straight 
                        laces and buttons and cufflinks. 
                        I’m every other jerk-off they’ve 
                        ever met. I don’t rock the boat or 
                        threaten the status quo. With me 
                        they feel safe and secure.

           He turns to her.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        But you put a woman in the same 
                        position, a woman who’s confident, 
                        capable at that-- she’s a moving 
                        target. An object of scorn, and 
                        nastiness, and ridicule. They look 
                        for reasons to challenge her. You 
                        saw what happened to Julie Flynn in 
                        Syosset. I don’t want that for you.

                                 PAM
                        I don’t need you to protect me. You 
                        think I’m scared of them?

                                 FRANK
                        I think they’re scared of you. Of 
                        real progress. Of change.

                                 PAM
                        In that case, maybe you’re the one 
                        they should really be afraid of. 
                        You and your straight laces.

           Frank tightens.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Frank.
                                 FRANK
                        No. You’re right.

                                 PAM
                        Frank, I’m sorry.

           He meets her gaze.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Did you tell him you’re going?

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah. He knows. He’s not thrilled. 
                        It’s only two days, but... I think 
                        I could use some time.

                                 PAM
                        If you ever need anything.

           Frank nods. Pam touches his hand.

                                 FRANK
                        Fuck ‘em. If this is really what 
                        you want, let’s make it happen. 
                        I’ll help however I can.

                                 PAM
                        Thanks, Frank.

           We see the two of them from a CAMERA MONITOR, zooming in 
           slowly to capture their interaction. Their words are lost 
           amidst the ROAR of the MARCHING BAND.

           Rachel lowers her camera.

           INT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Pam sits at her workstation, tapping away on her keyboard.

                                 RACHEL (O.S.)
                        Hi Mrs. Gluckin.

           She looks up to see Rachel, wind-blown and soaking wet.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Hi. I was told to come to you if I 
                        wanted to take a look at the annual 
                        budget reports.

                                 PAM
                        What’s this about?
                                 RACHEL
                        Oh, sorry. I’m Rachel Kellogg with 
                        The Hilltop Beacon.

                                 PAM
                        Since when are you guys doing 
                        budget stories? It seems a fairly 
                        dull subject for the Beacon, if you 
                        want my opinion.

           Rachel shrugs. Pam eyes her strangely.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Well, we post the budgets

           She gives a polite smile. Returns to her computer.

           Rachel doesn’t budge.

                                 RACHEL
                        Sorry. Only the function summaries 
                        are available online. I was hoping 
                        to see the line-by-line reports.

           Pam exhales, visibly irritated now.

                                 PAM
                        Which year specifically?

           Rachel thinks.

                                 RACHEL
                        All of them, I guess.

                                 PAM
                        What for?

                                 RACHEL
                        Budget reports are a part of the 
                        public record, right? If a request 
                        is made, you’re not allowed to 
                        obscure them--

                                 PAM
                        Hold on, who’s obscuring? No one’s 
                        obscuring. You’re welcome to take a 
                        look at however many budgets you 
                        want. I’m just telling you, they’re 
                        not very exciting. It’s a lot of 
                        numbers and percentages...
                                 RACHEL
                        That’s okay. I’m in Math Olympiads.

                                 PAM
                        You’re in the Math Olympiads.

           Rachel nods eagerly.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Well, don’t say I didn’t warn you.

           She hands Rachel a small key.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        They’re waiting for you down in the 
                        basement. Happy hunting.

           INT. BASEMENT - CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Rachel combs through the district archives, plucking dusty 
           old binders from the shelves one by one.

           She steps straight into a cobweb. Gets some in her mouth. 
           Doubles over in a coughing fit.

           INT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Rachel returns to Pam with a stack of binders.

                                 RACHEL
                        Could I use the Xerox machine to 
                        photocopy some of these?

           Pam stares at the mammoth pile. She bites her lip.

                                 PAM
                        It’s ten cents a sheet.

           Rachel smiles.

           INT. COPIER ROOM - CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Debbie feeds the reports into the Xerox, one page at a time. 
           Rachel stands beside her, cradling a bag filled with dimes.

                                 DEBBIE
                        So, you’re a junior?

                                 RACHEL
                        Sophomore.
                                 DEBBIE
                        That’s nice. My son’s in sixth 
                        grade. His name’s Jared.

                                 RACHEL
                        Cool.

           They look off in opposite directions. The copier spits out 
           spreadsheets by the second.

           INT. LIBRARY - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Rachel pores over the budgets with a highlighter. She wears a 
           pair of headphones to tune out the surrounding chatter.

           INT. KITCHEN - RACHEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Rachel approaches David at the kitchen counter. He’s nursing 
           a drink, struggling to stay awake.

                                 RACHEL
                        Can I borrow your laptop? I need to 
                        use your software for something.

                                 DAVID
                        My old financial software?

                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah. For a project I’m doing.

                                 DAVID
                        Do you need any help?

                                 RACHEL
                        Nope, I’m all set. Thanks Dad.

           She leaves with the laptop.

           INT. BEDROOM - RACHEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Rachel configures her own spreadsheet on the laptop. Inputs 
           the numbers from the school budgets. Chews on her pen.

           EXT. ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           A severe thunderstorm besieges the school and its campus. 
           Streaks of lightning flash ominously on the horizon.

           The SkyWalk, still nowhere near completion, appears to be 
           swaying in the heavy winds.
           INT. HALLWAY - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           The hallway is lined with trash cans serving as rain buckets, 
           receptacles for the widespread ceiling leakage.

           Rachel walks past the library. She looks in through the 
           window to find Mrs. Dwyer scurrying about in a yellow rain 
           coat, attempting to rescue every book she can.

           INT. HEALTH CLASSROOM - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           The health teacher gives a lecture. She tries her best to 
           ignore the blue tarp (or “bladder”) dangling overhead, which 
           accumulates rainwater in its ever-swelling basin.

           She gazes up at the tarp. It’s GURGLING and MOANING, like an 
           upset stomach... and just as it looks READY to POP...

           INT. CASINO - CAESAR’S PALACE - DAY

           A cocktail waitress POPS THE CORK on a BOTTLE of CHAMPAGNE. 

           She winds through the packed establishment, delivering the 
           glasses to Bressler and Lombardo at a craps table.

           Lombardo blows on the dice in his hand. Flings them forward.

                                 LOMBARDO
                        Eleven! Eleven! Eleven--!

           INT. EVENT HALL - RAMADA INN - DAY

           Frank watches a dull PowerPoint lecture at the education 
           conference. He copies down the bullet points in a notebook.

           Beside him are two unoccupied seats.

           INT. LOBBY - RAMADA INN - DAY

           Frank mingles with the other attendees, putting his best face 
           forward. He shakes hands, collects business cards.

           EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT

           Frank takes a midnight stroll down the strip, a tiny presence 
           in the shadows of the great playground hotels.
           He pauses outside a popular gay nightclub. His face awash in 
           the bright neon glow of the signage. The beat pulsing from 
           inside, reverberating out into the street.

           He keeps walking, past the club. Gets a tap on the shoulder.

                                 MAN
                        You got a light?

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t. Sorry.

           He looks up, briefly glimpses the man.

           He’s early 30s, youthful and handsome, dressed in a faux 
           leather jacket patched at the elbows.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Jason?

           Jason keeps walking. Frank pursues.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Jason! Jason DiMarco!

                                 JASON
                        Back off, man. I just asked if you 
                        had a light, not some kind of--

                                 FRANK
                        You’re Jason DiMarco from Levittown 
                        High School, maybe fifteen years 
                        ago. From when I taught there.

           Jason stops. He meets Frank’s gaze.

                                 JASON
                        Dr. Tassone?

                                 FRANK
                        It’s Frank.

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Frank and Jason sit across from one another in a corner 
           booth. Jason shifts uneasily on the vinyl.

                                 JASON
                        Hey, uh, Frank -- do all teachers 
                        have a memory like you do? I always 
                        figured they just forget about you 
                        the second you’re outta there.
                                 FRANK
                        It varies, I think. Three hundred 
                        kids a year, things start to get a 
                        bit hazy. And they rarely come by 
                        again afterwards, so you don’t get 
                        much in the way of follow-up. But 
                        there are some you don’t forget.

                                 JASON
                        I don’t know. I would’ve figured 
                        I’d be pretty forgettable.

                                 FRANK
                        You liked books.

           Jason cracks a smile.

                                 JASON
                        Yeah. Yeah, I did. Like sci-fi and 
                        shit. Harlan Ellison.

                                 FRANK
                        You carried around that beat-up 
                        copy of Dune with you, always. It 
                        was a nice detail, I put it in your 
                        college rec. You went on to Stony 
                        Brook, right? How was that?

           Jason looks down at his menu. Scratches the back of his neck. 
           Frank glimpses a series of bruises on his forearm.

                                 JASON
                        Not so good. I think I was burned 
                        out on the whole Long Island scene, 
                        to be honest. I left after a year.

                                 FRANK
                        And you live out here now?

                                 JASON
                        Yeah. Is that okay?

                                 FRANK
                        What do you mean?

                                 JASON
                        I just feel like you’re judging me, 
                        like, for not doing more.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh, I’d imagine there are lots of 
                        people that live in Las Vegas and 
                        do just fine. More than fine.
           He takes a sip of coffee.

                                 JASON
                        Yeah, I guess you could say I’m in 
                        between things. I was dancing, 
                        actually, up until pretty recently.

                                 FRANK
                        Dancing?

                                 JASON
                        Yeah. You know. Anyways, that was a 
                        pretty good gig and all, till I 
                        went and fucked up my ACL...

                                 FRANK
                        You could write.

           Jason laughs.

                                 JASON
                        Okay. What am I writing?

                                 FRANK
                        Science fiction. Something in the 
                        vein of Harlan Ellison, or Dune.

                                 JASON
                        Nobody wants to read that from me.

                                 FRANK
                        I’d read it.

           Jason sobers.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I’m serious.

                                 JASON
                        Hey, can you-- can you stop?

                                 FRANK
                        Stop what?

                                 JASON
                        I don’t know. This.

                                 FRANK
                        We’re just talking.
                                 JASON
                        C’mon. It’s two in the morning and 
                        you’re sitting here messing around 
                        with me. Don’t you have, like, a 
                        wife waiting for you at the hotel?

                                 FRANK
                        No. No wife.

                                 JASON
                        Really? At your age?

                                 FRANK
                        I’m a widower.

           Jason shakes his head.

                                 JASON
                        Fuck. You know, they used to say 
                        things about you back in Levittown.

                                 FRANK
                        Like what?

                                 JASON
                        Nothing. No, nothing. Stupid stuff. 
                        You know how kids talk.

           Frank peers up at him.

                                 FRANK
                        What did they say?

           INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

           Bressler and Lombardo wait to board the plane. They spot 
           Frank as he approaches, clad in last night’s wrinkled suit.

                                 BRESSLER
                        Where were you? We tried knocking 
                        on your door this morning.

                                 FRANK
                        I overslept.

                                 BRESSLER
                        In your suit, by the looks of it.

                                 LOMBARDO
                        Glad to see at least one of us got 
                        some strange pussy this weekend...
                                 FRANK
                        I missed you two at the conference.

                                 BRESSLER
                        Yeah. Y’know, that stomach flu 
                        knocked us both right on our ass.

                                 LOMBARDO
                        Terrible, terrible timing.

           Frank sighs.

                                 FRANK
                        Did you win any money at least?

                                 BRESSLER
                        We did okay.

                                 LOMBARDO
                        Thanks for the respite, Frank. 
                        You’re a hell of a guy.

           They walk ahead of him. He grimaces.

           EXT. BACK PATIO - PAM’S BEACH HOUSE - DAY

           Grey skies. Calm seas. Seagulls heading west.

           John Boy roams the patio in a hard hat and utility belt, 
           taking measurements with a roll of tape.

           He whips a pencil from behind his ear. Jots down notes.

           INT. HOME DEPOT - DAY

           John Boy maneuvers a shopping cart down the sheetrock aisle, 
           plucking a variety of supplies from the shelves.

           He’s not exactly discerning.

           INT. CHECKOUT - HOME DEPOT - DAY

           A clerk rings up John Boy’s purchases. He swivels a credit 
           card machine forward. The total is $3,423.25.

           WHOOSH! As John Boy SWIPES HIS CARD through the reader. We 
           see the RAISED PRINT on THE PLASTIC, in SHARP FOCUS:

                                    JOHN D. McCORMICK
                                  ROSLYN PUBLIC SCHOOLS
           EXT. PARKING LOT - HOME DEPOT - DAY

           John Boy loads up his pick-up truck.

           He gets in the driver’s seat. Unfolds a map of Home Depot 
           store locations across Long Island. Checks off the top one 
           with his ear pencil.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - ANOTHER HOME DEPOT - DAY

           John Boy pulls up to a nearly identical Home Depot.

           INT. ANOTHER HOME DEPOT - DAY

           John Boy weaves through a new aisle.

           INT. CHECKOUT - ANOTHER HOME DEPOT - DAY

           Whoosh! John Boy swipes his card.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - ANOTHER HOME DEPOT - DAY

           John Boy packs his truck with the second round of supplies.

           He ticks another Home Depot off the list.

           INT. CHECKOUT - YET ANOTHER HOME DEPOT - DAY

           Yet another clerk. Yet another stockpile of goods.

           Whoosh.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - YET ANOTHER HOME DEPOT - DAY

           The clerk helps John Boy carry his supplies to the truck. He 
           sees it’s already stuffed beyond capacity.

                                 CLERK
                        How many of our stores have you 
                        visited today?

                                 JOHN BOY
                        Yeah. A couple, I guess. The ones 
                        in Farmingdale and Patchogue didn’t 
                        have what I was looking for.

           John Boy climbs up into the back of his truck. He attempts to 
           rearrange the boxes to create more space.
                                 CLERK
                        They didn’t have plywood?

                                 JOHN BOY
                        Nah, they were all out. So you 
                        gonna help me load this or what?

                                 CLERK
                        I’m not sure it’ll fit.

                                 JOHN BOY
                        It’ll fit.

           He wipes a bead of sweat from his brow. Keeps at it.

                                 CLERK
                        Sir. Sir? You know we actually 
                        offer a free ship-to service for 
                        our high-value customers...

           John Boy stops. Peers down at the clerk.

                                 JOHN BOY
                        You think I’m high-value?

           The clerk looks at the colossal heap of merchandise.

                                 CLERK
                        Reasonably, yeah.

           INT. BREAK ROOM - YET ANOTHER HOME DEPOT - DAY

           The clerk eats lunch with his fellow employees, recounting 
           the story in between mouthfuls of his tuna fish sandwich.

                                 CLERK
                        So the guy gives me this home 
                        address in Westhampton, a full 
                        fifty miles from Roslyn.

                                 CLERK’S FRIEND
                        What’s a Roslyn Schools contractor 
                        doing buying supplies all the way 
                        in Selden? And don’t public schools 
                        get all their materials wholesale?

           They take a look at John Boy’s customer receipt. The STORE 
           MANAGER pokes his head in.

                                 STORE MANAGER
                        Tool chests? Shower heads? This 
                        stuff screams home improvement.
           He whisks the receipt off the table.

                                 STORE MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        It so happens my wife’s cousin’s 
                        married to one of the boardies over 
                        at Roslyn. Let’s see if they can’t 
                        make some sense of this.

           INT. DEN - BIG BILL’S HOUSE - DAY

           The fax machine prints out a copy of John Boy’s receipt. 

           BONNIE BLAUSTEIN, 50s, examines the purchases. Her head 
           reeling in utter disbelief.

           INT. MEN’S BATHROOM - BIG BILL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Bill sits in a bathroom stall, leafing through a magazine. 
           His phone rings. He fumbles to answer it.

                                 BIG BILL
                        Honey?

                                 BONNIE (O.S.)
                        You need to come home. Now.

           INT. KITCHEN - BIG BILL’S HOUSE - DAY

           Bill and Bonnie assess the receipt together.

                                 BIG BILL
                        He can’t be one of Lombardo’s guys. 
                        The school’s supposed to put out 
                        bids for construction materials.

                                 BONNIE
                        Then who is John McCormick and why 
                        does he have a Roslyn expense card?

                                 BIG BILL
                        I don’t know any McCormick over 
                        there. There is no McCormick.

                                 BONNIE
                        Wait, wasn’t Pam Cremona-- or Pam 
                        Gluckin or whatever-- her first 
                        husband was a McCormick, wasn’t he?

           They look at one another. Bill laughs.
                                 BONNIE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 BIG BILL
                        No fuckin’ way. Pam Gluckin, of all 
                        people, with a house on Dune Road?

           EXT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Pam backs her Corvette into its parking spot, bopping her 
           head to a cheery ‘80s pop song on the radio.

           Her vanity license plate reads DUNENUT.

           INT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Pam enters the building, a spring in her step. She finds ALL 
           SEVEN MEMBERS of THE SCHOOL BOARD waiting for her.

                                 BIG BILL
                        Hi Pam.

           Pam’s smile fizzles.

           INT. RESOURCE ROOM - ROSLYN MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

           Frank oversees a panel of restless sixth graders, all seated 
           on bean bag chairs. He folds his hands over his knees.

                                 FRANK
                        So, what do you all hope to achieve 
                        in the sixth grade? We’ll go around 
                        in a circle, counter-clockwise 
                        starting with Spencer.

           Spencer stares blankly ahead, mouth hanging open.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Spencer, are you with us?

           No visible reaction.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Spencer? Is he okay--? All right. 
                        Why don’t we move on to Heather?

                                 HEATHER
                        I don’t know about sixth grade, but 
                        I’d like to be a cardiothoracic 
                        surgeon like my mom.
                                 FRANK
                        That’s great, Heather. But again, 
                        thinking a bit more short-term--

           The door swings open, revealing Frank’s secretary MARY ANN, 
           heaving to catch her breath.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Mary Ann?

                                 MARY ANN
                        Come... quick...

           INT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - NIGHT

           Frank faces the school board. He looks pale, drained of 
           color. His head’s spinning.

           The board members shout over one another in a mess of fury 
           and panic. Frank can barely register them.

                                 BIG BILL
                        She’s a fucking thief!

                                 JUDY ROTHMAN
                        She made off with thirty thousand 
                        dollars in taxpayer money, and 
                        that’s just between all the Home 
                        Depots. Who knows who else has one 
                        of those expense cards?

                                 THIRD BOARDIE (STAN)
                        We have a moral obligation to 
                        report this to the community.

                                 JUDY ROTHMAN
                        No. This is a criminal matter. We 
                        need to call the police. The FBI.

                                 FOURTH BOARDIE (BETH)
                        You think the FBI would care about 
                        something this small-time? Aren’t 
                        they busy investigating terrorists?

                                 JUDY ROTHMAN
                        I think it’s worth giving them a 
                        call, at the very least.

           Frank gazes past them at the conference room window, where 
           Pam sits quietly in detention.

           They make eye contact.
                                 FIFTH BOARDIE (WENDY)
                        I just got off with our lawyers. 
                        They recommend we report.

                                 SIXTH BOARDIE (JOEL)
                        Okay, so what are we waiting for? 
                        Let’s crucify the bitch.

                                 BIG BILL
                        I’m calling the mayor. No, the 
                        sheriff. Who should I call first?

                                 THIRD BOARDIE (STAN)
                        You think they’d have the FBI in 
                        the yellow pages--?

                                 FRANK
                        Hold on.

           They all turn to him.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I need to sit down.

                                 BIG BILL
                        Frank, are you okay? Quick, someone 
                        get him a glass of water.

           Bill guides him to a chair. Debbie, lingering off to the 
           sidelines, scrambles to the water cooler.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m sorry. I should’ve caught this.

                                 BIG BILL
                        It’s not your fault. It’s neglect 
                        on all our ends.

           Debbie returns with a paper cup. She hands it to Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        Thanks, Debbie. Maybe see if 
                        there’s anything we can get Pam 
                        while she’s locked up in there.

                                 JUDY ROTHMAN
                        Haven’t we given her enough?

                                 FRANK
                        She did a terrible thing, but she’s 
                        still a human being. And so are we.

           Judy nods to Debbie. Debbie proceeds.
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I think we need to wait until we 
                        have a firm number for Andy.

                                 JUDY ROTHMAN
                        Andy, our auditor? The man’s a 
                        moron. He’s the one person that 
                        should’ve picked up on this--

                                 THIRD BOARDIE (STAN)
                        Fuck him too, the prick.

                                 FRANK
                        We can’t afford to jump the gun. 
                        Not when there’s so much at stake. 
                        Let’s see how deep the well runs 
                        before we commit ourselves to any 
                        definitive course of action.

           He looks at Bill in appeal.

                                 BIG BILL
                        We’ll give him one more hour. After 
                        that we start making calls. Frank, 
                        go ahead and drink that water. We 
                        need you with us tonight. Anyone 
                        have any food lying around?

                                 FRANK
                        I’ll be fine. I’m just a little 
                        shell-shocked. Thanks, everyone.

           He takes a sip.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - NIGHT

           Pam sits in solitude.

           Debbie enters, passes her a water. Pam gulps it down in one 
           shot, crinkles the paper cup in her closed fist.

                                 PAM
                        How could John Boy be so careless? 
                        I’m pulling him off the remodel, 
                        that’s for sure. We’ll have to hire 
                        a real contractor. A professional.

           She stares out the window at the board members.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Frank’s gonna fix this. We’ve had 
                        each other’s backs, always. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Frank could sell those people ice 
                        in the winter... He’ll step up.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Hey Aunt Pam?

           Pam turns to her.

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        You think they’ll find out about 
                        the PlayStation?

                                 PAM
                        No. I told you, I handled that.

                                 DEBBIE
                        That’s good. It’s just... I might 
                        have also done some early Christmas 
                        shopping, is all.

           Pam tightens.

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        See, I wasn’t gonna mention it till 
                        after the holiday, ‘cause I picked 
                        you out something real nice and I 
                        didn’t want to spoil it, y’know...

                                 PAM
                        How much?

           Debbie bites her lip.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Oh... oh, you know... maybe about 
                        eight thousand or so at Macy’s? And 
                        another two at Lord & Taylor...?

           Pam blinks.

                                 PAM
                        Frank will take care of this.

           INT. FRANK’S OFFICE - CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - NIGHT

           ANDY MILLER, 50s, the district auditor, hunches over an 
           impossible array of budget papers. Sweating from all pores.

           The door opens. Frank enters, visibly stressed.

                                 FRANK
                        How’s it coming along?
                                 ANDY
                        There’s no way. There’s just no 
                        way. There’s check warrants 
                        missing, purchase orders...

           He looks up at Frank.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        How could I have overlooked this? 
                        Pam tells me one thing, she says 
                        don’t worry about it, and I believe 
                        her like the idiot schmuck I am.

           Andy shuffles through the papers. It’s hopeless.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        I never so much as think to check 
                        up, and then... Christ. I’m gonna 
                        lose my job. We’re gonna lose our 
                        firm. I’ve been in this business 
                        thirty years and... and my kids...

                                 FRANK
                        Andy.

                                 ANDY
                        We’re dead. They’re gonna kill us, 
                        Frank. Every last one. Game over.

                                 FRANK
                        Nobody’s killing anyone. Andy, I 
                        need you to look at me. Andy.

           Andy does so, weakly.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You’re running the show here. You 
                        have to hold it together. Now how 
                        much did you find, concretely?

                                 ANDY
                        Concretely? I dunno. Two hundred 
                        twenty-three thousand. But that’s 
                        just the obvious stuff. Who knows 
                        what’s buried in here--?

                                 FRANK
                        Two hundred twenty-three thousand. 
                        That’s our number. That’s the 
                        number we go to them with.

                                 ANDY
                        You’re not hearing me. That might 
                        just be the tip of the iceberg.
                                 FRANK
                        You don’t know that.

                                 ANDY
                        Frank, she would’ve kept the 
                        fucking receipts.

                                 FRANK
                        But she could have just misplaced 
                        them, right? I mean, there’s a very 
                        real scenario where every other 
                        expense on there is totally legit.

                                 ANDY
                        Maybe. I don’t know.

                                 FRANK
                        Jesus Andy, Pam’s not some criminal 
                        mastermind. She’s our friend, and 
                        she made a stupid mistake.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah. No, yeah, you’re right.

           Frank nods.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, but what about Hevesi? The 
                        state comptroller’s office could 
                        barge in here at any time and 
                        conduct an outside audit.

                                 FRANK
                        Have they ever done that, in your 
                        thirty years of experience?

           Andy thinks. His head stirs.

                                 ANDY
                        Two hundred twenty-three thousand, 
                        that’s what I can find.

                                 FRANK
                        Maybe we round it up to two fifty. 
                        A nice, clean number.

                                 ANDY
                        Two fifty. Sure.

                                 FRANK
                        We’re gonna make it through this, 
                        Andy. We’re gonna keep our jobs.
                                 ANDY
                        Yeah. Yeah, we are.

           INT. BATHROOM - CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - NIGHT

           Frank grips the sink tight.

           He takes a deep breath. Stares at himself in the mirror.

           INT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - NIGHT

           Frank returns to the board members.

                                 FRANK
                        According to Andy, the sum total’s 
                        two hundred fifty thousand dollars.

           The board reacts in collective disgust.

                                 FOURTH BOARDIE (BETH)
                        That fucking woman. She’s got a set 
                        of balls on her.

                                 BIG BILL
                        She’s gonna rot in prison. Her and 
                        her shitbag son.

           Bill whips out his cell phone.

                                 BIG BILL (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, it’s Bill. I need to speak 
                        with Mayor Kolitz...

                                 FRANK
                        Bill. Put down the phone.

                                 JUDY ROTHMAN
                        Why should he?

                                 FRANK
                        Because if the town finds out about 
                        this, the school’s as good as dead.

           They all process this.

                                 BIG BILL
                             (into the phone)
                        I’ll call you right back.

           He hangs up.
                                 BIG BILL (CONT’D)
                        What are you talking about?

                                 FRANK
                        It’ll be very difficult to explain 
                        this away as an isolated incident. 
                        Once an establishment is perceived 
                        as corrupted, even by one bad egg, 
                        the public never sees it the same. 
                        Think about Watergate.

                                 JUDY ROTHMAN
                        Spare us your civics lesson. We’re 
                        talking about a crime, a theft of 
                        taxpayer money.

                                 FRANK
                        Judy, you’ve been on the school 
                        board how long? Seven years?

                                 JUDY ROTHMAN
                        Eight years. Proudly.

                                 FRANK
                        And in eight years, how many times 
                        has our proposed budget passed 
                        without incident?

           Judy thinks.

                                 JUDY ROTHMAN
                        Eight.

                                 FRANK
                        And what will happen when our new 
                        budget goes up for approval in May? 
                        The one that gets us to first?

                        I see what he’s saying. If an 
                        employee was able to siphon two 
                        hundred fifty thousand dollars 
                        without anyone noticing--

                                 FOURTH BOARDIE (BETH)
                        --why keep pumping more and more

                                 FRANK
                        If a scandal this seismic breaks, 
                        our budget’s torpedoed and we start 
                        back at square one.

                        The teachers don’t get paid, they 
                        migrate out in droves...

                                 THIRD BOARDIE (STAN)
                        Would it affect the colleges?

                                 FRANK
                        It’s reasonable to expect that 
                        admissions officers at top-tier 
                        schools would view us differently.

                                 BIG BILL
                        No. What? Why would they--?

                                 FRANK
                        If they smell trouble, they could 
                        decide to lay off Roslyn kids for a 
                        few years. The yesses become nos 
                        overnight. I’ve seen this kind of 
                        thing happen before.

           Bill’s face grows very pale. He takes a seat.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Okay, then we start to plummet in 
                        the rankings. Our sister schools 
                        push us out of the top ten, the top 
                        hundred even. We become little more 
                        than a blip, an obscurity...

                                 BIG BILL
                        Worse. We’re a fuckin’ cautionary 
                        tale. And that’s when our property 
                        values crap out. ‘Cause on Long 
                        Island, a town’s worth is defined--

                        --by its public school system.

           The board absorbs this.

                                 BIG BILL
                        What the hell do we do?

                                 FRANK
                        There’s one other option.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - NIGHT

           The school board filters into the conference room. Pam glares 
           up at them, anxiously awaiting her fate.
           Frank emerges from the pack. He takes a seat at the table, 
           straight across from Pam.

                                 PAM
                        Frank...

                                 FRANK
                        It’s gonna be okay, Pam. We’ll get 
                        you home to your family soon.

           He looks her in the eyes.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You’ve done a lot for this school, 
                        Pam. The board knows that. They’re 
                        willing to see this incident for 
                        what it is -- a lapse in judgment.

           Pam nods.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        In light of that, they’ve opted not 
                        to press charges or notify police.

                                 PAM
                        Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        You’ll make full restitution, at 
                        the sum of two hundred and fifty 
                        thousand dollars.

                                 PAM
                        Two fifty? Absolutely. Full 
                        restitution, of course.

                                 FRANK
                        You’ll finish out the work week, 
                        and then you’ll resign quietly.

                                 PAM
                        What?

                                 FRANK
                        On Friday you’ll surrender your 
                        administrator’s license. You’ll 
                        sign a confidentiality form--

                                 PAM
                        Frank.

           Frank stops.
                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Frank, what’s happening?

           She looks at him.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Frank, I don’t understand what’s 
                        happening. Why are you--?

                                 FRANK
                        You stole from the schools, Pam. 
                        From the kids. This behavior, it 
                        stretches beyond the bounds of 
                        immoral. It’s heinous, and very 
                        likely indicative of sociopathy.

                                 PAM
                        Sociopathy? What--?

                                 FRANK
                        The shameless self-interest, the 
                        unstable personality, the parade 
                        of... of rotten marriages...

                                 PAM
                             (pleading)
                        Frank.

           Frank averts his gaze. Bill speaks up.

                                 BIG BILL
                        You need help, Pam. Real medical 
                        help. You’re a sick woman.

                                 JUDY ROTHMAN
                        We’re very concerned about you.

           Frank gives her a short, knowing nod. This is the way it has 
           to be. Pam swallows her pride.

                                 PAM
                        I-- I’m a sick woman.

           She chokes on her words.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        I’m ashamed of myself. I’m ashamed 
                        of my actions. There’s no excuse 
                        for what I did.

                                 BIG BILL
                        Well, the sociopathy.

           Pam flinches.
                                 PAM
                        Right.

                                 FRANK
                        Pam, before you go I think it’s 
                        important for us to recognize the 
                        board’s extraordinary compassion.

                                 PAM
                        Thank you, Frank. Thank you, 
                        everyone. Judy. Bill.

                                 BIG BILL
                        Get better, Pam. We all, y’know, we 
                        all care about you.

           Bill shows Pam the door.

                                 FRANK
                        We’ll make all the arrangements 
                        first thing tomorrow morning.

                                 PAM
                        Sure. Yeah. Good night, all.

           She staggers out of the room.

           Frank exhales. Bill gives him a pat on the back.

                                 BIG BILL
                        You saved us tonight, Frank. Go 
                        home and get some sleep.

           INT. FRANK’S CAR - NIGHT

           Frank drives home. The highway’s clear.

           His phone chirps. Incoming call from PAM.

           Frank pulls over to the side of the road. Kills the engine.

           He stares at the phone. Flips it open. Doesn’t speak.

                                 PAM (O.S.)
                        Frank? Frank, I know you’re there. 
                        I need you to tell me everything’s 
                        okay. I’ll never say a goddamn word 
                        to anyone. They’ll never know--

           He hangs up.

           He starts his car.
           INT. BEDROOM - FRANK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Frank joins Steve in bed.

                                 STEVE
                        How was your day?

                                 FRANK
                        Great.

           Steve embraces him.

                                 STEVE
                        I missed you.

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah. I missed you too.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - PAM’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Pam returns home. Henry and Debbie are waiting for her.

                                 PAM
                        Where is he?

           She pushes past them. Henry tries to stop her.

                                 HENRY
                        Pam.

                                 PAM
                        He’s in his bedroom, isn’t he? He’s 
                        in his bedroom. Don’t touch me--!

           John Boy slinks out of his room. He smiles sadly.

                                 JOHN BOY
                        Hi ma.

                                 PAM
                        Hi ma. Hi ma.

           Pam LUNGES FOR HIM.

           Henry and Debbie HOLD HER BACK.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        You moron! You dumb moron!

                                 JOHN BOY
                        Ma, stop screaming. Ma...
                                 PAM
                        You’re just like your father! Get 
                        the hell out of my house! I don’t 
                        want you living here anymore--!

           John Boy’s eyes start to pool.

                                 JOHN BOY
                        You’re scaring me...

                                 HENRY
                        Stop it, Pam. You don’t mean any of 
                        that. We love you, Johnny Boy.

           Amber, Pam’s daughter, surfaces from her bedroom in pajamas.

                                 AMBER
                        What’s going on?

                                 PAM
                        What’s going on is John Boy fucked 
                        my entire career, this family’s 
                        livelihood. Because he’s a moron!

                                 HENRY
                        Your mother lost her job today.

                                 AMBER
                        Oh. So you can go to a different 
                        school, can’t you?

                                 PAM
                        They’re taking away my license.

                                 AMBER
                        Why? They can’t do that. They can’t 
                        take your license, unless...

           The room falls silent, save for John Boy’s sniffles.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Mom. What did you do?

                                 PAM
                        I took money from them.

                                 AMBER
                        You what?

                                 PAM
                        I stole. We all did.

                                 AMBER
                        Who did?
                                 HENRY
                        I’m gonna go walk the dogs--

           Pam shoots him a glare. He stays put.

                                 PAM
                             (to Amber)
                        Your car. Your clothes. This house. 
                        The other houses... the trips... 
                        your college tuition...

           Amber’s eyes widen.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        You could’ve gone to state school. 
                        But you didn’t want that. I just 
                        wanted... I just wanted you to be 
                        happy with me...

                                 AMBER
                        Mom.

                                 HENRY
                        It’s okay, honey. We’ll get you a 
                        job at the dealership. We need a 
                        new girl at the front desk anyways.

                                 PAM
                        You mean like a secretary?

                                 AMBER
                        Mom.

                                 JOHN BOY
                        Ma...

                                 HENRY
                        We’ll find something. I’m just 
                        saying we’ll work it out.

                                 PAM
                        I have degrees. I have multiple 
                        degrees in... in education...

                                 AMBER
                        I’m gonna be sick.

                                 HENRY
                        We’ll get through this, Pam. You’re 
                        the smartest woman I know. You’re 
                        gonna land right side up.

                                 AMBER
                        I’m really gonna be sick.
           Amber rushes to the bathroom. We hear her HURL.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I’ll take care of her.

           Debbie follows after Amber. Henry guides Pam to the couch, 
           shrouds her in a quiet embrace.

                                 PAM
                        Thank you, Henry.

                                 JOHN BOY
                        Ma?

           John Boy manifests in their sight, casting a long shadow.

                                 PAM
                        Yeah, John?

                                 JOHN BOY
                        What you were saying before... you 
                        don’t really hate me, do you?

                                 PAM
                        No. No, of course not. Come sit 
                        over here with me.

           John Boy does so.

           Pam puts her arm around him.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry I yelled.

           Debbie returns with Amber. Amber looks very pale.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        I still get to finish out the week. 
                        If there’s any odds or ends that 
                        need settling...

           She looks to Debbie.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        We’ll be fine. There’s nothing for 
                        us to worry about.

           INT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Rachel appears before Pam, a smile on her face.
                                 RACHEL
                        Hi Mrs. Gluckin. I was wondering if 
                        you had all the individual purchase 
                        orders for 1999 through 2002 handy.

           Pam stares at Rachel. She twitches.

           Rachel doesn’t get the hint.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Gluckin? I saw an expense for 
                        a pizza oven and I spoke with Paula 
                        in the cafeteria but she said they 
                        didn’t know about any pizza ovens--

                                 PAM
                        Rachel.

                                 RACHEL
                        Yes?

                                 PAM
                        Rachel, if I were to pick up my 
                        phone and call Nik Aggarwal at the 
                        Beacon, would he confirm that he 
                        assigned you this story?

                                 RACHEL
                        No. I mean, not strictly speaking.

                                 PAM
                        Maybe even generally speaking too?

           Rachel doesn’t break eye contact.

                                 RACHEL
                        Maybe.

                                 PAM
                        Yeah. I hate to burst your bubble, 
                        but whatever it is you think you’re 
                        looking for, you’re gonna come up 
                        short. No one’s hiding anything.

           She shuffles papers absently on her desk.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        On the contrary, we show up here 
                        every morning, day in and day out, 
                        because we care about providing you 
                        with a proper, quality education. 
                        Because we’re nice people.

           Pam smiles, perhaps a little too wide.
                                 RACHEL
                        I know. But I’d still like to see 
                        the purchase orders.

                                 PAM
                        Well, you can’t. Because I’m tired, 
                        and my feet are sore, and I have a 
                        lot more work to do today.
                             (a pause)
                        Also, that pizza oven never went to 
                        the high school. Because we ordered 
                        it for the middle school. They’ve 
                        got pizzas for days down there.

           Rachel processes this. She backs off.

           Pam catches sight of Frank as he strolls into his office. She 
           gets up from her chair, follows him inside.

           INT. FRANK’S OFFICE - CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - CONTINUOUS

           Frank settles in at his desk. He proceeds with his morning 
           routine, neglecting to acknowledge Pam’s presence.

                                 PAM
                        So that’s how it’s gonna be, huh?

                                 FRANK
                        I’m not sure I know what you’re 
                        referring to, Mrs. Gluckin.

                                 PAM
                        Fuck you, Frank.

           Frank looks up at her.

                                 FRANK
                        I did what I could to protect you.

                                 PAM
                        You fired me. Shamed me. Dragged me 
                        through the mud. Ignored my calls.

                                 FRANK
                        I saved you and your son from a 
                        life in prison. And you still get 
                        your pension and health benefits, 
                        more than you deserve.

                                 PAM
                        You’re gonna sit there and pass 
                        judgment on me? 
                                 (MORE)

                        Frank Tassone, the beloved 
                        educator, nobly dedicating himself 
                        to the children...

           She shakes her head.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        They think I’m so bad? Just wait 
                        until they get a load of their 
                        superintendent.

                                 FRANK
                        I have nothing to hide.

                                 PAM
                        You have everything to hide.

                                 FRANK
                        How I conduct my personal life is 
                        nobody’s business but my own. It 
                        doesn’t affect the work I do for 
                        this school district.

                                 PAM
                        We both know that’s not what I’m 
                        talking about.

           They lock eyes.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        I see right through you. I always 
                        have. Necessary and proper, my ass.

           Frank passes a form across the table.

                                 FRANK
                        Your exit interview. Please answer 
                        these as honestly as possible.

                                 PAM
                        Oh. That’s a nice touch.

           She grabs the paper.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        If I’m the sociopath, I shudder to 
                        think what that makes you.

                                 FRANK
                        Hey, if you could send Debra Rigano 
                        in on your way out that’d be great.

           Pam’s face falls.
                                 PAM
                        You wouldn’t.

                                 FRANK
                        Take care, Pam. Best of luck.

           He motions to the door.

           INT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Pam returns to her workstation.

           She pulls a key that hangs from her neck, on the same chain 
           as her ID badge. Unlocks the bottom drawer of her desk. 

           There’s a slim blue binder marked WORDPOWER TECH. It looks as 
           though it’s never been touched.

           Pam thinks for a moment.

           She extracts the binder. Packs it in her bag.

           INT. FRANK’S OFFICE - CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Debbie sits across from Frank, wringing her hands nervously.

                                 DEBBIE
                        You’re reassigning me?

                                 FRANK
                        We could really use your expertise 
                        down in special utilities. I think 
                        it’ll be a much better fit.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Yeah. Yeah, but y’know, I thought I 
                        was a pretty good fit up here.

                                 FRANK
                        We’re doing some shuffling. Trying 
                        some things out. It’s very routine.

                                 DEBBIE
                        What about Pam’s old job? Like, as 
                        a business manager? Maybe, y’know, 
                        maybe I’d be right for that...

                                 FRANK
                        Actually, we have Andrew Miller 
                        stepping in as interim manager--
                                 DEBBIE
                        Andy the auditor?

                                 FRANK
                        --until we’re able to find a more 
                        appropriate replacement for Pam. 
                        He’s very qualified.

           Debbie shifts her weight in the chair.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I think I should-- I think I might 
                        wanna-- you know, there’s a couple 
                        things I know about--

                                 FRANK
                        Hold on. Sorry to interrupt you. 
                        It’s just, I wanted to compliment 
                        you on your necklace. That’s really 
                        very pretty. It matches your eyes.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Thanks.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s new, isn’t it? I don’t think 
                        I’ve seen you wear it around here 
                        before. I’ve got a pretty good eye 
                        for these kinds of things.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Yeah. It’s new.

                                 FRANK
                        You get it from Lord & Taylor? Or 
                        was that one from Macy’s?

           Debbie TENSES.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Special utilities?

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah, I think so. Thanks Debra.

                        What the fuck, Kellogg? I just got

           He reaches out, grabs a hold of her backpack -- and it TEARS 
           OPEN AT THE SEAMS. Papers GO FLYING.

                        Great. I was gonna quit your shitty 
                        newspaper anyway.

           Nik gets to his feet.

           She stops. Looks up at him.

                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah.

           He’s impressed. Proud.
                                 DAVID
                        Listen, Rach. I know I haven’t been 
                        the best these past few years. But 
                        I want you to know that I-- I’m--

           He takes a closer look.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        They spent over a million dollars 
                        on lab supplies?

                                 RACHEL
                        No. That’s just Sargent-Welch.

                                 DAVID
                        That can’t be right... Have you 
                        tried calling them to verify?

                                 RACHEL
                        You can do that?

           David smirks.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh yeah.

           INT. DOORWAY - PAM’S HOUSE - DAY

           The doorbell chimes.

                                 AMBER (O.S.)
                        I’ll get it!

           Amber rushes into view. She unlocks the door.

           A MAN IN A PINSTRIPE SUIT stands at the porch, a cluster of 
           balloons in his hand. He instantly breaks out into song:

                                 PINSTRIPE MAN
                        Hey Pam. We at custodial heard 
                        you’re feeling blue, so we asked 
                        our friend to sing an extra-special 
                        song for you--!

                                 AMBER
                        What the fuck?

           The man’s smile fades.

                                 PINSTRIPE MAN
                        Are you not Pam Gluckin?
                                 AMBER
                        No, I’m her daughter.

                                 PINSTRIPE MAN
                        Is she home? I’ve got an extra-
                        special song addressed to her.

                                 AMBER
                        I’m calling the police.

           She moves to close the door.

                                 PINSTRIPE MAN
                        Wait! I’m Tony Treble, her singing 
                        telegram. I was hired to deliver a 
                        get-well-soon greeting.

                                 AMBER
                        But my mom’s not sick.

                                 PINSTRIPE MAN
                        They said she had stage four 
                        ovarian cancer.

                                 AMBER
                        What?

                                 PINSTRIPE MAN
                        If she doesn’t have cancer, then 
                        what’s all this?

           He steps aside to reveal a seemingly interminable array of 
           get-well-soon kitsch cluttering the porch.

           Amber’s mouth drops.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - PAM’S HOUSE - DAY

           The house has been overtaken with sympathy baskets and 
           flowers. The phone’s ringing off the hook. Total mania.

           Pam weaves past Henry, who wrestles an oversized stuffed 
           bunny through the door. She picks up the phone.

                                 PAM
                        Yes, this is she... No thank you. 
                        Please don’t call here again.

           She hangs up.
                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        They want to donate the proceeds of 
                        the fashion show to pay for my 
                        medical expenses.

           She turns to John Boy, who picks at an elaborate edible 
           arrangement. Slaps the food from his hand.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Don’t touch anything. We’re sending 
                        it all back.

                                 JOHN BOY
                        Can’t we keep the macaroons?

                                 PAM
                        Those macaroons belong to cancer 
                        victims and their families. Not us.

           She takes a deep breath.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck did Frank tell them?

           INT. HALLWAY - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Nik snaps the plastic bindings off a freshly printed batch of 
           Hilltop Beacon newspapers.

           The front page reads “ADMINISTRATOR RETIRES SUDDENLY DUE TO 
           SEVERE ILLNESS,” with a photo of Pam at a pie-eating contest.

           INT. MAIN OFFICE - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Bressler reads the paper, shaking his head. He consoles his 
           secretary, who dabs away tears with a Kleenex.

           Frank’s voice crackles from the loudspeaker.

                                 FRANK (O.S.)
                        We wish Pamela Gluckin a speedy 
                        recovery. May God be with her 
                        through this unthinkable trial.

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Frank pumps iron with the help of his physical trainer.

           He sprints on the treadmill. Steadfast. Determined.
           INT. AUDITORIUM - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Frank and Bill ring in the early-decision college acceptances 
           on a massive projector.

                                 BIG BILL
                        Cornell, five! Amherst, six!

           INT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Andy occupies Pam’s former cubicle, reconciling a stack of 
           crumpled petty cash receipts.

           Debbie clears out her belongings at the adjacent desk. She 
           hauls her boxes to the elevator. Presses the DOWN arrow.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           The office staff operates a de facto assembly line, preparing 
           holiday cards and candy canes for the Roslyn taxpayers.

           They stamp each card with Frank’s signature.

           INT. KITCHEN - RACHEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           David tosses Frank’s holiday card in the trash. He returns to 
           poring through the budgets with Rachel.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - PAM’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Pam’s extended family gathers for a Christmas Eve dinner, a 
           classic Bing Crosby noel drawling over the radio.

           John Boy barrels in dressed as Santa Claus. The kids go 
           apeshit, rush him with open arms.

           Pam watches in an ugly sweater, trying her best to smile.

           EXT. TOWER OF LONDON - DAY

           Frank tours the historic sight in an overcoat and scarf.

           He pauses to admire a majestic view of the Thames and the 
           sprawling London Bridge. Breathes in the cool winter air.

           A younger man appears beside him, nestles his head into 
           Frank’s. He looks up at him -- it’s JASON.

           Frank returns his gaze, smiling softly.
           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - HENDERSON, NEVADA - DAY

           Frank plucks the FOR SALE sign from its stake on the lawn.

           He and Jason pose for a photograph in front of their quaint 
           new home. The Las Vegas skyline looms on the horizon.

           INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Rachel confronts the chairman of the science department with 
           the budget spreadsheets.

           She points out the lab supplies charge from Sargent-Welch. He 
           furrows his brow, visibly perplexed.

           INT. STAFF ROOM - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Rachel brings the custodians a fresh batch of Krispy Kreme 
           doughnuts. They eat them up happily.

           She asks about materials expenses. They shake their heads.

           INT. LIBRARY - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Mrs. Dwyer breaks out in a guttural cackle as she reads the 
           various library charges. She nearly falls off her chair.

           INT. KITCHEN - RACHEL’S HOUSE - DAY

           David sits at the kitchen counter, examining a list of 
           district vendors and their accumulated charges.

           He flips open the phone book. Places a call.

                                 DAVID
                        Good afternoon. Is this Champion 
                        Products in Uniondale--?

           He gets the info he needs. Checks the vendor off his list.

           EXT. HALLWAY - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Lombardo spots Rachel heading his way.

                                 RACHEL
                        Mr. Lombardo! Mr. Lombardo--!

           He turns and hustles in the opposite direction.
           INT. KITCHEN - RACHEL’S HOUSE - DAY

           David works his way down the list of vendors.

           He reaches HSG MANAGEMENT CONSULTING, a company paid a total 
           of $78,347 over the course of eighteen months.

           INT. HENRY’S OFFICE - CAR DEALERSHIP - DAY

           Henry’s landline rings. He picks up.

                                 HENRY
                        Chevy Bellmore, this is Henry.

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        I think I have the wrong number. 
                        I’m looking for HSG Consulting...

           Henry lights up. He doesn’t get many of these calls.

                                 HENRY
                        Hey yeah, sure! This is Henry S. 
                        Gluckin, chief executive officer of 
                        HSG. How can I assist you today 
                        with your consulting needs?

           A pause on the other end.

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        Did you just say Gluckin?

                                 HENRY
                        That’s correct.

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        As in, Pam Gluckin?

           Henry’s face falls.

                                 DAVID (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hey Henry, are you aware of a 
                        seventy thousand dollar charge to 
                        the Roslyn school district--?

           Henry hangs up. Breathing heavily.

                                 HENRY
                        Fuck. Oh fuck.

           The phone rings again. He’s startled by the shrill sound.

           He stares anxiously at the blinking red light.
           INT. KITCHEN - RACHEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Rachel and David go over the vendor list together. Most line 
           items have either been checked off or marked in red.

                                 DAVID
                        I tried WordPower Tech, but the 
                        number’s been disconnected.

           He draws Rachel’s attention to a vendor near the bottom of 
           his list, circled twice and bordered in question marks:

                                WORDPOWER TECH -- $803,570

           Rachel’s eyes stay fixed on the text.

                                 RACHEL
                        Nobody I’ve spoken to has any idea 
                        who they are or what services, if 
                        any, they’ve rendered.

                                 DAVID
                        I did some digging online. They’re 
                        a one-man operation, as far as I 
                        can tell. Have you heard the name 
                        Stephen Signorelli before?

                                 RACHEL
                        No. No, I don’t think so.

                                 DAVID
                        I also found an address. A place in 
                        the city. Upper East Side.

           INT. LIRR TRAIN - DAY

           Rachel takes the train into Manhattan.

           INT. BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

           Rachel stands outside a closed door at the end of a long 
           hallway. She checks the address. It’s a match.

           She knocks on the door. Waits.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Hold your horses, I’m coming.

           The door opens... It’s STEVE, clad in a grey bathrobe.
                                 STEVE
                        Sorry, you caught me in the shower. 
                        I guess I’ll have two of the thin 
                        mints and two of the do-si-dos.

           He fishes a few bills from his wallet. Looks up at Rachel, 
           sees she doesn’t process his meaning. His smile dissolves.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        It’s not cookie season, is it?

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m not sure. I’m here to see 
                        Stephen Signorelli.

                                 STEVE
                        It’s pronounced Seen-yor-elli, but 
                        yeah, you’ve got him.

                                 RACHEL
                        I’d like to ask you a few questions 
                        about your company WordPower.

           Steve’s face turns to stone. He reaches for the doorknob.

                                 STEVE
                        WordPower’s closed.

           He shuts the door on her.

           Rachel arches an eyebrow. She retreats back down the hall, 
           making her way toward the elevator bank.

           She passes a man in gym clothes, a fresh bag of dry cleaning 
           slung over his shoulder. They nod politely to one another... 

           It’s FRANK.

           He doesn’t recognize her. Not immediately.

           Rachel rounds the corner. She watches as Frank stops at an 
           apartment door... the same apartment she just left.

           Frank thinks. He looks back in the direction Rachel headed.

           Rachel withdraws her head from view.

           Frank doesn’t see her. He shrugs it off. Twists his key in 
           the lock, opens the door. Disappears inside.

           INT. FRANK’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Frank sees Steve on the phone. Steve hangs up instantly.
                                 STEVE
                        You’re home.

                                 FRANK
                        What’s wrong?

                                 STEVE
                        Is she still out there?

                                 FRANK
                        What are you talking about?

                                 STEVE
                        Frank. She asked about WordPower.

           Frank’s eyes widen.

           He drops his dry cleaning. Races to the elevator bank, just 
           in time to see Rachel VANISH BEHIND the SLIDING DOORS...

           He heads for the stairwell.

           INT. STAIRWELL - FRANK’S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Frank charges down the stairs, two at a time.

                                 FRANK
                        Come on. Come on.

           INT. LOBBY - FRANK’S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Frank rushes into the lobby.

           Rachel’s nowhere to be found. Frank pivots to the doorman.

                                 FRANK
                        Did you see a girl--?

                                 DOORMAN
                        You just missed her.

           The doorman points. Frank whisks around, sees the revolving 
           door’s glass partitions swinging...

           He barrels out after her.

           EXT. FRANK’S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Frank emerges onto the street. He nearly collides with a 
           jogging pedestrian, apologizes quickly.
           He does a full three-sixty. No sign of Rachel.

                                 FRANK
                        Fuck--!

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

           Rachel watches from an alleyway across the street.

           She catches her breath, her mind running a million miles a 
           minute -- what the fuck did I just see?

           EXT. BIG BILL’S HOUSE - DAY

           Bill finishes walking his dog. He emits a protracted yawn, 
           reaches a hand into his mailbox.

           He finds a lone blue envelope, his address scrawled on the 
           front in sloppy handwriting.

           Just as he starts to rip it open... His home phone rings from 
           inside the house. His cell phone. His wife’s cell phone. A 
           discordant symphony of beeps, chimes and jingles.

           Across the street, Judy Rothman steps out from her own home. 
           A matching blue envelope in her hand, already torn open.

           They make eye contact.

           INT. FRANK’S OFFICE - CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           The board crowds around Frank as he reads the letter. Each 
           member holds a butchered blue envelope.

                                 FRANK
                        “We believe Dr. Frank Tassone and 
                        Pamela Gluckin participated in an 
                        embezzlement scandal so as to 
                        support their lavish lifestyles--”

           He sets down the letter.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        This doesn’t make any sense. It’s 
                        barely even proper English.

                                 JUDY ROTHMAN
                        We each got one. All seven of us.
                                 FRANK
                        It’s ludicrous. I’d hardly describe 
                        my lifestyle as lavish-- are they 
                        referring to my car allowance?

                                 BIG BILL
                        Who’s this “we,” anyway? I don’t 
                        get it. An anonymous letter...

                        Whoever it is, or they are, they’re 
                        on the money about Pam Gluckin.

                                 FRANK
                        The only people that knew about 
                        that are standing in this room.

           The board exchanges a series of paranoid looks.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        We can’t waste our time pointing 
                        fingers. Who else got one of these?

                                 BIG BILL
                        The mayor. A few trustees.

                                 FRANK
                        Okay. I’ll call them all myself, 
                        explain the situation.

                                 JUDY ROTHMAN
                        And what is the situation, Frank?

                                 FRANK
                        This is clearly a smear campaign 
                        designed to sabotage the school’s 
                        credibility before the budget vote.

                                 BIG BILL
                        Who the hell would do that?

                                 FRANK

                        Like Great Neck?

                                 FRANK
                        Maybe. Who knows? If that budget 
                        doesn’t pass, we’re screwed.
                                 JUDY ROTHMAN
                        Are we even going to consider the 
                        implications of what this letter 
                        says? If the crime goes beyond Pam, 
                        extends to other administrators...

                                 FRANK
                        You mean me.

           Judy takes a beat.

                                 JUDY ROTHMAN
                        Yes.

           Whispers and glances abound among the board.

                                 BIG BILL
                        No. Hell no. As our president, I’m 
                        putting my foot down. This is Frank 
                        Tassone we’re talking about here. 
                        The man’s reputation is nothing 
                        less than sterling in this town, 
                        and for damned good reason.

           His peers agree. Judy shrinks.

                                 FRANK
                        Thank you, Bill. The board’s vote 
                        of confidence is essential.

           He turns to face the rest of the board.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        The culprit of this cruel prank 
                        will be identified.

                                 BIG BILL
                        When I get done with them, they’ll 
                        wish they’d never owned a pen.

           He balls up the letter, pitches it into the trash.

           INT. HALLWAY - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT

           Drip. Drip. Drip.

           Rainwater trickles idly from the ceiling, landing in the 
           buckets below. The impact echoes through the desolate hall.

           Rachel walks past, sidestepping an unattended puddle.

                                 FRANK (O.S.)
                        It’s past school hours.
           She looks up, startled.

           We see Frank’s silhouette at the end of the hallway, leaning 
           against the brick wall.

                                 RACHEL
                        Sorry. I lost track of time.

           Frank approaches her.

                                 FRANK
                        Who else got one of your letters?

                                 RACHEL
                        What?

                                 FRANK
                        I’ve already spoken with the board, 
                        and the mayor, and all the others 
                        at town hall. Can you remember if 
                        there was anybody else--?

                                 RACHEL
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about. What letter?

                                 FRANK
                        Last weekend you showed up at my 
                        home unannounced. You invaded my 
                        privacy, Rachel. Accosted my 
                        roommate, my--

           Frank bites his lip. He composes himself.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Whatever it is you know about me, 
                        or think you know-- these rumors 
                        have to stop. They have to stop 
                        before someone gets hurt. Before 
                        our school is harmed beyond repair.

           Rachel doesn’t respond.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s not in your nature to 
                        trust people like me. That you’re 
                        angry, and afraid-- afraid of being 
                        burned again by a system that has 
                        no regard for you. For your family.

           She meets his gaze.
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I’m not like them. Can’t you see 
                        that? I’m not some evil, faceless, 
                        money-hungry CEO. I’m a teacher, 
                        for Christ’s sake. All I’ve ever 
                        cared about is my students, and 
                        providing them the best possible--

                                 RACHEL
                        Why are the ceilings still leaking?

                                 FRANK
                        I’m trying to tell you-- will you 
                        just let me talk--?

                                 RACHEL
                        You said they’d stop...

                                 FRANK
                        Enough about the fucking ceilings!

           An uncomfortable silence, punctuated by the drips.

           Frank looks mortified. He retreats slowly.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I’m a good person.

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m sorry.
                             (a pause)
                        I never wrote any letters.

           She exits, leaving Frank alone in the empty hallway.

           INT. FRANK’S OFFICE - CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - NIGHT

           The elderly night custodian from earlier clears out Frank’s 
           trash can. He happens upon a crumpled sheet of paper.

           It’s Bill’s discarded copy of the letter.

           INT. HALLWAY - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Rachel twists open her locker.

           Inside she finds THE LETTER, crinkled and coffee-stained. 
           Scrawled on the backside is a note:

                               THANKS FOR THE KRISPY KREME.
           EXT. BIG BILL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Bill answers the doorbell. Rachel’s standing on the front 
           porch, David beside her.

                                 BIG BILL
                        Can I help you?

           Rachel hands Bill the letter. Bill deflates.

                                 BIG BILL (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. Just my luck.

           INT. BEACON OFFICE - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           The Beacon editors read over Rachel’s article, along with the 
           anonymous letter. Nik paces behind them.

                                 FIRST EDITOR (SCOTT)
                        This is all real?

                        I’m friends with Jess, the mayor’s 
                        daughter, and she overheard her dad

                        Bressler will never go for it. Not 
                        to mention Tassone...

                                 FIRST EDITOR (SCOTT)
                        If they try and censor us, I’ll pay 
                        for the print cost myself. It’ll be 
                        a nice topic for my college essay.

           Nik emerges from the next classroom over. He catches up to 
           Rachel, breathing quickly. They walk down the hall together.

                                 NIK
                        Okay, no need to panic. We have to

                        never expel us, I don’t think--

           Bressler blocks the exit. He’s drenched in sweat.

                        It’s not true, is it? You made it 
                        up, it can’t possibly-- I would’ve--

                        Keep walking, Nik.

           She guides Nik through the door, eyes fixed straight ahead. 
           Nik casts a quick glance behind at the agitated principal.

           Rachel and Nik sit across from Frank, who surveys the Beacon 
           copy with a face of stone.

           Frank reaches for his pen. Uncaps it with a short CLICK.

           Nik watches him, terrified. Rachel doesn’t react.
           Frank scribbles a small note in the margins. Underlines a 
           word. Circles another.

           He hands the copy back to Rachel.

                        You use the passive voice in the 
                        second paragraph. It should read 
                        “the letter alleges” rather than 
                        “is alleged by the letter.” There’s 
                        also a misplaced comma in the final 
                        paragraph, and that photo should 
                        have a proper caption.

           An awkward silence hangs over the room.

                                 NIK
                        You’re not mad?

                                 FRANK
                        I can’t block you from exercising 
                        your First Amendment rights.

                                 NIK
                        But--

                                 FRANK
                        How I feel about it is immaterial, 
                        Mr. Aggarwal. I can only add that 
                        the district is taking steps to 
                        investigate each and every claim in 
                        the letter, and that until we have 
                        more information it should only be 
                        viewed as hearsay.

                                 RACHEL
                        Would you care to comment on the 
                        allegations about you specifically?

                                 FRANK
                        Would I care to--? No, they’re 
                        completely ridiculous. That’s 
                        really all I have for now.

           Rachel and Nik get up to leave.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Rachel, would you mind sticking 
                        around a minute?

           Rachel sits back down. Nik gives her a look, exits.

           Frank waits for the door to close fully before continuing.
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I need you to know that if you did 
                        in fact write this letter, you’d be 
                        breaching journalistic ethics to 
                        report on its validity. That’s very 
                        serious. It’s the kind of thing we 
                        have to tell colleges about.

                                 RACHEL
                        I didn’t write the letter.

                                 FRANK
                        I felt I’d be remiss if I didn’t at 
                        least issue the warning.

                                 RACHEL
                        Thanks, Dr. Tassone.

           She exits.

           INT. HALLWAY - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Nik deposits three separate stacks on the windowsill.

           The front page of The Hilltop Beacon reads “MYSTERY LETTER 
           ACCUSES TOP ADMINISTRATORS OF MISALLOCATING FUNDS.”

           The bell rings. Students pour out into the hallway. They 
           coast past on their way to next period, ignoring the papers.

           Finally -- a disembodied hand enters into frame, fishing a 
           copy off the top of the first stack. Another hand appears, 
           does the same. Then another. Then another.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT

           Frank faces an influx of concerned parents, some wielding 
           copies of the Beacon. Talking over one another all at once.

           The school board stands at his side, shifting anxiously.

                                 FIRST PARENT
                        Why are we hearing about this from 
                        our children and not you?

                                 SECOND PARENT
                        What did you do with Pam Gluckin?

                                 FRANK
                        Nobody did anything with Pam. Pam’s 
                        very ill. I’m afraid we don’t have 
                        too much to share right now. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                        All I can really say is that our 
                        auditor is conducting a full 
                        investigation--

                                 THIRD PARENT
                        Where the hell’s our money?

           This sparks an uproar. The board gives Frank a look.

           He leans into the microphone.

                                 FRANK
                        The school has taken very good care 
                        of every cent it’s been given and 
                        will continue to do so. Sit tight, 
                        we’ll have more information soon.

           Frank cedes the podium to Bill.

                                 BIG BILL
                        Yes we will. And in the meantime, 
                        please remember to check “yes” on 
                        the May 12th budget vote!

           A round of renewed protests.

           INT. FRANK’S OFFICE - CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - NIGHT

           Andy enters Frank’s office, a mess of papers in hand.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m finding more irregularities by 
                        the hour. Nonsensical charges, 
                        illegitimate vendors... This isn’t 
                        just a matter of two hundred and 
                        fifty thousand dollars. It could 
                        very well be over a million.

                                 FRANK
                        And?

           Andy doesn’t know how to react.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        My hands are tied until we have a 
                        concrete number. Do your job, Andy.

                                 ANDY
                        I got a call from Hevesi today.

                                 FRANK
                        The state comptroller?
                                 ANDY
                        You said he’d never call.

                                 FRANK
                        Hm. Well, I suppose there’s a first 
                        time for everything.

           Frank returns to his work.

                                 ANDY
                        There’s something else.

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah, what’s that?

                                 ANDY
                        A flight to London, billed to the 
                        school. Five thousand dollars each 
                        way. First class. Concorde jet.

                                 FRANK
                        You know my contract permits me to 
                        travel to Europe once a year to 
                        represent Roslyn at global forums.

                                 ANDY
                        But they charged us for two seats.

           Frank stops.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        I figured it was a mistake, but 
                        then I called the airline. We paid 
                        for two passengers, sitting side by 
                        side in first class. That’s twenty 
                        thousand dollars total.

           Andy stiffens.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Frank, who’s Jason DiMarco?

           Frank glares up at him.

                                 FRANK
                        I can’t believe this. You have the 
                        nerve to walk into my office and 
                        question my integrity-- this coming 
                        from the man who spent the past six 
                        months falsifying our records to 
                        cover up his own incompetence--

                                 ANDY
                        What? I didn’t...
                                 FRANK
                        Oh, don’t feed me that crap. I’m 
                        onto you, Andy. Don’t pretend for 
                        one second that you’re not just as 
                        guilty as Pam Gluckin. So again, 
                        I’ll ask you to please nut up and 
                        do your fucking job before I call 
                        Hevesi myself and let him know you 
                        were busy doing community theater 
                        while Pam robbed us blind.

           He collects himself.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Was there anything else, or...?

                                 ANDY
                        No. Sorry for barging in.

           Andy shuffles out.

           INT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - NIGHT

           Andy stares at Frank’s closed door. The light still on.

           INT. ANDY’S CAR - NIGHT

           Andy places a call on his cell.

                                 BIG BILL (O.S.)
                        For fuck’s sake, Andy. Do you know 
                        what time it is?

                                 ANDY
                        It’s about Frank.

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Bill confers with Frank under the bleachers.

                                 BIG BILL
                        We paid for your dry cleaning.

                                 FRANK
                        In my employment contract you’ll 
                        find there’s a clause about 
                        necessary and proper expenses.

                                 BIG BILL
                        I know that. I wrote your fucking 
                        employment contract.
                                 FRANK
                        Right. The board has always 
                        permitted me my discretion in 
                        determining what constitutes 
                        necessary and proper.

           Bill gets in close.

                                 BIG BILL
                        You racked up thirty thousand 
                        dollars in dry cleaning charges 
                        over the course of four years. 
                        Please explain to me how the hell 
                        that’s “necessary” by any stretch.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m the public face of this school 
                        district. It’s my responsibility to 
                        project an image of success, on 
                        behalf of the students.

                                 BIG BILL
                        Maybe we should have bought all 
                        your clothes too?

           Frank shrugs.

                                 FRANK
                        Well, that’s a matter of opinion.

                                 BIG BILL
                        I trusted you. I defended you. How 
                        can you be so blasé about this?

                                 FRANK
                        I haven’t done anything wrong! My 
                        contract clearly stipulates--

                                 BIG BILL
                        Fuck your contract. You need to 
                        tell me right now -- were you and 
                        Pam Gluckin in on this together?

                                 FRANK
                        Bill, you know me. We’re friends.

                                 BIG BILL
                        I’m really not so sure anymore.

           He takes a deep breath.
                                 BIG BILL (CONT’D)
                        This has gone way too far. I’m 
                        coming clean about last November. 
                        About how we handled Pam.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s absurd. The budget plan we 
                        slaved over for months would go 
                        belly-up in a heartbeat. The 
                        taxpayers, they’d never ever 
                        forgive us-- forgive the board--

                                 BIG BILL
                        So be it. Good luck to you, Frank. 
                        I’m gonna go find us a new lawyer.

           He turns to leave.

                                 FRANK
                        This isn’t right, Bill. You know 
                        it’s not right. After everything 
                        I’ve done for you and your family.

           Bill pauses.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I’m a smart guy, Bill. I could’ve 
                        been running a Fortune 500 company 
                        by now, riding around on my jet and 
                        laughing at all the suckers. But I 
                        wanted to help people. Okay, so I 
                        charged some dry cleaning. So what? 
                        Look at them! I work harder than 
                        all of them combined. I put my soul 
                        into this job-- for Christ’s sake, 
                        it’s fucking dry cleaning!

           Bill keeps walking. Frank gets out in front of him.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I can get Becca into Harvard.

           Bill sighs. He brushes past him.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I have the head of admissions on 
                        speed-dial, don’t think I don’t. I 
                        got us all the way to four, didn’t 
                        I? Four in the goddamn country, and 
                        you want to throw it all away like 
                        it’s-- like it’s just-- Bill. Bill?

           He’s all alone.
           EXT. QUANTUCK BAY - DAY

           Pam stands at the water’s edge, eyes fixed on the murky 
           horizon. There’s a cold front brewing.

           She pops a cigarette between her teeth. Brings the lighter up 
           to her mouth. Ignites. Takes a very long drag.

           Behind her, we hear the growing sound of POLICE SIRENS.

           Pam doesn’t flinch.

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

           Frank feeds quarters into the slot. Dials a number.

           Ring. Ring. Ring.

                                 JASON (O.S.)
                        This is Jason. Leave a message.

           A protracted BEEP.

                                 FRANK
                        Jace, it’s me. It’s Frank. I was 
                        thinking-- I’ve been thinking we 
                        might want to spend the summer 
                        together. In Nevada. And who knows, 
                        if that goes well, maybe I could 
                        stick around for even longer.

           He rubs his face with his hand. His wedding ring visible.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I’m scared this place is trying to 
                        swallow me whole. I feel like I 
                        could asphyxiate to death at any 
                        moment. And that maybe you’re the 
                        only one who can pull me back out 
                        again. I’d like to come to you now, 
                        if that’s okay. If you’ll have me. 
                        I really hope you’ll have me.

           EXT. ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           News vans swarm the roundabout. Local reporters and camera 
           crews loiter on the school’s front lawn.
           INT. HALLWAY - ROSLYN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Frank journeys across the school, dodging the crumbled 
           ceilings, rain buckets and unfinished construction.

           Students and faculty part, allowing him to pass. They all 
           stare at him quietly.

           INT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Frank strides into the building.

                                 FRANK
                        The high school’s falling apart. 
                        Mary Ann, try Jack Lombardo.

           Mary Ann pops up from her workstation.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Mr. Lombardo left the country.

                                 FRANK
                        He left the country.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Yes.

                                 FRANK
                        Okay. Well, do you know if he’s 
                        planning on returning anytime soon?

                                 MARY ANN
                        He didn’t say. But he did run out 
                        in kind of a hurry. And he also 
                        mentioned he couldn’t be reached.

           Frank chuckles to himself.

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah, I bet.

                                 MARY ANN
                        There’s another thing.

                                 FRANK
                        Right. The numbers came in, and my 
                        budget plan was rejected by an 
                        overwhelming majority.

                                 MARY ANN
                        How did you know?
                                 FRANK
                        Because I’m a fucking mind reader, 
                        Mary Ann. That’s how.

           His coarse tone draws the bullpen’s collective gaze. He feels 
           their eyes on him.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Just draft a press release, okay? 
                        We can still control this. We can 
                        still-- we can--

           He notices two nondescript men in suits, wholly unfamiliar, 
           sorting through papers at Andy’s old cubicle. Both wear 
           government ID badges.

           They don’t look at him. They don’t even notice him.

           INT. TOWN HALL - DAY

           Frank presides over a public forum. The place teems with 
           parents, taxpayers and reporters. Standing room only.

                                 FRANK
                        I can confirm that Pamela Gluckin 
                        has been placed under arrest, and 
                        that the school will be pressing 
                        criminal charges.

           The mob overpowers him with a litany of complaints, pleas, 
           questions and accusations.

           He exhales. Continues.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Your voices have been heard, loud 
                        and clear. We know that you’re 
                        upset. We know that you’re angry. 
                        But we cannot afford to hold our 
                        schools’ budget hostage-- to place 
                        a filibuster on education--

                                 FOURTH PARENT
                        How can we trust a board that lied 
                        to us about stolen funds?

                                 FIFTH PARENT
                        The budget’s obviously grossly 
                        inflated if she was able to make 
                        off with hundreds of thousands of 
                        dollars without anyone noticing!
                                 SIXTH PARENT
                        This is collusion! You all should 
                        resign immediately--!

           This is met with applause.

           Frank spots Judy Rothman and the other boardies, crouched in 
           near anonymity among the volatile crowd. They all look sick.

           Bill is nowhere to be found.

                                 FRANK
                        I’ll answer any and all questions 
                        after I’ve finished my statement--

                                 SEVENTH PARENT
                        How much was taken? Who else is 
                        involved--?

                                 EIGHTH PARENT
                        Where was the auditor? Where was 
                        the board treasurer--?

                                 NINTH PARENT
                        You keep changing your story. Why 
                        does Newsday know more about this 
                        than we do--?

           We go in TIGHT on FRANK.

           Eyes darting this way and that. Face going red.

           The parents’ shouting loses coherence altogether. Their 
           voices gradually WARPING into a long, piercing DRONE...

           Frank shuts his eyes. He retreats inward.

           The drone fades to nothingness. He listens to the pulse of 
           own heartbeat. Growing calmer... calmer...

           His heart stops.

           His eyes flicker open.

           All at once, the shouting RESUMES in FULL FORCE -- building 
           to a wild, incomprehensible CRESCENDO of TOTAL MADNESS --

                                 FRANK
                        Enough!

           His voice CUTS THROUGH as he BANGS HIS FIST on THE PODIUM.
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to listen to me! You 
                        are all going to listen to me--!

           The room quiets.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Okay. I’m ready to take your 
                        questions in an orderly, adult 
                        manner. Rhonda?

           He points to the nearest parent.

                                 TENTH PARENT (RHONDA)
                        When the school’s law firm advised 
                        the board to report on Pam Gluckin, 
                        did you purposely seek out a second 
                        legal opinion that would favor your 
                        own conclusion?

                                 FRANK
                        I-- I don’t--

           He sighs.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        How many of you ladies in here are 
                        lawyers?

           He’s met with a sea of hands.

           INT. FRANK’S OFFICE - CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Frank circulates his office, rounding up every valuable he 
           can find -- his most impressive diplomas and awards, stray 
           papers, the photo of him and Geraldo Rivera.

           He snaps open his briefcase. Shovels all the items inside 
           with effort. Forces the thing shut.

           We see the framed portrait of Frank’s young bride Joanne, 
           left behind on his desk.

           Frank reaches for his coat. Just as he’s about to make his 
           way out the door -- motherfucking CINDY SCHWEITZER bursts in.

                                 CINDY
                        Oh, Dr. Tassone. I’m so glad I 
                        caught you.

                                 FRANK
                        Miss Schweitzer, now’s really not 
                        the best time...
                                 CINDY
                        Please. We just need one minute.

                                 FRANK
                        We?

           Cindy’s son CHAD, 9, pokes out from behind his mother.

                                 CINDY
                        Chad has something he’d really like 
                        to say to you. Won’t you take a 
                        seat and hear him out?

                                 FRANK
                        Can it wait?

                                 CINDY
                        I’m afraid not.

           She indicates Frank’s chair. He begrudgingly sits down.

                                 FRANK
                        Yes, Chad?

           Chad removes a sheet of loose-leaf from his back pocket. He 
           gazes down at the words, the paper trembling in his grip.

                                 CHAD
                        Good afternoon Dr. Tassone. How was 
                        your weekend good I hope. I would 
                        like to talk to you today about the 
                        OMNI program that you are running.

           Frank blinks. He stares forward.

                                 CHAD (CONT’D)
                        I very much hope that you will 
                        consider me for this program. I 
                        believe that I am very bright and 
                        could benefit from learning thusly 
                        at an ack... ack... ackel...

                                 CINDY
                        Sound it out.

                                 CHAD
                        Ack... ackel... ackrelated...?

                                 FRANK
                             (teeth clenched)
                        Accelerated.
                                 CINDY
                        Thank you, Dr. Tassone. Did you 
                        hear what he said, Chad?

           Chad nods.

                                 CINDY (CONT’D)
                        Now start the sentence over.

                                 CHAD
                        Which?

           Cindy points. Chad squints.

                                 CHAD (CONT’D)
                        I’m-- I am-- I believe that I am 
                        very bright and could benefit from 
                        learning thusly at an... at an... 
                        acks... axel... axelrated...

           Frank looks like he’s about to pop a blood vessel.

                                 FRANK
                        Accelerated.

                                 CHAD
                        Arrelecated?

                                 FRANK
                        Accelerated.

                                 CHAD
                        Asselerated.

           Frank stands. He looms high over Chad.

                                 FRANK
                        Accelerated. Accelerated. Let’s say 
                        you’re stuck in a car that’s moving 
                        way too slow, so slow you might 
                        want to blow your friggin’ brains 
                        out all over the dash, so you go 
                        ahead and you accelerate. Say it 
                        with me now. Accelerate! I can’t 
                        hear you... Accelerate! Accelerate!

           He stops, catching his breath.

           Chad’s in tears. Cindy stares at Frank, horrified.

                                 CINDY
                        Dr. Tassone...?

           Frank thinks. He bolts out the door.
           EXT. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Frank retreats to his parking spot. He glances down the hill 
           at the high school, one final time.

           A small smile creeps out from the corners of his mouth. Till 
           he notices something odd in the distance... He looks closer.

           The SkyWalk project, half-completed, appears to TREMOR.

           Frank’s smile dissipates. He can’t tear his eyes away, can’t 
           help but watch in utter awe as IT ALL UNFOLDS --

           BOOM! The structure CAVES IN and COLLAPSES ENTIRELY, exposing 
           a flimsy core of cheap plastic and aluminum siding.

           Frank backs away. He scrambles into his car and peels out of 
           the lot with a sharp SCREECH.

           INT. AIRPORT - DAY

           Frank approaches the airline counter.

                                 FRANK
                        I’d like to buy a seat on the next 
                        flight to Las Vegas, Nevada.

                                 AIRLINE CLERK
                        Round-trip or one-way?

                                 FRANK
                        Oh, let’s plan on the latter.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY

           Pam sits across from the Nassau County district attorney and 
           two state’s investigators -- the same two men Frank saw 
           earlier sifting through files.

                                 D.A.
                        Two beachfront homes in Florida and 
                        the Hamptons. Five Yamaha jet-skis. 
                        Luxury cars. Vacations to Brazil, 
                        Puerto Rico and Hawaii. Jewelry. 
                        Artwork. Electronics. Dog food...

           Pam stares past them, impassive.

           INT. ANOTHER INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY

           We see John Boy in a very similar situation.
                                 D.A.
                        Thirty thousand dollars at six 
                        separate Home Depot stores...

           INT. YET ANOTHER INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY

           And, of course, Henry.

                                 D.A.
                        Seventy-eight thousand dollars in 
                        monthly installments to your 
                        company HSG Consulting...

                                 HENRY
                        Not my company.

                                 D.A.
                        Mr. Gluckin, your initials are HSG.

                                 HENRY
                        Do I really look like a consultant 
                        to you? I sell used cars. I’m the 
                        biggest schmuck you’ll ever meet.

           He lets out a nervous laugh. The investigators aren’t amused.

                                 D.A.
                        Moving right along...

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY

           Pam hasn’t moved.

                                 D.A.
                        I have some bad news for you, Pam. 
                        You’re going to prison for a very 
                        long time. But maybe it’s not too 
                        late for you to save your family.

           She flinches, briefly. Tempers herself.

                                 D.A. (CONT’D)
                        C’mon. Do you think John Boy will 
                        survive two days in state max? What 
                        about your husband? If you help us 
                        out, they walk. Light probation, 
                        maybe. Community service.

           Pam looks up at him.

                                 PAM
                        What do you want?
           INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT

           Frank lingers on the sidelines, hands in his pockets. He’s 
           out of sorts among the openly gay crowd.

           Jason hops up into the DJ booth, makes a request. A light 
           touch on the palm to seal the deal.

           The DJ nods, swaps out the record for another.

           A new song. A slight change of pace.

           It’s “Oh Me Oh My (I’m a Fool For You Baby)” by Lulu. Slow 
           and beautiful. And maybe a little jazzy too.

           Frank sees Jason. Jason sees Frank.

           He holds out a hand.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY

           Back on Pam.

                                 D.A.
                        We know you’re not the only ones 
                        involved. Most of the receipts are 
                        missing, but we’ve got a few ideas. 
                        If you can give us a not-so-gentle 
                        push in the right direction...

           She thinks.

           INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT

           Jason guides Frank to the heart of the dance floor. Frank 
           surveys the atmosphere, self-conscious.

           Jason pivots to face him. Rests a hand on his cheek.

           Frank closes his eyes. He exhales deeply.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - PAM’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Pam returns home. Henry and John Boy are waiting for her.

                                 JOHN BOY
                        Ma...?

           Pam ignores him. Walks upstairs.
           INT. BEDROOM - PAM’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Pam digs through the back of her closet.

           She finds what she needs.

           INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT

           Frank and Jason sway to the music.

           Jason’s a great dancer. Frank’s not so bad himself.

           The song continues to build.

           INT. BASEMENT - CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION - DAY

           Debbie’s stationed at the lone basement desk, fighting to 
           stay awake. Her nameplate reads “SPECIAL UTILITIES.”

           Suddenly, the elevator light flashes. Someone’s coming down.

           Debbie gets excited. She stands upright, eager to greet her 
           new visitors. Straightens her blouse and skirt.

           The elevator doors PART... Five cops SWARM IN.

           Debbie’s smile evaporates as the officers push her against 
           her desk, cuffing her wrists behind her back.

           EXT. ANDY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Andy’s ushered across his front lawn in cuffs, flanked by two 
           hard-faced cops. His family watches from the front porch.

           INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT

           The song reaches its peak.

           Frank gives Jason a playful twirl. Jason laughs.

           INT. FRANK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Steve sits by himself at the dining table.

           There’s a knock on the front door. Firm. Resolute.

           He takes a deep breath. Pours himself a shot of whiskey.
           INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT

           Frank leans his head on Jason’s shoulder.

           He whispers something in his ear as the song fades out.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY

                                 PAM
                        I have one more condition. I hope 
                        it won’t be a problem.

                                 D.A.
                        What’s that?

           A pause.

                                 PAM
                        I want him to suffer.

           INT. JASON’S CAR - NIGHT

           Frank and Jason drive back to their home.

           They spot the flashing blue and red lights directly ahead. 
           Blinding their vision.

           Jason looks past the police cruisers. Cops are pushing their 
           way into the house, the front door wide open.

                                 JASON
                        What the fuck? They’re going inside 
                        our house. Frank, they’re going 
                        into our home--!

           Jason shoots out of the car. Rushes up the lawn.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        That’s our house, motherfuckers--!

           The cops apprehend him on sight. They confront him with a 
           baggie of heroin. Wrestle him to the pavement.

           Frank watches through the windshield. His hand hovers over 
           the stick shift. Tempted to pull the car into reverse...

           A knock on the driver’s seat window.

                                 VEGAS COP
                        Frank Tassone?
                                 FRANK
                        Yeah. I’ll be right out.

           He exhales. Unbuckles his seat belt. Opens the door.

                                 VEGAS COP
                        Frank Tassone, you’re under arrest 
                        on charges of grand larceny in the 
                        first degree. You have the right to 
                        remain silent...

           The cop racks off the Miranda Rights, forcing Frank’s hands 
           behind his back. He stares straight ahead, expressionless.

                                 JASON
                        Frank! Frank--! He’s an old man, 
                        you assholes. You can’t push him 
                        around like that--!

           Just then, Frank DOUBLES OVER in the COP’S GRIP. EYES ROLLED 
           to the BACK OF HIS HEAD. FOAMING at the MOUTH.

                                 VEGAS COP
                        Get up. Get up--!

                                 JASON
                        He’s having a heart attack. You 
                        fucking pricks! Don’t you see 
                        you’re giving him a fucking--

           Jason continues to scream, his pleas muted to WHITE NOISE.

           Frank’s POV: The nighttime sky. Stars twinkling. Peace.

           INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

           A sharp white light overhead.

           Frank’s strapped to a gurney, surrounded by EMTs.

                                 LEAD EMT (O.S.)
                        His vitals are normal. No sign of 
                        cardiac arrest.

                                 SECOND EMT (O.S.)
                        You think he’s faking?

                                 LEAD EMT (O.S.)
                        We’ll bring him in, just in case.

           Frank’s vision fades as he passes out.
           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY

           Some time has passed. Frank now occupies the hot seat. He 
           looks sickly and pale, like he hasn’t slept in months.

           In a departure from his typical refinements, he wears an 
           unflattering orange jumpsuit. No make-up. No grooming kits.

                                 D.A.
                        Gee, I wish the taxpayers footed 
                        the bill for my personal trainer.

           Frank doesn’t respond.

                                 D.A. (CONT’D)
                        Earth to Frank. Am I coming in loud 
                        and clear...?

                                 FRANK
                        Necessary and proper.

                                 D.A.
                        What’s that? What did he say?

                        As we’ve gone over time and time 
                        again, per the language in Dr. 
                        Tassone’s contract, he’s entitled

                        Oh, you mean like the health spas? 
                        The custom tailoring? The trips to 
                        Las Vegas, London, Thailand--

                        You’re harassing my client.

                        nice. Where’s St. Thomas, Frank?

                                 INVESTIGATOR
                        It’s in the Virgin Islands.

                                 D.A.
                        The Virgin Islands. Wow. Was there 
                        an administrator’s conference in 
                        the Virgin Islands too?

           Frank stays mute.
                                 D.A. (CONT’D)
                        You know, I happened to pay a visit 
                        to that pretty little loft of yours 
                        on the Upper East Side. You’ve got 
                        a real flair for design. I guess it 
                        helps when you have an unlimited 
                        piggy bank to draw from...

                                 FRANK’S LAWYER
                        Frank, don’t say a goddamn word.

                                 D.A.
                        And that roommate you’ve got, boy, 
                        he’s a real cut-up. What’s his name 
                        again? Steve? We have Steve right 
                        next door. I hear Steve fancies 
                        himself quite the entrepreneur. 
                        Hey, what’s that company called--?

                                 INVESTIGATOR
                        WordPower Technologies.

                                 D.A.
                        That’s right. WordPower. Hey Frank, 
                        what does WordPower do anyways?

           Frank stares at him. No response.

           INT. ANOTHER INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY

           Steve sits in a similar predicament.

                                 STEVE
                        We printed pamphlets. Handbooks.

                                 D.A.
                        We?

                                 STEVE
                        Me. I did.

                                 D.A.
                        No partners over at WordPower? No, 
                        huh? I only ask because according 
                        to your company’s records, at least 
                        half that money was transferred 
                        over to Frank Tassone.

           Steve shakes his head.

                                 STEVE
                        You can’t make me. You can’t make 
                        me testify against my spouse.
                                 D.A.
                        Your spouse?

                                 STEVE
                        We’re domestic partners. We’ve been 
                        together for thirty-three years. 
                        We’re entitled to the exact same 
                        protections as other married 
                        couples, under federal law--

                                 D.A.
                        Are you married?

                                 STEVE
                        We had a commitment ceremony in 
                        2001, on a boat in the Caribbean--

                                 D.A.
                        You didn’t answer my question.

           Steve tenses.

                                 D.A. (CONT’D)
                        Thirty-three years, huh?
                             (to his cohorts)
                        When did he say his wife passed?

                                 INVESTIGATOR
                        ‘73.

                                 D.A.
                        That’s only thirty-one years ago.

                                 STEVE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 D.A.
                        His wife, Joanne.

                                 STEVE
                        Frank never had a wife. I knew him 
                        in 1973, he didn’t-- he’d never--

                                 D.A.
                        Really? They say he brought her up 
                        constantly. Had a photo on his desk 
                        and everything. You must’ve been by 
                        his office, right? I mean, you did 
                        do almost a million dollars worth 
                        of contract work over there...

           Steve goes red in the face.
                                 STEVE
                        That’s not true. You’re a liar. 
                        You’re a liar and-- and a bully--

                                 D.A.
                        Then there’s the matter of Jason 
                        DiMarco, the hot young number your 
                        so-called “domestic partner” bought 
                        a house in Vegas with last year.

           He slides a photo of Frank and Jason across the table. The 
           picture they took the day they closed on the home.

           They’re smiling. Arm in arm.

                                 D.A. (CONT’D)
                        He’s a dancer.

           INT. HALLWAY - POLICE STATION - DAY

           Frank’s escorted from the room, his hands cuffed in front of 
           him in a prisoner restraint belt.

           He spots Steve as he exits the adjacent room, subject to his 
           own police escort. They meet head-on.

                                 STEVE
                        What do you have to say?

           Frank’s head stirs. He stays silent.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Nothing? Nothing--?

           He SPITS IN FRANK’S FACE.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Thirty-three years, Frank!

           The police pull him away. His shouting echoes down the hall:

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Thirty-three years! Thirty-three 
                        years and not one thing to say--!

           Frank doesn’t react. Lets the saliva slither down his cheek.

                                 LEAD COP
                        Come on, buddy. Let’s go. One foot 
                        in front of the other.

           Frank nods. He takes a step forward.
           EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           Frank’s escort emerges from the building. The station steps 
           are lined with onlookers and news cameras. Booing, hissing.

           Bill. Judy. Bressler. Bonnie. Cindy. The other board members. 
           The book club women. The real estate agents. The rotary club. 
           Nearly every Roslyn taxpayer we’ve met till this point...

           The escort pauses briefly next to SHARON FARKAS, the book 
           club organizer. We remember Sharon. She hit on Frank once.

                                 SHARON
                        Hey. Fucking faggot.

           Frank keeps walking. They reach the squad car parked on the 
           curb. The rear door’s already open and waiting...

           He sees a small, hazy figure across the street. Away from the 
           rest of the mob. Standing alone, watching him.

           It’s Rachel.

           They make eye contact.

                                 LEAD COP
                        Watch your head.

           Frank disappears behind tinted windows. Rachel watches as the 
           car drives off, disappearing down the road.

           A reporter taps her on the shoulder.

                                 REPORTER
                        Excuse me. Are you Rachel Kellogg? 
                        The girl that broke the story?

           Rachel snaps back to reality.

                                 RACHEL
                        What? Oh. Yeah.

                                 REPORTER

                                 RACHEL
                        The Times?

                                 REPORTER
                        Yes. The New York Times. I’d love 
                        to hear your side.

           Rachel smiles, totally speechless.
           Nearby, one of the book club members answers questions for 
           the local news cameras. She offers her own free insight:

                                 BOOK CLUB WOMAN
                        Well, if you ask me, I think what 
                        he did was downright Pecksniffian.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Frank stands for his sentencing, his lawyer beside him. He 
           looks terrible, as if he’s melting.

           The rafters are filled with taxpayers and parents, eagerly 
           awaiting Frank’s fate.

                ON OCTOBER 10, 2006, FRANK TASSONE WAS CONVICTED OF STEALING 
                       $2.2 MILLION FROM THE ROSLYN SCHOOL DISTRICT.

                        HE WAS SENTENCED TO 4-12 YEARS IN PRISON.

           Applause from the rafters. Frank shuts his eyes.

           A hand touches his shoulder. He’s whisked out of frame.

           The Hawaiian horse painting is removed its spot above the

                           HER POSSESSIONS WERE SOLD AT AUCTION.

           EXT. BIG BILL’S HOUSE - DAY

           Bill wanders outside to fetch the morning paper. He steps in 
           a MOUND of DOG SHIT left on his front porch.

           He glances over at his next-door neighbor, walking her collie 
           a few yards off. She gives him the finger.

                     BILL BLAUSTEIN WAS OUSTED FROM THE SCHOOL BOARD.
                    HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES WERE SUCCESSFULLY SUED BY THE

           He rushes back inside to change out of his slippers.

           The bell chimes.

           The young students, ages five through eleven, pour out of 
           their classrooms all at once. Bright-eyed, fresh-faced.

           A gloved hand files the handwritten letters and battered blue

                  THE AUTHOR OF THE ANONYMOUS LETTER WAS NEVER DETERMINED.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - RACHEL’S HOUSE - DAY

           Rachel and David pack up their belongings. They’re assisted 
           by Rachel’s older brother JEREMY, 20, back from college.

           Rachel sorts through old papers. She comes across her front 
           page Beacon headline. Rereads the first few lines.

           Jeremy looks over her shoulder as she places the newspaper 
           into a box. His brow furrows.

                                 JEREMY
                        Whoa. That’s weird.
                                 RACHEL
                        What is?

                                 JEREMY
                        That guy taught me how to cross the 
                        street in first grade.

           He picks up the paper. Studies Frank’s photo.

                                 JEREMY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. I wandered straight into 
                        oncoming traffic, and he stepped 
                        out in front of me right at the 
                        last second. Saved me from being 
                        steamrolled by a school bus.

           He shrugs.

                                 JEREMY (CONT’D)
                        He seemed like a decent enough guy.

           Rachel absorbs this.

           INT. REC ROOM - MID-STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY

           Frank holds court over an assembly of state prisoners. Each 
           of them has a copy of Dickens’ Little Dorrit.

                                 FRANK
                        So, what did we all think of this 
                        week’s reading?

           He waits. No response.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Okay, let’s start by going over 
                        these discussion questions. Take 
                        one and pass the rest back.

           He distributes a stack of papers.

           INT. HALLWAY - MID-STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY

           Frank walks back to his cell, hands in his pockets. He 
           happens upon a stray parcel of clay.
           INT. FRANK’S CELL - MID-STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY

           Frank deposits the clay in the sink basin. He blends it with 
           ground cinnamon and ginger purloined from the mess hall.

           He rubs the resulting concoction on his face, across his 
           cheeks and forehead, smoothing over the cracks of his skin.

           He draws back his hands, revealing the amalgam’s function as 
           a more-than-capable powder foundation.

           Frank examines himself in the opaque sink mirror. Combs back 
           his hair. Plucks an errant hair from his chin.

           He doesn’t look half bad.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Tassone. You’ve got a letter.

           Frank arches an eyebrow. This is new.

           He hustles to the mail cart, grabs an envelope.

           He plants himself on his cot. Tears the thing open in one 
           motion. Peruses the enclosed contents.

           It’s an impersonal, typewritten government form.

           He squints, reads closer... His mouth drops.

           It’s too good to be true. Almost.

                     DUE TO A LOOPHOLE IN NEW YORK STATE PENSION LAW,

                                  TILL THE DAY HE DIES.

           Frank looks directly into the camera.

           He cracks a smile.

                                                          ROLL CREDITS.
