           EXT. LOUVRE MUSEUM - PARIS - NIGHT

           I.M. PEI’S GLASS PYRAMID radiates golden light.  

           PRIVATE SECURITY patrols the structure’s edge, armed to the 
           teeth and primed for disturbances. 

           CARD: Paris, France.

           The thrum of a string quartet lures us closer.  We PUSH past 
           the guards, THROUGH the glass, and inside--

           THE LOUVRE ATRIUM

           -- where high society mingles amidst high art.  

           A NEBBISH POLITICO panders to the crowd from beneath a banner 
           reading “Paris Accueille le 9e Sommet Annuel ECO” (”Paris 
           Welcomes the 9th Annual ECO Summit”).  

                                 POLITICO
                        My wife suggested I break the ice 
                        with a joke, so here goes: why does 
                        only seventy-five percent of the 
                        world believe in global warming? 
                        Because the other twenty-five 
                        percent works for the oil industry. 

           The Politico pauses for breezy laughter.

                                 POLITICO (CONT’D)
                        Sophie, your suggestion worked.   
                        Ice has been broken.  Unfortunately 
                        our work isn’t all laughs.  It’s 
                        serious business, protecting 
                        environmental interests in the face 
                        of political and financial--

           The Politico continues to drone as our focus shifts to a 
           twenty-something AMERICAN ATTACHÉ in a barely-there dress.  
           She looks out of place among the one-percenters, her youthful 
           inexperience lending her a degree of nervous charm. 

           From across the monied crowd, the American Attaché meets the 
           laser-focused gaze of a DISTINGUISHED EURASIAN WOMAN.  A 
           gentle smile curls up on the Woman’s face.  

           The Attaché blushes and looks away. 

           The Attaché sips her champagne and lets her eyes bounce back 
           to the Distinguished Woman’s face.  

           She’s still watching. 
           AT THE DISTINGUISHED WOMAN’S TABLE - LATER

           The Attaché sits cozied up next to the Distinguished Woman.  

           The Woman leans in and whispers something.  Our Attaché 
           tosses her head back in a fit of laughter.  

           This Lady must be a real comedian.  

           The Woman reaches for her champagne flute, but accidentally 
           knocks it off the table.  

           Our Attaché reacts with a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it flick of 
           her arm, catching the flute mid-fall. 

           The Woman puts her hand on the Attaché’s knee. 

           The Attaché’s legs spread just so as she turns toward the 
           Woman - welcoming her advances.  

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - PARIS - NIGHT

           A top-floor corridor overlooking the glittering Parisian 
           cityscape.  

           Our American Attaché slinks toward the Penthouse door.  

           She shoots a bashful glance over her shoulder at the Woman 
           and the TEAM OF SECURITY PERSONNEL stationed down the length 
           of the hall.  

                                 WOMAN
                        Sorry about the extra eyes, I’m 
                        sure you understand. 

                                 LONDON
                        Can never be too careful.

           The Woman enters a pin on a KEYPAD LOCK and opens the door.  

           INT. PENTHOUSE - LATER

           Our Attaché stands before the room’s expensive STEREO.  Under 
           the soft light of the hotel suite, her dress reveals even 
           more than before.  

           The Woman watches her from a nearby chaise lounge.  

                                 AMERICAN ATTACHÉ
                        Shit.  My phone died.  Now I can’t 
                        play my jam.  Too bad, it’s a real 
                        banger. 
                                 WOMAN
                        Never let bad technology get in the 
                        way of a good time.

           The Woman rises and reaches for her laptop.  She enters her 
           password and hands the computer to the Attaché.  

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Play whatever you like.  

           The Attaché plugs the laptop into the stereo as the Woman 
           heads toward the wet bar.

                                 AMERICAN ATTACHÉ
                        You won’t regret it.  

           The Attaché takes a peak over her shoulder at the Woman, 
           who’s busy mixing drinks with her back toward our Attaché.  

           The Attaché pulls a USB DRIVE from the hem of her dress and 
           plugs it into the laptop.  

           Her fingers move fast as she digs through encrypted files.  

           She lands on one: CAPTHORN.  She drags the file to her DRIVE.  

           The USB drive’s RED LIGHT blinks to life as an ON-SCREEN 
           PROGRESS BAR tracks the file transfer.

           It moves at a snail’s pace.

           Ten percent...

           The Woman rattles a cocktail shaker as the progress bar 
           inches along.  

           Twenty percent...  

           The Woman pours the drinks and turns back to our Attaché.

                                 WOMAN
                        What’s taking so long?  

           Thirty-five percent...

           The Woman taps a drink against the Attaché’s shoulder.  

                                 AMERICAN ATTACHÉ
                        Got it.  

           The Attaché whips around just as the first heavy guitar rips 
           of Genesis’ “I CAN’T DANCE” blare across the opulent suite.  

           Behind her, the progress bar still ticks a slow advance.  
                                 WOMAN
                        You’re kidding.  Genesis?

                                 AMERICAN ATTACHÉ
                        Not a fan?

                                 WOMAN
                        My favorite.  

           The Woman grooves out a charming little dance move. 

           The Attaché grins, lifts a leg and kicks the Woman back onto 
           the chaise, punctuating her every move with lurid sexuality.

                                 AMERICAN ATTACHÉ
                        What a coincidence.  So, you’re the 
                        Melanie Gaines?

                                 WOMAN
                        In the flesh.

           The Attaché moves in closer now, allowing the Woman’s hands 
           to roam her body.  Our Attaché twists and writhes, her 
           strapped dress loose at the shoulders.  

           She’s enjoying herself.  She loves this song.  

           The track really KICKS INTO GEAR and the Attaché moves her 
           mouth close to the Woman’s ear.  

                                 AMERICAN ATTACHÉ
                    (whispering)
                        You know I’m not going to fuck you, 
                        right?

                                 WOMAN
                        Pardon?

                                 AMERICAN ATTACHÉ
                        I’m not the kind of girl who fucks 
                        monsters.

           The Woman’s eyes curl into question marks.  

           Phil Collins hits a high note as the timid Attaché assumes a 
           metallic gravitas. 

                                 AMERICAN ATTACHÉ (CONT’D)
                        I’m the kind of girl who destroys 
                        them.  

           The Woman tries to stand but our Attaché swiftly - almost 
           beyond the spectrum of human ability - SNAPS HER NECK.  
           The Woman’s delicate body CRASHES through a glass table and 
           THUDS to the floor.

                                 GUARD (O.C.)
                    (yelling over the song)
                        Boss?

                                 AMERICAN ATTACHÉ
                        We’re fine!

           The Attaché hurries back to the laptop and finds the progress 
           bar at one-hundred percent.  Satisfied, she yanks her USB 
           DRIVE free and tucks it back into her dress.  

                                 GUARD (O.C.)
                    (even louder)
                        Mrs.  Gaines?

                                 AMERICAN ATTACHÉ
                        I said-- 

           Before she can finish, the door swings open.  

           A HULKING GUARD peers in.

                                 AMERICAN ATTACHÉ (CONT’D)
                        -- we’re fine.  

           The Hulking Guard’s eyes stumble over a trail of blood drip-
           drip-dripping down Gaines’ neck and onto the carpet, 
           spreading like syrup on a sno-cone.  

           The Attaché LAUNCHES herself at the Hulking Guard, locking an 
           arm around his tree-trunk neck.  She kicks the door shut and 
           punches the electronic deadbolt with her foot.

           Hulking Guard CRACKS her into the wall.

                        WHAM!    WHAM!    WHAM!

           Hulking Guard pulls out a fierce-looking PISTOL and fires at 
           the Attaché latched on his back.

           ONE SHOT! splinters the door behind them.

           ANOTHER BLAST! decimates a hideous sculpture at their side.

           The door THUNDERS and CRACKS - the other bodyguards barking 
           like pissed off Dobermans trying to get inside.  

           The Attaché thrusts her arms and grabs the Hulking Guard’s 
           gun, SNAPPING HIS WRIST as she redirects it back at him and 
           dumps what’s left of the clip into his stomach.
           He slumps as the door SHATTERS and a ROUGHNECK GUARD angles 
           himself inside the suite.  

           Roughneck’s eyes become black holes as he surveys the damage, 
           the blood, his dying colleague, and our unassuming Attaché at 
           the center of it all.  

                                 AMERICAN ATTACHÉ (CONT’D)
                        I said we’re fine.

           Roughneck shoots at the Attaché, who uses the Hulking Guard’s 
           body as a shield.  

           Roughneck pulls the trigger once more - CLICK! - he’s out of 
           rounds. Roughneck chucks the empty gun at our Attaché.  

           She CATCHES IT and THROWS it back -- knocking him in the 
           head.

           She reaches for a fallen clip, swapping out empty rounds for 
           fresh ones.

           She takes quick aim and fires into Roughneck’s HEAD with 
           fatal precision - gray matter and neon viscera doing a mad 
           Jackson Pollock on the wall behind him.

           She rises, levels out, inches the door open and peers down 
           the hall at a half-dozen other guards, all of them quickly re-
           evaluating their commitment to their jobs.  

           Our Attaché doesn’t need a second thought.  She looses a 
           spray of tightly aimed bullets.  

           A HEADSHOT here. 

           TWO BACKSHOTS there. 

           The Attaché lays the remaining guards out.  

           She drops the gun and straightens her dress.

           A CREAKING DOOR draws the Attaché’s attention to a sleepy-
           eyed LITTLE GIRL standing in the door frame, leading into the 
           penthouse suite’s guest bedroom. 

           The Little Girl spots Melanie Gaines’ lifeless body.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Mama?

           A hurricane of emotions stir in the Little Girl’s eyes as 
           they land on our Attaché’s expressionless face.  

           It’s a haunting exchange of glances.
           The Attaché draws a finger to her mouth: Shhh.

           The Attaché takes an unreadable final look at the Little 
           Girl, before she turns back to the--

           HALLWAY

           The Attaché takes a deep brace-yourself breath, checks that 
           the USB drive remains in place, then BOOKS it down the 
           hallway, firing what’s left of her rounds through the window 
           at the far end of the hall.  

           The Attaché takes a running leap toward the blown-out window 
           and SWAN DIVES into the brisk Parisian air.

           Her dress whips behind her like silk wings.

           She’s an angel of death, taking flight.  

           WE PUSH OUT of the window after her.

           TITLE OVER SKY

                        H U M M I N G B I R D

                                             SNAP TO

           TIGHT ON THE AMERICAN ATTACHÉ’S FACE

           We get a more intimate look at her now.  Her name is-- 

                                 THALIA (O.S.)
                        London.  What the fuck were you 
                        thinking?

           LONDON is in her twenties, with a slight smile that dares you 
           to underestimate her just because she’s beautiful.  

           Focused, commanding, she’s a far cry from the insecure 
           American Attaché we first met. 

                                 LONDON
                        I was thinking about my assignment.  

           We go WIDER to reveal we’re inside of a--

           HOLDING CELL

           Windowless and too bright.  The sort of interrogation room 
           reserved for questionings that never officially happen.  
                                 THALIA (O.S.)
                        “Reason.  Reckon.  Kill.” Which 
                        part of The Commandments don’t you 
                        understand?

           London sits opposite THALIA PARKES (40s).  

           A delicate pane of bangs does little to conceal Thalia’s 
           ferocity.  She’s Good Cop.  She’s Bad Cop.  And when the 
           circumstances necessitate it, she’s the entire goddamn 
           precinct.

           A METAL BOX with a KEYPAD INTERFACE sits on a table between 
           them.  

                                 LONDON
                        I reasoned that Gaines was a 
                        deserving mark.  I reckoned that 
                        her security detail would get in my 
                        way.  And I killed them all when 
                        they did.

                                 THALIA
                        Those additional casualties 
                        increased your operation body count 
                        by six hundred percent.  Did you 
                        reckon that would go unnoticed?  

           For anyone else, this would be a nerves-shredding 
           intimidation, but London isn’t breaking.  

           Hell, she isn’t even breaking a sweat.

                                 LONDON
                        There was a child, Thalia.  My 
                        mission brief made no mention of a 
                        child. 

                                 THALIA
                        The child was unexpected.

                                 LONDON
                        You can drop the “Stoic Handler” 
                        routine.  It makes you look old.  

                                 THALIA
                        I am old.  And I’ve got Gideon so 
                        far up my ass he’s chewing my food 
                        for me.  You know he’s desperate to 
                        pull the plug on Codex, and you’re 
                        one fuck-up away from being his 
                        reason.  I trained you better than 
                        that.  
           London’s eyes dodge Thalia like a scolded child’s.  

                                 THALIA (CONT’D)
                        I’m not mad, but I am very 
                        disappointed.  If you keep this 
                        kind of messiness up, Cathedral 
                        will have no choice but to renounce 
                        you.  I’ll do it myself.  You’ll be 
                        dead--

           Thalia reaches across the table and brushes London’s hair out 
           of her face.  

                                 THALIA (CONT’D)
                        -- and I’ll be devastated.  So I’ve 
                        decided to put you on low-risk 
                        detail.  An intel run.  

                                 LONDON
                        Thalia.

                                 THALIA
                        An easy job.  And I trust you to 
                        execute it without making noise.  
                        Enter your pin.   

           Thalia slides the metal box toward London. 

           London taps a number into the box’s keypad.  It unlocks with 
           a soft WHIR.  Thalia opens the box and removes a STACK OF 
           FLASHCARDS with BLACK AND WHITE SYMBOLS printed on each.  
           Thalia lifts the first card and holds it for London’s 
           benefit.  

           Printed on it, a --

                                 LONDON
                        Star.

           Again and again, Thalia flashes card after card.  

                                 London (CONT’D)
                        Square. Circle.  Circle.  Square.  
                        Hummingbird.

           After the sixth card, something changes in London.  Like a 
           combination lock, the extended sequence of cards has 
           triggered a change inside her.  

           She’s blank and objective, not at all the woman we just met.  

           It’s as if London’s been “hacked.”  

           The GLITCHY PULSE of a droning EDM track begins to swell.
                                 THALIA

                        target’s name is Alex Donovan.

                        identified by the handle “Orion.”  
                        Intel retrieved from Melanie

           Just as the BEAT DROPS we--

                                            SMASH TO

           EXT. BAGA BEACH - GOA, INDIA - DAY

           Swaying palms frame a white sand beach.

           A horde of sweat-slicked bodies sway to the THROBBING TRANCE 
           BEAT.  

           CARD: Goa, India. 

           We move through the ecstatic crowd, past drugged-out revelers 
           and local vendors shilling coconuts and chai.  

           We land on London, caught in a fit of laughter.  Her energy 
           is electrifying - there’s nothing of the demure Attaché or 
           steely killer left.  

           She’s practically a different person. 

           London tosses a handful of NEON DYE and the mob loses it.  

           The dye mushroom clouds over a greasy-masculine man in his 
           mid-30s.  

           This is ALEX DONOVAN.  

           Beneath his threadbare NIRVANA T-shirt and fresh patina of 
           powdered pigment is a guy who could wield some genuine sex 
           appeal, if he ever gave it any thought.  

           London and Alex lock eyes.
           She shoots him a mischievous grin, transmitting an immediate 
           connection in Alex’s direction.

           She turns away and loses herself to the music but Alex’s eyes 
           stay glued to London. 

           EXT. BEACH - GOA, INDIA - LATER

           The party shows no signs of slowing down as the sun finally 
           sets.  From across the throng of people, Alex spots London 
           walking along the shore, away from the party. 

           EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH - GOA, INDIA - MINUTES LATER

           London sits facing the sunset.  Alex approaches with a 
           coconut. 

                                 ALEX
                        Everything okay? 

                                 LONDON
                        Just needed a breather.  

                                 ALEX
                        Electrolytes’ll do you good.  

           Alex takes a seat beside London and hands her the coconut.  
           She takes a sip. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        I’m Alex.

                                 LONDON
                        Hey,  I’m London.

                                 ALEX
                        What brings you to Goa?

                                 LONDON
                        Just searching for meaning at the 
                        edge of the Earth.

                                 ALEX
                        How’s that going for you?

                                 LONDON
                        I don’t know about meaning, but the 
                        party’s pretty great.  What about 
                        you?  

                                 ALEX
                        I’m here for ecstasy.  
                                 LONDON
                        Not sure you needed to fly to India 
                        for pills. 

                                 ALEX
                        I’m not talking about drugs.  I’m 
                        talking about the experience.  
                        Transcendence.  Going beyond 
                        yourself.  Connecting with other 
                        people.  The feeling that reminds 
                        you what it’s like to be truly 
                        human.  That’s what it’s like here.  
                        That’s ecstasy.

           London gives Alex’s comments a moment to breath before 
           bursting into a fit of laughter.

                                 LONDON
                        I don’t mean to laugh, but you 
                        sound ridiculous.

                                 ALEX
                        I get it, some raved out stranger 
                        rambling about ecstasy on a beach 
                        in India.  It seems like a joke.  
                        But I’m serious.  I spent my 
                        twenties staring at code, and at 
                        some point I realized that life is 
                        so much more than data.  It has to 
                        be experienced.  It has to be felt. 

                                 LONDON
                        You sure you’re not talking about 
                        pills?

                                 ALEX
                        This is a special place.  You can 
                        feel it in the ground.  It 
                        practically hums.

           Alex grabs London’s hands, holds it inches above the ground. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Can you feel it?

           She looks to him - is he making a pass? - but his face offers 
           nothing but sincerity.  Alex is a true believer, and it’s 
           enough honesty to make London a little bit uncomfortable. 

                                 LONDON
                        All I’m feeling is hot.

           London stands and sprints into the surf.  Alex rises, and 
           follows her into the water. 
           EXT. THE MERMAID RESTAURANT - PATIO - NIGHT

           Hanging lanterns and tiki torches wash the patio in warm 
           light.  

           A band plays as Alex and London finish their drinks.  

           This is low-key romance at its most tropical. 

                                 ALEX
                        I did well for myself, but it was a 
                        curse.  Golden handcuffs chained me 
                        to a job I ended up hating, that 
                        cost me dearly.  All because I 
                        never made time to just enjoy the 
                        present.  So, that’s what I’m all 
                        about now, fully enjoying the 
                        present. 

           London smiles and reaches toward Alex, but rather than grab 
           his hand, she grabs his phone. 

                                 LONDON
                        Let’s commemorate the present.  

           London snaps a selfie of herself and Alex. 

                                 ALEX
                        Hold up, I’ll close out.

           Alex stands and heads to the bar.

           London palms Alex’s phone, covertly slipping a MICRO-DONGLE 
           into the phone’s input.

           The dongle immediately initiates a COVERT APP.  

           The phone’s screen flicks through a lightning-fast sequence 
           of passcodes before landing on the correct number, unlocking 
           the phone.  

           The phone goes black, then flashes back to life. 

           As the data dump progresses, London’s eyes move to Alex at 
           the bar.  He waves and shoots her a glowing smile.  Her 
           expression softens, just barely. 

           The phone beeps, and London palms it just as Alex returns. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        London, do you like tapas?

           Off of London’s face--
           EXT. GOA AIRPLANE FIELD - NIGHT

           A cigarette dangles from a SECURITY GUY’s mouth.  The 
           Security Guy spots Alex and London approaching, spits out the 
           butt, stiffens up and ushers them past. 

           They move toward a hangar as it’s massive door SHUDDERS open.  
           Inside, a private plane.  

           A really nice private plane.

                                 ALEX
                        I want to show you something.  But 
                        it’s far.

                                 LONDON
                        You’re kidding.  What’re you, like, 
                        the Sultan of Brunei?

                                 ALEX
                        I told you, I did well for myself.  
                        I can have you back here, or 
                        anywhere else in the world, inside 
                        of thirty-six hours. 

                                 LONDON
                        I’m not sure I can just, get on a 
                        plane with a stranger and fly to -- 
                        where exactly?

                                 ALEX
                        Barcelona. I know it seems sketchy--

                                 LONDON
                        That’s an enormous understatement.

                                 ALEX
                        -- I promise, there’s something 
                        special on the other end of this 
                        flight.

                                 LONDON
                        You’re not going to kill me and 
                        turn me into a lampshade, are you?

                                 ALEX
                        I’m pretty sure you could take me 
                        down if I tried.  So whaddaya say? 

           London looks at the plane, then back to Alex.  His face 
           brings some genuine comfort to her.  Alex smiles and we--

                                         MATCH CUT TO:
           EXT. BARCELONA - DAY

           We go WIDER on Alex’s smiling face to discover that he’s 
           surrounded by a surreal panoply of psychedelic colors and 
           patterns.  

           A low din of chatter and noise begins to blossom around him. 

           We continue to pull back - we see TOURISTS, LABORERS, 
           SECURITY GUARDS - eventually we discover we’re inside of--

           THE SAGRADA FAMILIA

           Sprawling.  

           Complicated.  

           A stunning architectural accomplishment which - nearly a 
           hundred years after its ground breaking - is still in 
           construction and nowhere near complete.  

           CARD: Barcelona, Spain.

                                 ALEX
                        I come here to escape.  Staring at 
                        code all day makes me feel like I’m 
                        in Daft Punk.  But this place.  
                        It’s so--

                                 LONDON
                        Human.  

                                 ALEX
                        Exactly.  It brings me back to 
                        life.  We should go on a private 
                        tour.

           Alex points up at the scaffolding that weaves in and out of 
           the building, through spires and balustrades. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Trust me: Barcelona looks beautiful 
                        from up there.  

                                 LONDON
                        Why don’t we just come back when 
                        it’s finished.

                                 ALEX
                        In a decade or three?  C’mon.
           Alex takes London’s hand as he unbuckles a cordon blocking 
           off access to the construction area separating them from a 
           SPIRE STAIRCASE.

           A nearby GUARD spots them.

                                 GUARD
                    (in Spanish)
                        Hey, stop!

                                 ALEX
                        Come on.  You’re already my 
                        accomplice. 

           London and Alex rush through the construction equipment.  

           London dodges a CONSTRUCTION WORKER who twirls in her wake.  

           Alex SPINS past the same Worker on his other side.  

           The Security Guard follows them a few feet behind and slams 
           into the Construction Worker.

           London and Alex race toward a staircase.  

           A LANKY CONTRACTOR moves in their direction, trying to 
           intercept. 

           Alex grabs London from behind, pulling her into a-- 

           SHADOWY ALCOVE

           -- where they disappear from the Lanky Contractor’s view as 
           he races past, still in pursuit.  

           London smiles at Alex, pressed close to him in the shadows, 
           their faces inches apart.  

           The electric moment between them builds until London SPRINTS 
           out of the alcove.  

           Alex follows London inside of the--

           SPIRE STAIRCASE

           The two of them rush up a flight of WINDING STAIRS, moving at 
           a breakneck speed: Up - Up - Up.

           They finally burst out of a door and onto the --
           RICKETY SCAFFOLDING

           -- that’s wrapped around the building.  

           London and Alex skid to a halt a breath from the edge and 
           find Barcelona sprawled out before them.  

           London and Alex sit on the edge of the scaffolding. 

                                 LONDON
                        I see what you meant about ecstasy.

           The beat stretches out until London reaches toward Alex and 
           grabs his hand.

                                            PRE-LAP:

           THE SCRATCH OF KEYS AIMING FOR - AND MISSING - A LOCK.

           Eventually the DOOR CRACKS OPEN.  Light shines inside of--

           ALEX’S FLAT - SAME

           Alex leads London through the apartment.  It’s sparse but 
           ordered, the kind of measured minimalism that only the ultra-
           wealthy can afford.

           London grabs Alex and pulls him into a passionate kiss.

           Alex takes her by the hand and leads her into his--

           BEDROOM

           They make quick work of each others’ clothes.

           Just when it seems like hot is about to give way to heavy, 
           Alex kicks his door shut and we SNAP TO--

                                              BLACK.

           INT. ALEX’S FLAT - BEDROOM - LATER

           London and Alex are sweat-glued together.

           London delicately separates herself and rises, careful not to 
           disturb Alex as she moves to the--
           BATHROOM

           London shuts the door behind her, turns the water on. 

           After a moment, she cracks the door and peeks back at Alex, 
           already passed out.  

           She turns to the mirror and stares at herself.  For a split 
           second, London sees Melanie Gaines’ Little Girl in her 
           reflection. 

           London startles but by the time she looks behind herself 
           Gaines’ Little Girl is gone. 

           She shakes off her disturbing reverie and opens the medicine 
           cabinet, reads labels.  

           She moves to the toilet, feels for anything that might be 
           stashed underneath it.  

           She opens the tank: nothing but water.  

           INT.  ALEX'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - SAME

           London pads to Alex’s computer. 

           Multiple monitors and a knot of cables tell us that this is a 
           fiercely modded machine.

           London sits and rummages through Alex’s things: lifts an 
           empty Fanta can, moves a textbook on coding languages.

           She pulls open a drawer and finds a HANDGUN inside.  She 
           feels its weight, pulls the trigger, and water squirts out.  

           She shimmies the computer’s cursor, and stares at the 
           blinking prompt: PASSWORD - PASSWORD - PASSWORD.

           She tries an entry, then pauses - deletes whatever she’d 
           entered, then types another entry.  

           She presses enter.  

           The monitor flickers and flashes to LINUX.

           London types a litany of commands. 

           Presses enter. 

           Bingo.  

           London bounces through Alex’s files.  
           We see:

           -- Telephoto surveillance images of people and places.  

           -- Time-stamped telephone logs.  

           -- A drove of dangerous data.  

           London’s eyes go tight as she recognizes a face amongst the 
           data: HERSELF in deep cover.   

           Something catches London’s eye: a FAMILIAR LOOKING BOX with a 
           KEYPAD interface, identical to Thalia’s.

           London enters a pin, and the box opens with a whir.

           These cards share many of the symbols we saw earlier, but 
           these are more sophisticated, shimmering with color and 
           depth.  London flicks through them one at a time, studying 
           them.

           And after the sixth card something changes inside her, just 
           like before, but it’s the opposite of blankness this time.  

           Her face is suddenly flushed with feeling, as an overwhelming 
           wash of thoughts course through her.

           London takes stilted, uneven breaths.  

           She’s panicking now.

           EXT. BARCELONA STREET - SECONDS LATER

           London bursts out of Alex’s building.  She heaves, and 
           struggles to collect herself. 

           Her legs begin to move.  

           She’s running now. 

           London is suddenly racing away from the building. 

           Sprinting down city blocks, weaving through Barcelona. 

           Her mind moving as fast as her legs as she runs with endless 
           stamina past late night diners in streetside cafes, dodging 
           drunks yelling in the street.

           She winds through traffic and weaves through parks, her 
           energy seemingly ceaseless.

           She’s racing away from whatever the cards did to her, and 
           toward a new kind of understanding. 
           INT.  ALEX’S FLAT - MORNING

           Alex lumbers toward the kitchen, where London whisks, flips, 
           and sizzles breakfast.  

                                 LONDON
                        Hope you don’t mind I took the 
                        reins on breakfast. 

           London slings a plate toward Alex.  

           He smiles - holy shit, this girl is a bring-her-home-to-mom-
           caliber keeper.

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        And, y’know, did some casual 
                        snooping.

           London watches Alex take a bite of eggs.  

           Alex smiles, playing it cool. 

           Just as Alex eases into breakfast--

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        Alex, have you ever heard the name 
                        “Orion”?

           Alex’s face glazes over as a fearful realization dawns.  

           He bolts for the WATER GUN in his desk drawer, and turns it 
           on London.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m not afraid to use this.

           London whips a PLATE at Alex’s hand.  Water spills out as the 
           plastic gun CRACKS in two.

           Alex lunges toward the hall, keeping a table between himself 
           and London.  

           London POUNCES on top of the table and LEAPS at Alex.   

           She WINDMILLS her legs and slams him to the ground.

                                 LONDON
                        Stop running.

           Alex rises and TACKLES London, dragging her into the--
           BATHROOM

           He tosses her against the toilet and the tank shatters. 

           She flicks him into the ceramic shower, pulls a blunt gun 
           from her waist and presses it against his head.

                                 LONDON
                        One twitchy finger and you’re 
                        nothing but a mess for someone else 
                        to clean up.  Are you Orion?
                    (beat)
                        Answer me.

                                 ALEX
                        Yes.  Yes. 

           INT.  CATHEDRAL HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Thalia sits in a boardroom with other SUITS and OPERATIVES.  

           At the head of the table - God himself - GIDEON MERRIWEATHER.  

           In his sixties, Gideon’s got an ice-cold Wall Street 
           demeanor, but the tattoos peaking out of his suit collar 
           speak to a dangerous past of a different sort. 

                                 GIDEON
                        We’re hoping you’ll be able to 
                        explain yourself, Thalia.  The 
                        research and development we’ve 
                        poured into Project Codex isn’t 
                        sustainable, and frankly, the board 
                        is not terribly pleased with the 
                        results.  Your most recent Codex 
                        asset left an enormous mess.

                                 THALIA
                        London is our most sophisticated 
                        asset.  Not only did she gain 
                        access no one else could, she 
                        performed a job usually reserved 
                        for a team of operatives.  She’s 
                        the result of an enormous 
                        investment of time and resources. 
                        And while I of course understand 
                        the board’s concern, I can assure 
                        you, they’re baseless.  Project 
                        Codex - London - is our future.

                                 GIDEON
                        Haunting hyperbole.  
                                 THALIA
                        Gideon, Cathedral was born of your 
                        premise that the word of God is 
                        impossibly restrictive.  Ten 
                        Commandments?  You can hardly get 
                        away with anything.  So you rewrote 
                        God almighty, refining that list 
                        from ten to three: Reason.  Reckon.  
                        Kill.  Just like the Good Lord 
                        intended.  I hope my efforts will 
                        continue to winnow that list even 
                        further.   Codex assets will usher 
                        Cathedral into the next era of 
                        espionage.  How’s that for 
                        hyperbole?

           Thalia’s phone PINGS loudly.  

           She palms her phone and sees London’s encrypted message: 
           Target identity confirmed. I’ve got Orion. 

                                 GIDEON
                        Care to share with the rest of the 
                        class?

                                 THALIA
                        Nothing but good news.

           INT. ALEX’S FLAT - DAY

           London has Alex locked in her sights.  

                                 ALEX
                        Please don’t kill me. 

                                 LONDON
                        Not only is your hard drive is 
                        littered with information regarding 
                        my company, but you have one of our 
                        Codex boxes.  

                                 ALEX
                        You’re with Cathedral?

           A crushing disappointment spreads on Alex’s face.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        I thought there was something 
                        special between us.

           London slides Alex’s keypad box toward him. 
                                 LONDON
                        Why do you have this?

                                 ALEX
                        I made it.

           London’s face shows the briefest flicker of confusion as Alex 
           grabs the box and enters his pin and removes the flashcards.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Cathedral hired me to develop a 
                        programming language for the human 
                        brain.  Using symbols like these.  
                        The idea was to create secret 
                        spaces for memory storage.  Secret 
                        places for hiding what you know 
                        from yourself.  I thought it might 
                        help field agents protect intel, 
                        but I never got it to work.   And 
                        after years of development, I found 
                        out that it wasn’t going to be used 
                        to protect agents, it was going to 
                        be used to program them without 
                        their consent.  A new kind of 
                        killer, that could be commanded to 
                        do anything.  

                                 LONDON
                        Brainwashing.

                                 ALEX
                        I was developing a tool that would 
                        turn anyone on Earth into a human 
                        drone.  I found out more about 
                        Cathedral, the dark shit they 
                        dabble in, and I quit.  

                                 LONDON
                        You’ve got it wrong.  I’m not a 
                        drone.  And Cathedral executes 
                        objectives for the sake of 
                        international security. 

                                 ALEX
                        All of Cathedral’s contracts are 
                        off-book.  Beyond black-ops.  
                        They’re money hits.  And I think 
                        the world should know about you, 
                        that you’re not guardians, you’re 
                        not the good guys.  You’re weapons.  
                        Look.
           Uncertainty flashes across London’s face, she fights to 
           suppress it.  Alex grabs a stack of photos and intel.  He 
           flicks an image toward London: a sophisticated older WOMAN.

                                 LONDON
                        Cynthia Noel, deep drug ties 
                        throughout Russia.

                        German politician who lost a 
                        daughter to a heroin overdose.  She 
                        spent the rest of her career trying 
                        to stop the Khratov cartel.  Your 
                        people killed her because there’s 
                        big money in heroin.

           Alex tosses another photo.  And another.  And another.

                        She was a conservationist, she 
                        spent twelve years trying to 
                        protect her homeland from financial 
                        exploitation by blocking the 
                        Capthorn pipeline.  You have any 
                        idea what a pipeline like that 
                        would’ve done to her country’s 
                        national resources?  It’s economy?    
                        It would’ve left her country in 
                        ruins, but that doesn’t matter, 
                        because it would’ve also made some 
                        American developers billions. 

           London’s forehead creases just so, betraying her uncertainty.

                        Every one of Cathedral’s hits stood 
                        in the way of corporations making 
                        money.  You doesn’t protect people, 
                        you protect investments. 

                                 LONDON
                        No!  Shut up.  You’re lying.  I’m 
                        not a cold-blooded murderer.  

           Alex thumbs his flashcards. 

                                 ALEX
                        You never had a choice.  

           London’s smartphone PINGS as a new message appears on-screen: 
           EXECUTE TARGET. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        And I assume you don’t have a 
                        choice right now.  

           London sits down, her hands white-knuckling as they grip the 
           arm rest.  An uneasy combination of anger and sadness flood 
           London’s face as her façade collapses. 

                                 LONDON
                        Melanie Gaines had a daughter.  She 
                        saw me standing next to her 
                        mother’s body.  I stole her mother 
                        from her without a second thought, 
                        just because it was the job.  But 
                        it was a job built on lies, and now 
                        that girl has no one to watch her 
                        grow up.  All because of me.  Fuck. 

                                 ALEX
                        So what’re you going to do about 
                        it?

                                 LONDON
                        I’m going to do the right thing.

           London snarls into her smartphone.

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        I reason my intel is falsified.  I 
                        reckon the mission is unjustified. 
                        You’ve been lying to me, Thalia.  
                        And I refuse to kill.

           INT. CATHEDRAL HEADQUARTERS - HALL - DAY

           HUGH - a handsome Cathedral lackey in his mid-30s - tries to 
           keep pace with Thalia as she rushes back to her office.

                                 THALIA
                        She’s refusing my kill command.  
                        What is going on with my asset?

                                 HUGH
                        She’s changing. 

           Thalia laughs and speeds up, leaving Hugh in her wake.

                                 THALIA
                        Changing?  Two sugars, Hugh.  I’ll 
                        be in my office. 

           Thalia speaks into her smartphone.

           INT. ALEX’S FLAT - SAME

           London’s smartphone buzzes as it receives Thalia’s message.

           We go WIDER TO REVEAL that the phone is sitting on Alex’s 
           table, in his otherwise empty flat. 

           EXT.  LAS RAMBLAS - DAY

           London and Alex use the crowded street to their advantage, 
           doing their best to blend in.

           They move through a narrow alley toward a SERVICE DOOR. 

           London kicks the door open and they slink inside of a--

           GRIM BUSINESS CORRIDOR

           Free of the crowd, they speed up.

           At the end of a hallway, a glass door and more crowds on the 
           other side of it.  

           Eventually they burst out of the building and onto--
           A BUSTLING CALLE

           London freezes.  

           A HUSTLER selling knock-off watches has set up shop directly 
           ahead of them.  

           His eyes immediately lock on London’s.

                                 HUSTLER
                        Hi, London. 

                                 LONDON
                        Hi, Miles.

                                 HUSTLER
                        Need a watch?  

                                 LONDON
                        You know me, I’d still be late to 
                        my own funeral.

                                 HUSTLER
                        Actually, seems like you’re right 
                        on time.  

           The Hustler drops his wares and begins a tense approach.  

           This man couldn’t care less about shilling fake Rolexes.  

                                 LONDON
                        I think it’d be best for both of us 
                        if we didn’t cause a scene.  Let’s 
                        talk somewhere more intimate.

           The Hustler pulls an M9 from his jacket.

           The Hustler follows London back inside the business corridor.  

           Alex spots some inaudible words pass between them.

           The Hustler cocks his gun.  London gives the Hustler a faux 
           hands-up.  It’s a jokey “You got me!” gesture.

           Then - almost too fast to be real - London disarms the 
           Hustler and sends his gun skittering across the floor.  

           The Hustler has no time to react as London unleashes a 
           precise and instantly fatal combination of blows.

           The Hustler crumbles to the floor.

           Alex looks around at the crowd passing him by - did anyone 
           else catch that?
           London grabs the Hustler’s Beretta and spare clip before 
           hurrying back to Alex.

                                 ALEX
                        You killed him?

                                 LONDON
                        Feel free to help next time. 

           London’s eyes scout the crowd, on high alert as she and Alex 
           navigate the onslaught of traffic.  

           INT. CATHEDRAL HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Thalia gulps the last of her coffee as she strides toward 
           DEREK, Gideon’s assistant.

                                 DEREK
                        He’s unavail--

           Thalia slams her empty mug on Derek’s desk and blows past 
           him, toward Gideon’s door.

                                 DEREK (CONT’D)
                        Please, Thalia - don’t just barge--

           But Thalia is already inside of--

           GIDEON’S OFFICE

           The room is all Eastern minimalism - a rock garden, a 
           burbling fountain.  

                                 THALIA
                        You have an operative trying to 
                        destroy London?

                                 GIDEON
                        She has not been performing to my 
                        satisfaction.  I put extra eyes on 
                        her in case she went off the rails 
                        again.  And she’s gone off the 
                        rails again.

                                 THALIA
                        I’ve got her under control. 

                                 GIDEON
                        I disagree.  Codex is spinning out, 
                        and I’m putting a stop to it.  
           INT. CATHEDRAL HEADQUARTERS - SAME

           Thalia rockets out of Gideon’s office and past Derek.

                                 DEREK
                        Your mug?

           Thalia grabs the mug from Derek’s hand and CHUCKS IT against 
           the wall.

           EXT.  COURTYARD - SAME

           London and Alex have found a quiet courtyard - a retreat from 
           the crowd and a chance to regroup.  

                                 LONDON
                        We need to get a better position.  

           London’s eyes rove the courtyard, they stop on the balcony 
           directly above them, then the rooftops beyond.  

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        We need to get up--

           A BLAST CRACKS behind them.

           They flinch and turn - a smoking-fresh BULLETHOLE blistered 
           into the wall directly between them, a plume of plaster dust 
           hanging in the air.  

           London regards the rooftops - breathlessly still.

           Then movement - a muzzle glints in the sun.

           London grabs Alex’s arm, flinging him behind her as another 
           bullet POCKS THE WALL exactly where Alex was a second before.

                                 ALEX
                        Where is he?

                                 LONDON
                        Not him.  They.  Always They.

           London’s eyes flick up to the rooftops, Alex’s follow.

           Sure enough, we see Them on the rooftop: THREE BALACLAVA-CLAD 
           SNIPERS and their MUZZLED RIFLES.  

           Bullets clip through the air as London works overtime to WHIP 
           and FLING Alex out of the line of fire.  

           London tosses Alex behind a metal dumpster as bullets PING 
           against the other side.  
                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        We can take the fire escape and 
                        eliminate them from the roof.

                                 ALEX
                        You’re going after them?

                                 LONDON
                        They won’t quit.  Ever.  Not until 
                        I make them.  I’ll tell you when to 
                        follow me.  

           London runs across the courtyard with the M9 aimed toward 
           God.  A wake of bullets splinters the ground behind her as 
           she returns fire.  

           Alex eyeballs the fire escape.  It’s too high - he knows 
           there’s no way she’ll reach it.  

           Time stops as London CATAPULTS HERSELF across the impossible 
           distance to the bottom of the fire escape and tugs it down.

           She aims toward one of the Balaclavas.  Her first shot is a 
           near-miss.  Her second shot knocks him off the roof.  

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        Come on.  

           London looks back to Alex as she begins her ascent.  He’s 
           perfectly still.  Completely overwhelmed.  

           London reaches the second floor and hunkers down, assessing 
           her shot.

           A Balaclava peers over the ridge of the terra-cotta rooftop.  

           She blasts a tile directly in front of him and a disorienting 
           spray of ceramic dust clouds his view.  

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        You can follow me or deal with 
                        these guys on your own.  I’ll give 
                        you cover, but you have to move 
                        now.

           Alex follows the trail of bullet holes toward the fire 
           escape, lunging for the lowest rung.  His grip is weak and 
           sweaty.  He makes it up a rung, then another, before he 
           tumbles to the ground.  

           Alex tries again, grabbing hold of the BOTTOM RUNG.  

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        Just hold on.  
           In a demonstration of impossible strength, London HEAVES THE 
           ENTIRE LADDER - Alex and all - up to the second floor.

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        Get to the roof, I’m right behind 
                        you.

           Alex races up the next floor as the Dust-faced Balaclava 
           regains his bearings and resumes firing at London.  

           London matches his shots until she finally NAILS HIS 
           SHOULDER.  She snaps out another shot and BLOOD GEYSERS FROM 
           HIS NECK.  

           London follows Alex up the final ladder.  

           EXT.  ROOFTOP - SAME

           London spots Alex cowering behind a chimney, no sign of the 
           third Balaclava.  She kneels beside him.  

                                 ALEX
                        I - the other one - I just saw him.  
                        He has a ba- ba- 

           Alex gestures to his shoulder.

                                 LONDON
                        Backpack?

           London peers over the chimney and spots him, the third 
           Balaclava.  And over his shoulder is a--

                                 ALEX
                        Bazooka.

                                 LONDON
                        Oh.  

           London approaches Bazooka Boy.  

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        You’re about to make some serious 
                        noise.  

                                 BAZOOKA BOY
                        I’ve been given permission to be as 
                        loud as necessary.  

           London charges across the terra-cotta tiles.

           She takes aim - she’s got him in her sights, an easy shot.  
           But before she can unload on him, BAZOOKA BOY FIRES.  
           The shell SLO-MO WHIRLS through the air before it SLAMS into 
           London’s LEFT SHOULDER, exploding in a BLISTERING FIREBALL 
           that swallows her whole.

           WIDE ON an obliterating blow that SHOCKWAVES across the 
           rooftop tiles and kicks Alex backward. 

           An impenetrable RINGING blares.  

                                 BAZOOKA BOY (CONT’D)
                    (to Alex)
                        There’s no need for this to be 
                        loud.  Or painful.

           Bazooka Boy sets his weapon down and pulls a VICIOUS KNIFE 
           from his belt.  

                                 BAZOOKA BOY (CONT’D)
                        But it sure can be.

           A jack-o'-lantern grin spreads across Bazooka Boy’s face just 
           as a CURTAIN OF BLOOD waterfalls from his throat.  

           Bazooka Boy CRUMPLES to the ground.  

           Behind him: LONDON, STANDING IN THE WRECKAGE THAT SHOULD’VE 
           KILLED HER.  That should’ve killed anyone.

           She has a WEDGE OF TERRA-COTTA TILE in her hand, blood 
           dripping off.  And she’s fine - save for SPARKING WIRES and 
           VISCOUS GEL bleeding out from her shredded left arm.

           Though it takes a second to register, we see that LONDON IS A 
           ROBOT.

           Alex takes some spastic, huffing breaths before BLACKING OUT.  

           London looks at her arm, eyes wide and uncertain as the 
           dangling mechanics move erratically. 

                                 THALIA (O.S.)
                        What’s going on with the asset?

           LONDON’S P.O.V.: We angle on Alex, then down on our own arm - 
           damaged mechanical errata - wires and unnerving organic 
           connective tissue.  

           She HEAVES Alex over her shoulder and WE--

                                          MATCH CUT TO
           INT.  CATHEDRAL HQ - THALIA’S OFFICE - SAME

           London’s P.O.V. is visible on a WALL-SIZED SCREEN.  Thalia, 
           Gideon, and Hugh watch the action from London’s perspective 
           and we realize that LONDON’S EYES ARE CAMERAS reporting back 
           to HQ in real time.  

           Thalia’s office is head-to-toe glass and million-dollar views 
           of a metropolis beyond. 

                                 GIDEON
                        London’s blatantly disregarded 
                        mission directives and now she’s 
                        wiped out my recovery team.  

                                 THALIA
                        You shouldn’t have sent them if you 
                        wanted them back alive.  I told you 
                        she’s capable of extraordinary 
                        things.

                                 GIDEON
                        She’s a machine, Thalia.  A very 
                        expensive calculator.  But a 
                        calculator doesn’t subtract if you 
                        tell it to add - what is going on 
                        with her?

                                 HUGH
                        She’s making choices.  We gave her 
                        a personality, and it seems to have 
                        grown without us.  I think there’s 
                        a consciousness here.  Something we 
                        didn’t create. 

                                 GIDEON
                        Activate the fail-safe.

                                 HUGH
                        We can’t just destroy her, Sir. 
                        What if this is the moment that AI 
                        developed sentience.  History will 
                        be measured as things that happened 
                        before this moment and things that 
                        happened after it.

                                 GIDEON
                        No it won’t, because you’re going 
                        to turn her off. 

                                 THALIA
                        Her fail-safe charge is too massive 
                        to fry her in public.

                                 THALIA (CONT'D)
                        She’s a walking warhead.  That kind 
                        of charge could knockout a city 
                        block. 

                                 GIDEON
                        That’s why we put it in there, 
                        isn’t it?  To destroy every trace 
                        of her should we need to.  So 
                        destroy every trace of her.

           Gideon’s out the door as Hugh shoots Thalia an anxious look. 

                                 THALIA
                        Ignore him.  We play this close to 
                        the chest and get her back in one 
                        piece.

           FROM ABOVE we move down toward Barcelona’s arterial C-31 
           highway.  

           CLOSER STILL as we spot a TESLA hurtling through traffic with 
           hair-raising precision - urgent and furious amidst the drowsy 
           afternoon commute.  

           INT.  TESLA - SAME

           London steers with tactical agility, despite only having use 
           of one hand, which she occasionally removes from the wheel to 
           touch her blasted arm.  

           She doesn’t flinch, even as the mechanics inside respond 
           frantically to her touch.  Alex rouses in the passenger seat.  

                                 ALEX
                        Let me out.

                                 LONDON
                        I can’t.

                                 ALEX
                        Kill me.  Just get it over with.

                                 LONDON
                        If I wanted you dead, I would’ve 
                        left you to rot on that roof.  I’m 
                        not going to kill you, I saved your 
                        life.

                                 ALEX
                        Why?
                                 LONDON
                        Because I care about you.

                                 ALEX
                        Care about me?  You’re a robot.  
                        Robots don’t care.

                                 LONDON
                        An hour ago, I was a woman on a 
                        job.  Now--

           Her eyes move to her shredded arm, and the mechanical 
           ephemera inside.

                                 ALEX
                    (re: the road)
                        Look out!

           London narrowly dodges a road-side accident.

                                 LONDON
                        Now I have no clue what I am.  
                        Everything I’ve ever known has been 
                        a lie.  Everything.  I know you’re 
                        scared.  I am too. 

                                 ALEX
                        That’s not possible.  

                                 LONDON
                        Those cards in your flat?  I’ve 
                        seen cards like those hundreds of 
                        times.  Cathedral used them to 
                        imprint my mission briefs.  But 
                        yours were different.  They flicked 
                        a switch inside me.  It felt like 
                        waking up.  Like seeing colors I 
                        never knew existed before.  When my 
                        boss told me to kill you, I 
                        couldn’t.  Not after what those 
                        cards did to me, not after what you 
                        told me.  Something changed last 
                        night.  I need you to fix me, and 
                        then I’ll let you go.  Please. 

           Alex eyes London, unsure if he can believe her.  Despite his 
           reservations, there’s a genuine panic in her voice that he’d 
           be an asshole to ignore. 

                                 ALEX
                        I’ve seen hardware like yours 
                        before, stuff that was in beta at 
                        Cathedral.

                        Advanced AI that I used to test 
                        some of my flashcard prototypes on.  

           A dawning realization:

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        My cards never worked on human 
                        subjects, only computer models.  
                        And that was the point.  Cathedral 
                        never wanted to program people, 
                        they wanted to program AI.  My 
                        programming language not only 
                        works, it generated sentience.  It 
                        generated you.  

           Alex takes a moment for himself.  A quiet celebration. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit.  I could win the Noble 
                        Prize.  I think I will win it. 

                                 LONDON
                        Remind me to buy you a drink 
                        sometime, but for now?

           London gestures to her arm. 

                                 ALEX
                        Cathedral must be using something 
                        inside you to track us.  We need to 
                        disable it, and then I’ll take a 
                        look.

           Echoing.  

           Empty.  

           Unnerving and still.  

           The Tesla rips through the silence as it enters frame and 
           screeches to a stop.
           INT. TESLA - UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - SAME

           The stillness of the parking garage is only amplified by the 
           tense silence between London and Alex.  

                                 LONDON
                        Your plan is to hang out in a

                                 ALEX
                        This far underground should put you 
                        out of range of whatever’s tracking 
                        you.  You have a better idea?  I’m 
                        all ears.

           Thalia stares at the massive monitors that stand sentinel 
           over her office, relaying footage from London’s P.O.V.  

           As London and Alex enter the underground parking garage, 
           London’s P.O.V. glitches, and the monitors are swallowed by 
           static. 

                                 THALIA
                        She’s gone rogue.  Maybe Gideon was 
                        about the failsafe.  Christ.  What 
                        have we done?

                        Hold still.

           In a stomach-churning moment, Alex peels back London's 
           synthetic skin and peers inside her.  

           Alex shines his garish cellphone light INSIDE OF LONDON’S 
           BODY.

           London’s internal ephemera is a mix of recognizable tech and 
           bleeding-edge mechanics.  

           It comes strangely close to being legitimately organic.

           Alex looks at the photo.

           Alex leans back in and squints, taking a closer look at 
           London’s synthetic skin, at the soft blue light emanating 
           from inside of her.

                        It doesn’t look good.  Your systems 
                        will lose functionality if you we 
                        don’t get you fixed.  First goes 
                        your geocoordination.  Then memory.  
                        Then energy.  And then you die.  

                                 LONDON
                        I die?

           It’s the first time she’s thought about that.

           London starts to take arrhythmic, panicked breaths. 

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        In my line of work, dying was 
                        always a risk.  I’ve thought about 
                        it before, but it’s a different 
                        thing to feel it.  It’s like I 
                        can’t breathe, can’t move.  

                                 ALEX
                        Relax.  What you’re feeling is 
                        fear.  Fear is good.  Fear is your 
                        body fighting back.  Take a deep 
                        breath.  One more.  There it is.  
                        Calm down, we’re not going to let 
                        you die.  I won’t let you die, you 
                        understand?

           London nods, her fear abated just so.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        If you’re anything close to what I 
                        think you are, if you’re something 
                        more than machine and more than 
                        human, then we need to get you 
                        fixed.  We have to permanently 
                        disable whatever’s tracking you.

                                 LONDON
                        How?

           Alex looks around, searching for a good idea.  

           He eyeballs the Tesla.
           INT.  PARKING GARAGE - MINUTES LATER

           We follow a set of HEAVY JUMPER CABLES as they snake from a 
           car battery across the concrete floor.  The RED TERMINAL ends 
           in Alex’s hand, where he’s using a BLADE SCREWDRIVER to strip 
           it of its protective lining.  As for the BLACK TERMINAL...  

                                 ALEX
                        The human body isn’t conductive 
                        enough to be electrocuted by 
                        something this low-voltage.  But 
                        whatever this fluid seems like it 
                        can carry a charge. 

           The BLACK TERMINAL is already stripped and COILED AROUND 
           LONDON’S RIGHT ARM - snaking up, wound with deadly potential.  

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        It might short your geocoordination 
                        system, but it might fry everything 
                        else, too.  You sure you want to do 
                        this?  

                                 LONDON
                        Compared to the bazooka, I’d say 
                        it’s an improvement.  

                                 ALEX
                        What do I do if you die, or stop 
                        working?

                                 LONDON
                        You run.

           Without waiting for anymore back-and-forth, London grabs the 
           stripped red terminal from Alex’s hand.  

           A sharp CRACK! blasts as white hot electricity pulses into 
           London’s arm and sends her ROCKETING backward.  

           London’s small frame SLAMS into the CONCRETE SUPPORT BEAM and 
           slides to the floor, limp.  Her arm SPUTTERS gel onto the 
           concrete.  Black smoke billows from the car battery.  

                                 ALEX
                        London?

           He kneels beside her.  Touches her and recoils.  Her body’s 
           hot.  

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Fuck.  Fuckfuckfuck.
                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                    (O.S., in Spanish)
                        What’re you doing?

           Alex turns and finds a PORTLY PARKING ATTENDANT watching, his 
           nightstick aimed in Alex’s direction.  

           It’s hard to fault him for being worried.

           In fact, from the Parking Attendant’s P.O.V., it looks like 
           Alex has down something very cruel to the pretty girl on the 
           ground below him.

                                 ALEX
                        It’s not what it looks like. 

           The Parking Attendant pulls out his cellphone, about to call 
           in the guards when London SITS STRAIGHT UP with a MASSIVE 
           GULP OF AIR.

               PARKING ATTENDANT
                                      ALEX (CONT'D)
            (in Spanish)
                                Oh, thank God. 
           Oh, my God.

           The Parking Attendant does a one-eighty and books it, 
           stumbling over himself to get the hell out of here. 

           Alex rushes to the car and unlatches the jumper cables.  Back 
           to London, he lifts her off the ground.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Did it work?

                                 LONDON
                        I hope so, because I’m not doing it 
                        again.  

           London snaps the sharp ends of shattered filament off of her 
           damaged arm like twigs from a tree, and tossing them to the 
           ground.  

           Alex touches the gel spilling out of London’s arm. 

                                 ALEX
                        We need to stem this immediately.

                                 LONDON
                        Do you know anyone who could help?

           Off of Alex’s look--
           INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

           We PUSH THROUGH a crowd of MEN raining singles on the 
           catwalk. 

           Onstage, TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN in FRENCH MAID outfits pantomime 
           the world’s sexiest cleaning routine. 

           On the other side of the crowd, CLAUDIO FALCONI (50s) pulls 
           CUPCAKE (late teens) onto his lap. 

                                 CLAUDIO
                        Cupcake, I’m not much for crowds.  
                        Is there somewhere we can go that’s 
                        more private?

           Cupcake smiles and leads Claudio by his tie. 

           INT. STRIP CLUB - CHAMPAGNE ROOM - LATER

           CLOSE ON Cupcake snapping back a nostril-full of coke.

           Claudio flicks some on her bare chest and gives it a lick.

                                 CLAUDIO
                        As much fun as this is, I think we 
                        could have a lot more fun somewhere 
                        else. 

           Cupcake smiles. 

           INT. STRIP CLUB - COAT CHECK - LATER

           Claudio tosses his coatcheck ticket at VINCENT (30s), a 
           mostly unassuming strip club underling. 

           We follow Vincent through row after row of coats, before 
           stopping at a black trench.  He checks that the numbers 
           match.

           They do, and Vincent discreetly removes a GLASS VIAL from his 
           pocket.

           Inside the vial: a spider with a splotch of red on its back. 

           Vincent flicks the vial, angering the spider.  He unscrews it 
           and tamps the reluctant spider into Falconi’s jacket pocket. 

           We follow Vincent and the jacket back to Falconi.

           Falconi drapes the jacket over his shoulders and flicks a 
           single at Vincent. 
           INT. LIMO - MINUTES LATER

           Cupcake is all over Falconi, and his hands are all over her. 

           We go EXTREMELY CLOSE on the jacket pocket in time to spot 
           the spider climbing out.  It dances over fabric and skin, 
           tiny legs tickling Falconi’s neck. 

           The spider pulls back and reveals its fangs.  Just as it 
           moves to sink its fangs into Falconi--

           Falconi’s tongue draws a line up Cupcakes cleavage before he 
           freezes and SLAPS HIS HAND AGAINST HIS NECK.

                                 CLAUDIO
                        Fucking hell!

                                 CUPCAKE
                        What’s good, baby?

           Claudio leans forward.  The girl screams.

                                 CUPCAKE (CONT’D)
                        Spider!

                                 CLAUDIO
                        I get it?

                                 CUPCAKE
                        I hope so.

                                 CLAUDIO
                        Fuckin’ arachnids.

           Claudio reaches across cupcake and knocks out another bump of 
           coke. He Hoovers the bump, his eyes rolling back.  But 
           Falconi’s eyes don’t relax.  His face frozen.

                                 CUPCAKE
                        Baby?

           Claudio’s face slackens as a milky froth begins to seep from 
           his mouth, and  rivulet of blood dribbles from his eyes.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Vincent watches a news report cover the strange death of 
           Claudio Falconi.

                                 REPORTER
                        - the Phoneutria Fera has been 
                        described by specialists as the 
                        world’s most deadly spider -
           INT.  CATHEDRAL HQ - THALIA’S OFFICE - SAME

           Thalia watches the same news report on her in-office monitor.

                                 REPORTER
                        - native to Brazil, where corporate 
                        whistleblower Claudio Falconi was 
                        allegedly seeking asylum - 

           Thalia dials a number and puts a telephone headset to her 
           ears.

           Thalia sits on her desk, gnawing anxiously at a hangnail.  

                                 THALIA
                        You did good work with Falconi.  

                                 VINCENT
                        I always do good work.

                                 THALIA
                        The spider was a particularly 
                        savage approach.

                                 VINCENT
                        What do you want Thalia?  Last I 
                        checked you’re no longer my 
                        handler.

                                 THALIA
                        I need a favor.  A one-time job.  
                        The others are incapable of 
                        wrangling my asset.  I need someone 
                        without reservations.  

                                 VINCENT
                        Funny.  The last conversation we 
                        had, you told me that my lack of 
                        reservations was the exact thing 
                        that would keep me from working 
                        with you in the future.

                                 THALIA
                        My opinion of you has changed.  

                                 VINCENT
                        My opinion of you hasn’t.   

                                 THALIA
                        I’m in deep here, Vincent.  I need 
                        a savage. 

                                 VINCENT
                        When do I start?
           EXT.  SELMA’S VILLA - DAY

           Alex and London stand in front of a rustic Spanish estate.  
           Alex looks to London and tugs his shirt straight.

                                 ALEX
                        How do I look?

                                 LONDON
                        Nervous. 

                                 ALEX
                        I’m not nervous.

                                 LONDON
                        You’re bad at lying.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m a great liar, I’m just bad at 
                        lying about her. 

           An eighty-year-old ABUELA answers.  

                                 LONDON
                        Not quite who I was expecting.  

           [N.B.  - The following scene is spoken entirely in Spanish 
           and subtitled in English unless noted otherwise.]

                                 ABUELA
                        Oh no, not again.  She loved you, 
                        asshole.

                                 ALEX
                        No no, Abuela.  No no.  

                                 ABUELA
                        And who is this?  You bring another 
                        woman to protect you from me?  He 
                        can be sweet.  But don’t fall for 
                        his charms.  He’s also an idiot.

                                 SELMA (O.S.)
                        Who’s an idiot?

           The room turns its attention to the woman standing down the 
           hall.  Her name is SELMA VERACRUZ (30s).  

           It’s clear Selma could’ve been a model if her equally 
           stunning IQ hadn’t demanded she do something for the greater 
           good.

                                 SELMA (CONT’D)
                        I asked you not to visit me here.
                                 ALEX
                        I don’t have anywhere else.

                                 ABUELA
                        Try a prison.  

                                 SELMA
                        Abuela, please. 

                                 ALEX
                        I’m not here about us.  I promise.  
                        London, show her.

           London angles her arm just so, exposing the technological 
           sinew inside her body.

           Abuela’s eyes go wide.  She stumbles back and crosses her 
           chest.

                                 ABUELA
                        My god, she’s a Terminator.

           Rather than stumble away, Selma approaches with instant 
           curiosity.  

                                 SELMA
                        What is this?

                                 ALEX
                        So I was at this rave in India-- 

           Off of Selma’s face--

           INT.  SELMA’S VILLA - LATER

           Alex and Selma lean into London’s exposed viscera with a 
           professional curiosity. 

                                 ALEX
                        -- and I thought you might be able 
                        to help.  

           Selma pulls back from London.

                                 SELMA
                        I can’t believe you slept with it.

                                 ALEX
                        Selma--

                                 SELMA
                        After all we’d been through 
                        together, you just walked away.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 SELMA (CONT'D)
                        You ruined me.  And the next time I 
                        see you is four years later when 
                        you bring this thing--

                                 ALEX
                        It’s not like that.

                                 SELMA
                        Then how is it like?

                                 ALEX
                        After all of the work I did for 
                        Cathedral, I thought that I was a 
                        failure.  But she’s proof that I’m 
                        not.  So can you fix her?

                                 SELMA
                        No.  Absolutely not.  I don’t have 
                        any of my tools, I don’t have an 
                        assistant, I don’t even know what 
                        she is. 

           London’s face folds under the weight of her fear.

                                 LONDON
                        Please try?  I don’t want to die.

                                 SELMA
                        Die?  Seems like an overstatement.

                                 ALEX
                        It’s not, Selma.  She authentically 
                        feels.

                                 SELMA
                        How?

                                 ALEX
                        I don’t know.  But I think it has 
                        to do with my Codex cards. 

                                 SELMA
                        You’re serious? 

           London nods.  Selma softens as it lands that London might 
           actually be more than a machine. 

                                 SELMA (CONT’D)
                        I might be able to reconnect some 
                        torn wires, solder some circuitry, 
                        but she’s a decade ahead of 
                        anything I know.  Maybe two.  
                                 ALEX
                        Do you recognize this?

           Alex shows Selma his phone, the photo of the insignia that he 
           took while peering inside of London.  

                                 SELMA
                        My God.  
                    (reverentially)
                        Paolo.  

                                 LONDON
                        Who?

                                 SELMA
                        See that little Fleur de Lis?  
                        That’s his insignia.  It’s Paolo 
                        Dos Santos.  A Brazilian 
                        prosthetics developer.  He’s 
                        responsible for the past two 
                        decades of advancements in 
                        prosthetics.   He could fix her, if 
                        you could find him.  But he’s made 
                        a point of being difficult to get 
                        in touch with.  Disappeared a few 
                        years ago.  I have a contact who 
                        may be able to help, but he only 
                        does face-to-face.  

                                 LONDON
                        I can travel, if you can get me 
                        documents.  

                                 SELMA
                        Won’t be a problem.  In the 
                        meantime, I can take a look at your 
                        arm.  

                                 LONDON
                        Thank you. 

                                 ALEX
                        Who’s the contact, Selma?

                                 SELMA
                        A friend.  In New Orleans.

                                 ALEX
                        Jesus.  It’s Lotus?  Unbelievable.

           Alex moves to the window and feigns a sudden interest in the 
           view.
                                 LONDON
                        Who’s Lotus?

                                 ALEX
                        Lotus DeMarco.  Selma’s ex. His 
                        real name isn’t even Lotus, it’s 
                        Terry. 

                                 SELMA
                        He’s doing big things, Alex.  He’s 
                        rebuilding New Orleans basically by 
                        himself.  

                                 ALEX
                        I heard he’s living in a swamp.  

                                 SELMA
                        He knows your guy Paolo, want me to 
                        set up a meet and greet or not?

                                 LONDON
                        Yes.  We do. 

                                 ALEX
                        Fine.  So we chat with Lotus - your 
                        ex - we locate Paolo, fix you, and 
                        we take Cathedral down.  

                                 LONDON
                        Alex.  You should stay here.  Lay 
                        low.

                                 ALEX
                        And wait to be killed?  You said it 
                        yourself: you’re the only way I 
                        don’t get killed.  Besides, there 
                        isn’t a programmer on Earth who’d 
                        walk away from you. 

           INT.  SELMA’S VILLA - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Alex chops an onion under Abuela’s heavy gaze.

                                 ABUELA
                        You chop like you’re afraid of the 
                        onion.  

                                 ALEX
                        I’m afraid of you, Abuela.  

           Abuela takes the knife from Alex and begins chopping with 
           unencumbered fury.  We PUSH PAST them and into the--
           LIVING ROOM

           -- where London reclines on the couch beneath an oppressive 
           BRIGHT LIGHT.  Selma draws a WHIRRING SOLDERING IRON into 
           London’s arm. 

                                 LONDON
                    (re: the conversation in 
                     the other room)
                        He did something horrible to you.

                                 SELMA
                        He did a lot of horrible things, 
                        actually.  

                                 LONDON
                        Then why did you let him back in 
                        tonight?

                                 SELMA
                        Because I love him, even after 
                        everything that happened between 
                        us.  And love makes a fool out of 
                        everyone.   

                                 LONDON
                        You trust him?  

                                 SELMA
                        I do.

                                 LONDON
                        And me?  Do you trust me?

                                 SELMA
                        I have no reason not to.

                                 LONDON
                        My job is murder.  And maybe I like 
                        Alex.  Maybe I want him all to 
                        myself.

           Selma’s face pinches together - is London threatening her?

           Selma pulls the soldering iron out from beneath London’s 
           artificial skin.  

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        I’m just fucking with you. 

                                 SELMA
                        A robot with a sense of humor.
                                 LONDON
                        I think you should stop calling me 
                        that. 

                                 SELMA
                        I stemmed the fluid. But it’s a 
                        temporary fix, at best.  

           London flexes, looks to Selma with a smile.

           Selma stands, flicks off the light.  

                                 LONDON
                    (sotto)
                        I was just kidding. 

           London sits in shadows as Selma joins Alex and her Abuela in 
           the kitchen.  

           She watches Selma and Alex settle into a familiar rhythm 
           together, even Abuela cracks a smile as they sit down to eat. 

           London’s transfixed.  Fascination and jealousy waging war in 
           her eyes. 

           EXT.  SELMA’S VILLA - DAY

           London has concealed her devastated appendage beneath a 
           shawl, but if you didn’t know any better, you’d think she 
           looks good.  For his part, Alex seems more fortified, ready 
           for the next challenge.  

           It’s Selma who looks worried.  

                                 SELMA
                        Don’t go Alex.  You already 
                        disappeared once.  Stay here.  No 
                        one’ll suspect I helped you.  You 
                        ruined me.  Remember?

           London watches as Selma leans in to kiss Alex, but he turns, 
           and the kiss lands on his cheek. 

           Selma’s eyes meet London’s.

                                 ALEX
                        Even under the strangest of 
                        circumstances, it’s always great to 
                        see you Selma. 

           Selma shakes herself free of Alex and hurries inside. 
           EXT.  SKY - DAY

           A 747 approaches 30,000 feet and evens out. 

                                            PRE-LAP:

                                 LONDON (O.S.)
                        You should’ve kissed her.

           INT.  AIRPLANE - DAY

           The DULL DRONE of the plane’s engines sits like a blanket 
           over the cabin.

                                 ALEX
                        I don’t want to hurt her.

                                 LONDON
                        She wanted you to kiss her.

                                 ALEX
                        Sometimes what a person wants is 
                        different from what they need, and 
                        right now, Selma needs me to get 
                        out of her life.  

                                 LONDON
                        You love her.  It’s simple.

                                 ALEX
                        It’s the least simple thing in the 
                        world.  Being human is complicated.  
                        I’d just end up hurting her again.  
                        The most loving thing I can do for 
                        her, is to let her live her life 
                        without me in it.  It hurts me more 
                        than it hurts her, but at some 
                        point I just won’t feel it anymore. 

                                 LONDON
                        I remember living without feeling.  
                        It was part of my job.  It was my 
                        whole life, actually.  And I 
                        promise, you don’t want to live 
                        like that.  

                                 ALEX
                        How far back do you remember?

           London considers the question and we-- 

                                            FLASH ON
           QUICK MONTAGE

           -- INSIDE OF A BLEAK ORPHANAGE.  Grim concrete walls hold a 
           semi-permanent chill in the air.  A timid, twelve-year-old 
           YOUNG LONDON cradles a worn-out STUFFED RABBIT, her only 
           comfort in the world.

           -- A SHADOWY MAN with a BRIGHT RED TIE, his face obscured, 
           points at Young London and her stuffed rabbit.  

           -- OUTSIDE, the man in the red tie leads Young London and her 
           stuffed rabbit away from the orphanage.  The man’s face 
           remains unseen as he kneels in front of London and grabs her 
           stuffed rabbit.  She puts up a bit of a protest, but one look 
           back at the orphanage is enough for her to let go of her 
           past, and the rabbit.  She hands the stuffed animal over and 
           the man replaces it in her hand with a BLACK BULLET, which 
           she stares at with fascination.  The man brushes London’s 
           hair out of her face as she stares at the bullet.

           -- London, now a young woman, in various types of training - 
           JUDO, WEIGHTS, TRIGONOMETRY and HISTORY.  

           -- London, in the holding cell we opened on, as Thalia 
           flashes CARD after CARD after CARD.  

           -- London BASHING A DAPPER MAN’S HEAD INTO A MARBLE BUST.

           -- London tugging the visor down on a helmet before rocketing 
           off on a DUCATI, tearing through serpentine San Francisco 
           streets.  

           -- London riding a train as it barrels through Tuscany, 
           beside her, a man laughing and flirting.

           -- That same man, blood spiraling around him as he bleeds out 
           in a ritzy hotel shower.

           -- London in the field, disguise after disguise.  Life after 
           life. 

           -- London, LAUGHING inside the Louvre with Melanie Gaines.  

           -- Gaines’ Little Girl stares at London through terrified 
           eyes. 

           BACK INSIDE THE PLANE

                                 LONDON
                        I remember all of the awful things 
                        I did for Cathedral.  The looks on 
                        dozens of faces as I ended life 
                        after life after life.  
           London’s face betrays her.  For a moment, she seems swept up 
           in the emotion of what she’s spent her life doing.  She can’t 
           maintain eye contact with Alex. 

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        I remember a whole life, but I have 
                        no idea who I actually am.

           INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY

           Vincent stares at the cracked concrete wall.  He runs his 
           finger down the jagged splinter.  He reaches to the ground 
           and picks up the JUMPER CABLES.

           We GO WIDER to find the Parking Attendant from before, 
           smoking beside Vincent.

                                 ATTENDANT
                    (in Spanish)
                        She was sizzling, bro.  Out her 
                        damn eyeballs.  So I started to 
                        kick his ass, but he ran off before 
                        I could get a real beating in.  

           Vincent picks up the piece of filament that London snapped 
           off of her arm, piecing together exactly what happened here.  

           Vincent speaks into his smartphone.

                                 VINCENT
                        The asset is significantly damaged.  
                        If I were her, I’d be looking for a 
                        mechanic.

           EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU - DAY

           Alligators slosh out of the way as a noisy-as-hell fanboat 
           cuts a line through silty backwaters.

           CARD: Louisiana, USA. 

           INT./EXT. FANBOAT - SAME

           London cradles her arm as Alex HOLLERS over the fan at the 
           HARDASS CREOLE CAPTAIN.

                                 ALEX
                        Where is this fucking place?

           The Hardass looks sideways at Alex, points to his ears and 
           shrugs. 
           LATER

           The fanboat hums to a stop as it approaches a dock jutting 
           out from the marshland.  This is--

           LOTUS DEMARCO’S COMPOUND

           The fanboat glides toward the dock, where MARISSA DAHAN 
           stands waiting.  An assertive woman in her 30s, Marissa is 
           already extending her hand for Alex before the fanboat has 
           even had a chance to stop.

                                 MARISSA
                        Alex Donovan, such a pleasure.  You 
                        must be London.  I’m Marissa Dahan, 
                        Lotus’s aide.  He’s so looking 
                        forward to your visit.

           EXT. LOTUS DEMARCO’S COMPOUND - SAME

           Marissa drives Alex and London through the compound on a 
           ghost-quiet ELECTRIC CART which steers itself autonomously 
           past GEODESIC DOMES and fields of SOLAR PANELING. 

                                 MARISSA
                        We’re incredibly proud of what we 
                        have here.  It’s the world’s 
                        greatest think tank.  

           INT. LOTUS DEMARCO’S COMPOUND - COMMUNAL SPACE - LATER

           Marissa leads London and Alex through the communal space-
           turned-dining hall.  

           The crowd is young and unironic.  These are people who, just 
           like the revelers at Goa, are searching for meaning.  

           Their attention radiates around a small-framed man in his 
           30s. His deceptively calm exterior is a distinct attempt at 
           hiding the fact that he’s a short fuse away from exploding at 
           all times.  His name is TERRY “LOTUS” DEMARCO.

                                 LOTUS
                        -- and I started to think, y’know? 
                        What we’re doing is special, but we 
                        must fight to make it great, and in 
                        order to be great, we must ask 
                        better questions.  We need to think 
                        on a cosmic scale.  

           Lotus turns and stares straight at Alex.  
                                 LOTUS (CONT’D)
                        Gang, please welcome one of the 
                        greats.  A techno-polyglot and a 
                        stratospheric thinker, a guy who’s 
                        gone so off the grid I’d thought he 
                        might be dead.  Say “Hi” to Alex 
                        Donovan.

           The whole room says “Hi,” loud and in perfect unison.  

           EXT. LOTUS DEMARCO’S COMPOUND - LATER

           Lotus leads London and Alex across the grounds.  Marissa 
           follows.  

                                 LOTUS
                        So wonderful for old friends to 
                        stop by.

                                 ALEX
                        I wouldn’t say we’re friends.

                                 LOTUS
                        We’re friends by proximity.  How is 
                        Selma, anyway?  Such a special 
                        woman.  I keep telling her to come 
                        for a visit, I think she’d love it 
                        here.  Only thing I don’t love 
                        about setting up in Louisiana is 
                        the heat.  Otherwise, the locals 
                        keep their space and let us do our 
                        thing.  It’s very agreeable. 

                                 LONDON
                        What exactly is “your thing”?

                                 LOTUS
                        My “thing” is radically altering 
                        global consciousness.  You’re 
                        standing on ground zero for 
                        changing the world.

                                 LONDON
                        That sounds very altruistic.

                                 LOTUS
                        Thank you.  I do care for others, 
                        but between us, before this place, 
                        I might’ve been a little lonely.  
                        And now I’m not.

           Lotus drags a massive STEEL DOOR open and leads Alex and 
           London inside--
           THE BRAIN TRUST HANGAR

           Set amidst dozens of computers, 3D printers, and recreational 
           equipment, ENGINEERS and EGGHEADS are hard at work.  

                                 LOTUS
                        I’ve aggregated the greatest brains 
                        in the world.  I’ve bought their 
                        debt, I’m paying them beau coup, 
                        and they’re giving me brilliance in 
                        return.  Manufactured weather, 
                        fusion technologies, energy 
                        storage.  We’ve got our fingers in 
                        everything. 

                                 ALEX
                        Lots of money to be made.

                                 LOTUS
                        I’m just happy to help change the 
                        world.  So, Alex, how can I help 
                        you?

           Alex swallows his irritation.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m looking for Paolo Dos Santos.

                                 LOTUS
                        Oh, oh shit.  No.  That’s gonna be 
                        a no-go.  I’m so sorry, but no,  I 
                        can’t help you with that.  

                                 ALEX
                        Selma seemed to think you’d be able 
                        to connect us.

                                 LOTUS
                        I’m sorry, he and I have some 
                        seriously bad blood between us.  It 
                        wouldn’t be right.  

                                 ALEX
                        I’ve gotten myself into something 
                        huge, something that would make 
                        your bad blood good again.  I need 
                        your help.

                                 LOTUS
                        I already told you I cannot help 
                        you with that. Comprende?
                    (swallowing the venom)
                                 (MORE)
                                 LOTUS (CONT'D)
                        Besides, whatever it is you need 
                        from Paolo, I promise I can help 
                        you with it myself.  Look around, 
                        Alex.  I have resources.  What’ve 
                        you gotten yourself into?

           Alex looks to London.  

           She lowers her shawl and reveals her damaged hardware.

                                 LOTUS (CONT’D)
                        Pray tell Alex, what am I looking 
                        at?

                                 ALEX
                        The greatest AI the world’s ever 
                        seen.  And she’s hurt.

                                 LOTUS
                        Holy smoking shitballs.  Marissa?  
                        Let’s take London to meet SCOUT. 

           INT. LOTUS DEMARCO’S COMPOUND - CLEAN ROOM - LATER

           London sits on an examination table.  

           FIVE ROBOTIC ARMS reaching down from the ceiling, like 
           mechanical fingers ready to ball into a fist.

           Each arm ends in a PINCER-like claw, allowing the arms to 
           pick up, or pick at.  

                                 LOTUS (O.S.)
                        Who needs Paolo when you have 
                        SCOUT. Surgical Computerized 
                        Operations Utility Technician.  
                        She’s our automated medical 
                        technician.  She moonlights as a 
                        fabricator for some of our more 
                        ambitious projects.  I think she’ll 
                        be able to clean London up. 

           London shoots a glance toward a thick pane of reinforced 
           glass.  

           We PUSH PAST the glass and into the--

           OBSERVATION ROOM

           -- where Lotus and Alex watch Scout’s work.
           Marissa lurks in the background, her face illuminated by the 
           glow of a tablet in her hands.  

                                 LOTUS
                        She does in an hour what a team of 
                        surgeons took twelve to do. Between 
                        us pals, I cribbed most of SCOUT’S 
                        specs from auto manufacturing 
                        plants and robotic surgical units.  
                        Good artists borrow, great artists 
                        steal, right?  

           Lotus nods to Marissa, she enters commands on her tablet. 
           Behind them, in the Clean Room, SCOUT buzzes to life, 
           responding to Marissa’s orders.  

           The mechanical appendages prod and pick at London’s “wounds.”

                                 LOTUS (CONT’D)
                        I know you don’t like me, and I 
                        knew you must have serious reasons 
                        for coming if you’d get past your 
                        hostility in order to meet.  

           SCOUT continues to work on London.  Alex clocks that its 
           robotic arms might be moving with a bit too much force. 

                                 LOTUS (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad you did.  London’s going 
                        to change the world.  
                    (beat)
                        And she’s going to make us so much 
                        god damn money. 

                                 ALEX
                        Money?

                                 LOTUS
                        The applications for tech like this 
                        are endless.  It won’t be difficult 
                        for my people to reverse engineer 
                        whatever she is.  Think of all the 
                        applications for tech like this.  
                        Military, automotive, commercial.  
                        We’ll make better drones, better 
                        guns.  Hell, even better blenders. 

                                 ALEX
                        We just need her fixed.

           SCOUT is now really going after London, pushing her back, 
           overwhelming her and pinning her down.  
                                 LOTUS
                        Fixed.  And then what’s your plan?

                                 ALEX
                        We’re going to run. 

                                 LOTUS
                        That’s a pretty shitty plan.

           Inside the CLEAN ROOM, London resists SCOUT’s manipulations. 

                                 LOTUS (CONT’D)
                        No.  You’ll stay here.  There’s 
                        room, right Marissa?

                                 MARISSA
                        Plenty of comfortable options. 

                                 ALEX
                        I’m not staying.  Turn that thing 
                        off. 

           Inside the CLEAN ROOM, three of SCOUT’s arms have PINNED 
           LONDON to the table. A fourth arm works to clean her wounds.  
           The fifth arm moves to her head, grabbing London by the face 
           with its pincers, turning her as though examining her.

                                 LOTUS
                        You don’t really have much of a 
                        choice.  I didn’t get to where I am 
                        by seeing an opportunity like that 
                        and letting it walk out on me. 

                                 ALEX
                        She’s not your next opportunity.  
                        She’s my friend.  Stop that thing, 
                        it’s hurting her.

                                 LOTUS
                        Hurting her?  She’s incapable of 
                        being hurt.

                                 ALEX
                        You don’t know what you’re doing.  
                        She feels. 

           Alex LUNGES TOWARD THE GLASS.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Stop!  Turn it off!

           Alex turns to Lotus, white-hot fury in his face.  He moves 
           quick and WINDS BACK.  Just as Alex readies to throw a fist, 
           the smart end of a pistol presses against Alex’s temple.  
           WIDE ON Marissa pressing the gun to his head. 

                                 MARISSA
                        You need to calm down and get on 
                        your knees.  

           Alex lowers his fist. 

                                 LOTUS
                        I tried to play nice, Alex. 

           INT. CLEAN ROOM - SAME

           London struggles against SCOUT’s robotic arms. She side-eyes 
           the observation room, and realizes that Alex is in deep shit. 

           SCOUT’s appendages keep her pinned as one of the free robotic 
           arms moves its razor-sharp pincer hand to her torn biosynth 
           skin.  The pincer tugs at London’s skin, London writhes 
           beneath it.

           The pincer spins and snaps in front of London’s face, moving  
           in toward one of her eyes. 

                                 LONDON
                        Alex, help!

           But Alex is still on his knees, with the muzzle of Marissa’s 
           gun pressed against his forehead.  London clocks some 
           inaudible words pass between Lotus and Alex. 

           London watches as Lotus SLAMS a fist into Alex’s face, and 
           Alex crumples.

           The pincer flicks even closer to London’s face - freezing a 
           hair’s breadth away from her pupil.

           London twists in time to see Lotus CRACK! his knee into 
           Alex’s face. 

           The violence against Alex has a catalyzing effect on London, 
           filling her with a relentless fury.  As London’s rage 
           redlines, she makes quick work of TEARING herself free of her 
           restraints. 

           London maneuvers herself out from under the arms just so when 
           the arms ROAR back to life, trying to pin her back down.  

           SCOUT’s robotic arms whir above her, fighting to regain 
           control.

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        Alex!  Turn - them - off. 
           BACK INSIDE THE OBSERVATION ROOM

                                 MARISSA
                        Lotus--

           Lotus looks up from Alex’s bloody face and sees London 
           working overtime to disable the arms. 

           Lotus grabs the tablet control and enters commands, 
           increasing the robotic arms’ incredible ferocity.  London can 
           barely keep pace as she fights to fend the arms off.  

           Lotus and Marissa are distracted by the brawl inside the 
           clean room, so, fighting against the pain coursing through 
           his body, Alex seizes the moment, rising to his feet. 

           Alex grabs a STEEL CHAIR and slams it onto Lotus. 

           The pincers DOUBLE THEIR SPEED and London throws herself into 
           the fight with everything she’s got. 

           Marissa angles herself toward Alex, who performs a clumsy but 
           effective takedown.  His moves are the poor-man’s version of 
           what London did to the Hustler in Barcelona.  With Lotus and 
           Marissa briefly subdued, Alex grabs the control tablet and 
           ushers SCOUT to slow its moves. 

           London gains the upperhand and shears one of the arms out of 
           its socket. 

           Alex dials in more commands and the arms begin SLAMMING 
           AGAINST THE REINFORCED GLASS.

                                 LOTUS
                        Relax!  That’s billions of dollars 
                        of tech, Alex.

           The arms pummel themselves against the viewing window, 
           destroying themselves as cracks in the glass begin to 
           blossom.

           The arms breach the glass and London works with them to tear 
           down what’s left of it. 

           Alex dials in another command and the two remaining 
           serviceable arms extend menacingly toward Lotus and Marissa. 

           Alex kicks Lotus toward the pincers and commands them to grab 
           hold of him.  The pincers turn their vicious attention to 
           their master. 

                                 ALEX
                        Where is Paolo?
           EXT.  ATHENS - NIGHT

           The cradle of civilization.  A sea of white buildings rises 
           up onto the sides of the valley hills and mountains.

           CARD: Athens, Greece.

           EXT. ATHENS WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

           London leads Alex through sprawling warehouses in Athens’ 
           most industrial neighborhood.  

                                 LONDON
                        Paolo’s place is just around the 
                        corner.

           They turn a corner, but it’s a dead end.

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        It might’ve been a left, not right, 
                        back there.

           London looks around, a dizzying confusion has briefly 
           replaced her unwavering certainty.

                                 ALEX
                        Are you okay?

                                 LONDON
                        The jump start scrambled my 
                        tracking.  I have no sense of 
                        direction anymore.  I have no sense 
                        of anything anymore.  My memory’s 
                        wiped.

                                 ALEX
                        You’re just exhausted.  Welcome to 
                        the human race.   

           They take another turn and find a vast lot filled with 
           PLASTER SCULPTURES, knock-offs of the classics - 
           Michaelangelo’s DAVID,  the VENUS D’MILO.  All about four 
           feet tall, arranged like warriors on the verge of battle.  

           Alex points to a Fleur de Lis symbol above the effigies, it’s 
           identical to the insignia inside of London. 

           In the distance, a GRIZZLED MAN in his early 40s heaves a 
           latest edition into place amongst the others.  

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        That’s gotta be him.
           We’ll soon know him as PAOLO.

                                 LONDON
                        You sure?

                                 ALEX
                        No.

           London and Alex catch The Man’s attention. 

           Alex tries to lower himself further, but inadvertently knocks 
           a four-foot-tall DAVID to the ground.  

           In a heartbeat-reaction, the Man PULLS A GUN FROM HIS 
           WAISTBAND and POPS THREE SHOTS AT LONDON AND ALEX.

           London SNAPS A HAND OFF of one of the adjacent statues, 
           FLINGS IT at the Man and INSTANTLY DISARMS HIM.

           The Man stands in stunned awe before he approaches her, a 
           recognition erupting behind his eyes.   

                                 PAOLO
                        My name is Paolo.  I am your maker.  

                                 LONDON
                        I know.  I need your help.

           London shows Paolo her wounded shoulder.  

                                 PAOLO
                    (in Portuguese)
                        My God.

           INT. PAOLO’S STUDIO - MINUTES LATER

           Plaster dust hangs in the air.  SQUARES OF WET CLAY line the 
           walls.  Plaster models of faces rest on every surface.

                                 PAOLO
                        I’m so sorry about, y’know, 
                        shooting my gun at you.  I simply 
                        cannot be too careful.  Pray I 
                        didn’t do any of this damage?

                                 LONDON
                        No, no, that was a bazooka.

                        Then a very aggressive robot.  It’s 
                        been a long week.

                                 PAOLO
                        It hurts to see you like this, my 
                        darling.  Not only are you wounded, 
                        you’ve also been made into a 
                        weapon.  You were conceived of such 
                        noble ambitions, modeled after 
                        beauty and engineered to advance 
                        mankind.  Daphne would be 
                        devastated to see what you’ve 
                        become.

                                 LONDON
                        Daphne?

                                 PAOLO
                        Look around you.  

           CLOSE ON the smooth face of one of Paolo’s knock-off Venus 
           D’Milo’s.  

           It bares a strange resemblance to London.  

           We realize now that all of these female likenesses look quite 
           like London.  

                                 PAOLO (CONT’D)
                        This face is the face of the love 
                        of my life.  

                                 LONDON
                        You made me in her likeness?

                                 PAOLO
                        I make everything in her likeness.  
                        But I’m afraid none of it comes 
                        close, darling, not even you.  

           Paolo rises, grabs a photo, and hands it to London.

           We ANGLE ON the photo and see a younger version of Paolo on 
           an elegant boat, his arm WRAPPED AROUND LONDON.  

           The image MOVES WITH LIFE as we--

           EXT.  ELEGANT BOAT - SAME AS IN THE PICTURE - FLASHBACK

           Paolo and London’s original model, DAPHNE, laugh as the 
           camera’s bulb flashes.

                                 PAOLO (V.O.)
                        Our honeymoon.  The best thirty-six 
                        hours of my life.  We laughed, made 
                        love, planned for a future that 
                        would never come.  

           Paolo and Daphne kiss and knock champagne flutes.  

           INT.  PAOLO’S STUDIO - PRESENTLY, AS BEFORE

                                 PAOLO
                        She died, but I couldn’t say 
                        goodbye.  Bringing her back, even 
                        if only as a mechanical copy, 
                        became my work.  And my work was 
                        quite good.  Dynamic enough to 
                        attract the attention of a former 
                        colleague, Gideon Merriwether.  
                        Gideon invited to join him at 
                        Cathedral, to help them develop 
                        artificials for commercial 
                        applications: battlefield medics 
                        with friendly faces, space 
                        exploration without the need for 
                        food or water.  Your kind would 
                        help mankind without asking for any 
                        help yourself.  Our ambitions were 
                        lofty, and beautiful.  Of course, I 
                        knew that Cathedral was more than 
                        tech firm, that there was another 
                        side to Cathedral, but the money 
                        was there, the only way to bring 
                        you back to life.  And I did.  And 
                        then Thalia Parkes hijacked my 
                        work, to become a weapon.  She 
                        envisioned a new kind of killer.  
                        Project Codex.  It breaks my heart 
                        to see what you’ve become; designed 
                        to help the world, you’re now it’s 
                        most sophisticated weapon.  I can 
                        say with certainty that Cathedral 
                        will not stop until they’ve 
                        recovered their investment, or 
                        destroyed it. 

           London trembles at Paolo’s words.

                        You’re not being tracked anymore,

                        A noble thought, but believe me 
                        these people will never stop until 
                        they have recovered their 
                        investment.

           SECRET CORRIDOR

           Shiny and polished, more hospital than artist’s residence.   
           Paolo leads London and Alex through an imperial gallery of 
           prosthetics.  

           ARMS, LEGS, ABDOMENS are affixed to the walls, giving it the 
           feel of a gallery of macabre works of art.  

           Paolo drags his fingers across their synthetic skin and they 
           react with movement.  Alex reaches out for a hand, touches 
           it.  The hand grips his and gives him a shake.

           The Lab is both bleeding edge and old school tech.

                        Can Cathedral detonate me remotely?

                                 PAOLO
                        Indeed, but you said you’re 
                        offline?  You should be safe from 
                        remote interference.  Of course, 
                        you could always elect to detonate 
                        yourself.

                                 LONDON
                        And how would I do that?

                                 PAOLO
                        I presume you do what everybody 
                        else does.  You get so angry you 
                        simply must explode.

           Paolo smiles and gestures toward an ancient-looking chair.

                                 PAOLO (CONT’D)
                        Take a seat, I need to gather my 
                        tools. 

           EXT. LOTUS DEMARCO’S COMPOUND - NIGHT

           Lotus’s sprawling compound is a FIELD OF FLAMES.  Vincent 
           speaks into his smartphone, silhouetted against the ferocious 
           blaze.

                                 VINCENT
                        I had no trouble convincing DeMarco 
                        to surrender the operative’s 
                        location.  Recovering London and 
                        her mark is only a matter of time. 
           INT.  PAOLO’S LAB - DAY

           London reclines in an impromptu operating chair, watching 
           with simple curiosity as Paolo draws a BENT LASER SCYTHE 
           above the jagged remains of her damaged arms.  

           The GLOWING ARC’d blade shears her biosynth skin as though 
           it’s cutting off rot.

           We PULL BACK, past Paolo and find Alex, watching from a few 
           feet away.  The operation has a nauseating effect on Alex. 
           London watches Alex turn and leave the Lab.  

                                 LONDON
                        Why do I exist?

                                 PAOLO
                        Pardon?

                                 LONDON
                        I know why I was made, but why do I 
                        exist?

                                 PAOLO
                        For the same reason as everyone 
                        else.

                                 LONDON
                        Which is?

                                 PAOLO
                        Oh, I haven’t the slightest idea.  
                        But you do.  So you’d better make 
                        it worthwhile. 

           EXT.  PAOLO’S STUDIO - NIGHT

           The fleet of plaster sculptures stands at silent alert 
           beneath a bright moon.  

           Alex faces out toward the city.

           We move in closer, like a predator stalking prey.

           Headphones in Alex’s ear render him unaware of the fact that 
           he’s being pursued.

           A hand enters frame and grabs his shoulder.  

           Alex startles, and rips the earbuds out of his ears.

           WIDER TO REVEAL London, behind Alex.  
                                 LONDON
                    (gesturing with her new 
                     arm)
                        Check it out.  I’m fixed.

           Alex smiles at London, surveys her new hardware.

                                 ALEX
                        God given.  

                                 LONDON
                        It is a shame.  His work could 
                        change the world.

                                 ALEX
                        It already has.  

                                 LONDON
                        What’re you listening to?

                                 ALEX
                        “Rumours.”

                                 LONDON
                        About what?

                                 ALEX
                        Pardon?  About Lindsey Buckingham.  
                        And Stevie Nicks.  The most 
                        tumultuous cocaine-fueled love 
                        affair of all time?  Fleetwood Mac.  

           Alex puts the headphones in London’s ears and Fleetwood Mac’s 
           “DREAMS” blares over the action.  

           Alex smiles as London begins to nod her head to the beat, 
           experiencing the music for the first time.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        At first it made me sad to think of 
                        all the things you don’t know 
                        about.  But I see how remarkable it 
                        really is - you get to see so much, 
                        hear so much, for the very first 
                        time.  When we met - when I saw 
                        what you are - that’s what it felt 
                        like for me, like I was 
                        experiencing something totally new.  
                        That never happens anymore.

           London takes it to heart, lets a silence build between them.

           London leans into kiss Alex, but he pulls back.
                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        I can’t.

                                 LONDON
                        Why?  Because you don’t think I’m 
                        real?

                                 ALEX
                        No, because I know you are.  

                                 LONDON
                        You don’t want to hurt me.  You 
                        love Selma.  That must be nice. 

           “DREAMS” draws to a close.  London takes the earbuds out and 
           moves to hand them back to Alex.

                                 ALEX
                        Hold onto that.  

           Alex heads back inside, leaving London alone under the stars.

           INT.  PAOLO’S STUDIO - NIGHT

           Paolo tinkers with his latest prosthesis on a far table.

           Alex sleeps on the floor.  

           Beside him, London’s eyes are wide open.  

           The earbuds are in.  

           She’s listening to Fleetwood Mac.  

           She’s tasting humanity.  

           EXT.  PAOLO’S STUDIO - SAME

           The battalions of plaster models remain as alert as ever 
           beneath the blanket of night time sky.  

           EXT.  ATHENS - SAME

           The silence of the night is interrupted by the sound of a 
           flickering cicada.  

           The noise grows into a vibrating buzz.

           As the chittering amplifies, it becomes clear: This is not an 
           insect.  
           It’s too loud, too tinny.

           It takes on a mechanical persistence.  

           From the blanket of night-sky a dim red light begins to grow.

           We spot the source of the buzzing and the glowing red light: 
           an insect-like machine flitting through the air.

           We move in close on it: a MICRO-DRONE flies between buildings 
           and down ancient alleys as it makes a breezy approach toward 
           Paolo’s studio.  

           A few paces below the drone, two clicking heels trail...  

                                             ...VINCENT.

           He waves, motioning at the Micro-Drone: go on.

           The Micro-Drone jettisons in obedience.

           We follow the drone in TIGHT PURSUIT as it weaves past the 
           myriad likenesses of London and finally lands with a 
           skittering on the side of the building.

           It’s “wings” bleat frantically - the red light pulses 
           urgently.  

           Then, all the sound in Greece is sucked into silence before --

                            W-H-A-M-P!

           The Micro-Drone births an obliterating explosion that blasts 
           through the wall.

           INT.  PAOLO’S STUDIO - SAME

           Alex and London hurtle off their pallet and into the wall.

           The explosion knocks Paolo on his ass.

                                 PAOLO
                        Run!

           From the gaping wound in the wall that same BUZZING INSECT 
           SOUND grows out of the rubble.

           One RED LIGHT BLINKS in the distance.  

           Then a SECOND RED LIGHT.

           Within the span of a heartbeat, there are dozens.  
           A SWARM OF MICRO-DRONES readying for assault.  

           Through the blown-out wall we see the impending swarm 
           standing stationary and cloud-like in the yard beyond.

           Beneath the cloud: VINCENT.

           CLOSE ON LONDON’S FACE as she, Alex and Paolo hide behind a 
           flipped-over table.

                                 LONDON
                        Vincent.  He controls those things.  

           Vincent urges his cloud on and the swarm FLOODS INSIDE 
           PAOLO’S STUDIO.  Over the incessant BUZZING: 

                                 ALEX
                        What is it?

                                 LONDON
                        The Plague.  

           Paolo lunges behind a desk and retrieves a militia-grade 
           SAWED-OFF FIREARM.  He tosses London another gun.  

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to do this just 
                        because Thalia told you to, 
                        Vincent. 

           She FIRES at the dense Drone cloud, knocking some out of the 
           sky but others fill in the space, like a school of fish.

           Alex takes one of the nearby appendages and SLICES IT THROUGH 
           THE AIR.

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        We need to stop him.

           BUZZING, GUNFIRE, and MAYHEM CONSUME THE STUDIO.  

           But none of it does anything to deter Vincent, who fearlessly 
           strolls over the smoking rubble and INSIDE the building.  

                                 VINCENT
                        London, Thalia would like a word.  

                                 LONDON
                        Tell her I quit.  

           Vincent reaches inside his jacket for a STUB-NOSE PISTOL and 
           fires it with purpose at Alex. 

                           CRACK!  CRACK!
           Paolo SLAMS a robotic appendage into Vincent, whacking 
           Vincent’s gun from his hand.  

           Vincent throws a punch. Paolo dodges it and Vincent’s fist 
           sinks into a BLOCK OF WET CLAY.  

           Paolo berates Vincent, slamming the fake APPENDAGES into 
           Vincent’s side, over and over.  

           Without Vincent in control, the MICRO-DRONES fall, one after 
           the other, powering down and crashing into the ground.  

           Vincent frees himself.  

           Paolo stumbles over debris, losing his advantage.  

           Vincent HIGH-KICKS Paolo and knocks him behind a wall.

           London sprints toward them, but she’s not quick enough to 
           stop Vincent, as he squarely fires a blast in the direction 
           of Paolo - KILLING PAOLO.

           London stumbles to a stop.  

                                 VINCENT
                        His blood is on your hands, London.

           London’s face is a paroxysm of rage, her anger replenished 
           and her motivation bolstered.  She leaps at Vincent, throwing 
           his body OUT OF THE STUDIO and into the--

           APPENDAGE HALLWAY

           The duo spars down the length of the corridor LINED WITH 
           APPENDAGES.  

           The appendages react with animal instinct - grasping and 
           pulling at London and Vincent with desperate fervor.

           Alex follows them into the hallway with Paolo’s bent-laser 
           scythe in-hand.  He powers it up with a WHIR and slices 
           through the appendages grabbing onto London, freeing her.

           London reloads the SAWED-OFF FIREARM as Alex whips the scythe 
           at Vincent.  

           Instead of damaging Vincent, it frees him from the arms 
           holding him back.  

           Alex and London flee-- 
           OUTSIDE THE STUDIO

           London continues to fire over her shoulder at Vincent.

           Version after version of London’s sculpture duplicates BURST 
           into dust and debris as they’re caught in the crossfire.  

           Vincent rushes London and knocks the gun from her hand.  
           London and Vincent move hand-to-fist against one another.

           London pins Vincent and wails into him and throws slam after 
           concussive slam to his face - his head twisting on its axis 
           with a gruesome CRUNCH.  

                                 LONDON
                        Let’s go.

           Alex and London peel out in one of Paolo’s scooters as 
           Vincent stands to his feet behind them, stabbing a HACK-KEY 
           into another scooter.

           Vincent follows, racing after them through the--

           ATHENIAN STREETS

           London steers with efficiency, Alex clamped around her waist.

           Behind them, Vincent closes the margin.

           He draws a BERETTA from his waist and fires aimlessly in 
           London’s direction, SHATTERING one of her scooter’s mirrors.  

                                 ALEX
                        He’s right behind us.  

                                 LONDON
                        Hold on.  

           London peeks over her shoulder and makes a snap decision as 
           she WHIPS THE SCOOTER around one-hundred-and-eighty degrees.  

           London snatches the SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN from Alex and BLASTS! 
           two ferocious and wide-spraying rounds.  

           Vincent dodges the fire.  

           London GUNS IT past Vincent and twists to the right, hooking 
           it down a SHOULDER-WIDTH alley.  Behind them, Vincent rockets 
           past the entrance to the alley.

           London and Alex careen into a corner as they approach the--
           ATHENIAN DOCKS

           The sun crests over the ancient hills and seagulls squawk as 
           they dive and feed.  The early morning FISHING CREWS work on 
           preparing their rigs.

           LONDON skids her scooter to a stop.

                                 ALEX
                        We lost him.  

           London and Alex barrel toward a FISHERMAN unknotting his net.

                                 LONDON
                        How much to buy your boat?

                                 FISHERMAN
                    (serious, and unamused)
                        Two scooters.

           Vincent slams to a stop behind them.

           He leaps from his scooter as it SLAMS into London and Alex’s.

           Vincent blasts ONCE! TWICE! 

           The Fisherman clocks the scene - ducking to hide from the 
           firefight.  

                                 ALEX
                    (to the Fisherman)
                        All yours!

           Alex and London dive aboard a NEARBY dinghy.

           London fights to keep Vincent at bay as Alex snaps the engine 
           into gear.  

           London and Vincent are locked into brutal, relentless hand-to-
           hand combat. 

           Vincent kicks Alex away from the propeller and leverages 
           London underneath its WHIRRING BLADE.  

           London’s head dangles off the rubbery edge of the dinghy as 
           London and Vincent fight for control of the propeller’s 
           lethal edge.  

           Vincent gets the advantage over London and brings the 
           spinning PROPELLER LOWER AND LOWER.

           SNAP!
           A length of net tangles itself around Vincent and YANKS HIM 
           OFF of London, backward, past the fisherman holding the net’s 
           other end.

           London falls back into the boat as it peels away from the 
           dock.

           Vincent runs the length of the dock and launches himself from 
           the dock, landing on the boat.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        London, duck.

           London moves, drawing an arm across her face for protection 
           as Alex FIRES THE SAWED-OFF and NAILS VINCENT in the chest, 
           ROCKETING him once and for all off the side of the boat.  

           WE FOLLOW VINCENT as he sinks to the ocean floor. 

           Vincent's P.O.V. becomes Thalia's P.O.V., as she watches his 
           perspective from a monitor inside--

           INT.  CATHEDRAL HQ - SAME

           Vincent sinks past oblivious ocean life as he thuds to the 
           shallow ocean floor.  He’s unflappable and wide eyed.  

           Vincent begins to walk across the ocean floor to shore.

           WIDER to find Gideon and Thalia watching together.  

                                 THALIA
                        I told you, she’s special. 

                                 GIDEON
                        You’re operation is spinning out, 
                        Thalia.  

                                 THALIA
                        Vincent will retrieve her.  He’s an 
                        early iteration.  Fewer safeguards.

                                 GIDEON
                        And more bugs.  The mark is 
                        vulnerable in ways unimagined to 
                        that machine.  Do your job.  Find 
                        where he bruises and press it.  

           Off of Thalia’s face--
           INT.  BOAT - DAY

           London navigates the small boat across choppy waters. 

                                 LONDON
                        I told you they won’t stop.  
                        They’ll never stop.  We’re fighting 
                        a lost cause.  

                                 ALEX
                        So what do you want to do, London?  
                        Call it a day?  You want to shoot 
                        me?  Fine.  But nothing changes - 
                        you’re still a machine, you’re 
                        still doing what they want.  They 
                        still win.  They just killed your 
                        creator.  Doesn’t it piss you off?  
                        Doesn’t it make you feel?

                                 LONDON
                        We have no hand to play. 

                                 ALEX
                        We fight back.  

                                 LONDON
                        Everywhere I’ve ever gone, I’ve 
                        left a path of destruction in my 
                        wake.  

                                 ALEX
                        You can change direction, London.  
                        You might not have had a choice 
                        before we met, but you do now.  You 
                        can decide who you are, and how you 
                        want to live.  Things get difficult 
                        for people all the time, I want to 
                        quit at something every day.  
                        Sometimes I do, but on good days I 
                        don’t. 

           The engine putters and dies.

                                 LONDON
                        Do you know how to swim?

                                 ALEX
                        Not very well.

           Alex and London bob aimlessly, adrift in the Mediterranean as 
           in the distance, a ship makes its approach toward London and 
           Alex.
                                 LONDON
                        It’s like Paolo said, they won’t 
                        ever stop.

                                 ALEX
                        Then neither will we. 

           But as the distant boat becomes clear we realize it’s not 
           more Cathedral agents, it’s the Greek Fisherman, waving a 
           pleasant hello across the bouncing waves.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think that’s Cathedral.

           EXT. THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA - DAY

           WIDE ON London and Alex hopping from their dinghy into the 
           fisherman’s boat. 

           WIDER STILL on the boat heading AWAY FROM SHORE.

           EXT. THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA - LATER

           The Fisherman’s boat approaches--

           A TINY GREEK ISLAND

           All windmills and blue domes.

           The fisherman guides the boat to the meager dock.

           EXT. THE FISHERMAN’S HOUSE - LATER

           A small cottage set against an arid seaside. 

           INT.  FISHERMAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The Fisherman and his WIFE (40s) clean the remains of a 
           simple Greek meal.  

           The surroundings are rustic and warm. The wife grabs a plate 
           of UNFINISHED ANCHOVIES and approaches Alex and London, both 
           hovering over a clunky, dated notebook LAPTOP, clearly a 
           loaner from the Fisherman.  

           The wife stabs a forkful and draws it toward Alex’s mouth.
                                 WIFE
                    (In Greek)
                        You finish your fish.

                                 ALEX
                        Oh, I’m okay.  

                                 WIFE
                    (In Greek)
                        You finish your fish.

                                 FISHERMAN
                        She says you finish your fish.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m full.

                                 FISHERMAN
                        My friend, I’ve been full for 
                        twenty-four years of marriage.  
                        Even when she messes up the fish, 
                        which happens, y’know - a lot - 
                        still, I eat the fish.  You must 
                        know when you’re fighting a lost 
                        war.

                                 WIFE
                    (In Greek)
                        You finish your fish.

           Alex takes the fork and begins to finish his fish.  The 
           Fisherman and his wife kiss, a charming rapport.

                                 ALEX
                        Cathedral’s network is impossible 
                        to crack.  I can’t break through 
                        their quantum encryption, not on 
                        this timeline, not with this tech.  
                        And if I can’t get into their 
                        network we’ll never be able to plan 
                        a way inside the building.  But I 
                        have an idea.  You already have the 
                        information, London.  All of them 
                        are inside of you, somewhere.  All 
                        I’d have to do is find them.  I 
                        could try, at least.

                                 LONDON
                        To hack me?

           Off Alex’s look, as he reaches for a pen and paper--
           INT.  FISHERMAN’S HOUSE - LATER

           Alex has covered the table in hand-drawn symbols - SQUARES, 
           CIRCLES, STARS, and a HUMMINGBIRD. 

                                 ALEX
                        Ready?

            He reorders them, then holds up card after card.

                                 LONDON
                        Hummingbird.  Circle.  Star.  Star.  
                        Square.

           As before, London’s demeanor changes entirely, muted now, as 
           if her personality has been cloaked.  Erased.  

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)

                        Unable to access Cathedral data.

           Alex shuffles the cards again, reordering them with 
           precision.  He holds up a new sequence.

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        Square.  Square.  Circle.  
                        Triangle.  Star.  Square.

                        London, retrieve all data regarding

                                 LONDON
                        Unable to access.

           Alex looks at the cards.  It should be easier than this.

           Alex holds up a new arrangement.

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        It’s not the cards, Alex.  It’s 
                        you.

                                 ALEX
                        What?
                                 LONDON
                        You’re smart enough to know that I 
                        won’t let you onto my network.  

           London smiles, small and wry and cunning.

                                 ALEX
                        Operative, access Cathedral 
                        database.

           Her voice changes, as if we’re suddenly hearing it through a 
           worn-out speaker.  It might take a moment to recognize the 
           voice, but there’s no doubt: it’s Thalia.

                                 LONDON
                    (as Thalia)
                        You’ve accessed it, Alex, but I’m 
                        not going to let you see anything.

                                 ALEX
                        Operative, what is your name?

                                 LONDON
                    (as Thalia)
                        I’m Thalia Parkes,  London’s 
                        handler.  And I want my asset back.

           Alex sets the cards down.

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                    (as Thalia)
                        Alex, you are in the company of a 
                        very dangerous machine.  Despite 
                        her appearances, she is absolutely 
                        a weapon, and one with explicit 
                        instructions to terminate you.  No 
                        matter what, unless you turn her in 
                        to me, that will be the outcome.  I 
                        can promise you amnesty, and a 
                        shield, should you fulfill my 
                        request: Bring London to me.  

           London grabs a pen, and begins to scribble down some 
           coordinates.  

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                    (as Thalia)
                        And if you refuse to oblige us, we 
                        will kill your Spanish friend.  

           London opens her mouth and speaks in Selma’s voice, glitchy 
           and garbled.  
                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                    (as Selma)
                        Alex?  Alex.  I’d really like to 
                        see you again.  

                                 ALEX
                        Selma? Selma!  Selma, I lo-- 

           London’s face twitches and she once more speaks as Thalia.  

                                 LONDON
                    (as Thalia)
                        Bring London to the coordinates or 
                        we’ll kill Selma Veracruz.  

           Alex looks at the cards, then at London.  Alex flashes 
           another sequence, and London’s personality sweeps over her.

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        Did it work?

           Alex looks at the coordinates.  His eyes cloud with an almost-
           tangible degree of uncertainty. 

           INT.  TRAIN CAR - DAY

           Alex retains his distant and uncertain look.  London 
           approaches, a soda in-hand.  She sits opposite Alex, hands 
           him the soda.  

           CARD: Washington D.C.

                                 LONDON
                        The coordinates seem to take us to 
                        an industrial neighborhood outside 
                        of D.C.  

                                 ALEX
                        We can’t just walk in there, shoot 
                        the place up and leave.  We have to 
                        have a plan.

                                 LONDON
                        You’re right.  We need to catch 
                        them off guard.  I think I have a 
                        plan.

           THE SOUNDS OF A TRAIN ENTERING THE STATION
           EXT.  TRAIN STATION - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

           London and Alex disembark, following the crowd toward the 
           station. 

                                 LONDON
                        This way--

           London tugs Alex’s hand. 

           Through the fog of faces, one man stands out: Vincent.

                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        Alex, run. 

           She turns back to Alex and finds him standing still a few 
           paces back.  

           London looks back at Vincent, who signals a HANDFUL OF 
           CATHEDRAL OPERATIVES to close in on London.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m sorry, London. 

                                 LONDON
                        What’s going on?

                                 ALEX
                        I had no choice.  They have Selma.

                                 VINCENT
                        It’s over.  There are a lot of 
                        people here who are just going 
                        about their day.  Don’t make a 
                        scene.

           She looks around - what’s her way out? - but she’s cornered.

           London acquiesces as the operatives bind her hands with zip 
           ties.  

           They move to Alex, who tries to fight them off.

                                 ALEX
                        Hey, let go of me.  I did what you 
                        asked me to do.

                                 LONDON
                        I told you, they won’t stop, Alex.  
                        This isn’t something you can buy 
                        your way out of.   

           One of the operatives zip-ties Alex’s hands.  
           INT.  PARAMILITARY VEHICLE - SAME

           Vincent chains London and Alex to the rear wall of the 
           armored vehicle.  

           Vincent SLAMS the hatch shut and takes a seat between London 
           and Alex as the vehicle roars to life.

           London’s eyes are locked onto Alex.  He tries to dodge her 
           gaze, but can’t. 

                                 ALEX
                        They have Selma.

                                 LONDON
                        And now they’ll kill both of you. 

           EXT.  PARAMILITARY VEHICLE - WASHINGTON D.C. - SAME

           The enormous vehicle rolls past WASHINGTON D.C.’s massive 
           monuments.  The engine growls as it moves past the city 
           limits and into the rundown-- 

           INDUSTRIAL SECTOR

           The vehicle passes identical buildings, one after another, 
           grimy and forgotten.  Eventually it lurches to a stop in 
           front of a massive GOTHIC CATHEDRAL.  You guessed it, this is-
           -

           CATHEDRAL HEADQUARTERS

           Vincent drags Alex and London from the truck toward the 
           imposing ANCIENT PORTICO DOOR.  

           A digital KEYCARD interface is the only giveaway that this 
           seemingly ancient and holy spot is not all that it appears to 
           be.

                                 VINCENT
                        Welcome home.

           Vincent is met by a ROUGH THUG. 

           Vincent approaches the portico door and inserts his keycard 
           in the panel.  The door’s motor engages and draws the heavy 
           slab back.

           Alex clocks Vincent replacing the keycard in his back pocket. 

           Vincent and the Thug lead Alex and London inside-- 
           THE CATHEDRAL NARTHEX

           Nothing immediately surprising.  

           In fact, should London and Alex be on a tour of ancient 
           basilicas and abbeys, this DANK building would fit right in.

           Candlelight is all the shines throughout the sleepy 
           cathedral.  

                                 VINCENT
                        Move. 

           Vincent and the Thug lead Alex and London down the 
           cathedral’s nave, toward the altar.

                                 HENCHMAN
                        Go.

           The Thug gives London’s cuffs a tug and pulls her and Alex 
           toward a confessional.  

           He gives Alex a shove that knocks Alex into Vincent.

           This Thug is rougher than any holy man as he forces London 
           and Alex into the same half of the confessional.

           The Henchman slams the door shut.  

                                 VINCENT (O.S.)
                        Take a knee.

           London nods - do as he says.  

           London and Alex take knees. 

           The pressure of their bodyweight on the padded kneelers 
           triggers a mechanism that SINKS THE CONFESSIONAL UNDERGROUND.

                                 LONDON
                        Deep breaths, Alex.  Relax.  What 
                        you’re feeling is fear,  And fear 
                        is your body fighting back.  Take a 
                        deep breath.  One more.  There it 
                        is. 

           The confessional quakes as it arrives at the bottom floor.

           The confessional wall PEELS BACK and we’re INSIDE OF--
           CATHEDRAL HEADQUARTERS - MAIN ATRIUM

           Unlike the spiritual world outside of its doors, the inside 
           of Cathedral Headquarters is a hive of electric energy.  
           PERSONNEL in off-the-rack suits are busy with paperwork, with 
           phone calls, with bureaucracy.

           In the center of it all, a queen amongst her buzzing drones, 
           Thalia waits to greet the new arrivals.  

                                 THALIA
                        I was beginning to worry I’d never 
                        see you again.  And you must be 
                        Orion.  So good of you to follow 
                        orders.  Perhaps we should hire 
                        you!  An asset who doesn’t fuck 
                        everything up.  Wouldn’t that be 
                        something.  Take him to Cell-8.  
                        London, why don’t you and I find 
                        Cell-34.  

           Thalia grabs London’s zip-tied wrists and leads her away.

           She moves toward Gideon.

                                 GIDEON
                        Glad to see you retrieved your toy. 

                                 THALIA
                        I’ve never seen you so nervous, 
                        Gideon.  I know it must be scary to 
                        stare the end of your career in the 
                        face.  This AI will not only change 
                        our business, it’ll change the 
                        world.  And I’ll be the ones 
                        leading the pack.  

           INT.  CATHEDRAL HEADQUARTERS - HOLDING CELL-8 - DAY

           Another GUARD roughly kicks Alex into a cell with Selma.  

                                 SELMA
                        Alex?

           Selma approaches Alex.

                                 ALEX
                        Oh thank God you’re--

           WHAP! 

           Selma’s open-palm leaves a bright red mark on Alex’s face.
                                 SELMA
                        You’re such an asshole.  You ruined 
                        me, Alex.  You ruined me for anyone 
                        else.  But I need to know right 
                        now, do you want me?  Or do you 
                        want something else?

                                 ALEX
                        There’s nothing else but you, 
                        Selma. 

           The two wrap themselves around one another, no matter what 
           pretense they put up previously, it’s clear now that these 
           are two folks with a deep bond.

           London and Thalia sit opposite one another, just like when we 
           first met them.

           A flashcard box on the table between them.

                                 THALIA
                        I’m sure you’re expecting me to go 
                        nuclear.  Scream.  Threaten.  Rage.  
                        You’ve disobeyed orders, 
                        compromised Cathedral intel, you’ve 
                        put Codex and my very own future on 
                        the line.  But I’m not mad, I know 
                        it’s not your fault.  You can’t 
                        control the flaws in your design.  
                        And that’s what this was.  A design 
                        flaw on a most massive scale.  
                        You’re riddled with bugs.  And 
                        that’s my fault.  And I’m taking 
                        responsibility.

           Thalia reaches for the flashcard box and enters her pin. 

                                 THALIA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know what you are, but I do 
                        know you’re special.  This hurts me 
                        so much more than it hurts you. 

                                 LONDON
                        You’re right, a machine can only do 
                        what it’s told, but a person can 
                        choose to do what’s right.  I’m not 
                        a piece of flawed tech.  I’m a 
                        person.  I think.  I feel.  I 
                        remember. 
                                 THALIA
                        Memories.  You remember where you 
                        came from, a cold, godless place.  
                        And the man in the red tie who 
                        rescued you.  You remember 
                        loneliness, and your only friend, a 
                        stuffed rabbit.  And you remember 
                        trading the rabbit for a black 
                        bullet. 

           Thalia reaches inside of her jacket and places a BLACK BULLET 
           on the table between them.

                                 THALIA (CONT’D)
                        I know those memories just as well 
                        as you do.  Because they’re mine,  
                        London, the rabbit, the bullet, the 
                        choice.  

           INSERT:  EXT. ORPHANAGE - THE DAY LONDON LEFT

           We see Young London’s hand wrap around the black bullet, and 
           we REVERSE OUR P.O.V., finally see the man in the red tie, 
           face on.  He’s younger here, but the tattoos peaking out are 
           a dead giveaway - the man is a YOUNG GIDEON.

                        I gave you my memories.  They’re 
                        our bond.  We’re meant to be the 
                        same, London.  At least I’d hoped 
                        to be.

                                 LONDON
                        We’re not.

           London’s face falls.  Her hair sweeps in front of her eyes. 

                                 THALIA
                        No.  All of these people wanted you 
                        to change the world, but Gideon and 
                        I wanted you because we saw your 
                        dark potential.  I knew you could 
                        be better than me.  You were built 
                        to be better than me in the field, 
                        a weapon without flaws.

                        But make no mistake, London, you’re 
                        not better than me.   Your flaw is 
                        that you feel, and my greatest 
                        strength is that I don’t. 

           Thalia reaches toward London and brushes London’s hair out of 
           her face. 

                                 LONDON
                        I’ve been afraid so much this week, 
                        for the first time in my life.  But 
                        I’m not afraid anymore.  Whatever 
                        you do to me, it’s worth it.  

           Thalia holds up the first card.  London breaks a smile as she 
           recognizes the hummingbird printed on its face.

           Alex sticks his hand in his pocket and pulls out VINCENT’S

                        We’re not going to die here.

           Selma grabs Alex and pulls him in close for a kiss.  Alex 
           pulls back wearing a broad grin.  Alex’s moves to the door 
           and tries the keycard, but it DOESN’T WORK.

                        Shit.

           Alex tries the card again and again, rattling the handle.

           On the other side: Hugh.  

           He eyes Alex, Selma, the stolen keycard.

                        The orders for you two are 
                        incredibly simple: they’re going to 
                        destroy London and execute you 
                        both.  Things get more complicated 
                        at that point.  If I were a betting 
                        man, I’d say they’ll kill me too.  
                        Take the tech and sell it to the 
                        highest bidder.  But I’ve got 
                        personal problems with hawking the

                        Thalia doesn’t seem to understand 
                        that London is special.  That the 
                        work we’ve done here is sacred.  
                        London isn’t just a machine 
                        anymore, and I won’t let her die 
                        without a fight.  So come on, let’s 
                        see if we can’t get out of here.

           Hugh grabs the keycard from Alex, flips it UPSIDE down and 
           inserts it into the lock.  The light BLINKS green.

           halls.  Alex eyes the placards above each door.

                                 HUGH
                        I’m going to secure some back up.  
                        You two get in there and make sure 
                        London is functional.  I’ll keep an 
                        eye on the door.

           Finally: Cell-34.

           Alex presses VINCENT’S ACCESS KEYCARD into the panel.  The 
           door SLINKS open and Alex and Selma step-- 

           INSIDE LONDON’S HOLDING CELL

           London sits exactly as we last saw her, cards still stacked 
           on the table before her.  But London’s no longer herself, 
           she’s a blank slate.

                                 ALEX
                        London?

           London’s eyes flutter as she looks to him, oblivious.

                                 LONDON
                        Cathedral asset: London.  OS 
                        purged.  Quantum cloud deleted.  
                        Personality renounced.

                                 SELMA
                        She’s gone.

                                 ALEX
                        Not yet.  

           Alex sorts the cards, rearranging them, then rearranging them 
           again.
                                 ALEX (CONT’D)

                        Symbol processing enabled.  

           Alex holds up a card.

                                 ALEX
                        Please identify. 

                                 LONDON
                        Star.

                                 ALEX
                        Good.

           And then more cards...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Continue.

                                 LONDON
                        Square.  Circle.  Circle.  Star.  

           London blinks - her personality cresting across her face.

                                 SELMA
                        London?

                                 LONDON
                        Hello?

                                 ALEX
                        London, do you recognize me?

           A breathless pause.

                                 LONDON
                        You’re the New Age douchebag from 
                        the beach party.

           Selma snorts a laugh.  Alex chokes with appreciative relief.  

                                 ALEX
                        Holy shit I’m good at my job.  

                                             PRE-LAP

           THE SOUND OF A PROPULSIVE EXPLOSION.

                                            SMASH TO
           INT.  CATHEDRAL HEADQUARTERS - THALIA’S OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE ON a champagne cork ROCKETING from a frosty bottle.

           WIDER ON Thalia filling a flute for herself.

           WIDER STILL as we realize she’s celebrating alone.

           She takes a sip and stares out at the cityscape beyond.

           Thalia sips some bubbles and moves for a control panel near 
           her window.  

           With the flick of a switch, the city scape disappears - we 
           realize it was a virtual image.

           In its place, a view down below, on the enormous-- 

           CATHEDRAL PROTOTYPE WORKSHOP

           It’s a massive underground bunker.

           The place where Cathedral has developed every iteration of 
           every AI weapon they’ve created.

           On a massive table near the rear are DOZENS OF MICRO-DRONES.  
           Near the rear are PROSTHETIC LIMBS in various states of 
           construction.

           But in the center, what draws our attention immediately, is 
           the LEGION OF OTHER LONDONS - prototypes of the woman we 
           know.  Dozens of them in different stages of assembly.

           Some missing an arm, others without the final details of hair 
           or teeth in place.  Like Paolo’s yard of plaster models, but 
           larger - and perfectly identical to London.  

           A LACKEY enters in a harried rush.

                                 THALIA
                        I trust she’s been destroyed. 

                                 LACKEY
                        Actually, Thalia, we have a 
                        problem.

                                 THALIA
                        What sort?

                                 LACKEY
                        They’re missing.
                                 THALIA
                        Who’s missing?

                                 LACKEY
                        London.  Vincent.  Donovan.  All of 
                        them.  

                                 THALIA
                        Where’s Hugh?

           The Lackey looks down, a silent admission that Hugh is also 
           gone.

           Thalia drops her champagne flute.

                                 THALIA (CONT’D)
                        Lock the building down.  

                                 LACKEY
                    (into a headset)
                        Building is code black.  No one in 
                        or out.  

           Thalia returns her gaze to the workshop below.  

           INT.  CATHEDRAL HEADQUARTERS - CORRIDOR - DAY

           London, Hugh, Alex and Selma slink through the HQ corridors.

                                 HUGH
                        The workshop is her blind spot.  I 
                        can get you in, but they’ll kill me 
                        if they find out I turned. 

                                 SELMA
                        We have no attack plan, Alex.

                                 ALEX
                        We fight. 

                                 LONDON
                        We won’t be able to take Cathedral 
                        down if we’re dead.  Our best 
                        strategy at this point is escape.

                                 ALEX
                        No.  I’ve - I’ve lost everything to 
                        make the world a better place.  My 
                        home, my family.  I have nothing to 
                        go back to.  This is it for me.  
                                 SELMA
                        You have me, but not if we die in 
                        here.  We escape, and then we 
                        expose them.  

                                 LONDON
                        She’s right.

           Selma gives Alex a kiss on the cheek.

                                 HUGH
                        The workshop is this way. 

           The trio rounds a corner and finds the hallway blocked by 
           Vincent.

                                 LONDON
                        Run, I’ll take him.

                                 HUGH
                        Wait, wait.  He’s with us.

                                 LONDON
                        Vincent has tried to kill me 
                        several times this week.

                                 HUGH
                        I’m no good with guns, but I am 
                        pretty good at reprogramming 
                        assets.  I re-imprinted Vincent to 
                        give you a hand inside. 

           A huddle of CATHEDRAL OPERATIVES rounds the corner ahead, 
           then gives chase.  London, Alex, Selma, Hugh and Vincent turn 
           and book it the other in the other direction. 

                                 HUGH (CONT’D)
                        Through that door.  You’ll only 
                        have a minute or two.

                                 LONDON
                        Get out of here alive.    Blow the 
                        whistle on Cathedral. 

                                 HUGH
                    (to the guards 
                     approaching)
                        They’re going through the workshop!
                    (sotto, to our group)
                        Go!

           London kicks a distant door open and ushers the group inside 
           of the--
           PROTOTYPE WORKSHOP

           London, Alex, Selma and Vincent hurry inside but are quick to 
           slow their advance as they realize what it is they’re looking 
           at.  

                                 LONDON
                        My God.

           Behind them, Vincent shuts the door to the workshop as the 
           Agents continues their pursuit.  

           The agents immediately begin RATTLING on the door.

           INT.  CATHEDRAL HEADQUARTERS - THALIA’S OFFICE - SAME

           Thalia looks down on Alex, London, Selma and Vincent as they 
           stare with wonder at the army of Other Londons.  

           Thalia grabs a TABLET as she watches them. 

           BACK ON THE WORKSHOP FLOOR

           Behind them, a gunshot CRACKS! into the door.  

                                 SELMA
                    (re: the Other Londons)
                        What are they?

                                 VINCENT
                        They’re prototypes.

           The innumerable versions of London BREATHE TO LIFE.

           Their eyes flutter, waking from a deep and drowsy spell.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        And they won’t let us leave.

           Heads lolling, eyes wandering, arms and legs flourishing as 
           they regain whatever it is they know of consciousness.

           The entire ARMY OF OTHER LONDONS continues to “come to” - all 
           forty or fifty of them - before they finally twist their 
           heads in terrifying syncopation, their eyes focusing intently 
           on London, Alex and Selma.  

                                 OTHER LONDONS
                    (in an echoing 
                     syncopation)
                        Hello.
           Vincent points across the workshop toward a massive cargo 
           door.

                                 VINCENT
                        The access elevator is in the rear.

           Another loud SLAM into the door behind them.

                                 HUGH
                        They’re going to break through.

                                 ALEX
                        We have to move.

           Vincent signals toward a swarm of MICRO-DRONES on a nearby 
           table.  The MICRO-DRONES’ red lights flicker awake as they 
           take flight.

                                 VINCENT
                        I’ll keep the guards at bay.  
                        That’s the best I can do.  

           London, Alex and Selma move to walk through the horde of 
           Other Londons.

                                 OTHER LONDONS
                        Who are you? What do you want?

           From behind them, the FLANK OF AGENTS arrives in the door 
           frame.

           Vincent takes cover behind a desk as his FLEET OF MICRO-
           DRONES takes flight.  He gestures toward the door and the 
           MICRO-DRONES BUZZ AND BLEAT in that direction.  

                                 VINCENT
                        Go!

           London leads Alex and Selma through the Other Londons.

           Each model of her twist and turning to keep its eyes on the 
           trio when.  They make good progress until--

                            T H W A K!

           An arm SLAMS into London.

                             P O P!

           A leg KICKS ALEX’S out from underneath him.

                            C R A C K!

           TWO FISTS CLOBBER into Selma.
           We go WIDE and realize that the OTHER LONDONS ARE ATTACKING 
           OUR TRIO.

           ANGLE ON Thalia in her office and we get a greater sense of 
           what’s shaping up in the workshop.

           THALIA’S P.O.V.: 

           -- The Micro-Drones laying assault on the squad of Cathedral 
           Agents at the door.  

           -- Agents at the door firing massive-caliber weaponry at the 
           cloud of drones, knocking a few out at a time.

           -- Vincent nearby, protected by an overturned table, in 
           control of the drones.  

           -- Meanwhile, the army of Other Londons has begun a 
           devastating siege on London, Alex and Selma

           Thalia reaches for a NASTY FIREARM.  From above, she begins 
           her own assault on Vincent.

           BACK ON THE WORKSHOP FLOOR

           A GUNSHOT from above SHREDS INTO VINCENT’S SHOULDER.

           Exposed mechanical ephemera SPARKS. 

           His eyes move to Thalia’s office, up above, as she fires 
           again.  He dodges, but barely.

           One more LOUD BLAST at Vincent is enough for him to make up 
           his mind.

           Vincent ushers a portion of the remaining Micro-Drones away 
           from the guards at the door and UP-UP-UP to Thalia’s office.

           Vincent’s P.O.V.: A dozen Micro-Drones flood inside of--

           THALIA’S OFFICE

           Thalia scrambles away from the window and toward her door.

           She fumbles with her keycard as the Micro-Drones buzz toward 
           her.  She doesn’t stand a chance against the approaching 
           swarm.

           She takes a panicked breath, just as the DOOR OPENS.

           Gideon reaches in and pulls her out of her office and into 
           the--
           HALLWAY

           Thalia scrambles across the floor.

                                 THALIA
                        Jesus, thank you.  Thank you 
                        Gideon.  You saved my life.

                                 GIDEON
                        Oh, Thalia.  No, no, no.  I simply 
                        wanted to chance to do this myself. 
                        I refuse to let you wreak any more 
                        havoc on what it is I’ve 
                        accomplished here.

           Gideon pulls a PISTOL from his jacket.

           Thalia tries to stand but stumbles over herself.

                                 GIDEON (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never seen you so nervous, 
                        Thalia.  

                                 THALIA
                        Gideon, please.

           Gideon raises the gun.  Before he can fire a shot Thalia POPS 
           to her feet.

           Her lightning fast hand grabs Gideon’s gun and SNAPS HIS 
           WRIST, turning the gun back to him and emptying Gideon’s own 
           clip into his stomach.  

           The move immediately recalls London’s assault on Melanie 
           Gaines’ security team.  

           Like mother, like daughter. 

           As Gideon’s massive dead body lurches forward we--

           INT. WORKSHOP - SAME

           BACK ON LONDON as her arms and legs work in overtime, 
           blurring as she whirs and flings to BUY ALEX AND SELMA enough 
           agency to flee for the cargo elevator.

           It’s a surreal sight as we witness Our London in a brutal 
           fist fight with a legion of mirrored Others.

           This is a woman literally at war with her many selves.
                                 LONDON
                        You need to leave, I can clear a 
                        path.

                                 ALEX
                        We can make it to the door.  

           London does her best to keep the army at bay - hurling her 
           arms and legs and butting heads.  But eventually the melee 
           takes its toll.  

           An impact shreds half of her left hand, another sheers off a 
           foot.  In the mess of duplicates, London is ultimately being 
           pulverized.  

           In one final powerful push, London drives a MAD PATH through 
           the legion of Other Londons.  The Others recoil and assess.

                                 OTHER LONDONS
                        Who are you? 

                                 LONDON
                        You have no choice - leave.  Finish 
                        what we started.

                                 SELMA
                        We can’t leave you!

           The Other Londons are inching back in to resume their fight.

                                 LONDON
                        Alex, just stick to the plan. 

           Off of Alex’s look of recognition--

           INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY - SAME AS WE LAST SAW LONDON AND ALEX ON 
           THE WASHINGTON D.C.-BOUND TRAIN. 

           London and Alex sit exactly as we left them.

                                 ALEX
                        We can’t just walk in there, shoot 
                        the place up and leave.  We have to 
                        have a plan.

                                 LONDON
                        You’re right.  We need to catch 
                        them off guard.

           Alex nods, London leans in.
                                 LONDON (CONT’D)
                        I think I have a plan.  I assume we 
                        won’t get much further than the 
                        train station before Thalia ropes 
                        us. 

                                 ALEX
                        I was going to tell you.

                                 LONDON
                        Alex, you really are a bad liar. I 
                        understand.  You traded me for 
                        Selma.  You love her.  I get it.  
                        Actually, it’s my favorite thing 
                        about you.  You’re a good person, 
                        even if you don’t really think so.  
                        And besides, now we have our way 
                        inside Cathedral.  We don’t need to 
                        sneak in at all, we play dumb and 
                        offer ourselves up.  Then we tear 
                        it down from the inside.  

                                 ALEX
                        A Trojan Horse.  Why do you want to 
                        help me?  I sold you out.

                                 LONDON
                        You did that for love.  I guess you 
                        could say that my reasons are 
                        pretty similar.

           INT. CATHEDRAL HEADQUARTERS - PROTOTYPE WORKSHOP - SAME

           London continues to clear a path for Alex and Selma.  Alex 
           grabs Selma’s hand. 

                                 ALEX
                        Come on. 

                                 SELMA
                        What about London?

                                 ALEX
                        London knows what she’s doing.

           Alex and Selma sprint down the cleared path as the Other 
           Londons close in.  
           London and the legion of her doubles in brutal hand-to-hand 
           violence against one another, the MICRO-DRONES savaging the 
           Cathedral agents, gunshots blasting the drones out of the 
           sky.  

           Alex takes a last look at the insanity behind him, before 
           grabbing Selma’s hand and diving into the--

           CARGO ELEVATOR

           The door slowly closes behind them as Alex takes one last 
           glance back, at London, at Vincent, at the all-out onslaught 
           he’s left in his wake.  

           The door shuts, and the cacophony of violence is immediately 
           replaced by the DING-DINGing of the elevator as it rises.

           EXT.  WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SECONDS LATER

           Outside the Cathedral is a placid calm.  From this 
           perspective, one would have no idea of the endless 
           destruction below.  

           The discreet elevator door CLANGS open.  Alex and Selma 
           stumble onto the street, gasping for air, exhausted and 
           brutalized.  

                                 SELMA
                        Where do we go?

                                 ALEX
                        Anywhere but here.

           Selma and Alex move down the quickly darkening alley, their 
           shadows stretching out behind them.

           INT. WORKSHOP - SAME

           London and Vincent don’t stand a chance against the onslaught 
           of Other Londons.  It’s only a matter of time before they’re 
           completely annihilated.

           The WORKSHOP DOOR CLANGS open, and Thalia enters with a 
           SAVAGE ASSAULT weapon gripped under her arm. 

                                 THALIA
                        London, you’re being a very bad 
                        girl.  

           Thalia opens fire on the horde of Other Londons, mowing them 
           down in an effort to hit London.
           London stops fighting the Others.  She’s totally battered.  
           London looks to her doubles - reminders of her dark life 
           before Alex, then back to Thalia.

                                 THALIA (CONT’D)
                        There’s only one way this ends, 
                        London.

           London looks very, very pissed off.

                                 LONDON
                        I know. 

                                 VINCENT
                        What do we do?

                                 LONDON
                        We get angry. 

           It’s as though all the air has been sucked out of the 
           workshop as London braces herself and DETONATES.  A 
           THUNDERING BLUE shockwave blasts across her Others, 
           triggering a chain reaction of pulsing explosions. 

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SAME

           The SHOCKWAVE from floors below the Earth shudder through 
           Cathedral HQ.  

           INT. HOTEL - BARCELONA - DAY

           The Sagrada Familia is perfectly framed by the suite’s 
           massive window.  Selma and Alex sit side-by-side in bed, 
           sheets tangled around them.  Selma sips a coffee, reading 
           from her smartphone as Alex works in a frenzy on his laptop.

           CARD: Barcelona, Spain.  36 hours later.

                        Cathedral’s crippled, but without 
                        London or Hugh, we don’t have much 
                        to go on.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m not sure we’re without London 
                        just yet.  I know better than to 
                        not back files up. 

           Alex enters code into the darknet browser.  

           Alex types: London? The cursor blinks.  
           The moment stretches out...

                        ...  Until text scrawls across the screen.

           The cursor blinks again, then: Hi, Alex.

                                 SELMA
                        It’s really her?

           The cursor continues to flash on and off as we SNAP TO--

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Hugh sits in a dreary bar, rolling ice around a near-empty 
           glass.  He half-watches news reportage on a television above.  
           A journalist detailing the still-unexplained explosion in 
           Washington D.C.  A WOMAN clinks her own empty glass.

                                 WOMAN
                        Looks like we could both use 
                        another drink.

                                 HUGH
                        Don’t need to tell me twice. 

           Hugh gestures at the BARTENDER - another round.  

                                 HUGH (CONT’D)
                        I’m Hugh.

                                 WOMAN
                        Sarah.

           As they offer each other a hand to shake, the woman 
           accidentally knocks her empty glass from the bar.  Hugh 
           reacts with blink-and-you’ll-miss-it speed, grabbing the 
           glass and setting it back on the counter.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Nice catch.

                                 HUGH
                        What can I say?  Good reflexes.

           Hugh smiles.  We PRESS IN on his face, moving in to a close-
           up view of his eyes.  His PUPIL twists tight with mechanical 
           precision and we--

                                        SMASH TO BLACK

                            THE END.
