                        Do you remember the first time you 
                        took me swimming? Before you left 
                        us, and before Madagascar. 

           EXT. THE ATLANTIC OCEAN - MONTAUK - DAY

           YOUNG CELIA, seven years old, stands before the ocean, 
           outfitted in flippers and goggles. She looks back, 
           frightened. 

                                 CELIA (V.O.)
                        Did you know that, since then, the 
                        amount of water in the world has 
                        shrunk by nine percent? 

           From a distance we see her parents, standing shoulder-to-
           shoulder. With a wave of her hand, her mother urges her 
           ahead.

                                 CELIA (V.O.)
                        There used to be birds the size of 
                        elephants, hippos that didn’t grow 
                        more than two feet, trees thirty 
                        meters high. 

           Young Celia swims. She’s gaining confidence when a huge wave 
           knocks her over. 

                                 CELIA (V.O.)
                        Mom says the world keeps losing 
                        things. 

           Young Celia pummels her arms against the water, struggling to 
           pull her way up.

           EXT. THE INDIAN OCEAN - DAY

           The other side of the world. A different ocean now, glass-
           smooth in the sun. A small plane zooms near landing, 
           disturbing the calmness of the water. 

                                 CELIA (V.O.)
                        I write this from Ankarana, from 
                        the jungle. This is the twelfth 
                        week we are here. 
           EXT. MADAGASCAR - ANKARANA RESERVE - DAY

           CELIA, now 14, poised and watchful, and her striking mother, 
           JUNE, tromp through the forest with six eager, intense 
           GRADUATE STUDENTS, 20s, a German ECOLOGIST, 40s, and ARTURO, 
           a wiry Malagasy fixer in his late 50s. 

                                 CELIA (V.O.)
                        During the day we track the great 
                        bamboo lemur. We eat bags of dried 
                        food, like astronauts. We drink 
                        water from the river with iodine 
                        pills. 

           EXT. ANKARANA RESERVE - FOREST - LATER

           They’ve reached their destination. The students set up camp.

           June stares up at a spirited SPORTIVE LEMUR scampering up a 
           bamboo tree.

           Celia reaches her mother. They stand shoulder-to-shoulder 
           watching the lemur with quiet focus. 

           This is our first good look at June. She’s in her 40’s but 
           she’d never tell you and you’d never guess. She wears her 
           hair tugged back, out of her face. 

                                 JUNE
                        Look at the way his legs move - 
                        keep up or die early.  

           She nods at Celia. Celia swings herself silently up onto a 
           branch without missing a beat. Takes a slim collar from her 
           mother and competently snaps it on the lemur. 

                                 CELIA (V.O.)
                        People visit from all over the 
                        world. France and India, an 
                        ecologist from Germany. Mom keeps 
                        asking about the drought in the 
                        south, if the lemurs are changing 
                        their eating habits. Maybe that’s 
                        what they have to do to survive.

           Celia watches her mother from her perch. June shows the 
           ecologist the beginning of a budding tree. She touches his 
           wrist. 
           EXT. TENT - FOREST - NIGHT

           Rain drums down on the small camp site. The sportive lemur, 
           collared now, sleeps. 

                                 CELIA (V.O.)
                        We’re lucky here. 

           INT. TENT - FOREST - NIGHT

           June types furiously. The tent is a clutter of camping 
           equipment, vitamins, and re-used paper towels hung to dry. 

           Celia hides a LETTER she’s writing in a book about the 
           world’s greatest scientists. She peeks at a bent PICTURE of 
           herself at a swim meet, hidden between the pages of the book. 

           In the picture, Celia’s grinning, wet-haired, wearing a 
           swimsuit and holding a trophy. Her father Len smiles 
           sheepishly next to her. The wavy reflection of a pool in the 
           background. 

           Wind rips the picture from her hand. She grabs it before her 
           mother sees. 

           The rain pounds harder. 

           EXT. TENT - FOREST - DAY

           Celia and June step into the mist of outside. The ground is 
           littered with crushed petals and washed-up seeds. June plucks 
           a seed from the ground. 

                                 CELIA 
                        What is it? 

           Celia knows her mother well enough: an idea is brewing, and 
           has been for a while. June looks up at her and simply smiles. 

           EXT. ANKARANA RESERVE - LATER - SERIES OF SHOTS

           Celia watches June gather seeds, write notes intently. She 
           sits next to her mother, begins organizing the notes in a 
           binder. They have this down to a system. 

                                 CELIA (V.O.)
                        Mom says you have to make a plan 
                        but you also have to change it. The 
                        greatest scientists in the world 
                        were brave enough to veer off 
                        course. 
           EXT. TENTS - NIGHT

           A crackling fire cooks freeze-dried food. The ecologist isn’t 
           there any longer. Arturo mans the fire with the help of a 
           student. June is mid-story.   

                                 JUNE
                        -and Celia just stands there 
                        watching him drink her coke. 
                        Doesn’t cry. Doesn’t seem surprised 
                        - how old were you, eight? 

                                 CELIA
                        Nine. I didn’t understand how he 
                        could drink it so quickly. 

                                 JUNE
                        Ladies and Gentleman, that’s when I 
                        knew I had a scientist. 

                                 STUDENT #1
                        Was he a full grown? 

                                 JUNE
                        Two year old bamboo, a couple 
                        months and change. 

                                 CELIA
                        My mom, I mean June, she convinced 
                        our guide to let us bring him back 
                        to the hotel so she could watch him 
                        for twenty four hours. 

                                 JUNE 
                        Oh god help me. 

                                 CELIA
                        He was flirting with her. The 
                        guide, not the lemur. 

                                 JUNE
                        He was spitting on me, but he was 
                        smart enough, so I tolerated it. 

                                 CELIA
                        The lemur shat all over our room. 

           The students laugh. 

                                 STUDENT #2
                           (to Celia)
                        Are you excited to go back to 
                        school? 
                                 CELIA
                        I mean, I like physics. In ninth 
                        grade we get to take physics. I 
                        learn more from June, though. 

                                 JUNE
                        I pay her to say that. 

                                 STUDENT #1
                        I don’t miss Ithaca, that’s for 
                        sure. 

           June accepts a cigarette from one of the students. She takes 
           a long drag. Thinks for a minute. Addresses the whole group. 

                                 JUNE
                        Let’s get back to work. 

           EXT. TENTS/FOREST - LATER

           June and the students are positioned throughout the forest, 
           observing the lemurs with night vision equipment. 

           Celia wanders towards the tree where she tagged a lemur some 
           days ago. Familiar flowers bloom from this tree. A bamboo 
           lemur is gnawing at a small, tough fruit. 

           Celia climbs the tree, quick and careful in the dark. Plucks 
           one of the fruits from a branch, examines it. Unseen by her, 
           a BOA winds its way around a branch. 

           The snake bites her arm. Celia screams. 

           EXT. TENTS/FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

           Arturo injects medicine into Celia’s arm. Celia’s trying not 
           to cry as June blows in. 

                                 JUNE 
                        What the hell happened? 

                                 CELIA
                        I wasn’t paying attention. I should 
                        have been paying better attention. 

                                 JUNE
                        Does it hurt?

                                 CELIA
                        No. 
                                 JUNE
                           (affectionate)
                        Liar. 
                           (to Arturo)
                        How is she?

                                 CELIA
                        It’s a boa. It’s not poisonous. 

                                 ARTURO
                        I give shot, just in case. She’ll 
                        be fine. Strong girl. 

                                 JUNE
                        She really is, isn’t she? 

                                 ARTURO
                        I ask that we rest after dinner so 
                        that there are no injuries. Do you 
                        understand now? 

           June looks at him for a tense moment. 

                                 JUNE
                        Loud and clear.  
                           (doesn’t mean it)
                        And thank you. 

                                 CELIA
                        Thanks, Arturo. 

           Arturo retreats. June sits down next to Celia. Goes through 
           Arturo’s bag, lining up medications, ointments. Taking extra 
           precautions. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        What did you find? 

                                 JUNE
                        What did you find? 

           Celia holds out her good hand, revealing seeds from the fruit 
           she saw before.  June takes it, glances at her daughter, 
           smiles. 

                                 CELIA
                        The lemur was eating them. 

                                 JUNE
                        What genus? 

                                 CELIA
                        Bamboo. 
                                 JUNE
                        That isn’t usual. 

                                 CELIA
                        Maybe they’re adapting?

           June looks at her a moment. She’s been thinking about this. 

                                 JUNE
                        Very good. 

           June rips off Arturo’s lumpy bandage. She applies more 
           medication, efficiently and expertly re-bandages Celia’s 
           wound. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Better? 

           Celia nods. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        So, I’m thinking. 

                                 CELIA
                        That’s a surprise. 

           June grins, smacks her lightly. 

                                 JUNE
                        If the bamboo are consuming seeds, 
                        it’s very possible species in the 
                        south are diversifying, also.  

                                 CELIA
                        Like the Goldens? In Fort Dauphin? 

           Off June’s silence, Celia’s excitement begins to bubble. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        You want to go there, don’t you? 

                                 JUNE
                        You’d miss a week of school. Maybe 
                        two. 

           A beat. 

                                 CELIA
                        We probably shouldn’t tell Dad. 

           June kisses Celia’s head. Celia takes the seed back, examines 
           it. 
                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        Can I keep this one? 

           EXT. TENTS/FOREST - DAY

           Celia, arm bandaged, stirs mealy oatmeal over an open fire 
           and watches as her mother carries two small suitcases out of 
           their tent. 

           Arturo follows June as she loads up a jeep. She hands him a

                                 JUNE
                           (to Arturo)
                        Help me with this, would you? 

           Celia comes over. Waits till Arturo is done lugging the 
           suitcase, gives him a bowl of oatmeal. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                           (to Celia)
                        Check the tent. I saw a pair of 
                        goggles and a Vogue. 

                                 CELIA
                        I don’t read Vogue. 
                           (off June’s look)
                        I don’t. 

                                 JUNE
                        Just get your stuff. 

           With that, June heads to the fire pit. Celia and Arturo watch 
           as June says goodbye to the students. 

                                 ARTURO 
                        An old proverb. There was a woman 
                        once who traveled east to find the 
                        fountain of youth. She looked for 
                        many years. She went farther and 
                        farther from the coast of Africa. 
                        By the time she gave up, her 
                        children were old, too. 

                                 CELIA
                        I hope you didn’t tell that to my 
                        mother. 
                           (a beat)
                        Anyway, we’re going south. 
           EXT. MIDLANDS/TANA - DAY

           A small plane chugs east over the island. 

           EXT. AIRPORT - DAY - ANTANANARIVO

           June sweeps down onto the tarmac, eager to begin her work. 

           Celia waits, nervous, on the loose metal stairs, squinting 
           into the sun. From her vantage point, it looks as though 
           concrete and red dirt are all that exist here. 

           The camera pulls back and up, over crusty palm trees and low 
           stone buildings. Then we’re high in the hills, sweeping 
           towards a small blaze that’s almost invisible at first, but 
           grows imperceptibly brighter as we cut to:

           TITLE: THE BURNING SEASON 

           EXT. TRAIN - MOZAMBIQUE COAST - DAY 

           A train hurtles down the coast, Celia’s face pressed against 
           the window, the blaze distant in the background.

           CONFERENCE ROOM - EARLIER

           A power point presentation. An image of a lush forest 
           switches to an image of a golden bamboo lemur. June at a 
           podium, talking to a humorless committee, commanding their 
           attention. Celia sits in the back of the room, rapt. June is 
           mid-speech. 

                                 JUNE
                        Hapalemur aureus. Otherwise known 
                        as the golden bamboo. Otherwise 
                        known as the gentle lemur, which 
                        they absolutely are. Look at that 
                        guy. I’m asking for a little time 
                        and space to preserve the forest he 
                        calls home. 

                                 COMMITTEE MEMBER #1
                        We have given you many acres of

                                 JUNE
                        Yes, and I’m grateful. But, in 
                        relative terms, Ankarana is 
                        prospering.

                        The animals are protected, and 
                        there’s regular rainfall. 

           INT. TRAIN - DAY - SERIES OF SHOTS

           Celia and June watch the passing countryside, stretches of 
           desert-like plants and shallow pools of water. Celia writes a 
           letter. 

           Malagasy children run after the train. Passengers throw food 
           to them. Celia and June join in. 

           INT. MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH - 
           CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

                                 JUNE
                        When I discovered the golden bamboo 
                        fifteen years ago, their diet was 
                        primarily stalks and bark. I 
                        believe that’s changing. I believe 
                        they are now eating fruit and 
                        dispersing the seeds. 

           June switches to a picture of a plush, alert Golden Bamboo 
           Lemur. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Consider him your newest, greatest 
                        gardener. 

           June’s winning them over. Celia smiles. One of the youngest 
           committee members - DAUD, a PHD student we’ll meet later - 
           watches June with interest. Celia clocks this. 

                                                      END INTERCUT

           INT. TRAIN - DAWN 

           Celia, sleeping on June’s shoulder, opens her eyes to bright 
           sunlight and her mother shaking her, visibly excited. The 
           landscape has opened up to a reddish river bordered by red 
           dirt. 

                                 JUNE
                        You slept for six hours, lazy. 
                        We’re almost there. 

                                 CELIA
                        Why is the water so red? 

           June thinks for a beat, looks out the window with concern. 
                                 JUNE
                        Erosion. 
                           (off Celia’s look)
                        Don’t look so shocked. This from 
                        the girl who spends half her life 
                        in chlorine.  

                                 CELIA
                        Yeah, but I know it’s a chemical. 

                                 JUNE
                        Won’t make a difference when your 
                        hair falls out. 

           Celia takes this in. Hard to tell if she’s annoyed or tuning 
           out her mother. 

                                 CELIA
                        The following are fady in Fort 
                        Dauphin: throwing a stone at the 
                        Tolo bird. Eating meat for 
                        breakfast. Killing a crocodile. 
                        Going to the same bathroom twice. 

                                 JUNE
                        You memorized all that? 

                                 CELIA
                        You’ve been talking about Fort 
                        Dauphin practically my entire life. 

           June pushes her laptop towards Celia. Taps to enlarge an 
           image of two baby goldens peering through dense canopy. The 
           landscape around them is stunning. 

                                 JUNE
                        They were two weeks old, those 
                        guys. I counted twenty nine, my 
                        last trip here. 

           EXT. TRAIN - MOMENTS LATER

           June looks out the window at the reddened water, at a stretch 
           of decimated forest that the train chugs past. She lights a 
           cigarette. A CHAMELEON streaks across the land.

           EXT./INT. TRAIN - FORT DAUPHIN - LATER

           Malagasy children run towards the approaching train. 

           Celia follows her mother down the aisle of the now EMPTY 
           train, dragging their bags. 
           They step into the dry heat of Fort Dauphin and are 
           immediately surrounded by curious kids tugging at their 
           clothing. Celia empties her pockets - a few granola bars, a 
           bag of dried fruit.  

           EXT. TRAIN - LATER

           The children have cleared out, lost interest. June snaps 
           pictures of a dilapidated patch of forest. Celia, wilted, 
           sits on her suitcase reading. She digs around her bag, but 
           she’s given all her food away. 

           A GREEN JEEP, driven by HAJA bumps towards them. June calls 
           to him without turning away from the forest: 

                                 JUNE
                        Are you from the hotel? You’re 
                        late. 

           Haja doesn’t apologize, or think he needs to. He parks in 
           front of Celia. He’s in his 20s, skinny, all greetings and 
           smiles. 

           EXT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - MADAGASCAR - DAWN

           Haja pulls up a red dirt road, stopping in front of a hotel 
           book-ended by thick foliage. 

           The place is a dump - peeling yellow paint and a concrete 
           terrace on which meals are served. The terrace looks sturdy, 
           the rest looks like it could collapse any minute. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - MADAGASCAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Haja bounces up the creaking stairs, carrying Celia and 
           June’s bags easily. June speaks to him in confident Malagasy. 

                                 JUNE
                           (in Malagasy)
                        I can carry those. Really, this is 
                        silly.  

           They reach the top of the stairs. There are exactly three 
           rooms in the hotel, all of them empty.   

                                 HAJA
                           (in Malagasy)
                        The two biggest rooms!

           Celia glances around the hotel - the loose banister, the 
           rotting wood, the lack of staff or tourists. 
           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - JUNE AND CELIA’S ROOM - DAY

           Two adjoining rooms with wide, hard beds. Haja circles the 
           space, inspecting it. 

                                 HAJA
                           (in Malagasy)
                        And here, you see, Miss. Any 
                        problems, I fix them. 

           June gives Haja a huge tip. He counts it, surprised. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           LATER

           Celia unpacks: a few shorts and tank tops, one swimsuit, a 
           fashion magazine she hides under the clothes. She and her 
           mother travel light. 

           EXT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - BALCONY - DUSK

           Celia goes out on the balcony. Watches her mother, down on 
           the terrace, talking to Haja. He points east. 

           June looks up, sees Celia. She points to the huge crusty 
           trees that surround the hotel. 

                                 CELIA
                        Triangulated palms. 

                                 JUNE
                        They’re endangered, Celia. Like 
                        everything else on this island. 

           Celia leans over the railing. Around the palms there are 
           stretches of charred, empty land. 

           June smiles at Celia, trying to cover her concern.  

           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN - ROAD - DUSK

           June drives slowly down a pot holed road, past small thatched-
           roof huts and over red dirt. It’s desolate and a little 
           depressing. 

           Celia, in the passenger seat, notices a WOMAN and two 
           CHILDREN who duck behind a tree trunk when they see the jeep. 
           EXT. THEIRRY’S HUT - MOMENTS LATER

           June pulls up to a larger HUT. Takes a bottle of rum from her 
           bag, polishes it with a rag and her own spit, then hands it 
           to Celia. 

           THEIRRY, 50s, the VILLAGE KING, grey stubble on his head and 
           a smooth, kind face, exits the hut. He holds up his hand in 
           greeting. June helps Celia out of the jeep. 

                                 JUNE
                           (to Celia)
                        Ten years ago, he was a guide. Now 
                        he’s the leader of the village. 
                        That’s how it goes. 

                                 THEIRRY
                           (in Malagasy)
                        Misses June! 

                                 JUNE
                        Mr. Theirry!

           June hops out of the jeep. Celia follows her. Theirry shakes 
           June’s hand, warmly. 

                                 THEIRRY
                           (in Malagasy)
                        Do not tell me a beautiful woman 
                        such as you has come alone. 

                                 JUNE
                           (in Malagasy)
                        My husband had classes to teach 
                        this summer. This is our daughter, 
                        Celia. 

           June nudges Celia, who gives Theirry the rum. 

                                 THEIRRY
                           (to Celia, in English)
                        Your mother, smart lady. 

                                 CELIA
                        She really is. 

           June puts her arm around Celia as Theirry leads them towards 
           the hut.  

           INT. THEIRRY’s HUT - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia looks around - this is where the king lives? General 
           chaos. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           Six small kids roll marbles across the floor, catch them. 
           Theirry’s wife de-bones a large fish over a metal bowl. Sun 
           leaks through a hole in the thatched roof.

           June lays out pictures on Theirry’s dirt floor. Two of the 
           kids latch onto Celia, drag her away from her mother. One of 
           the kids offers Celia a plate of fried locusts. She tries 
           one, finds it horrible. 

                                 JUNE
                           (in Malagasy)
                        These were taken in Ankarana, the 
                        conservation I was telling you 
                        about. 
                           (pointing)
                        We’ve found that when seeds are 
                        planted by the lemurs they grow 
                        more efficiently than when we plant 
                        them on our own. This could be very 
                        beneficial for your village.  

           Celia watches as June nudges a picture of a golden bamboo 
           towards Theirry. One of the kids climbs onto Celia’s lap. 
           Another starts braiding her hair. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                           (in Malagasy)
                        Do you remember, Theirry? The first 
                        spotting of a Golden Bamboo Lemur, 
                        and it happened here. 
                           (off his nod)
                        All I need is a few protected 
                        hectares. We don’t have much time 
                        before the fire season starts. 

           Celia sees a sick OLD WOMAN (Theirry’s mother) in the dark 
           corner on a cot. Theirry’s wife, finished with the fish, now 
           tends to her. 

           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN - RIVER - DAY

           A GUIDE rows Celia and June down the river. The water is red, 
           the water level is waning. A crested ibis swoops down. A 
           black heron perches high in a wilted tree. A chameleon peeks 
           out from behind a log. 

           Celia sees the brown head of a CROCODILE in the distance and 
           flinches. June touches her daughter’s arm.  
           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN RIVER - LATER

           The guide docks their canoe on the muddy red bank. June 
           climbs onto the bank, briskly flicks water off her jacket. 
           She grabs Celia’s hand and helps her out. 

           A group of SMALL boys are running in the distance, screaming 
           with glee. June zeroes in, concerned. 

           EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS

           The boys - 8 or 9, emaciated - throw rocks at a lemur trap 
           perched in a tree. The trap has rusty metal bars, something 
           moving inside it. 

           June hurries ahead of Celia. The trees are sparse. They are 
           both weighed down by their gear.

           Seeing her, one boy begins to SCREAM. The children dart in 
           the opposite direction. June shakes her head, marches to the 
           tree, tugs at the trap. She pulls it open and snags her 
           finger. Curses. A weak white and grey AYE AYE LEMUR is still 
           alive inside it. 

           Celia catches up to June. Quickly pulls herself onto the 
           lowest branch. Inches the trap closer to June, who gently 
           pulls the lemur out and begins to tend to her. 

                                 CELIA
                        I thought it was fady to hunt 
                        lemurs.  

                                 JUNE
                        Well, they’re starving. Can you see 
                        if we have any formula? 

           Celia slides back to the ground, begins to look through their 
           gear. Finds the formula and hands it to June. June begins to 
           feed the lemur. She has a tender and delicate way of handling 
           her. She looks up at Celia, tears in her eyes. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Female. Around five years old. An 
                        aye-aye. 

                                 CELIA
                        June, you’re bleeding. 

           June’s hand is gashed, but June ignores it. 
                                 JUNE
                        It isn’t always considered fady to 
                        hunt the aye-aye. They think that 
                        they’re bad luck. 

                                 CELIA
                        Are they the kind Dad said looked 
                        like demented cats? 

                                 JUNE
                        Your father would say that. He 
                        likes to put down anything that’s 
                        smarter than he is. 
                           (beat)
                        Write this down. The first of the 
                        brown group. Brown #1. First 
                        spotted one and nine tenth miles 
                        from the entry point. September 
                        5th. 

           Celia writes down everything June says. 

                                 CELIA
                        Can we give her a real name? 

                                 JUNE
                        She has a name. Brown #1. 

           Celia inspects her mother’s hand. June continues to tend to 
           the lemur.   

                                 CELIA
                        You need to disinfect. 

           June pats her daughter’s cheek. Stands up. Brown #1 grips her 
           shirt. 

           EXT. RESEARCH CABIN - ESTABLISHING - MOMENTS LATER

           June, still holding Brown #1, nods towards a dilapidated 
           CABIN yards from them. The windows have been broken and the 
           roof has rotted through. 

                                 JUNE
                        I examined the first goldens in 
                        that cabin. I was practically a 
                        kid. 
                           (off Celia’s silence)
                        How long do you think it will take 
                        us to make this functional? 
           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN - TANAMBOA MARKET - NIGHT - SERIES OF SHOTS

           A feast is in process, a roast mostly picked clean. A group 
           of musicians play violins, guitars, accordions. Everyone 
           drinks moonshine. 

           Celia watches June dance with the villagers - including 
           Theirry and his wives - spinning amongst them, snapping into 
           the rhythm of the music - sweat and shimmying shoulders and 
           pure joy. 

           Celia turns to see a group of children waiting for food, but 
           the meat is gone.  

           June grabs Celia’s hand and pulls her into the circle. 

           Celia’s self conscious, completely aware that everyone is 
           staring at both of them. But the music grows louder and the 
           dancing gets wilder and Celia forgets herself. 

           Mother and daughter are clapping and spinning, fueled by 
           excitement and moonshine, when, over June’s shoulder Celia 
           sees the swift and brutal slaughter of a live ZEBU. 

           Celia flinches and grips her mother, who notes the ritual 
           with seasoned nonchalance, pulling Celia deeper into the 
           crowd. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           NIGHT

           Celia throws up into the sink. June holds her hair back. 
           Celia accepts the water bottle her mother offers her. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN- CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - PRE-
           DAWN

           Celia opens her eyes to her mother shaking her. It’s still 
           dark outside. 

                                 CELIA
                        What time is it? 

                                 JUNE
                        The best time of day to see 
                        nocturnal aye-ayes. Come.  

                                 CELIA
                        I feel like someone exploded a rock 
                        in my skull. 
                                 JUNE
                        That, Celi, is what they call a 
                        hangover. You have sixty seconds to 
                        make a decision. 

           Celia pulls her blanket over her head. June waits for a 
           moment. Pats the blanket, squeezes the bump of her daughter’s 
           foot. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS

           Celia wakes up. The sun is bright. Presses her hand against 
           her dull headache. June has left a bottle of Advil. Celia 
           takes one. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia goes down the crooked stairway. No one’s at the front 
           desk. 

           EXT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - TERRACE - CONTINUOUS

           Celia shoves a couple bites of bread into her mouth. Grabs a 
           few rolls and shoves them in her pocket. 

           She pours a cup of coffee. Sees the young man - DAUD - from 
           the University of Antananarivo, a heavy backpack by his feet. 

           He is 29, tall, sturdy, handsome, despite a nose that looks 
           to have been broken more than once. 

           EXT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CONTINUOUS

           Daud approaches Celia. 

                                 DAUD
                        You, I recognize. I am looking for 
                        June Engle. 

           Celia looks at him, wary. 

                                 CELIA
                        Are you from the ministry? 

                                 DAUD
                        The university. This place does not 
                        make itself easy to find. 
                                 CELIA
                        It’s the only hotel for twenty six 
                        miles. 

           June runs up, hair back, lightly sweating, lugging gear. 

                                 JUNE
                        Brown #1 is already rallying, I 
                        think she’ll be ready for re-
                        integration in a couple of days. 
                           (glancing at Daud)
                        You must be the zoologist. 

           Celia looks up at her mother, confused. June swings her arm 
           around Celia’s shoulder. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Celia and I found a five year old 
                        female, pretty bad shape. Couple of 
                        kids looking for a meal. 

                                 DAUD
                           (re Celia)
                        I take it this is your sister, 
                        then? 

                                 JUNE
                        Don’t bullshit me, mister. Did you 
                        know I was the first to photograph 
                        golden bamboo lemurs? They were so 
                        rare, it took us weeks of trekking 
                        in the forest to find them. 

                                 DAUD
                        I’ve seen your footage. 

                                 JUNE
                        Have you? 

                                 DAUD
                        You have a few fans at the 
                        university. 

                                 JUNE
                        I thought it was the opposite. 

                                 DAUD
                        It’s not often we meet American 
                        women with such intelligence. 

                                 JUNE
                        Something tells me this isn’t 
                        exactly a compliment. 
           Celia looks between them. Hands her mother a roll and coffee. 
           June gulps the coffee in a swift sip. Tears off a piece of 
           the roll. Hands it back to Celia. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                           (to Daud)
                        Let’s get to work. 

           EXT. FOREST - DAY 

           June clips quickly through the forest, Daud keeping pace. 
           Celia trails behind them. June points to a bare gulf between 
           trees, Daud bends to inspect it. 

                                 JUNE
                        Another bush fire, there -

                                 DAUD
                        This was recent. 

                                 JUNE
                        Day before yesterday. 

                                 DAUD
                        Early for them. 

                                 JUNE
                        Theirry said they’d leave this area 
                        - a square mile around the research 
                        cabin.  Wait!

           Celia and Daud abruptly stop. June kneels next to a half 
           buried pile of dung. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Gloves, please. 

           Celia gives them to her. June plucks a few seeds from the 
           dung. 

                                 CELIA
                        Are they planted by a golden?

                                 JUNE
                        It’s possible. God, it’s possible. 
                        Tracks are too wide to be an aye-
                        aye.  

           June stores the seeds, dispenses with her gloves. She takes a 
           rapid series of pictures. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Mark this spot. 
                                 DAUD
                        One and a quarter kilometers in, 
                        approximately. 

                                 CELIA
                           (to Daud)
                        You need to give the exact 
                        location. 

           Daud looks up at Celia, holds out his pedometer, which looks 
           a bit worse for the wear. 

                                 DAUD
                        Here. Have a go. 

                                 CELIA
                        One and three fifth miles from the 
                        forest entry point. 85 meters from 
                        the research cabin, once we fix it. 
                           (nodding at June, who is 
                           already trudging ahead)
                        She’ll be mad if you don’t tell 
                        her. You’ll see. 

           June glides ahead.  Daud follows, fascinated. Celia watches 
           as he hurries to catch up to her mother. 

           EXT. FOREST - LATER

           Celia, June, and Daud wait patiently in June’s designated 
           spot, a few nets spread in front of them. 

                                 CELIA
                        Is this where you found the first 
                        one? 

           June puts her finger to her lips. 

                                 JUNE
                           (a whisper)
                        20 meters from the research cabin. 

           There’s rustling above. June’s eyes have not left the trees. 
           A flash of brown fur becomes visible. Then a tail, and 
           another tail, and another tail. 

                                 CELIA
                        June.

           June creeps closer. They speak in whispers. 
                                 JUNE
                        Shh. I see them. Daud, write this 
                        down. The largest is approximately 
                        35 inches tall.
                           (shakes her head)
                        Chestnut brown pelage. 

           Celia grabs a slippery tree branch with her good hand and 
           tries to pull herself up. Slips. Tries again. Daud moves to 
           assist her but she waves him away. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                           (to Celia)
                        Can you handle more than one? 

                                 CELIA
                        I got it. 

                                 JUNE
                           (to Daud)
                        She hurt herself in Ankarana. 

           Celia slips, catches herself. The lemurs scatter. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Shit. 

                                 CELIA
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 JUNE
                        They won’t come back to this 
                        location. 

                                 CELIA
                        I’m sorry. 

           Daud throws an anesthetic dart, knocking one fleeing lemur to 
           the ground. June snaps a collar on the lemur. 

                                 DAUD
                           (to Celia)
                        Are you all right? 

           Celia nods. Does not accept his hand. Daud and June wait for 
           a moment. Celia slowly climbs down. 

           EXT. RESEARCH CABIN - LATER

           Celia hammers planks onto a damaged side of the research 
           cabin. She’s sweating. She watches her mother tell Daud a 
           story as she shows him Brown #1. They’re laughing about 
           something.  
                                 CELIA
                        What’s so funny? 

                                 JUNE
                        War stories of the academic 
                        persuasion. 
                           (off Celia’s look)
                        Daud had a semester with my old 
                        advisor. Convinced him to go 
                        underwater diving. And we’re 
                        talking about one of the biggest 
                        cowards I’ve come across. 
                           (to Daud)
                        You’ve got to tell me how you did 
                        it. 

                                 DAUD
                        For now, this is a secret. 

           Celia watches them flirt for a moment. Drops the hammer and 
           heads in the direction they came from. 

                                 JUNE
                        Where are you going? 

           June trudges after Celia. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Celi. Hey. What’s up?  

           June catches up to her. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Celia.

                                 CELIA
                        You didn’t tell me anyone else was 
                        coming. 

                                 JUNE
                        It’s standard. 
                           (beat)
                        You know that. 

                                 CELIA
                        I could take notes. I could monitor 
                        for you.   

                                 JUNE
                        The powers that be have their own 
                        rules. I’ve given up trying to 
                        understand them. 

           Celia looks at her mother. Not sure she really believes her. 
                                 CELIA
                        How long are we really going to be 
                        here? How many weeks of school? 

                                 JUNE
                        We just got here, and already you 
                        want to go home? 

                                 CELIA
                        I didn’t say that.

           Celia walks off. June watches her for a beat. 

           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN - ROAD

           Celia walks up the road, comes upon a rice field, where 
           VILLAGERS work hard to harvest - among them, the children 
           Celia saw in the forest. All are bone thin, wearing 
           threadbare clothes.  

           The workers squint warily at her. The children retreat behind 
           their parents. 

           A tall blond WOMAN and a young boy on a motorbike pass by. 
           Celia turns and sees them. 

           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN COAST - DAY

           Celia walks down the road, in the direction of the motorbike. 
           The OCEAN comes into focus far in front of her. 

           EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - LATER

           Celia writes a letter. Stops to watch fishermen throw puffer 
           fish back into the ocean. 

           Celia gets up. Walks closer to the ocean. In the pool she’s a 
           champion, but the ocean has terrified her since she was a 
           child. 

           She looks west, sees the edge of the FOREST, where her mother 
           is with Daud. She looks east, sees an ISLAND, far in the 
           distance. 

           She looks right in front of her, at the vast stretch of water 
           that she wishes didn’t scare her. She turns away. 
           EXT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - NIGHT

           June, Daud, and Celia eat dinner. Haja and another worker eat 
           a few tables away. 

                                 JUNE
                        We covered ten acres of the 
                        rainforest after you left. I’m 
                        ready to strangle this man. 

                                 DAUD
                        I’m a very hard person to work 
                        with. 

                                 JUNE
                        Oh, mister, you should have met 
                        some of the kids I took to 
                        Ankarana. Constantly distracted. 
                        And don’t get me started on our 
                        geriatric guide.
                           (to Celia)
                        Isn’t that right, Celi?

           Celia shrugs. June watches her poke at her food. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Celia wasn’t partial to fried 
                        locusts. I told her they were an 
                        acquired taste. 

                                 DAUD
                        They’re good for you. Brain food. 

                                 JUNE
                           (to Celia)
                        So. What did you study?  
                           (to Daud)
                        Celia has the most astonishing 
                        memory. 
                           (to Celia)
                        Give him a list - how about 
                        pollution? 

                                 CELIA
                        The most polluted places on earth: 
                        Ranipe, India. La Oroya, Peru, 
                        Linfen, China. Um -Dzerzhinsk, 
                        Russia; Haina, the Dominican 
                        Republic; Kabwe, Zambia. And you 
                        can’t forget Chernobyl. 
                                 JUNE
                        Anyone who keeps a nuclear power 
                        plant in business should be forced 
                        to eat their own plutonium. 

                                 DAUD
                           (to Celia)
                        What else have you got? 

                                 CELIA
                        A list of all the famous scientists 
                        who committed suicide. And how they 
                        did it. 

                                 DAUD
                        I didn’t know that many had. 

                                 CELIA
                        Adolphe d’Archiac - threw himself 
                        into the Seine River. Percy 
                        Williams Bridgman shot himself. 
                        James Leonard Brierley Smith took 
                        cyanide. Viktor Meyer - also 
                        cyanide. 

                                 DAUD
                        Sounds like cyanide was the way to 
                        go. 

                                 CELIA
                        It does kill you pretty quickly. 

                                 DAUD
                           (to June)
                        You’ve given your daughter quite 
                        the education. 

                                 JUNE
                        Most parents shield their children 
                        from reality. I wanted Celia to 
                        learn about hardship early on.

           Daud’s eyes have barely left June. Celia looks between the 
           two of them, realizing they don’t really need her in this 
           conversation. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           BATHROOM

           June washes Celia’s hair in the sink. The scream of the indri 
           loud through the window. 
                                 CELIA
                        They weren’t stupid. Your team. 

                                 JUNE
                        There’s no point in being 
                        sentimental. 

           June hands Celia a towel. Celia rubs her hair dry as June 
           ducks her head in the sink and begins washing her own hair. 
           After a moment: 

                                 CELIA
                        He seems smart, I guess. Daud. 

                                 JUNE
                        He is. Clever when he isn’t lazy. 

                                 CELIA
                        What do you mean? 

                                 JUNE
                        He’s quick on his feet. 

                                 CELIA
                        But doesn’t always try. 

           June smiles: exactly. 

                                 JUNE
                        You never told me what you did 
                        today. 

                                 CELIA
                        Studied. I told you. 

           Celia begins combing her mother’s hair. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                           (re hair)
                        Maybe you should dye it. Like 
                        redder or something. 

                                 JUNE
                           (ignoring her)
                        You’re old enough to start thinking 
                        seriously about what you want to do 
                        with your life. 

                                 CELIA
                        I want to swim long distance, like 
                        Lynne Cox. 

                                 JUNE
                        Celia, you hate the ocean. 
                                 CELIA
                        I don’t!

                                 JUNE
                        Oh, don’t get upset. You’re a 
                        sprinter. You always have been.  
                           (beat)
                        You’re also an excellent scientist. 

           Celia stops combing. Thinks about this. Still smarting from 
           before. 

                                 CELIA
                        I screwed up though. 

                                 JUNE
                        Everyone does, sometimes. 

                                 CELIA
                        Not you. 

           Celia leaves the bathroom and gets into bed. The indri 
           screams swell. She covers her ears. 

           A moment passes. June sits on the edge of her bed. Gives her 
           a pair of ear plugs. Celia turns away. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - JUNE AND CELIA’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           LATER

           Celia can’t sleep. She turns to see her mother passed out in 
           her clothes. 

           Celia tiptoes over to June, checks to make sure the finger 
           she snagged on the trap is healing. The INDRI (nocturnal 
           lemur) start their nightly SCREAM.  

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           PRE-DAWN

           Celia opens her eyes to her mother again leaving before 
           daybreak. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - LOBBY - EARLY MORNING

           Celia walks quietly down the stairs, into the empty lobby. 
           There’s an ancient telephone behind the check-in desk. Celia 
           dials. 
                                 CELIA
                        I wanted to make a collect call. 
                        Leonard Engle? 
                           (beat)
                        Yeah, Bryant Avenue. In Ithaca. 
                           (beat)
                        OK. You could try his cell. 255-

           A moment passes. Then another. Celia hesitates, then hangs up 
           the phone. 

           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN - TANAMBOA MARKET - LATER

           Celia walks through a tiny market, past stands selling fruit, 
           wood carvings, dyed clothes, beautiful embroidery. 

           The woman who passed Celia near the rice field crouches at 
           one stand, filling a satchel with colorful fabric. This is 
           MELANIE. 

           We get a better look at Melanie. She’s tough and stately. 
           Beads dangle from her neck. She glances at Celia.

           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN - TANAMBOA MARKET - LATER

           Celia crouches down in front of a necklace with an tiny stone 
           amulet shaped like a moth. A SALESMAN, 30s approaches her. 

                                 SALESMAN
                           (in Malagasy)
                        You want her? Five thousand ariary. 

           Celia flips through her translation book, finds the correct 
           phrase. 

                                 CELIA
                           (in Malagasy)
                        What is it? 

                                 SALESMAN
                           (in Malagasy)
                        White moth. Protected the ancient 
                        people from the forest demons. 

           Celia flips though her translation book. 

                                 CELIA 
                           (in Malagasy)
                        Protection? 
                                 SALESMAN
                           (in Malagasy)
                        If you listen to these demons for 
                        too long, your body will turn to 
                        stone.

           Celia examines the amulet. Reaches into her pocket, counts 
           out coins. 

           EXT. TANAMBOA MARKET - LATER

           Celia, wearing the amulet, reaches the end of the market and 
           comes upon a thatch-roofed shack. It’s a small, empty bar, 
           flanked by spiny plants. 

           Out front an INDRI is chained to a post. Celia looks at him 
           for a moment, his round eyes and filthy fur. She inches up to 
           him, gets as close as possible. 

           Celia looks into the bar. The bartender - PHILLIPPE, early 
           20s - is the only occupant. 

                                 CELIA
                        Why do you have him chained like 
                        that? 

           Phillippe looks at her blankly. 

                                 MELANIE (O.S.)
                        He doesn’t speak English. 

           Celia turns. Melanie, a bible in her tanned hand, sweeps past 
           Celia into the bar. 

           INT./EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Melanie approaches Phillippe, pats the bible on the bar, taps 
           it, and says something in Malagasy. 

           Phillippe unchains the lemur, who darts into a nearby bush. 
           Melanie winks at Celia. 

           Celia walks into the bar, looks around. A few rotting stools.  
           A few cheap beer bottles and glass tubs of lychee. Melanie 
           gestures towards a stool. Celia sits. 

                                 MELANIE
                        Melanie Meier. Meier Ministry. 

                                 CELIA
                        What did you say to him? 
                                 MELANIE
                        Proverb number twelve, a man shall 
                        have no advantage over beasts. 

           Celia looks at her, confused. 

                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s from the bible, darling. You 
                        want to hear more, we have a base 
                        south of the market. Anyone is 
                        welcome. 
                           (beat)
                        Your mother, too. 

                                 CELIA
                        How do you know my mother?

                                 MELANIE
                        Yesterday she chased two eight-year- 
                        olds out of the forest. We’ve got a 
                        saying on our mission: you matter 
                        less than the community you foster. 

                                 CELIA
                        But who said she chased them? 

                                 MELANIE
                        Who do you think? The kids did. 
                           (beat)
                        This is their land. We’re visitors, 
                        that’s all. 

           Melanie slides a few ariary coins across the bar. Celia 
           notices a delicate cross tattooed on Melanie’s arm. Phillippe 
           gives her a glass of lychee juice, which she gulps with 
           gusto.

                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                           (off Celia’s stare)
                        Can’t blame a girl for being 
                        thirsty. 
                           (beat)
                        Ask him for the lychee juice. 
                        Delicious. 

           She swans away, gets onto a motorbike and powers it up. Celia 
           watches her go, then consults her book. 

                                 CELIA
                           (in Malagasy)
                        Could I have the moonshine? 

           Phillippe places a drink in front of Celia. She sips it. It’s 
           stronger than she remembered.
           EXT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - TERRACE - DUSK 

           Haja serves June and Daud dinner. 

           Celia, face flushed, shoulders completely burnt, walks up to 
           the patio.

                                 JUNE
                        Look who wandered in. 
                           (to Celia)
                        You’re not going to believe the day 
                        we had. We watched two bamboo 
                        lemurs nearly kill each other over 
                        a mate - 

                                 DAUD
                        They nearly scratched each others’ 
                        eyes out. 

                                 JUNE
                           (to Haja)
                        Can you get us more of this fish? 
                        It’s delicious - some kind of 
                        curry? 

                                 CELIA
                        You left without me. 

                                 JUNE
                        I would have had an easier time 
                        waking one of the bamboos.  
                           (to Haja, in Malagasy)
                        If you see them, you’ll tell your 
                        friends to stop burning the forests 
                        down. 

                                 DAUD
                        June. 

                                 JUNE
                        No, he’ll see. 
                           (to Haja, in Malagasy)
                        You’ll see. We’ll help you plant 
                        the right crops. Better for 
                        everyone. The animals are sacred. 
                        You must protect them. Do you 
                        understand? 

                                 HAJA
                           (In Malagasy)
                        I am sorry, miss. To make you 
                        upset. 
                                 DAUD
                           (In Malagasy)
                        She knows it’s not your fault, 
                        Haja. 

           Haja leaves. 

                                 DAUD (CONT’D)
                        You shouldn’t promise things like 
                        that. 

                                 JUNE
                        I didn’t promise anything I can’t 
                        deliver. 

           She touches his wrist. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        We can’t. 

           He looks at her shyly. After a beat June begins shoveling 
           food into her mouth, barely chewing. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        The goldens exhibit nocturnal 
                        tendencies. We should get back to 
                        the site. 

                                 DAUD
                           (lightly)
                        If you choke, you’ll never see 
                        them. 
                           (to Celia)
                        Is she this hard on everyone?

                                 CELIA
                           (to Daud)
                        When she thinks they’re lazy. 

                                 JUNE
                        I thought you would have wanted to 
                        see how Brown One was doing. 

                                 CELIA
                        How’s she doing? 

                                 JUNE
                        Better. Eating on her own.  

                                 CELIA
                        I met a missionary. 

           Daud and June look at each other. 
                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        That’s what she said she was.  

                                 JUNE
                        You shouldn’t be talking to her, 
                        Celia. 

                                 CELIA
                        Why not? 

                                 JUNE
                        Does it matter? 

                                 DAUD
                        Any more lists for us?  

                                 JUNE
                        Oh for god’s sake, Daud, she’s not 
                        a robot. 

                                 CELIA
                        Marjorie Gestrung - the youngest 
                        Olympic Gold Medalist. Jordan 
                        Romero was thirteen when he scaled 
                        Mount Everest. Pele was seventeen 
                        when he scored a goal in the world 
                        cup. Serjei Karjakin was a chess 
                        grandmaster at twelve. Lynne Cox 
                        was fifteen when she swam the 
                        English Channel. 

                                 DAUD
                        Did you know Pele used to be my 
                        hero? 

                                 JUNE
                        I wish you’d told me you were a 
                        jock masquerading as a scientist. 

                                 DAUD
                        Ah, but you would have requested 
                        someone else. 

                                 JUNE
                        Not that I had much of a choice. 

                                 DAUD
                        Thanks, then. 

           June grins.

                                 JUNE
                        I got lucky. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           Celia looks between her mother and Daud, trying to read the 
           dynamic between them, their hands almost touching. Haja comes 
           out. 

                                 HAJA
                           (in Malagasy)
                        Miss June? There is a telephone 
                        call for you. Mr. Leonard Engle. 

           Celia turns to June. 

                                 JUNE
                           (in Malagasy)
                        Tell him I’m busy.
                           (off Haja’s hesitation)
                        Go on. 

           Haja turns. 

                                 CELIA
                        I could have talked to him. 

           June gives her a look. A beat. 

                                 JUNE
                        How did he know where we were? 

           Celia doesn’t have an answer. June’s face is unreadable. She 
           stands up, motioning for Daud to follow. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - NIGHT

           Celia walks quietly towards Daud’s room. His door is closed. 
           She hears him hum, “The Impossible Dream,” hears June laugh. 
           Celia stands there for a moment, but she can’t make out what 
           they’re saying. 

           EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - BEACH - DAY

           Celia, dressed in a swimsuit, stands in front of the ocean. 

           She takes a shallow breath. She takes a small step in. Then 
           another. Then another. The ocean looks so big. 

           Celia closes her eyes. Opens them. Another breath. She looks 
           back, towards the beach and safety. A familiar man is giving 
           lychees to two children. 

           Daud. He looks up and sees her. They stare at each other for 
           a moment: a face off. Then Celia turns around, presses into 
           the water, and begins to swim. 
           EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - LATER

           Celia treads water. Begins a tentative crawl. In the pool 
           she’s won races with this stroke, but she’s slow out in the 
           ocean. 

           She keeps swimming even as the water gets rougher. 

           She’s so focused she doesn’t see a huge WAVE coming. Then 
           she’s under water, struggling against the current and the 
           current’s winning. 

           Daud, still wearing his t-shirt and shorts, cuts through the 
           water with the powerful stroke of a seasoned swimmer. He 
           hooks his arm around Celia’s waist and pulls her up, past a 
           darting school of fish. 

           Daud pulls Celia to the shore. 

           EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia stands on the beach, catches her breath. Daud watches 
           her. 

                                 CELIA
                        That came out of nowhere. 
                           (beat)
                        Where’s my mom? I mean, where’s 
                        June? 

                                 DAUD
                        I thought I’d re-charge for an 
                        hour. Not a lot of sunshine in the 
                        field.  

                                 CELIA
                        Lots of dendantum trees. 

                                 DAUD
                        Is that what those are? 

                                 CELIA
                        You should know that. You’re from 
                        here. 

                                 DAUD
                        Maybe. But Tana has no dendantum 
                        trees. And upstate New York has no 
                        palm trees. Same country, different 
                        region.

                        Your mother thinks you have given

                                 CELIA
                        She found it. 

           Celia looks out at the ocean. She’d rather be here, anyway. 

           EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia and Daud walk up the beach as Celia dries off. 

                                 DAUD
                        We came here, every summer, raced, 
                        tried to drown each other, tried to 
                        drown other kids. We were little 
                        brats. 
                           (pointing south-west)
                        You can see land if you swim far 
                        enough. 

                                 CELIA
                        I want to swim there. That island. 
                           (beat)
                        June doesn’t really think I can. 

                                 DAUD
                        Why do you call her that? 

                                 CELIA
                        It’s her name. 
                           (off Daud’s silence)
                        She’s wanted me to since my dad 
                        left. Not because of vanity. 
                        Because of professional identity. 

           Daud laughs. 

                                 DAUD
                        Everyone at my university knows 
                        about your mother. 

                                 CELIA
                        You should tell that to my dad. 

                                 DAUD
                        June says they worked together. 
                        When she first came up with the 
                        seed dispersal theory. That was the 
                        most I could get out of her. 

                                 CELIA
                        She doesn’t like to talk about him. 

                                 DAUD
                        They’re divorced? 
                                 CELIA
                        Did June tell you that? 

                                 DAUD
                        She did not. 

                                 CELIA
                        Good. 
                           (beat)
                        Have you ever been divorced? 

           Daud shakes his head. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        Do you have more than one wife? 

                                 DAUD
                        I have exactly zero. 

                                 CELIA
                        So you can sleep with my mom. 

           Daud says nothing for a tense moment. Then starts to laugh. 
           Celia stares at him, horrified. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        It’s not funny. 

                                 DAUD
                        I’m sorry. I am sorry. It is not 
                        funny. What can I say? Your mother 
                        is quite an amazing woman. 

                                 CELIA
                        My dad has a girlfriend. He met her 
                        at the racetrack. She’s a 
                        professional mom. 
                           (beat)
                        He’s still in love with June. He 
                        just isn’t strong enough to be 
                        around her. 

           Daud thinks about this. 

                                 DAUD
                        It’s something, her theory. 

                                 CELIA
                        If she proves it, will they stop 
                        burning down the forests? 

                                 DAUD
                        This is a practice older than I am. 
                        Older than your mother.

                        If anyone can make them understand 
                        the damage, it’s June.

                                 CELIA
                        Why?

                                 DAUD
                        When you’re starting out, you want 
                        to swim with the current, not 
                        against it. 

                                 CELIA
                        I’m not starting out. 

           A beat. 

                                 DAUD
                        I’m off then. Wouldn’t want to be 
                        late. 

           Daud revs up his motorbike. 

                                 CELIA
                        Daud?
                           (beat)
                        Thanks for helping me. But I would 
                        have been fine. 

           Daud looks at her for a minute, smiles. Celia watches him 
           ride off. 

           EXT. FOREST - RESEARCH CABIN - DUSK

           Celia comes in quietly. June and Daud are observing a few 
           caged aye-aye lemurs while June types quickly on a clunky 
           laptop. CAGES, CAMERAS, TRACKING COLLARS, and LABELED 
           SPECIMENS now line the dusty shelves of the cabin. 

           Celia peeks into the cage where Brown #1 is recovering. June 
           stops typing. 

                                 JUNE
                           (to Celia)
                        She looks great, doesn’t she? 
                           (to Daud)
                        Done. Give this a look? 

           Daud starts to read. June motions for Celia to come over. 
                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                           (to Celia)
                        We were looking for you. Could have 
                        used some help. Come here. Come 
                        over here.  

           Celia stays where she is. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you want to take a look at 
                        these guys? 

           June points to the cages with lemurs, who wear tracking 
           collars. Celia puts the specimen jar down and reluctantly 
           joins her mother. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        The aye-aye have been straying from 
                        their usual base. Brown has 
                        company. 

                                 CELIA
                        Do they bury seeds too? 

                                 JUNE
                        It’s possible. 

                                 DAUD
                        We don’t have the evidence. Not 
                        yet. 

                                 JUNE
                        We just need to find the Goldens. 
                        And convince the powers that be. 

                                 DAUD
                        What’s this phrase, the powers that 
                        be? 

                                 CELIA
                        When less iconoclastic humans form 
                        a corporate group they lose their 
                        individuality and also their 
                        humanity.

           Daud laughs.

                                 JUNE
                        She listens to me sometimes. 

                                 DAUD
                        And yet we need their backing, 
                        don’t we now? 
                                 JUNE
                           (shooting him a grin)
                        I can play nice. 

           Daud pushes the screen back to June. 

                                 DAUD
                        You have persuaded me. 

                                 JUNE
                        Good. 
                           (to Celia)
                        What happened to your shoulders? 
                        You look like you’re molting. 

                                 CELIA
                        I went to the ocean. 

                                 DAUD
                        Celia took me swimming. You didn’t 
                        tell me she had such talent. 

           June looks between the two of them. 

                                 JUNE
                        Did you? 

                                 CELIA
                        I have to practice somewhere. 

                                 DAUD
                        We stayed near the pirogues. Very 
                        safe. 

                                 JUNE
                           (to Celia)
                        Have you been to the tombs yet? 
                        Visited the caves? 

                                 CELIA
                        I don’t have a lot of interest in 
                        meeting another crocodile. 

                                 JUNE
                        You’ve got to get over your fear, 
                        Celia. I didn’t even leave New York 
                        until I met your father. I want to 
                        make sure you take advantage.

           Daud puts his arms around both of them. 

                                 DAUD
                        Lighten up, ladies. You want to see 
                        those tombs? 
           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN - MALAGASY TOMBS - NIGHT

           Daud leads them through a colorfully painted stone tomb. His 
           flashlight flickers over images of Malagasy gods. He puts his 
           finger to his lips. June hangs back.  

                                 CELIA
                           (to June, a whisper)
                        Are you scared? 

                                 JUNE
                        Of course not. 

           Daud puts his finger to his lips. 

                                 DAUD
                           (whispering)
                        We’re not supposed to be here. This 
                        is when the spirits are asleep. 

           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN - MALAGASY TOMBS - LATER

           Daud leads them through the tombs, a huge stone compound 
           decorated with bright geometric paintings and animal skulls. 

           Daud points out different paintings. 

                                 DAUD
                        To ensure a peaceful afterlife. To 
                        ensure that their descendents are 
                        fertile. 

                                 CELIA
                           (giggling)
                        Seriously? 

                                 DAUD
                           (he doesn’t think it is)
                        This is serious. 

           Daud points to another animal painting - a lemur. 

                                 DAUD (CONT’D)
                        You don’t see them in many tombs. 

                                 CELIA
                        Why not? 

                                 DAUD
                        The first people who settled here 
                        were scared of them. Got it into 
                        their heads that they were demons.

                                 DAUD (CONT'D)
                        Because of the way they sounded. 
                        Some of them still think that. 

                                 JUNE
                        They were here first, the indri. 
                        They used to be as big as we were. 
                        Their scream was integral to their 
                        survival. 
                           (a beat)
                        A thousand years ago, before men 
                        settled, the crocodiles tried to 
                        kill the indri. But they were so 
                        determined to stay here they bit 
                        off their own legs because they 
                        knew that would make their arms 
                        stronger. They used their arms to 
                        climb the trees. When men first 
                        settled, the indri learned to 
                        scream to alert them to the 
                        crocodiles. The settlers were 
                        scared of the creatures that were 
                        trying to protect them. 

           Celia leans forward, she’s never heard her mother talk like 
           this. June’s face is dreamy and determined. 

           Daud takes June’s hand and kisses it. June tucks her hair 
           behind her ear, embarrassed. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        It’s just a story. I used to think 
                        that it was bullshit. But it 
                        doesn’t matter, does it? We needed 
                        their help, now they need ours. 

           Celia absorbs this, uncomfortable with their closeness. She 
           looks away from June and Daud and watches a scorpion crawl 
           into one of the tombs. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Celia wakes up to the sound of frantic typing. She goes into 
           her mother’s room. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           CONTINUOUS

           June is sitting on the floor next to her bed, surrounded by 
           papers and pictures of lemurs, hard at work, taking tense 
           drags from a cigarette. 
                                 CELIA
                        Did Arturo tell you that story? 

                                 JUNE
                        What story?

                                 CELIA
                        The one you just told me and Daud. 

           A beat. June looks up. 

                                 JUNE
                        Arturo doesn’t have the 
                        imagination.  

                                 CELIA
                        It sounds like him. 

                                 JUNE
                        That story was told to me by a 
                        zoologist I worked with years ago. 
                        I think your father knew him. He 
                        discovered a new species of mouse 
                        lemur. He was also a great painter. 
                        He was Dutch. 
                           (a beat)
                        What are you still doing up? 

                                 CELIA
                        What are you still doing up? 

                                 JUNE
                        I’m on a deadline. 

           Celia sits down next to June, sifting through the mess of 
           papers. 

                                 CELIA
                        For what?

                                 JUNE
                        Celia, don’t touch my stuff.

                                 CELIA
                        It’s just paper. 

                                 JUNE
                        It’s not just paper, Celia, it’s 
                        evidence that their habitat is 
                        being destroyed and they’re smart 
                        enough to try to fix it. It’s 
                        evidence that the ecosystem here 
                        will not survive without them. I’ve 
                        told you a million times. 
                                 CELIA
                        Yeah, but the evidence is in your 
                        computer. It’s saved. You could 
                        even send it to yourself, if we had 
                        internet. 

           June moves her computer over. 

                                 JUNE
                        Who do you help by swimming? 

                                 CELIA
                        What do you mean? 

                                 JUNE
                        You put on a swimsuit, get in a 
                        swimming pool, go to one end of the 
                        pool, and turn around. Who does it 
                        effect? Who does it help? 

                                 CELIA 
                        I’m swimming in the ocean. 

                                 JUNE
                        Answer the question. 

                                 CELIA
                        Why did you tell me all those 
                        stories about Lynne Cox? If you’ve 
                        got such a problem. 
                           (off June’s silence)
                        When I was little. When you made me 
                        swim in the ocean. With dad. 

                                 JUNE
                        I don’t remember that. 

                                 CELIA
                        He told you not to make me go in if 
                        I didn’t want to. And you said I 
                        had to otherwise I’d be afraid 
                        forever. How can you not remember? 

           June types, doesn’t answer. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        I almost drowned. I bet you don’t 
                        remember that either. 

                                 JUNE
                        Don’t be dramatic. 

           Celia goes to her camera, fiddles with it. 
                                 CELIA
                        I miss dad. 

           June looks up at her, startled and hurt. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        I know you think I’m lying, but 
                        it’s true. 

           A beat. June goes back to typing, her fingers murdering the 
           keys. 

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Celia walks. Daud pulls up behind her on his motorbike. 

                                 DAUD
                        The diligent student returning to 
                        her classroom. 

                                 CELIA
                        I’ve been practicing. 
                           (beat)
                        I guess you’re sick of the shade? 

                                 DAUD
                        Hop on. 

                                 CELIA
                        I like to walk. 

                                 DAUD
                        Suit yourself. 

           Daud’s motorbike sprays red dust as he drives towards the 
           ocean. 

           EXT. BEACH/INDIAN OCEAN - LATER

           Celia walks down the beach, pulling off her tank top and 
           shorts, revealing a swimsuit. 

           Note: from this point on she is almost always wearing a 
           swimsuit, usually under her clothes. 

           In the distance Daud’s already swimming. He treads water, 
           waves at her. 

                                 DAUD
                        Are you going to come out, then? 

           Celia stays where she is. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 DAUD (CONT’D)
                        I thought you didn’t need my help. 

                                 CELIA
                        Don’t be a jerk. 

           She stares out at the water. It’s so stupid that she’s 
           nervous. 

           She runs. Swims as fast as she can, past swimming children, 
           past Daud, too. 

           EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia stops, treads water, tired but elated. Daud catches up 
           to her. 

                                 DAUD
                        You’ve got good speed. 

           Celia grins at the compliment. Looks at the shore so far away 
           now. 

                                 CELIA
                        I could qualify for regionals if I 
                        go back to New York. 

                                 DAUD
                        Your mother must be proud. 

                                 CELIA
                        She says it’s not the same as open 
                        water swimming. 

                                 DAUD
                        She’s right. No rules. The water is 
                        not so predictable. 

                                 CELIA
                        That’s why I want it. 

           Daud studies her. 

                                 DAUD
                        Keep going. Swim out as far as you 
                        can. Swim east towards that island. 
                        Keep your arms straight, like this. 
                           (a beat)
                        This is the best time of day. There 
                        aren’t any currents. 
           EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia swims out. Looks back at Daud. He motions for her to 
           keep going.  

           Celia swims farther. Picks up speed. Swims until she’s 
           exhausted. Looks back. Doesn’t see Daud anymore. 

                                 CELIA 
                        Daud!

           Celia starts to swim back, to panic. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        Daud!

           Celia swims faster. Daud pops up a few feet in front of her. 
           She’s not sure whether to laugh or be furious. 

                                 DAUD
                        Mahazo Aina. It’s a game I used to 
                        play, when I was a little punk. To 
                        free your breath, you must hold 
                        your breath. 

                                 CELIA
                        What does that mean? 

                                 DAUD
                        You need to know what you’re 
                        missing to appreciate it. Most 
                        people don’t even think about 
                        breathing. They just do.  

           Celia thinks about this. 

                                 CELIA
                        I want to try. 
                           (beat)
                        I want to hold my breath like you 
                        do. I’m ready. I swear. 

           Daud swims up to her. Puts his hands on her shoulders. Pushes 
           her underwater. 

           EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - ABOVE AND UNDERWATER - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia keeps her eyes open. Looks all around her. Coral, 
           purple fish. 

           She starts to struggle. Daud holds her there. 

           Celia gasps a breath. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           Daud thrusts her back underwater. 

           Celia flails against his hands. Everything fuzzy around her. 

           Daud pulls her up again. 

           EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia catches her breath. 

                                 DAUD
                        It’s good for you to struggle 
                        against the water. You could get 
                        sucked down by a strong tide. You 
                        have to know how to fight. 

                                 CELIA
                        I know how. 

                                 DAUD
                        Yes. You do. 

           Celia floats on her back. Looks towards the shore.  

                                 CELIA
                        I wish my mother had seen that. 

           EXT. BEACH - LATER

           Celia finishes drying off. Gives her towel to Daud. 

                                 CELIA
                        The record for long distance 
                        swimming is just over two thousand 
                        miles, set by Martin Strel when he 
                        swam the Mississippi River.

           Daud nods. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll come every day. I’ll go back 
                        out, no matter what. That’s what 
                        June does. 

                                 DAUD
                        I call her Demeter. The goddess of 
                        determination. 

                                 CELIA
                        That’s Greek. 
                                 DAUD
                        You’re good. 

           Celia shields her eyes, looks towards the island in the 
           distance.

                                 CELIA
                        I’m going to swim there. To that 
                        land. And all the way back. 

           She looks to Daud for a reaction. His eyes are closed. He’s 
           smiling. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        You don’t think I can do it? 

                                 DAUD
                        I think that’s up to you. 

                                 CELIA
                        My mother doesn’t.

                                 DAUD
                        Your mother didn’t think she’d last 
                        long enough in Fort Dauphin to spot 
                        a rare new species. And she did. 

                                 CELIA
                        The golden bamboo? She knew she’d 
                        find them. She knew she’d find 
                        something. 

                                 DAUD
                        She was young. She tells me 
                        differently. 

           Daud reaches into his bag, takes out sunscreen, gives it to 
           her. 

           She puts it on, twisting her arm so she doesn’t have to ask 
           Daud to do it. 

           EXT. FOREST - LATER

           Daud pulls up on his motorbike, Celia on the back. Villagers 
           are putting out a blaze. June stands near the research cabin, 
           screaming at Theirry. Daud hurries towards her. 

                                 DAUD
                        What’s this?
                                 JUNE
                        He promised us a square mile until 
                        we could gather the necessary 
                        evidence. Two weeks go by and its a 
                        fucking matchbox. 
                           (to Theirry, in Malagasy)
                        We had an agreement!

                                 THEIRRY
                        I did not know!

                                 DAUD
                        June, it’s very possible -

                                 JUNE
                        We had an agreement. 
                           (to Theirry, in Malagasy)
                        A pact. Trust. Your people will  
                        eventually starve, do you 
                        understand me? This will kill them. 

                                 DAUD
                        June -

           June kicks the side of the jeep, and stomps towards the 
           research cabin. Daud begins to apologize to Theirry. 

           Celia follows her mother to the cabin. 

           INT. RESEARCH CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia leans on the counter, watching June tend to Brown #1. 
           Neither of them speak. June glances at Celia, shakes her 
           head, turns her attention back to the lemur. 

           Daud steps in. Stares at June for a tense beat. 

                                 DAUD
                        You don’t want to be yelling at 
                        these people. 
                           (off her silence)
                        June.

           She’s still too furious to speak. 

                                 DAUD (CONT’D)
                        He only has control to a point. You 
                        know this. 

           June looks up at Daud. 

                                 JUNE
                        I should apologize. 
                                 DAUD
                        That wouldn’t be the worst thing. 

           June turns back to Brown #1. 

                                 DAUD (CONT’D)
                        Is she all right? 

                                 JUNE
                        Oh, now you want to work? 

                                 DAUD
                        Normal people need a break, June. 

           June takes this in for a moment. Seems to accept it. Gestures 
           to Daud.  

                                 JUNE
                           (to Daud)
                        Look at her pelage. And her 
                        incisors. 

           Celia peers into cages at several tagged lemurs. 

                                 CELIA
                        Are they sick? 

                                 DAUD
                           (to Celia)
                        Let her work. 

           Celia turns to him, surprised and stung. 

                                 DAUD (CONT’D)
                           (to June)
                        32 teeth. I counted twice. 

                                 JUNE
                        No, Daud. Her abdomen, her 
                        shortness of breath. Check her 
                        weight. 

           Daud slips on gloves, examines the lemur. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Right? I mean this is...Daud. She’s 
                        pregnant.  

                                 DAUD
                        That’s what we call fatrata. 
                        Amazing. 

           June grins at Daud. Pulls Celia into a hug. 
                                 JUNE
                        Where’d you put that scotch? 

           Celia hugs her mother back. 

           EXT. TANAMBOA BAR - DUSK

           June and Daud both drink moonshine. Celia a fruit cocktail 
           with a sugar-soaked lychee. June is mid-story. 

                                 JUNE
                        - and like an idiot I cried in 
                        front of the head of the committee - 

                                 DAUD
                        In front of Dr. Sophist? 

                                 JUNE
                        The hundred year old who doesn’t 
                        have a sense of humor?

                                 DAUD
                        Hundred and fifteen, and, what do 
                        you call it, senile? 

                                 JUNE 
                        There were more of us, then, we 
                        drove two of the dehydrated black 
                        and whites into Tana - this was so 
                        traumatizing I think I forgot it 
                        happened -

                                 DAUD
                        I have a hard time believing you’d 
                        forget anything -

                                 JUNE
                        You’re a liar but cheers to that. 

           June leans into Daud and they almost kiss. Celia notices and 
           June pulls back. Celia takes a sip of June’s moonshine.

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                           (to Celia)
                        Careful with that. 

                                 CELIA
                        I’m building up an immunity. 
           EXT. TANAMBOA - MISSIONARY CAMP - LATER

           Celia wanders away from the bar. She approaches a bonfire 
           that has been set up in front of a large white tent near the 
           beach. KIDS - native Malagasy and a few white children - eat 
           fruit and Zebu meat. Melanie’s at the grill. 

           A white man, DONALD (Melanie’s husband), and their eight-year-
           old son, TIMOTHY, read Dr. Seuss to a group of Malagasy 
           children. 

                                 DONALD
                        Please sir, I don’t like this trick 
                        sir. My tongue isn’t quick or 
                        slick, sir. I get all these ticks 
                        and clocks sir, mixed up with the 
                        chicks and tocks, sir. 

                                 TIMOTHY
                        I can’t do it Mr. Fox, sir. 

                                 DONALD
                        I’m so sorry, Mr. Knox, sir. 

                                 TIMOTHY
                        Here’s an easy game to play. Here’s 
                        an easy thing to say. 

                                 DONALD
                        And the cat said, get out of my 
                        salami!

                                 TIMOTHY
                           (to Donald)
                        That’s not how it goes. 

           But the kids are laughing, more at Donald’s goofy intonation 
           than what he’s actually saying. Timothy sees Celia. 

                                 TIMOTHY (CONT’D)
                        If you want to stay here, you have 
                        to be with our mission. 

                                 CELIA
                        How do I do that? 

           Melanie swans towards Celia. 

                                 MELANIE
                        Ignore him, darling. We don’t turn 
                        anyone away. Isn’t that right, Tim? 

           Tim studies Celia for a moment. 
                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                        He’s shy. We don’t turn anyone 
                        away. 

           EXT. TANAMBOA - MISSIONARY CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

           Melanie and Celia eat from heaping plates. Nearby, Donald and 
           Tim play boisterous bible songs on guitars while the children 
           sing. 

                                 CELIA
                        I didn’t realize how hungry I was. 

                                 MELANIE
                        My first mission, I told myself I’d 
                        only eat what they ate. I had to be 
                        in it with them to actually 
                        understand them. 

                                 CELIA
                        What happened? 

                                 MELANIE
                        I’ll tell you, I was sick as a dog. 
                        Resented my mission. Resented God. 
                        Forgot why I came here in the first 
                        place. He was trying to teach me a 
                        lesson. 
                           (beat)
                        So what did I do? Started eating 
                        fruit and protein. Vitamin 
                        supplements. Naps in the afternoon. 
                        And voila. Everything was clearer.
                           (beat)
                        I have a lot of respect for the 
                        work your mother’s doing. 

                                 CELIA
                        My mother made it sound like Fort 
                        Dauphin was some sort of paradise. 
                        I thought it would look like 
                        Hawaii. 

                                 MELANIE
                        Have you ever been to Hawaii?

           Celia shakes her head. 

                                 CELIA
                        I want to swim there, though. The 
                        south shore of Oahu. 
                                 MELANIE
                        The pictures show you the nice 
                        parts.  

           Donald and Timothy launch into a louder, sillier song. 
           Melanie and Celia watch them for a moment. 

                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                        Looks like a goof, doesn’t he? My 
                        husband. 

                                 CELIA
                        A little. 

                                 MELANIE
                        We were here through a cholera 
                        epidemic before Tim was born. He 
                        insisted we stay until he treated 
                        every single person. That’s how I 
                        knew I could never leave him. 

                                 JUNE (O.S.)
                        Celia. 

           Celia turns. June stands there, quietly stewing. 

                                 MELANIE
                           (to June)
                        I don’t think we’ve properly met.

                                 JUNE
                           (to Celia)
                        Come on. 

                                 MELANIE
                        Stay. Please. Help yourself to 
                        anything you’d like. 

                                 JUNE
                        I don’t need your handouts and my 
                        daughter doesn’t either. 
                           (to Celia)
                        Come on. 

                                 MELANIE
                        It’s not a handout. There’s plenty, 
                        I promise. 

           June turns and gestures to the camp around her. 

                                 JUNE
                        How much did all of this cost? 
                           (off Melanie’s silence)
                        It’s a legitimate question. 
                                 MELANIE
                        How could we do anything without 
                        support? 

                                 JUNE
                           (to Celia)
                        Thousands of dollars. At least. 

                                 MELANIE
                        Those who seek the lord shall not 
                        lack any good thing. Psalm 34:10. 

                                 JUNE
                           (to Melanie)
                        Tell them that the lord believes in 
                        preserving the planet. Then we can 
                        properly meet. 

           June takes off, walking quickly. 

           EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           June walks focused, quiet. 

                                 CELIA
                        You told me to explore. 

                                 JUNE
                        You want to hang out with Mother 
                        Teresa, that’s your prerogative. 

                                 CELIA
                        Mother Teresa saved thousands of 
                        people from starvation. 

                                 JUNE
                        Is that an exact statistic? 

           Daud ambles towards them, carrying two bottles of beer. 

                                 DAUD
                        I thought we were celebrating. 

                                 JUNE
                        You celebrate. I’ve got work to do. 

           June walks quickly ahead. Daud catches up to her, grabs her 
           hand. 
           EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY

           Celia swims. She stops. The island still seems so far off. 
           From a few meters back, Daud urges her ahead. 

           EXT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - AFTERNOON

           Celia grips Daud’s waist as he drives his motorbike towards 
           the hotel. She’s in her swimsuit and her shoulders are a 
           painful red. Her hair is disheveled, still wet. She sees the 
           jeep in front of the hotel. 

           Behind it, June is in a vicious argument with LEN, late 50’s, 
           bespectacled and wiry. 

           Len turns to see his daughter, surprised by her appearance. 
           June turns and heads back towards the terrace, pissed. Daud 
           parks. 

           CAROL, 50s, attractive in a soft way, waits on the terrace, 
           glancing at her watch.

                                 CELIA
                           (to Daud)
                        I didn’t know he was going to bring 
                        her. 

           Carol sees Celia and holds her hand up, a half-hearted wave. 

           EXT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - TERRACE

           Len, June, Carol, and Daud sit there with coffees. The 
           tension is thick. Celia comes out with rolls. 

                                 CELIA
                        Haja had some of these in the 
                        kitchen. 

                                 CAROL
                        Thanks, honey. We’re jet lagged and 
                        starving. 

                                 JUNE
                        If you want some fried bugs the 
                        market’s only a mile away. 

                                 LEN
                           (to Carol)
                        She likes to shock people. 
                                 JUNE
                           (to Len)
                        Are you worried about us? Because I 
                        have to say, packing up and leaving 
                        on a whim is a great fucking way to 
                        show it- 

                                 LEN
                        You’ve been gone a month! A month, 
                        June -

                                 JUNE
                        - that doesn’t give you any right 
                        to bring her here -

                                 CAROL
                        -I really didn’t mean to make 
                        things difficult. 

           June turns to Carol, glares. A long beat. Daud touches her 
           arm. Len notices. June and Daud stand up.   

                                 JUNE
                        We don’t have time for this. 

           June heads back to the jeep. 

                                 DAUD
                        We have a presentation at the 
                        ministry. June is on a very tight 
                        deadline. I do apologize. 

           Daud hurries after June. Len, Carol, and Celia sit in 
           silence. The sound of the jeep starting. Len turns to Celia. 

                                 LEN
                        Your old dad doesn’t get a hello? 
                        After flying across the world? 

           A beat. Celia hugs him. 

                                 CELIA
                        I wrote you letters. There wasn’t 
                        anywhere to mail them. 

           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN - LEN’S RENTAL CAR

           Len drives. Celia’s in the back seat, quiet, not quite sure 
           how to act around Carol. Carol pages through a guidebook in 
           the passenger seat. 
                                 LEN
                        I saw your friend Beth last week. 
                        With some of the other girls at 
                        that bar near the Moosewood. 

           Celia hesitates, then decides to talk to him. 

                                 CELIA
                        The one Jason Weiss’s dad owns? 

                                 LEN
                        You ever go there? 

                                 CELIA
                        I’m fourteen. 

                                 LEN
                        Ah hah, you see, I was testing you. 

                                 CELIA
                        I mean, I guess, Beth and Jason go 
                        there. Beth’s a junior though. 

           Carol swivels to look at Celia, in the back seat. 

                                 CAROL
                        I’ve always wanted to come here. 
                        The only other place I’ve been is 
                        Europe. 

                                 CELIA
                        Ninety nine percent of the people 
                        who live here have never been 
                        anywhere else. 

           Carol reaches for Celia’s hand, squeezes it. 

                                 CAROL
                        Your father and I had so much fun 
                        planning this trip. I’ve been 
                        looking forward to meeting you. 

                                 CELIA
                        Couldn’t you have done that in 
                        America? 

           Len and Carol look at one another, then back at Celia’s 
           guarded reflection in the rear view mirror. 

           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN - TANAMBOA MARKET - LATER

           Carol tries on a colorful Batik Tunik. Models it for Celia 
           and Len. 
                                 CAROL
                        This is stunning, Len. You can’t 
                        find clothing like this upstate. 
                        The colors. 
                           (a beat)
                        Come here, Celia, hon. 

           Celia comes over. Examines the dress. 

                                 CAROL (CONT’D)
                        These are pleasantly shapeless for 
                        middle-aged ladies like me. 

                                 LEN
                           (to Carol)
                        Shut up, you’re gorgeous. 

                                 CAROL
                        Oh, please. 
                           (to Celia)
                        Now you...something like this, 
                        maybe?
                           (changing her mind)
                        No, the color is too harsh. 
                        Something like this, I think. 

           Carol holds up a handmade sundress, bold blues and greens. 

                                 CAROL (CONT’D)
                        I want to see how this looks on 
                        you. 

           Carol pulls the dress over Celia’s head. It’s a little big on 
           her but the potential is obvious. 

                                 CAROL (CONT’D)
                        I think we’ve found a winner. 

                                 LEN
                           (to Celia)
                        Have you lost weight? 

                                 CAROL
                        No one asked you, Leonard.

                                 LEN
                        Two dresses for my favorite ladies? 

           Celia bristles at ‘favorite ladies.’ 

                                 CELIA
                        I really don’t need it. 
                                 CAROL
                        This is on me. 

           Carol gives the vendor a lot more money than one would need 
           to. 

           EXT. BEACH - LATER

           Celia leads Carol and Len down to the beach. 

                                 CAROL
                        Isn’t this a far cry from the Long 
                        Island Sound. 

                                 CELIA
                        Daud’s been teaching me how to swim 
                        with the current. 

           Celia strips off her clothes and hands them to her father. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        It’s totally safe. 

                                 LEN
                        Oh, because Daud says so? 

                                 CELIA
                        You didn’t have a problem when mom 
                        pushed me in the ocean. 
                           (beat)
                        When we went to Montauk. Me and mom 
                        made an apricot cake. It tasted 
                        terrible. 

           Len almost smiles. 

                                 LEN
                        It did taste terrible. 

                                 CELIA
                        She wanted me to swim in the ocean. 

                                 LEN
                        The way I remember it, Celia, she 
                        didn’t push you. You wanted to go. 

           Celia looks up at her father’s sunburnt face, trying to 
           decipher if he’s telling the truth. 
           EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia swims. Stops. Looks back at the distant shore. Len 
           walks closer to the water. 

           Celia paddles for a moment. Swims out farther. 

           EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia walks up on the beach. Len meets her there. He’s 
           visibly shaken. He gives her an enormous hug. This time, she 
           lets him. 

                                 CELIA
                        Dad, I’m fine. 
                           (beat, he doesn’t let her 
                           go)
                        Dad, I’m really OK. 

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Carol has set out lunch purchased at the market. She shows 
           Celia pictures of her horse ranch in Missoula. 

                                 CAROL
                        That giant guy is Bunny, don’t ask 
                        me why, Sammy named him. Rabbits 
                        scare the crap out of me. 

           She takes out other pictures. 

                                 CAROL (CONT’D)
                        But these - real beauties. I call 
                        this one Ben Hur. Ever seen that 
                        movie? 
                           (Celia shakes her head)
                        I’ve had him since Lana was your 
                        age. 

                                 CELIA
                        How many kids do you have? 

                                 CAROL
                        Three and a half. 

                                 LEN
                        What she means is, I’m the half. 

                                 CAROL
                        Yeah, when you act like a teenager. 

           She takes out another picture. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 CAROL (CONT’D)
                        An art show I did in Billings. A 
                        little dinky, but you have to start 
                        somewhere, don’t you? 

           Celia looks. Carol’s paintings are vibrant water colors, she 
           has talent. 

                                 CELIA
                        Are you guys getting married? 

           Carol and Len look at each other. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        I mean, it’s been a year. 

                                 CAROL
                        We’re thinking about it. 

                                 CELIA
                        Thinking about it or planning it? 

           Len shifts uncomfortably. 

                                 LEN
                        Swimming out that far, Celia, I 
                        don’t like it.  

                                 CELIA
                        I’m almost as old as Lynne Cox was 
                        when she swam the English Channel. 

                                 LEN
                        Lynne Cox wasn’t my daughter. 

                                 CELIA
                        I know what I’m doing. 

           She points to the island. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        See that? That’s where I’m going to 
                        swim to. It’s not the Mozambique 
                        channel but it’s a start. 

           Carol pats Celia’s shoulder. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to believe me but 
                        it’s what I’m going to do. 

                                 LEN
                           (beat, quietly)
                        Are we gonna eat, or what? 
                                 CAROL
                        All right, kill joy. The food is 
                        out. 

           Carol starts dividing food onto plates. 

                                 CAROL (CONT’D)
                        Listen, honey. We booked a hotel a 
                        couple hours down the coast, what’s 
                        it called, Len? Menabe?

                                 LEN
                        The Menabe region. 

                                 CAROL
                        We’d love you to stay with us while 
                        we’re here. 

           Celia looks to her father, who is silent. 

                                 CELIA
                        Have you asked my mother? 

           EXT./INT. RESEARCH CABIN - FOREST - DAY      

           Celia looks through the window. June inspects the lemurs in 
           their cages. Len paces. They are mid-fight.  

                                 JUNE
                        You’re not taking her - 

                                 LEN
                        - it’s four days -

                                 JUNE
                        - I’m on a deadline, as hard as 
                        that concept might be to wrap your 
                        head around -

                                 LEN
                        - She’s your daughter, not your 
                        assistant - 

                                 JUNE
                         - is that how she sees it? Have 
                        you asked her? 

                                 LEN
                        Your sabbatical is up. 

                                 JUNE
                        That’s none of your business. I’m 
                        not your fucking student anymore. 
           Len moves closer to June, puts his hand on her shoulder. She 
           looks up at him. 

                                 LEN
                        You need to think about coming 
                        back, June. 

                                 JUNE
                           (quietly)
                        Can’t right now. 

                                 LEN
                        You are going to lose your job. 

                                 JUNE
                        I am very close to something. The 
                        beginning of forest regrowth. The 
                        legacy of an animal that’s this 
                        close to dying out. If I leave, 
                        everything I’ve done, not just 
                        these past months, but my entire 
                        life, it means nothing.

           June tends to the lemurs. Len watches her. 

                                 LEN
                        I’m moving. 

                                 JUNE
                        Finally decided you were sick of a 
                        Murphy bed in a studio apartment? 

                                 LEN
                        That’s not what I meant. 
                           (a beat)
                        Look at me. June. 

           June turns to look at him. 

                                 JUNE
                        You came all the way here to tell 
                        me you were moving in with her. 
                           (beat)
                        Where?

                                 LEN
                        Missoula. 

           June starts to laugh. 

                                 JUNE
                        Missoula. Missoula. That’s where 
                        you met her, isn’t it? One of your 
                        cushy conferences. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 LEN
                        The university offered me a good 
                        job, June. 

                                 JUNE
                        In Missoula. Jesus. 

           Celia takes this in. Watches as her mother turns back to her 
           work, focused intently on the lemur. A beat.

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Have you seen Daud work? I’ve 
                        finally found someone who can keep 
                        up with me, and he’s just as smart 
                        as you are. So why the hell would I 
                        come back? 

           Celia steps away from the research center. A lemur with 
           stunning white fur stares down at her. 

           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN - NIGHT

           Len’s rental car, top down, drives down the road. A group of 
           teens blast by on motorbikes. Carol clutches Len’s arm. 

           Celia sits with June’s worn backpack on her lap. Watches the 
           ocean get farther and farther away. 

           EXT. MENABE REGION - NIGHT

           They drive past enormous - and sparse - baobob trees. 

           EXT. HOTEL - ESTABLISHING

           A lavish hotel. 

           INT. HOTEL - LOBBY

           The complete opposite of Fort Dauphin. A full staff, a plush 
           carpet. Len pays with a credit card. 

           Celia looks around. A couple months ago she probably would 
           have been impressed. Now she’s a little overwhelmed. 

           INT. HOTEL - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Celia takes her first hot shower in a long time. She gets out 
           quickly - not used to it. 
           She flushes the shiny white toilet. 

           INT. HOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT

           Celia lies awake in a big white bed. Carol and Len sleep on a 
           pull out couch.

           Celia finds her father’s laptop. Quietly carries it into the 
           hallway. 

           INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY

           Celia sits on the floor, connecting to Skype. 

           BETH’s fuzzy image shows up on the screen. She is a little 
           older than Celia, 15, athletic, a streak of purple in her 
           hair. We recognize her from Celia’s pictures. 

           Celia waves like crazy. 

           Beth jumps up and down, clapping her hands, waving. The 
           picture goes in and out. 

           INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY

           Celia and Beth on Skype. 

                                 BETH
                        - and the fastest girl from

                        I guess that’s cool. Does your mom 
                        still dry paper towels on the dish 
                        rack?

                        There are definite ways to kill 
                        yourself. Crocodiles, scorpions.

                        that your mom wasn’t going back to 
                        Cornell.

                        Cornell sent her here, you idiot. 
                        She’s gathering research. It could 
                        be ground breaking. It could prove 
                        the hapelemur can make the forest 
                        grow back.

                        it’s head is gold. 

           Pause. Neither quite sure what to say to each other.

                                 BETH
                        Ugh, he’s being such an asshole - 

           EXT. AVENUE OF THE BAOBABS - DAY

           One of Madagascar’s tourist attractions - a huge, clear 
           field. An avenue of towering 800 year old trees. 

           Carol snaps pictures, walking ahead of Len and Celia. 

                                 LEN
                        Pretty neat.

                                 CELIA
                        If you like natural disasters. 
                           (beat)
                        That’s what this is. You know how 
                        many acres were destroyed so 
                        ignorant people could come and 
                        gawk? 

                                 LEN
                        You sound like her. 

                                 CELIA
                        Good. 

                                 LEN
                        Celia.

                                 CELIA
                        Why did you come all the way here 
                        if you were just going to tell me 
                        you were moving? 

           A beat. 

                                 LEN
                        I was waiting for the right time to 
                        tell you. 

                                 CAROL
                        Come on, slow pokes! We don’t have 
                        all day. 

                                 LEN
                           (re Carol)
                        She has a lot of energy. 
                           (off Celia’s silence)
                        To answer your question. I wanted 
                        to see your mother. And I wanted to 
                        see you. I’m not going to be right 
                        in town anymore. 
                                 CELIA
                        But why? 

                                 LEN
                        I just needed a change. 

                                 CELIA
                        Because of us. 

           Len shakes his head. They walk in silence. Carol is really 
           far ahead of them now. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        Did mom show you her research? 

                                 LEN
                        I looked at it. 

                                 CELIA
                        What did you think? 

                                 LEN
                        I have a feeling this is a trick 
                        question. 
                           (off Celia’s look)
                        I think she needs to be realistic. 

                                 CELIA
                        She said when you were younger you 
                        stayed in Fort Dauphin for three 
                        months, that’s how she got the 
                        footage of the goldens. She said 
                        sometimes she slept and sometimes 
                        you did. She said you didn’t ask 
                        the university permission, you just 
                        did it. 

                                 LEN
                        That was a long time ago. 

           Celia waits. Len stalls.

                                 LEN (CONT’D)
                        What your mother wants, what your 
                        mother has always wanted, is to 
                        alter something bigger than she is. 

                                 CAROL (O.S.)
                        Slow pokes!

                                 CELIA
                           (to Len)
                        What’s wrong with that? 
           They look at each other for a moment. A stand off. Celia 
           shakes her head, walks to join Carol who is taking pictures 
           of everything. Carol waves to a WORKER.

                                 CAROL 
                           (to worker)
                        Can you take our picture? 

           Carol poses Celia next to her. The worker snaps their 
           picture.

           INT. HOTEL POOL/GYM - DAY

           Celia swims in the florescent hotel pool. Rote strokes. It 
           isn’t fun or challenging anymore. 

           INT. HOTEL GYM - CONTINUOUS

           Celia passes through the small hotel gym where Carol speed 
           walks on a treadmill and Len pedals leisurely on a stationary 
           bike. 

           The other TV plays an infomercial: Melanie talking to the 
           camera, surrounded by children. 

                                 MELANIE (ON TV)
                        You can help these boys and girls 
                        get food and books and a roof over 
                        their heads. No donation is too 
                        large or small. 

           Carol sees Celia and slows down. Gets off the treadmill. 
           Gulps water from the fountain next to Celia. 

                                 CAROL
                        I’ve probably gotten him hooked on 
                        that. Or my kids have. You wouldn’t 
                        believe the junk they watch. 

           Someone scores a goal. Len gives a little cheer. Celia looks 
           at him, annoyed. 

                                 CAROL (CONT’D)
                        Hon, have you - have you thought 
                        about moving in with us? 

                                 CELIA
                        You mean leaving Ithaca?

                                 CAROL
                        We have an awful lot of space. 
                                 CELIA
                        He can ask me himself. If that’s 
                        what he wants me to do. 
                           (beat)
                        Sorry. 

           They stand in silence for a moment. Both know Len isn’t going 
           to ask Celia to come back with them. Celia watches her father 
           pedal. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        When he left he didn’t even say 
                        goodbye. Did he tell you that? He 
                        just packed up one night and drove 
                        away and didn’t even leave a note. 
                        Didn’t say anything for an entire 
                        week. 

           Carol listens, uncomfortable. 

           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN - DAY

           Len’s car drives along the coast. 

           INT. LEN’S CAR - SAME

           Celia’s in the backseat, staring at Carol and Len’s clasped 
           hands. 

           EXT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - DAY

           Carol hands Celia her suitcase. Hugs her. 

                                 CAROL
                        Take care of yourself, you hear me? 

           Celia nods. Carol releases her. 

                                 CELIA
                        Bye, dad. 

           Len looks at Celia for a beat. Pats her cheek. Gives her an 
           envelope. 

                                 LEN
                        Here. 

           Celia opens the envelope. Travelers checks. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 LEN (CONT’D)
                        You can put in for up to five 
                        thousand dollars. 

                                 CELIA
                        Is this for me or for her? 

                                 LEN
                        What kind of a question is that?

           Celia folds up the envelope. A beat. 

                                 CELIA
                        If you see Beth or Jason, tell them 
                        I say hi. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           LATER

           Celia opens the top drawer, puts the check under her clothes. 
           Next to a pile of letters to her father.  

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN- CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           TERRACE - CONTINUOUS

           Celia pads out to the balcony. Her father’s car is already 
           gone. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN- CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           MOMENTS LATER

           Celia plops down on her bed. Lost and a little restless. Sees 
           a picture on the edge of her bed - a stunning golden bamboo 
           lemur. She turns it over. 

           There’s a note in June’s tight handwriting. Daud and I left 
           for the field early. Need to cover more ground. May be gone 
           another night. 

           Celia looks at the note for a moment. Turns it over, as 
           though the front might say something else, but there’s just 
           the picture of the lemur. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           NIGHT

           Celia gets ready for bed. The indri scream. Otherwise she is 
           alone. 
           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           MORNING

           Celia wakes up alone. The sun too hot and cheerful through 
           her window. 

           EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY

           Celia swims, hard. Stops, catches her breath. She’s getting 
           closer to the island.

           EXT. MISSIONARY CAMP - AFTERNOON

           Celia approaches the missionary camp, sees Melanie’s 
           ramshackle white house behind the large open tent. It looks 
           more run down in the daylight.  

           INT. MISSIONARY SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Celia approaches the tent.  A dozen young men and women and 
           five or six children lean over hand-built desks. Melanie 
           paces energetically, in the midst of a lesson. She spots 
           Celia and smiles broadly at her. 

                                 MELANIE
                           (in Malagasy, to her 
                           students)
                        It looks like we have a visitor. 

           The students turn to look at her. One of the Malagasy BOYS 
           June chased out of the forest ducks under his desk.

                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                        Come on up. I insist. 
                           (beat)
                        When we have a new member of our 
                        community, they tell us their name, 
                        their age, their greatest hope, 
                        their smallest fear. Not 
                        necessarily in that order. 

           Celia walks to the front of the classroom. 

                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                           (in Malagasy)
                        Tahiry, please demonstrate.  

           After a beat of hesitation, Tahiry stands up. He is scrawnier 
           than Celia remembers, wearing a tiny blue t-shirt that barely 
           fits him. 
                                 BOY (TAHIRY)
                           (in English)
                        My name is Tahiry. I am eight years 
                        old. I love chocolate, spiders, and 
                        I am going to learn to play the 
                        guitar. I am scared of crocodiles 
                        and I want one day to own a store 
                        that sells only blue things. 

                                 MELANIE
                           (in Malagasy)
                        And I promise to be your first 
                        customer.  
                           (to Celia)
                        Go ahead.

                                 CELIA
                        I’m Celia. Engle. I’m fourteen. I’m 
                        from Upstate New York. America. I’m 
                        training to swim the Mozambique 
                        Channel. I’m scared of crocodiles, 
                        also. 

           Melanie turns to the chalkboard. Draws the Mozambique 
           channel. 

                                 MELANIE
                           (in Malagasy)
                        See that, everyone. Celia is going 
                        to swim from there, to there. 

           The kids look at her, impressed. 

           EXT. MISSIONARY SITE - LATER

           Students lean over books, doing simple arithmetic problems as 
           Melanie shows Celia around. Timothy skips from student to 
           student, stopping to help them. 

                                 MELANIE
                        He’s very protective of them, my 
                        kid is. 
                           (beat)
                        We’ve found that if they learn the 
                        basics early on, they have an 
                        easier time keeping track of their 
                        businesses, their day to day. 
                        Before we came here they 
                        approximated everything. And of 
                        course they all want to learn 
                        English. 

           Celia gestures quietly to a small GIRL, absolutely bald. 
                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                        Lice. Common. Takes down a whole 
                        village in a day if we don’t get 
                        there first. 

           Melanie points out a sweet-faced boy bent over a notebook.

                        See that gorgeous boy? Lost most of 
                        his family to cholera. We’re trying 
                        to fund a filtration system, but 
                        that won’t be done before the fire 
                        season.

           A few teens on motorbikes blast by, spraying Celia and 
           Melanie with red dirt. 

                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                           (in Malagasy)
                        I’ll have your heads, you hear me?

           She’s joking. Melanie starts to laugh. Celia does too. 
           Another bike speeds by. Then another. Melanie looks after 
           them, a shadow of concern.

                                 CELIA
                        What is it? 

           EXT. THEIRRY’S HUT - LATER

           A crowd of Malagasy villagers wait outside of Theirry’s hut. 
           Donald is ushered in. Melanie follows. Gestures for Celia and 
           Tim to keep their distance. 

           INT. THEIRRY’S HUT - LATER

           Donald tends to the OLD WOMAN we saw earlier. Theirry’s 
           mother. She’s extremely sick. Theirry sits nearby with his 
           two wives. 

           Melanie kneels in front of the woman and offers a prayer. 

           Celia and Tim watch from the doorway. Tim reaches out and 
           takes Celia’s hand. She looks at him, surprised.

                                 CELIA
                           (a whisper)
                        What’s she saying? 
                                 TIMOTHY
                        She’s saying that there are 
                        wonderful things waiting for her 
                        and she shouldn’t be scared.

           Theirry stands up, shakes Melanie’s hand. Melanie speaks 
           quietly to him. Squeezes his shoulder. Sways back towards 
           Celia and Tim. A beat. 

                                 MELANIE
                           (to Celia)
                        It would mean a lot to him if your 
                        mother was here. 

           Celia watches Theirry kneel in from of his mother. He’s 
           clearly devastated.  

           EXT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - NIGHT

           Celia approaches the hotel. Daud and June’s jeep is parked 
           outside. 

           In the distance, five clusters of flames burn in the distant 
           hills. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - STAIRWELL/CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING 
           ROOMS

           Celia climbs the stairs. June’s waiting for her on the 
           landing. 

                                 JUNE
                        Where were you? 

                                 CELIA
                        Where were you?

                                 JUNE
                        I told you we’d be gone a while - 

           Celia walks past her, into their adjoining rooms. Daud 
           stands, shirtless, in the middle of June’s room. His eyes 
           meet Celia’s and she turns away, embarrassed. She closes the 
           door between their rooms. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           June sits on the edge of Celia’s bed. Celia faces the 
           opposite direction. 
                                 JUNE
                        Did you have a good time with your 
                        father? 
                           (beat)
                        I’ll take that as a no. 
                           (beat)
                        The good news, Brown One had her 
                        babies. I wish you’d come back a 
                        little earlier. 

                                 CELIA
                        I’ve been here two days. 

                                 JUNE
                        We weren’t off having a party. The 
                        work I’m doing takes patience. It’s 
                        like swimming long distance. 
                        Patience, devotion, complete 
                        absence of fear. 

                                 CELIA
                        Theirry’s mom is really sick. 

                                 JUNE
                        I’m sorry to hear that. 

           Celia rolls over, looks at her mother. Wants to ask for a 
           better response, more sympathy. A beat. 

                                 CELIA
                        Have you even seen a golden? 

           Off June’s silence. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t think so. 

           EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - ANOTHER DAY - SERIES OF SHOTS

           Celia practices. Goes out farther and farther, more 
           determination in her stroke. 

           EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - LATER

           Celia swims back towards shore. She sees Daud walking down 
           the beach. He holds up a hand, as though calling a truce. She 
           ignores him and keeps on swimming.  

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           Celia walks towards the research cabin. 
           INT. RESEARCH CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia nudges the door open. June tends to the once-pregnant 
           aye-aye lemur and two squirming babies. She seems peaceful, 
           focused. Also paler than usual. She sees Celia. 

                                 CELIA
                        Where’s Daud?

                                 JUNE
                        Our spotting scope cracked. He went 
                        into town to get it repaired. 
                           (a beat)
                        Gorgeous, aren’t they? 

           Celia shrugs. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to hold them? 

           Celia hesitates. Steps closer. Her mother hands her the two 
           babies. 

                                 CELIA
                        They sort of look like very skinny 
                        mice. 

                                 JUNE
                        They come out with hair all over 
                        them. You were practically bald. 

           June gives Celia a small syringe. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Let her latch onto it. There you 
                        go. Still a natural. 

           Celia warms to her mother again. Feeds the baby. 

                                 CELIA
                        Dad doesn’t want me, I don’t think. 
                        Not to live with him. 

                                 JUNE
                        Is that such a bad thing? I need 
                        you here, remember? 

           Celia grips the lemur babies. Doesn’t realize it. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t hold them so tight. They like 
                        human contact, but it takes them a 
                        while to get used to it. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           Celia looks down at the lemurs, who looks back up at her - 
           giant ears and tiny yellow eyes. 

           EXT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - TERRACE - NIGHT

           Celia and June eat dinner. June isn’t eating. She clutches 
           her stomach, pushes her plate away. Sees a slow spread of 
           flames on the distant hills. 

                                 JUNE
                        Dammit. 

                                 CELIA
                        Are you OK?

                                 JUNE
                        Don’t look at me that way, Celia, 
                        I’m a little under the weather, 
                        it’s not the end of the world.

           Daud’s jeep drives up. June notices. June gets up and walks-
           with effort - away from him and into the hotel. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - JUNE AND CELIA’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           NIGHT

           Celia tries to sleep as June and Daud argue in the next room. 
           The the indri scream. Celia jams earplugs in her ears. 

                                 JUNE (O.S.)
                        ...so you’ll what, drive back to 
                        your little lab? Count teeth for 
                        the next fifteen years - 

                                 DAUD (O.S.)
                        All I ask, June, is that we do not 
                        say we’ve found things that we 
                        haven’t -

           Celia pulls her pillow around her ears. It doesn’t help. 

                                 JUNE (O.S.)
                        - how many instances of possible 
                        growth have we documented? We are 
                        making a leap, Daud. If you were 
                        committed to this theory you’d 
                        understand that!

           A door slams. Celia sits up, tosses the pillow aside. 
           EXT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN- BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

           Celia bursts onto the balcony, screams into the darkness: 

                                 CELIA
                        Would you just shut up?   

           The hills now pop with flames. At least ten trees on fire. 

           EXT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - MORNING

           The fires are out. The hills behind the hotel have been 
           cleared for farming. 

           Daud, June, and Celia load the jeep for a long trip. No one 
           speaks. June is noticeably weaker. 

           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN HILLS 

           Daud drives past the newly charred, bare area where villagers  
           now harvest crops. Celia and June watch. 

           EXT. ANTANANARIVO - DAY - ESTABLISHING

           The capitol of Madagascar - big stone churches, mowed green 
           lawns, heavy traffic, motorbikes. We were here before but 
           didn’t see the breadth of it.  

           INT. JEEP - SAME

           Daud drives through traffic. June is noticeably under the 
           weather. Tension in the car. Celia’s in the back seat. 

                                 CELIA
                        You need to turn right - that road 
                        there. 

           Daud glances at Celia, grateful. He pulls to a stop not far 
           from The Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific 
           Research. 

           INT. MINISTRY OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH - 
           DAY

           They wait in a narrow hallway outside the conference room. 
           June breathes a few panicked, shallow breaths. Stumbles 
           slightly, holds onto Celia’s arm. 
                                 DAUD
                           (to June)
                        Are you all right? 

           Daud holds his hand out to June, who doesn’t take it. 

                                 JUNE
                        I’m fine. 

           INT. MINISTRY OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH - 
           HALLWAY

           Celia waits in the hallway, ear pressed against an office 
           door. 

                                 JUNE (O.S.)
                        - the support of this institution 
                        was instrumental in protecting a 
                        north east segment of the forest 
                        from loggers. Fort Dauphin was 
                        deemed unnecessary for additional 
                        protection. 

           INT. OFFICE - SAME

           June and Daud make their case to an OFFICIAL - 50s, tired, 
           slightly bored. We recognize him from June’s presentation. 

                                 JUNE
                        But when, and it won’t be long now, 
                        when you see what these animals are 
                        planting -  I don’t have another 
                        word for it. You’ll be amazed. 

                                 OFFICIAL

                        our resources for our people. 

                                 DAUD
                        June, why don’t you sit down... 

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Celia’s still listening, trying to make sense of this.  

                                 JUNE
                        Look. As promised - 
                                 DAUD
                        - we are working to prove the 
                        goldens bury these seeds. 

                                 JUNE
                        Daud’s being modest. He already has 
                        evidence. Show them, Daud. 

           INT. MINISTRY OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH - 
           LATER

           Celia’s still waiting. It’s late. 

           Daud comes out, looking distressed. Celia looks up at him. 

           June pelts past them, shaking her head, hurrying down the 
           hall. 

                                 DAUD
                        June. You can’t put me on the spot 
                        like that. I’m not going to lie. 
                        June!

           They watch June go into the bathroom. 

           INT. MINISTRY OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH - 
           HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia knocks on the bathroom door. 

                                 JUNE (O.S.)
                        Can you wait a fucking minute, 
                        Daud? 

                                 CELIA 
                        It’s me. 

                                 JUNE (O.S.)
                        Celia. Good. Come in here. 

           Celia pushes open the door. 

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Celia opens the bathroom door, sees her mother pale, hunched 
           over the toilet. She’s been throwing up. 

                                 CELIA
                        Are you OK? 
                                 JUNE
                        Don’t let him see me like this. 

                                 CELIA
                        June -

                                 JUNE
                        I’m fine. Just get me some water, 
                        will you, sweetheart? I’ll drink it 
                        from the sink. 

           Celia does as she is told. June drinks from Celia’s cupped 
           hands. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. 

           EXT. MINISTRY OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH - 
           LATER

           Daud, Celia, and June - clutching Celia’s shoulders - make 
           their way down the stairs. The city of Antananarivo sprawled 
           in front of them. Pink stone houses, a street vendor with a 
           gekko on his shoulder...and so many people. 

           June stumbles, nearly falls. Daud grabs her. 

                                 DAUD
                        We need to get you to a hospital. 

                                 JUNE
                        Over my dead body. 

           June pushes Daud away. 

                                 CELIA
                        He just wants you to get better. 

                                 JUNE
                        You weren’t in there. He was trying 
                        to diminish our evidence. 

           June clutches her stomach, doubles over again. 

                                 CELIA
                        Would you just let a doctor see 
                        you? 

           Off June’s exhausted face we cut to -
           INT. ANTANANARIVO HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - LATER

           A bustling, overcrowded emergency room. Beeping machines and 
           metal. Daud and Celia sit with a DOCTOR in a curtained-off 
           area next to a small bathroom. June can be heard throwing up. 

                                 DAUD
                           (to Doctor)
                        She’s been filling her canteen with 
                        river water. I told her it wasn’t a 
                        good idea.  

                                 CELIA
                           (to June)
                        Why would you do that? 

           June opens the bathroom door. She’s a complete mess. A long 
           hospital shirt down to her knees, her face colorless and 
           sweaty. 

                                 JUNE
                        I’ve been traveling for years and 
                        I’ve never been sick. I’m supposed 
                        to be immune. 

           She turns her back, starts throwing up again. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Cholera. 

                                 DAUD
                        She’s been showing signs of it for 
                        days. Leg cramping, drowsiness. 
                           (to June, not meanly)
                        You should have listened to me. 

           A NURSE helps June sit back down. The doctor gives June a 
           shot. She doesn’t flinch. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - JUNE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           June lies in bed now, sweating, hallucinating. Celia tries to 
           get her to drink water. 

                                 JUNE
                        We’re being forced out, Celia, 
                        they’ll send us back upstate, 
                        they’ll all die, everything in the 
                        entire forest, just crocodiles will 
                        live here, and they’ll starve, and 
                        they’ll die too... 
                                 CELIA
                        Shh... 

           The doctor gives June another shot. She flinches this time. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - JUNE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           June sleeps. Celia curls up next to her. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - JUNE’S ROOM - DUSK

           Celia wakes to see Daud sitting nearby. He’s crying. 

           He sees her watching, tries to cover, gets up and leaves the 
           room. After a moment Celia follows. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Celia walks into the hallway. Daud sits on a rickety bench. 
           Celia joins him. 

                                 CELIA
                        When I was a kid, when I was sick, 
                        she let me stay in bed for exactly 
                        one day. Then she’d make me oatmeal 
                        and tell me to get over it. All I 
                        wanted was to go with her. 
                           (pause)
                        You can die of cholera. Can’t you? 

                                 DAUD
                        Without treatment, yes, you can. 
                           (a beat)
                        We need to convince her to go home. 
                        The people in the village want it. 
                        They don’t believe her theory, they 
                        tell me.  

                                 CELIA
                        Do you believe it? 

                                 DAUD
                        We don’t have any evidence that 
                        proves the lemurs impact rainforest 
                        regrowth. Right now, from what I’ve 
                        observed, the deforested areas 
                        don’t do better or worse without 
                        them. 
                                 CELIA
                        In the north there’s evidence. I’ve 
                        seen it. 

           Daud takes this in. It’s unclear whether he believes her. 

           INT. ANTANANARIVO HOSPITAL - JUNE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Celia curls up next to her mother. Wipes down her forehead. 
           Forces her to drink water. 

           June is shivering violently. She pulls Celia close. 

                                 JUNE
                        This is why I need you here. 

           It hurts to hear her mother say this, but Celia allows 
           herself to be held. 

           INT. ANTANANARIVO HOSPITAL - JUNE’S ROOM - DAY

           Daud’s at the edge of June’s bed, leaning over her, stroking 
           her hair. 

           Celia wakes next to her mother. June smiles weakly at Celia. 
           She touches Celia’s cheek, then pushes herself up to sit.  

                                 JUNE
                        How about a drink? 

           Daud and Celia just look at her. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Scotch would be excellent. 

           Daud starts to laugh. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        How long have I been sleeping for? 

                                 DAUD
                        Probably longer than the last ten 
                        years combined. 

                                 CELIA
                        He means three days. 

                                 JUNE
                        Let’s get out of here then, shall 
                        we? 
           She taps the IV plugged into her arm. Celia looks at Daud, 
           nervous. 

                                 DAUD
                        Celia, do you mind if we speak 
                        alone for a moment? 

           Celia looks between them. Frustrated again. June reaches out, 
           squeezes her hand. 

                                 JUNE
                        We’ll be out of here soon, I 
                        promise. 

                                 CELIA
                        I don’t want to go till you’re 
                        better, though. 

           EXT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

           Celia walks towards June’s room with a tray - ice cream and 
           bread. She stops outside of June’s room. She can see June and 
           Daud through the room’s shuttered windows. Daud’s arm is 
           around June and they are speaking quietly, intimately.  

           EXT. ROAD - MADAGASCAR 

           Daud drives. June in the front seat, typing on a laptop. 
           Celia in the back. 

           EXT. TANAMBOA MARKET - NIGHT

           A FUNERAL in progress. 

           The mood is somber. Theirry’s mother’s body is covered with a 
           shroud. Theirry presides over everything, flanked by Donald 
           and Melanie. 

           Daud parks. They get out of the car. Walk towards the 
           ceremony. A few villagers look at June with zero warmth. 

           Theirry sees June. Their eyes meet - the look of a man who 
           has been deeply hurt. A look that tells June she can’t go to 
           him for help again. 

           The drumming gets louder.  

           On June, processing Theirry’s anger. On Daud, processing the 
           blatant distrust from the villagers. On Celia, struck by the 
           ceremony’s beauty, and by fear. 
           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - NIGHT

           Daud helps June up the steps. She seems to be on the mend.  

           Haja approaches Celia, carrying an envelope. 

                                 HAJA
                        This came, for her. 

           Celia looks at it. It’s from the Ministry of Scientific 
           Research. 

           She looks up at the landing: Daud entering his own room. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           MOMENTS LATER

           Celia, carrying their bag, steps into the room. June starts 
           to unpack. After a moment, Celia holds out the letter. 

                                 CELIA
                        It’s from the ministry. 

           June takes the letter. 

                                 JUNE
                        Already. Jesus.

           June opens the letter and reads. 

                                 CELIA
                        What does it say?

                                 JUNE
                        Give me a minute, will you?
                           (beat)
                        I need to think. 

           June sits down. Lights a cigarette. Her hands shake.  

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        There was no point in going down 
                        there. What a fucking waste. 

           Celia sits next to her mother. Takes the letter. 

                                 CELIA
                           (reading the letter)
                        Dear Dr. Engle, we’re sorry to 
                        inform you that your request for 
                        additional conserved land has been 
                        denied - 
                                 JUNE
                        I know what it says, Celia. It 
                        doesn’t change anything. We’ll find 
                        more evidence. Eventually they 
                        won’t be able to say no.  

           June takes the letter back. Rips it up. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        I need you to keep this between us. 

           Celia thinks about this, torn. 

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           Celia follows Daud and June through the forest. They’ve 
           walked far and she’s tired. 

                                 JUNE
                           (to Celia)
                        The ground we’ve been covering is a 
                        mile deeper. I first found goldens 
                        near the water so we have a good 
                        shot in this location. 

                                 DAUD
                        I’ve never seen anyone with so much 
                        focus. Your mother, she doesn’t 
                        even blink. 

           Celia looks at Daud with some guilt. 

                                 JUNE
                           (to Celia)
                        What we’ve been doing is observing 
                        ten meters apart. We’ve got the 
                        longest range of vision that way. 

           Celia nods. 

           EXT. FOREST - SERIES OF SHOTS

           June, Celia, and Daud are positioned apart from one another 
           in the forest. 

           Celia sees a crested ibis, three aye-aye lemurs. Celia climbs 
           a tree and watches from there. A gecko peers out at her. 

           The three of them eat a quick meal of beef jerky. June’s eyes 
           don’t leave the trees. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           EXT. FOREST - PRE-DUSK

           Celia waits and waits for a golden bamboo. A tiny mouse lemur  *
           peers out at her. Daud approaches, June on his heels. 

                                 DAUD
                        How’s the view up there? 

                                 CELIA
                        Still nothing. 

                                 JUNE
                        I knew we should have gone another 
                        mile west.

                                 DAUD
                        Well, we have our marching orders 
                        for tomorrow. 
                           (holding out his hand to 
                           Celia)
                        Don’t we? 

                                 JUNE
                        Nice try. 

           Celia looks between Daud and her mother. Climbs down without 
           Daud’s help. June doesn’t look like she’s going anywhere.  

                                 DAUD
                           (gently)
                        Don’t you think this can wait till 
                        tomorrow? 

                                 JUNE
                        Probably not. 

                                 DAUD
                        I’ll take the probably as a sign we 
                        can negotiate...

           If this is a joke June doesn’t find it funny. 

                                 JUNE
                        No, Daud, we can’t negotiate. Can 
                        you focus for more than ten 
                        minutes? 

                                 DAUD
                        We’ll make more progress when we’re 
                        rested. 

                                 JUNE
                        You want to sleep, sleep. Celia can 
                        help me.

                                 JUNE (CONT'D)
                           (off Celia’s hesitation)
                        Are you tired too?

                                 CELIA
                        Why don’t you just tell him? 

           June shoots her a harsh glance. A beat. Daud looks between 
           them. 

                                 DAUD
                        What is this?

                                 CELIA
                           (to Daud)
                        They said no. To the conservation.  

                                 DAUD
                           (to June)
                        Is this true? 

                                 JUNE
                        I haven’t known for very long. 

                                 DAUD
                        How long? 

           June pulls an ORS packet out of her bag and shakes it into 
           her water. 

                                 DAUD (CONT’D)
                           (to June)
                        You cannot ignore me. You tell me, 
                        now. 

                                 JUNE
                           (to Daud)
                        The ministry sent a letter. It just 
                        means we need to work a little 
                        harder. 

           June drinks her water in one long gulp. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Now you know. 

                                 DAUD
                        We work together as we have been. 
                        Every day. Eighteen hours, twenty 
                        hours sometimes we are out here. 
                        And I do this for you. 
                                 JUNE
                        That’s odd, I thought you were here 
                        because you cared about the 
                        research.

                                 CELIA
                        He does. 

                                 JUNE
                        Stay out of this. 

                                 DAUD
                        I am in a program, you understand. 
                        I am accountable to the ministry. I 
                        cannot go against them. 

                                 JUNE
                        You can’t make up your own mind? 

                                 DAUD
                        June, you have asked me to lie for 
                        you!

                                 JUNE
                        I asked you to take a leap of 
                        faith. Not for me, for the theory. 
                        It has nothing to do with either of 
                        us. 

           Daud just looks at her. 

                                 DAUD
                        I came here, I thought, if I worked 
                        hard, if I learned from the great 
                        scientist - I wanted to learn from 
                        you - I thought I could make a 
                        difference. 

                                 JUNE
                        What do you think we’ve been doing?  

                                 DAUD
                        We? There is not a ‘we’ when you 
                        lie to me, June. 

           June says nothing. They look at each other. A long moment. 

                                 JUNE
                        I told them I didn’t need you. 
                        Celia and I were doing just fine 
                        before the ministry insisted you 
                        come. 
                           (to Celia)
                        Weren’t we?
           Celia says nothing. Daud turns and starts to walk in the 
           other direction. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Great, go on, come on back when 
                        you’ve developed a mind of your 
                        own. Jesus Fucking Christ. 

           Daud keeps walking. June and Celia watch him. A long beat. 
           June turns to Celia. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        I thought I could trust you. 

           Celia doesn’t look at her mother. She starts to walk in 
           Daud’s direction. After a moment June picks up her gear and 
           follows. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Celia knocks on Daud’s door. He opens it. He’s holding a 
           cheap beer. A half packed suitcase is visible on his bed. He 
           looks terrible. 

                                 DAUD
                        What do you want? 

                                 CELIA
                        I’m sorry. 

           Daud softens, steps out of his room. Closes the door behind 
           him. Sits on the floor, gestures for Celia to sit next to 
           him. She does. 

                                 DAUD
                        It’s not your fault.  

                                 CELIA
                        She didn’t say anything because she 
                        wants you here. She doesn’t like 
                        that many people. She likes you. 

                                 DAUD
                        Ah, but she doesn’t. I now know, 
                        she doesn’t. 
                           (beat)
                        Respect and affection. They have to 
                        go like this. 

           He clasps his hands together and holds them out to Celia. 
           They sit in silence for a moment. 
                                 CELIA
                        You’re going to leave us. 

                                 DAUD
                        I have to finish my degree. 

                                 CELIA
                        If June hadn’t lied to you, would 
                        you have stayed? 

                                 DAUD
                        Celia -

                                 CELIA
                        Please don’t leave us. 

           Celia leans forward and impulsively kisses him. He quickly 
           pulls away. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.

                                 DAUD
                        Don’t worry. 

                                 CELIA
                        That was stupid, I’m sorry. 

                                 DAUD
                        Celia, it’s fine. 

                                 CELIA
                        I shouldn’t have done that. 

                                 DAUD
                        Nothing happened. 

           Celia gets up. Runs down the hall and down the stairs, to the 
           terrace outside. 

           EXT. TERRACE - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia stands outside. It’s completely dark around her except 
           for one lone fire in the distance. Daud comes out. Stands 
           next to her. 

                                 CELIA
                        Do you want to hear the world’s 
                        most famous disappearances?

                        Probably hundreds more no one knows 
                        about. Probably hundreds of people 
                        no one even went looking for. 

           Daud searches for something to say. 

                                 DAUD
                        You should go home, I think.

                                 CELIA
                        I can’t leave my mother. 

                                 DAUD
                        Would she stay for you? 

                                 CELIA
                        I don’t know. 
                           (a beat)
                        I’m not her. 

           EXT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - MORNING

           Daud jams belongings into his backpack. Fixes a few small 
           pieces of luggage to his motorbike. Celia helps. Daud reaches 
           into his bag, pulls out a picture. 

                                 DAUD
                        I wanted to give this to you. 

           It’s a picture of June in the forest, holding a bamboo lemur. 
           Her arms and legs are streaked with red dirt. She’s beaming, 
           and she looks beautiful. 

                                 DAUD (CONT’D)
                        I took this my first week here. She 
                        didn’t know I was watching her.  

                                 CELIA
                        Thank you. 

           Celia looks at the picture. They stand there for a moment, at 
           a loss for words. 

           EXT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - DAY

           Celia watches Daud drive away.

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           MOMENTS LATER

           Celia tiptoes into her room. Checks her drawer again - the 
           travelers’ check is still there. 

           She turns. June’s watching her, dressed for the field. Celia 
           steps away from the drawer. 

                                 JUNE
                        I’m not going to take your money, 
                        Celia. 

                                 CELIA
                        I didn’t think you were. 

                                 JUNE
                        If you didn’t think I was, you 
                        wouldn’t keep it in there. With 
                        your magazines. 

           A tense moment. 

                                 CELIA
                        Daud had to go back. He has to 
                        finish his degree. 

                                 JUNE
                        I know. He told me. 
                           (beat)
                        I’m going into the field. Do you 
                        want to come, or do you want to 
                        hang around here? 

           Celia grabs a top from the drawer. 

                                 CELIA
                        I just need to change. 

           June nods, leaves the room. Celia quickly takes the check and 
           slips it underneath her mattress. 

           EXT. FOREST - DAY - SERIES OF SHOTS

           Celia and June walk through the decimated forest. 

           June searches for the golden bamboo. 

           Celia takes gear from her. 

           June stops to rest, walks again. 

           Daylight starts to fade.

           EXT. FOREST - DUSK

           Celia’s faster than June now. June stops to catch her breath. 
           Celia turns and calls to her: 

                                 CELIA
                        If you don’t feel well, we should 
                        stop.  

           Celia backtracks towards her mother. Gives June water, which 
           she gulps. She starts walking again. 

                                 JUNE
                        You can’t slow down, Celia. If you 
                        do, no one will wait for you. 

                                 CELIA
                        Not everyone thinks like that.

                                 JUNE
                        Why have you been avoiding the 
                        forest? 

                                 CELIA
                        I haven’t been.

                        All you think about is water. You 
                        can’t see any of these animals 
                        anywhere else in the world. 

           June takes the gear from Celia and walks deeper into the 
           forest. 

           Celia hesitates, then follows her. 

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           June and Celia set up camp, their vision gear on now. Tense 
           silence between them. 

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           Celia and June stand staring up into the trees. They don’t 
           look at each other. Their shoulders don’t touch. June watches 
           for the goldens with almost desperate focus. 

                                 JUNE
                        Celia, do you think of me as June? 
                                 CELIA
                        I’ve been calling you that, haven’t 
                        I? 

                                 JUNE
                        But do you think of me that way? 

           Celia thinks. This question hurts more than she’d care to 
           admit. 

                                 CELIA
                        Thinking of you as my mother is a 
                        pretty hard habit to break. 

           A beat. June looks away. 

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           June sleeps. Celia can’t. SHe hears a rustling above her. 

           At first she just sees a tail. Then she makes out a lemur 
           feasting on fruit. She steps a few paces back, gets a good 
           look at him. A GOLDEN BAMBOO. 

           Celia freezes. Girl and animal regard each other. A beat. She 
           looks at her mother. Reaches out to wake her. Doesn’t. The 
           bamboo climbs higher in the canopy, and disappears. 

           EXT. FOREST - PRE-DAWN

           Celia and June sit and watch. The sun is coming up. The trees 
           are empty. 

                                 CELIA
                        What if your theory is wrong? 

                                 JUNE
                        Excuse me? 

                                 CELIA
                        What if it’s wrong? We’ve been here 
                        forever, and you haven’t proven it. 

                                 JUNE
                        Did Daud tell you that? 
                           (off Celia’s silence)
                        Important ideas are often 
                        discouraged by lesser people. 

                                 CELIA
                        He isn’t a lesser person. 
                                 JUNE
                        You’re so naive, Celia. Jesus, 
                        really. You listen to your father, 
                        you listen to Daud. Who are they? 
                        What have they done with their 
                        lives? What are you going to do 
                        with yours? 

                                 CELIA
                        I’m going to swim. I’m going to 
                        find a trainer, and I’m going to 
                        become great. 

                                 JUNE
                        You’re too scared, Celia. When I 
                        took you on the river, you wanted 
                        to turn back after seeing one 
                        crocodile. 

                                 CELIA
                        That’s not true.    

                                 JUNE
                        Of course it is. 
                           (beat)
                        You won’t make it, Celia. You don’t 
                        have it in you. 

                                 CELIA
                        How do you know? 

                                 JUNE
                        Oh, come on. 
                           (beat)
                        You want me to believe you’re 
                        strong, you have to prove it. You 
                        can either help protect this land 
                        or you can destroy it. You have to 
                        choose. 

                                 CELIA
                        I want to go home. 

                                 JUNE
                        Like I said. Too much fear. 

                                 CELIA
                        I saw a golden. I didn’t tell you. 
                        You can be mad if you want. 

           June looks at her with disbelief. It takes a moment for this 
           to sink in.  
                                 JUNE
                        I was wrong about you. You’re lazy. 
                        And you’re scared. And you don’t 
                        fight for anything. You’ll end up 
                        like your father, contributing 
                        absolutely nothing. 

                                 CELIA
                        Why do you say things like that?

                                 JUNE
                        Because they’re true. 

                                 CELIA
                        I hear enough about the lemurs. I 
                        really don’t think I’d mind if they 
                        were extinct. 

                                 JUNE
                        Which would leave me with nothing. 

           A beat. Celia, tears forming, turns around and runs. Her 
           mother does not call after her. 

           EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS

           Celia runs. 

           EXT. FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia slows to a walk. She has stopped crying. Through the 
           trees she sees the ocean. A crested ibis swoops above her. A 
           pair of moths flutter. 

           EXT. FOREST/INDIAN OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia looks out at the Indian Ocean. To her right she can see 
           the beach where Daud taught her to swim. The water is all 
           waves, one after the next. 

           Celia doesn’t hesitate. She takes off her shoes, strips down 
           to her swimsuit. 

           She SWIMS. 

           EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER - SERIES OF SHOTS

           Celia swims against the rough water, farther and farther from 
           any signs of land or people. 
           Her stroke is swift and confident. She’s pushing herself, but 
           the effort isn’t as trying. A huge WAVE rises above her. 

           Celia holds her breath like Daud taught her. She fights 
           against the current and pushes to the surface. When she 
           finally emerges, not so far in front of her, there the ISLAND 
           is. 

           EXT. ISLAND - DAY

           Celia pulls herself up onto a small stretch of land, dense 
           with trees. 

           EXT. ISLAND - DAY

           Celia explores. The island is hopping with frogs and bright 
           blue birds.  A lizard slithers across a branch.  

           No lemurs, no primates of any kind. But there aren’t any 
           people, either. 

           EXT. ISLAND - LATER

           Celia looks out at the now-calm ocean. She stretches, takes a 
           tired breath, and begins her long journey back. 

           EXT. BEACH - DUSK

           Celia walks up on the beach, exhilarated, shivering. The 
           beach is oddly quiet. 

           EXT. ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia reaches the road. A few motorbikes speed past. Then a 
           few more. She hears shouting from somewhere. She turns in the 
           direction of the forest as a streak of red cuts the darkness, 
           an enormous BURNING TREE, seemingly smashing the road in two. 

           Celia starts to run. 

           EXT. ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia runs in the direction of a distant, spreading FIRE. 
           Trees crack and tumble as smoke billows towards her. A white 
           jeep races up behind her. 

                                 MELANIE
                        Get in. 
           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN - ROAD - LATER

           Donald drives, Melanie shotgun. Celia’s in the back.

                                 CELIA
                        Who started it? 

                                 DONALD
                        It was meant to clear a hectare. It 
                        spread. 

           EXT. FOREST - RESEARCH CABIN - NIGHT

           Flames spread through the forest - a virtual sea of red. The 
           roof of the research cabin burns. June tries to pull the 
           lemurs out. 

           Celia, Melanie and Donald drive through thick smoke, past 
           Theirry and a few panicked villagers. Donald pulls to a stop. 
           Celia darts out of the jeep. 

                                 CELIA
                        June!

           Donald runs after her, catches her. 

                                 DONALD
                        Stay back here. 

                                 CELIA
                        I have to get my mother. 

                                 DONALD
                        I’ll go. 

           Donald lumbers past Celia towards the research cabin. He 
           finds June, drags her away from the fire. She fights him, 
           curses at him, kicks at him. 

                                 JUNE
                        Stop, I need to help them. Let go 
                        of me!

           Donald picks June up and carries her to the jeep, stuffs her 
           in the backseat. Celia scrambles up next to her as June tries 
           to get out. 

                                 CELIA
                        Mom, please stay. 

           June dissolves into a fit of coughing. They all watch as the 
           cabin is destroyed. 
           INT. MELANIE’S HOUSE - LATER

           Celia, wearing fresh clothes that are too big for her, takes 
           a cup of tea from Timothy. Melanie tends to burns on June’s 
           legs. 

           The house is half-bare, as though they’ve been packing.

                                 MELANIE
                        It’s lucky you caught us. We leave 
                        for Tana in a few days. 

           Celia sits next to June, who glances at her blankly. Accepts 
           the tea. 

                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                           (to June)
                        They get worse, my dear. There 
                        won’t be a clear mile in the 
                        forest. 
                           (a beat)
                        It’s hard to believe people capable 
                        of such beauty are also capable of 
                        such destruction. We try. We can 
                        both say we’ve done that.   

           June thinks about this. Stands up.  

                                 JUNE
                        Celia, come. 

           Celia looks at Melanie, still crouched on the floor. At her 
           mother, legs sticky with ointment, half treated. 

                                 CELIA
                        June. Let her finish helping you. 

                                 JUNE
                        I’m fine. 

                                 CELIA
                        You’re not.

           They stare at each other. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        We’re staying here until you let 
                        her finish. 

           A long beat. June sits down. Melanie resumes bandaging her 
           leg. 
                                 MELANIE
                           (to June)
                        The animals will thank you. I 
                        believe that. 

           Celia watches Melanie quietly treat her mother. 

           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN FOREST - DAY

           Half the trees have been burnt down. Ash and charred branches 
           where the research cabin once was. June’s research appears to 
           have been totally decimated. 

           Celia helps June bury Brown #1 and her babies. 

           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN FOREST - LATER

           Celia watches her mother, kneeling where the lemurs are 
           buried.  

           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN - FOREST - ANOTHER DAY

           Celia walks through what is left of the forest. 

           EXT. FORT DAUPHIN - FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia finds June attempting to rebuild the base of the 
           research cabin, hammering rusty nails into rotting wood.

                                 CELIA
                        That’s going to take you forever. 

                                 JUNE
                        Quicker if you help. 

                                 CELIA
                        I want to go home. 

           A beat. June looks up at her. 

                                 JUNE
                        I guess it’s your lucky day then. 

                                 CELIA
                        What do you mean? 

                                 JUNE
                        We’re leaving. 
                                 CELIA
                        When? 

                                 JUNE
                        Day after tomorrow. 

                                 CELIA
                        Are you lying to me? 

                                 JUNE
                        You shouldn’t talk to me like that. 
                        I’m still your mother. 

                                 CELIA
                        I thought you didn’t want me to 
                        think of you like that. 

           This seems to have an effect on June. She looks away from her 
           daughter. 

                                 JUNE
                        Go look in your top drawer. 
                           (beat)
                        The check your father gave you is 
                        still under your mattress, by the 
                        way. 

           Celia stands there for a moment, uncomfortable. 

                                 CELIA
                        Are you coming too? 

           June continues to rebuild the cabin. After a moment: 

                                 JUNE
                        Just go look. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           AFTERNOON

           Celia opens the drawer. Her money is there. And her 
           magazines. And two plane tickets, with her name and her 
           mother’s. Like June said. 

           EXT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - TERRACE - NIGHT

           Celia and June eat dinner. They don’t say anything. Celia 
           plucks a fried bug from her rice, eats it. It still tastes 
           horrible. June notices, eats one as well. 
           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           NIGHT

           Celia can’t sleep. She looks into June’s room. The door 
           opened this night. Her mother’s back is to her. 

           She tiptoes into June’s room. June is crying quietly. Celia 
           gets into bed next to her.

                                 JUNE
                        There used to be enough of them, 
                        Celi. The goldens. Quiet, going 
                        about their business, not bothering 
                        anyone. Smart. Enough for the 
                        species to have grown.  

                                 CELIA 
                        Twenty nine. 

                                 JUNE
                        I didn’t think you remembered that. 

                                 CELIA
                        You trained me to remember 
                        everything. 

           June wraps the blanket around them. Celia thinks for a long 
           moment. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        There’s an island 22 kilometers 
                        east. You didn’t think I could swim 
                        that far but I did it. 
                           (a beat)
                        It’s not really big enough for 
                        farming. Not really big enough for 
                        people. Maybe, when you find more, 
                        you can bring the goldens there. 

                                 JUNE
                        What do you mean?

                                 CELIA
                        I want to go home. And you want to 
                        stay here. 

                                 JUNE
                        I bought a ticket, Celia. 

                                 CELIA
                        But I know you want to stay. 

           June sits up. Thinks. After a moment:
                                 JUNE
                        What would you do? 

                                 CELIA
                        I could stay with Beth, maybe. Or I 
                        could go with Dad. I’d rather stay 
                        with Beth. Then I can ride with her 
                        to practice. 
                           (a beat)
                        I’ll be fine. It’s what I want. 

           A long beat. On June, thinking. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           PRE-DAWN

           Celia wakes up. June kneels in front of her. 

                                 JUNE
                        Are you sure? 

           Celia nods. Sits up. Hugs her mother. After a moment, June 
           untangles herself. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Go back to sleep. 

                                 CELIA
                        I’m not tired. 

                                 JUNE
                        Don’t lie. 

           A beat. They almost smile. June hands Celia a postcard. It’s 
           old, yellowed.

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        I bought this in some airport, 
                        somewhere. It just struck me. 

           Celia takes the postcard. It’s a picture of red sand, no 
           water in sight. On the back her mother has written, What the 
           World Will Look Like When All the Water Leaves Us. 

           INT. HOTEL LE DAUPHIN - CELIA AND JUNE’S ADJOINING ROOMS - 
           MORNING

           Celia, dressed now, finishes writing a letter, places it on 
           her mother’s bed. 

           Then she takes off her necklace, the amulet meant for 
           protection. Puts that next to the letter. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           EXT./INT. CAR - FORT DAUPHIN - MORNING - SERIES OF SHOTS

           Melanie drives. Celia sits in the passenger seat holding the 
           postcard. She looks out at the road. 

                                 CELIA (V.O.)
                        There’s this story I heard once, 
                        about a woman who traveled to 
                        Africa to find the fountain of 
                        youth. 

           They pass the market. 

                                 CELIA (V.O.)
                        She made a pact to find it, no 
                        matter what, and she searched 
                        everywhere, in the darkest caves 
                        and on mountains so high it was 
                        almost impossible to breath. 

           They pass the bar. 

                                 CELIA (V.O.)
                        She walked thousands of miles, 
                        fought off crocodiles and lions, 
                        but she couldn’t find the fountain. 
                        When she finally went home, her 
                        children were old. 

           They approach the forest and see June’s jeep parked by the 
           side of the road. 

                                 CELIA
                           (to Melanie)
                        Could we stop for a minute? 

           EXT. FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia walks into the forest. She sees her mother’s backpack, 
           her mother’s ponytail. 

                                 CELIA (V.O.)
                        I’ve been thinking, maybe it’s 
                        possible to look so hard for 
                        something you end up missing 
                        everything. 

           Celia walks towards June, who stands a few meters ahead, feet 
           firm in the red dirt, as though she is waiting for her. 

           On June. Looking up at the forest around her. So much of it 
           destroyed. 
           The magnitude and perhaps the impossibility of saving it. For 
           a moment it seems as though she might turn around. 

                                 CELIA (V.O.)
                        Is it? I don’t know the answer yet.

           Celia watches as June walks away. Her shadow disappears into 
           the forest.

           INT./EXT. CAR - FORT DAUPHIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Celia watches the trees recede in the distance. She’s not so 
           scared, anymore. 

                                 CELIA (V.O.)
                        These are a few things I do know: 
                        Lynne Cox swam across the Bering 
                        Straight and brought peace to two 
                        countries during the Cold War. She 
                        swam with dolphins and icebergs and 
                        sharks. She swam the coldest 
                        recorded swim in history. Some 
                        people thought she was brave. Some 
                        people thought she was crazy. Who 
                        is to say what is right? 
                           (beat)
                        I’ll send you more lists. I’ll send 
                        them here. But now I have to go. 

           The car drives farther away from the forest, in the direction 
           of the ocean.
