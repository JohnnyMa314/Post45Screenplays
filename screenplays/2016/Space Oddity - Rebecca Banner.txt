           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           An old slide projector HUMS as it throws an image of a red
           planet across a wall.

                                 ALEX (V.O.)
                        This is Mars.

           The projector WHIRS, then CLICKS: small, futuristic white
           dots on the planet’s surface.

                                 ALEX (V.O.)
                        This will be the first colony on
                        Mars.

           CLICK. A shuttle.

                                 ALEX (V.O.)
                        For 210 days, I will travel there
                        in this.

           CLICK. The white dots are pods, connected by hallways.

                                 ALEX (V.O.)
                        Then this will be my home.

           QUICK CLICKS: a compact bedroom, a greenhouse, a lab, a rec
           room. A face in a space suit, walking the foreign terrain.
           Two hands joined in matrimony. A flag planted on a hill.

                                 ALEX (V.O.)
                        This is where I’ll sleep. This is
                        where I’ll eat. Work. Play.
                        Explore. Get sick. Get better.
                        Marry. Pioneer. And die.

           BACK ON: Mars. Desolate, alien Mars.

                                 ALEX (V.O.)
                        Mars is where I’ll die.

           A long, dramatic pause as ALEXANDER MCALLISTER (27) looks
           out over his audience.

           Handsome, with an intelligent face and an air of awkward
           endearment he would strongly dispute, he wears a t-shirt
           with a CIRCULAR RED LOGO, not unlike NASA’s.

                                 DIMITRI (O.S.)
                        This is for children?

           His audience is DIMITRI (30), a Russian with brooding
           features that are at a constant clash with an
           uncharacteristically cheery personality.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ALEX
                        Yes.

                                 DIMITRI
                        And you must end on dying?

                                 ALEX
                        That is how it ends.

                                 DIMITRI
                        But do you really want to bring
                        that up to a room of first graders?

                                 ALEX
                        Second graders...

                                 DIMITRI
                        Maybe you should talk more of space
                        adventures?

                                 ALEX
                        Space adventures?

                                 DIMITRI
                        Discovering aliens, or racing
                        rovers. Oh, oh, oh - playing
                        basketball!

                                 ALEX
                        You’re thinking of Space Jam.

                                 DIMITRI
                        Oh. Yes. I do not think they would
                        realize this, though.

                                 ALEX
                        That stuff isn’t real, Dimitri.

                                 DIMITRI
                        Well this is not yet real, either.

                                 ALEX
                        It will be. That’s the difference.

                                 DIMITRI
                              (considering)
                        Let me see it again-

           He grabs the remote from Alex and CLICKS through slides.

                                 DIMITRI (CONT’D)
                        Projectors and Space Jam...what a
                        time to be alive.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 ALEX
                              (re: slides)
                        Some are from my old astronomy set.
                        I thought it’d be kind of cool...

                                 DIMITRI
                        Is that why Pluto’s still a planet?

           Alex looks at the projection. The former planet looks back.

                                 ALEX
                        Oh...maybe I can scratch it out.

           Dimitri watches as Alex attempts to tamper with the slide.

                                 DIMITRI
                        Use a laptop.

                                 ALEX
                              (having destroyed the slide)
                        Fine.

                                 DIMITRI
                        And finish with living. This is
                        where I live, the end.

                                 ALEX
                        Alright.
                              (beat)
                        They released Space Jam in Russia?

           OVER CREDITS:

           EXT. VERMONT - DAWN

           Mars, a tiny dot in the night sky, disappears behind
           sunlight as DAY BREAKS over an enormous field of flowers.

           A figure lies among them. UP CLOSE we see it’s Alex, doing
           push ups, fog swirling around his motion. We HEAR him
           breathing. We SEE his focus. This is a man on a mission.

           And then he’s off, RUNNING down a long driveway, watched
           from the retreating farmhouse by his bemused PARENTS.

           EXT. VERMONT - DAWN - CONTINUOUS

           He runs through meadows, past hay barrels and farm animals.
           A dark cloud follows him, but it never gives way to rain.

           He races himself up a hill, framed by staggering mountain
           ranges, running towards the sights and sounds of life in-
           EXT. BARTLET - TOWN SQUARE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           -Bartlet, a small town with a bustling main street and town
           square housing too many STATUES of long lost pioneers.

           He stops by ETHAN ALLEN, MILITIA LEADER, 1738-1789, leaning
           against his bronze coattails as he catches his breath.

                                 EVAN (O.S.)
                        We have a perimeter breach. This is
                        not a drill.

                                 JACK (O.S.)
                        Put your weapons down and your
                        hands up. I said weapons down!

                                 LOUIS (O.S.)
                        Weapons down, hands up!

           Three EIGHT-YEAR-OLDS stand on the balcony above the corner
           store, head to toe in army camouflage and pointing menacing
           POTATO GUNS at him. Several POTATOES roll round their feet.

                                 ALEX
                              (hands up in surrender)
                        I’m a civilian.

           EVAN steps forward. He talks like he’s seen a whole lot of
           Brad Pitt movies a kid shouldn’t have seen.

                                 EVAN
                        State your name.

                                 ALEX
                        Alexander McAllister.

                                 EVAN
                        Your purpose?

                                 ALEX
                        Supply pick up.

           Evan eyes him. Checks with his team. A tense beat.

                                 EVAN
                        Denied.

           And they unleash a HAIL of potato pellets. Alex ducks and
           covers himself as they RAIN down on him.

                                 ALEX
                        Evan!

           CONTINUED:

           A stray PLONKS onto a passing WOMAN’S head. She touches her
           hair, pulls it out and turns.

           This is DAISY TAYLOR (27), a tangle of dark hair and
           inquisitive eyes, the perfect match for the personality
           churning beneath.

           The boys DUCK under the safety of the white railing, hidden.
           No such luck for Alex.

                                 DAISY
                        People usually just tap me on the
                        shoulder.

           Alex looks to the balcony. Nothing. He’s on his own.

                                 ALEX
                        Well...you’ve got to stand out.

                                 DAISY
                        Does it ever work?

                                 ALEX
                        Does what?

                                 DAISY
                        Throwing potato at passing
                        strangers?

                                 ALEX
                        It’s...hit or miss...

           Beat. And then she laughs. He’s quite proud of himself.

                                 DAISY
                        Oh, you deserve this.

           She flicks it at him before turning. He notices another
           pellet caught in her hair.

                                 ALEX
                        Wait - there’s another one.

           She shakes her head but it remains lodged. He tentatively
           moves closer and pulls it out. From here, he can see
           freckles, the hazel in her eyes, a scar...

                                 DAISY
                        Thanks.

           She pulls away, bringing him back to reality.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Righting your wrongs. How noble.

                                 ALEX
                              (losing his nerve)
                        I mean...you know there are kids up
                        there, right?

                                 DAISY
                              (a glance to the balcony)
                        Are there? I’ve only ever seen
                        highly trained military operatives.

           She grins and walks off. The boys emerge from their hiding.

                                 EVAN
                        Smooth.

           Grimacing, Alex throws the pellet back up at them.

                                 ALEX
                        Thanks Evan.

           As he slings his fake gun over his shoulder and looks off
           into the distance:

                                 EVAN
                        That’s Commander Marshburn to you,
                        son.

           INT. BARTLET COUNTY GENERAL STORE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Alex enters, still holding the pellet. Evan’s mother LINDA
           (40’s) is perched behind the counter, eyes glued to a KINDLE
           which plays a constant stream of the darkest - though
           sleekest - Scandinavian crime dramas.

           We hear Swedish DIALOGUE. Intense MUSIC. FOOTSTEPS. Blood
           SPLATTERING over minimalist furniture.

                                 ALEX
                        Hey-

           She jumps.

                                 LINDA
                        Sorry. Good bit. Hi Alex.

           And her eyes are right back on the Kindle as Alex pays for a
           newspaper.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 ALEX
                        Think there’s been another raid on
                        the potatoes.

           He sets the pellet down within her line of sight.

           INT. MCALLISTER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

           JANE and JEFF MCALLISTER (60’s) eat breakfast round the
           table of a immaculately clean house, joined by daughter LIZ
           (30), a high strung PR Executive in a serious and committed
           relationship with her phone.

           Jeff reads the paper. Jane looks at her spoon and,
           dissatisfied, rubs at the sole blemish on it. In the
           reflection, she catches her daughter TYPING furiously.

                                 JANE
                        Honey, it’s not going to kill you
                        if you look away for two minutes.

                                 LIZ
                        It won’t. People will.

           Alex enters, sweaty. He throws Jeff the newest edition.

                                 ALEX
                              (to Liz)
                        Good, you came.

                                 LIZ
                        Whatever I can do to fulfill your
                        unreasonable demands.

           She continues TAPPING on her phone. Alex pours cereal.

                                 ALEX
                        It was a request.

                                 LIZ
                        Mom made it a demand.

                                 JANE
                        No, I didn’t.

           A look between mother and daughter: you sure as hell did.

                                 ALEX
                        Well, I’m forever grateful that you

                        Do you need me to text it to you?

           All eyes on him, Alex sits down. Clears his throat.

                                 ALEX
                        So I asked you here for a reason.

                        You need a lift.

                        The Mission Mars Space Program.

                        Okay.

                                 ALEX
                        It’s a one way journey so I wanted
                        to tell you all as soon as I knew
                        for sure.

           Now Liz is concerned, glancing over at her guilty-looking
           parents.

                                 LIZ
                        I don’t understand. Are we joking-

                              (scoffing)
                        NASA’s schedule is thirty years
                        out. We’re doing it in ten.

                                 LIZ
                        I still don’t...what...

                                 ALEX
                        I’m going to be training soon,
                        mostly in isolation, so I thought
                        we should all spend some time
                        together before that happens.

           Liz looks around the room. Looks back at him. His sincerity.

                                 LIZ
                        You really believe this?

           Liz isn’t listening, she’s glaring at her mother.

           The home phone RINGS. Alex answers:

                        This is the most he’s done all

                        Ideally, it will germinate seeds
                        using Martian soil.

                                 DIMITRI
                        But Martian soil is not really

                                 DAISY
                        And?

                                 ALEX
                        You really want the "and"?
                              (off her nod)
                        Well, we know next to nothing about
                        the universe, and we aren’t going
                        to figure it out from here. Just
                        like a hundred years ago we didn’t
                        know anything about the Amazon, or
                        Antarctica. We had to explore. So
                        we get to Mars, maybe we could
                        start to find answers...it could be
                        the beginning of everything.

           She sits back, playing with her pen. Intrigued.

                                 DAISY
                        "The beginning of everything."
                        Sounds like a song.

                                 ALEX
                        Thanks.

           He cringes: why is he pleased?

           Her eyes flicker to the clock. Quarter to five.

           Right. He looks back down and continues scribbling. Until:

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Did you just move here?

                                 DAISY
                        What?

                        It’s a small town...

                        Yeah, I did.

                                 ALEX
                        Why?

                                 DAISY
                        I guess sometimes you wake up with
                        the crippling desire to work in the
                        insurance industry, and then you do
                        everything possible to make that
                        dream a reality.

                                 ALEX
                        Oh.

           He goes back to the paperwork, oblivious. Or confused.

                                 DAISY
                        I wanted to be a swimmer.

           He looks up.

                                 ALEX
                        What happened?

                                 DAISY
                        A lot of other people did too.

           Beat.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m a really bad swimmer.

                                 DAISY
                              (laughing)
                        Well, good, then I at least beat
                        you.

           She walks him out, keys in hand.

                                 DAISY
                        I might have some follow up
                        questions if that’s OK.

                        hanging out with my pal Netflix.

                                 DAISY
                        Not really. He keeps trying to make
                        me watch the Vanilla Ice Renovation
                        show. Need some new friends...

           She looks at him. Pointedly. And he freaks out.

                                 ALEX
                        Ok, well, have a swell night.

           She raises an eyebrow: swell?

           Cringing, he’s down the steps and across the street before
           she can blink again. MIKE TAYLOR (60’s) joins her.

                                 MIKE
                        Sweet kid. Known him since he was

           He reaches his hand low to the ground.

                                 DAISY
                        Is he crazy?

                        I never thought so before.
                              (thinking)
                        Look, obviously we can’t insure him
                        if this is all nonsense, but we owe
                        it to him to look into it. I know
                        it’s not part of the job
                        description but...

           Far away now, Alex glances back, OUT OF BREATH from his
           escape.

                                 DAISY
                              (fascinated)
                        I’ll do it. I don’t mind.

           Alex ducks and shields his face as he enters the zone of
           potato pellets. Mike pats her on the back, relieved.
           INT. MCALLISTER HOUSE - ALEX’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Alex sits in the dark, watching the earth roll by via the
           International Space Station STREAM on his enormous MONITOR.

           Except he’s not really watching. He’s daydreaming.
           Reflections glide over his face. The Earth, going from night
           to day in seconds, and her somewhere on it.

           EXT. MCALLISTER FARM - FIELDS - DUSK

           Alex and Dimitri are putting equipment away. Dimitri is
           singing, and following each verse with translations.

                                 DIMITRI
                        She’s saying when you say her name,
                        she will run through the flames to
                        you. Peace will prevail-

                                 ALEX
                        There will be peace because you
                        said her name?

                                 DIMITRI
                        And fire. Peace and fire.

           Jane leads Daisy towards them.

                                 DAISY (O.S.)
                        Wow, this is beautiful.

           Alex hears and looks up. Panics, but there’s nowhere to run.

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        Hi.

                        Hi.

           They both notice the other person beside them, grinning
           deliriously. Dimitri is quickly back to work and Jane-

                                 JANE
                        -I think I hear your father-

                        Any daisies?

                              (scoffing)
                        No. Daisies are weeds.

                                 DAISY
                        Thank you.

           He has no idea how to save that moment.

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry to just show up...I had some
                        follow up questions but you didn’t
                        leave a number.

                                 ALEX
                        I don’t have a phone. It’s part of
                        preparing for isolation.

                                 DAISY
                        Oh, of course...isolation.

           She looks around. Dimitri sings quietly nearby.

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        Well, we can underwrite a policy,
                        but since it’s such a unique
                        situation I need some more details
                        in order to create a plan.

                                 ALEX
                        Ok. But I’m running late for
                        something.

           Dimitri GLARES at him.

                                 DAISY
                        Sorry, I came at a bad time...

           Dimitri GESTURES to her.

                                 ALEX
                        It’s a first aid course.

                        Dimitri sometimes helps me out but-

           Dimitri SPEEDS past:

                        I guess seeing the training might
                        answer some of your questions?

                                 DAISY
                        You’re learning first aid for

                        Just locally at the moment. They’ll
                        put us through more rigorous stuff
                        down the line.

           She looks at him. Such an odd proposal. Decides.

                                 DAISY
                        Ok.

           INT. SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

           Bodies and dummies litter the floor. Daisy is lying on a mat
           in front of Alex.

           The course is run by RENEE (60’s), a retiree who has
           wholeheartedly embraced the idea of Alex training for Mars.

           Alex looks MORTIFIED. We find out because it is CPR NIGHT.

                                 RENEE
                        Your cousin has jumped in the pool,
                        can’t swim and is drowning. You
                        must resuscitate her.

           She turns to Alex.

                                 RENEE (CONT’D)
                        Alex, Daisy here has taken her
                        helmet off for too long.

                                 ALEX
                        Ok, but in that case, she’d be dead
                        instantly.

                                 RENEE
                        Why?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 ALEX
                        Because there’s very little oxygen.

                                 RENEE
                        Well, say there is oxygen.

                                 ALEX
                        But there isn’t. She’d be dead.

                                 RENEE
                        Then say she fell into a pool too.
                        But the pool is on Mars.
                        Resuscitate her. Begin!

           The class performs CPR. Alex sighs.

                                 DAISY
                        Am I drowning now? Ok-

           She makes a choking sound.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t realize we were
                        doing CPR tonight.

                                 DAISY
                        Sure you didn’t.

                                 ALEX
                        No, I really didn’t.

           Daisy makes another choking sound. From across the room:

                                 RENEE
                        Alex, she’s dying! Save her! Save
                        her now!

           With extreme reluctance, Alex kneels down. He places his
           fingers on her neck to find her pulse. Then he moves over
           her mouth. He gets close. His lips right above hers.

                                 ALEX
                        And then I do the breathing part. I
                        get it. It makes sense.

           He sits back up and tentatively places his hands on her
           chest, beginning light compressions.

                                 DAISY
                        You’re not doing it right.

           She takes his hands and moves them over her chest to the
           proper position. She leaves her hands on top of his.

           She pushes their hands. He’s having trouble concentrating.

           She gets up and indicates for him to lie.

                        Come on, I was a swimmer, remember?

           With extreme hesitation, he complies. Her lips press his as
           she performs perfect CPR. It catches Renee’s attention:

                        drowning she has pulled Alex from
                        the water and now saved his life.

           Daisy grins at the disgruntled astronaut before her.

                                 DAISY
                        Sounds like you owe me.

                        I’m sorry. I thought we’d be tying

           They walk in silence for a little. Alex, as he is prone to
           do, looks up at the night sky. She follows his gaze.

                        It also helps to remember we’re all
                        just on a giant rock hurtling
                        through space and our meaningless

           She pulls the lollipop out of his mouth. He reaches into his

           Alex stands in front of EYES. Rows and rows of EYES, all
           glued on him. Among them are the ARMY BOYS.

           He’s currently the only thing standing between these kids
           and home. And they know it.

                                 ALEX
                        So I understand you’ve been

           Silence. Alex looks longingly at his laptop in Liz’s arms.

           Daisy rounds the corner, looking for him.

           Hearing LAUGHTER, she looks in a window to see him arranging
           the kids in several circles.

                                 ALEX
                        Ready...go!

           The kids TWIRL and SPIN and GIGGLE in their circles. Alex
           moves through them, adjusting as he goes.

                        Jack, you’re the sun, got it? You

                        around you.

           Jack nods. He moves to another child.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        You’re Mercury. It only takes you
                        eighty seven days to orbit Jack so
                        you’re going to move quickly now.
                        Yes, exactly. Venus, you rotate
                        counter-clockwise. Like this.

           He demonstrates. Venus follows. He repositions Evan.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Evan, you’re Earth. You’re our
                        home. You spin a bit slower than
                        Venus. Every time you come back to
                        face Jack you’ve experienced a day,
                        and every time you rotate all the
                        way around Jack it’s been a year.

           The kids are eating it up.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Louie, you’re the moon. There are

                        but we’ll just use ours today. So
                        you circle around Evan as he
                        circles around the sun.

           The boys LAUGH as they try to keep track of their spinning.

                        Neptune. Some of you have rings

                        some of you are very cold, Uranus.
                        Neptune, it takes you 164 years to
                        orbit the sun. So you have to move
                        really slowly, alright?

           Neptune slows his orbit.

                        Well, for instance, there are a 100
                        billion stars in the milky way and
                        maybe ten trillion galaxies in the
                        universe. Multiply that by a 100
                        billion and you have an extremely
                        rough, probably low estimate for
                        the number of stars.

           The now drunk pair emerge from the bar.

           It’s RAINING. Daisy takes off in a run, YELLING back:

                        You don’t have to walk me home.

           But he doesn’t like the implication and follows her.

           They head down Main Street. Alex is trying to catch up to
           her but she’s quite fast. And oblivious to his effort.

           They hit suburbia. A few streets come and go before she
           skids to a halt under a semi-effective umbrella tree.

                        Yeah. Well, have a swell night.

           He LOCKS EYES with her. The gaze lasts that one extra
           time-bending second.

           He leans forward and KISSES her.

           They BUMP into a dresser as she PULLS OFF his shirt. She

           Alex opens his eyes. He’s in an unfamiliar place and his
           head hurts. The clock reads 9:30AM.

           He turns over to see Daisy asleep beside him. God, she’s
           pretty. But-

           This is not part of the plan.

           He quietly gets out of bed, pulls his jeans over his MISSION
           MARS BOXER SHORTS and sneaks out.

                        all day talking on an imaginary
                        phone about FBI missions.

           Jeff sighs, defeated.

                                 JEFF
                        We can’t tell your mother.

                                 LIZ
                        I’ll get the car.

           She’s STARTLED when she runs into Dimitri on the main path.

                                 DIMITRI
                        The infamous Elizabeth! What are
                        you doing here?

                                 LIZ
                        Not today, Russia.

           He leans down, plucks out a flower and hands it to her.

           She keeps walking...but she also keeps the flower.

           INT. DR. OLSEN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Dr. Olsen is trailed as he prepares his exam room.

                                 DR. OLSEN
                        Doctor/patient confidentiality
                        means what it sounds like it means.

                                 LIZ
                        But this is different. This is
                        Alex.

                                 DR. OLSEN
                        A patient.

                                 LIZ
                        An insane patient who needs help.

                                 DR. OLSEN
                        He diagnoses himself sane and you
                        diagnose him insane - at the very
                        least we can have no doubt you two
                        are siblings.

           Liz nudges her father.

                                 JEFF
                        You’ve told me about him before.

                                 DR. OLSEN
                        Yes, when he was a child!

           Liz’s phone BUZZES. She glances at it.

                                 JEFF
                        Joe, I know it’s breaking protocol-

                                 DR. OLSEN
                        The law-

                                 JEFF
                        But we are concerned.

                                 DR. OLSEN
                        That doesn’t mean I break the law.

           Liz sits down in a chair and crosses her arms.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Dr. Olsen turns with a SYRINGE in his hand.

                                 DR. OLSEN
                        What if I break out one of these?
                        Are your immunizations up to date?

           Liz bristles. The downside of having a small town, lifelong
           physician is that he knows your secrets.

                                 DR. OLSEN (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes at night, I still hear
                        the screams from your measles shot.

           She weighs her options, not taking her eyes off the needle.

                                 LIZ
                        If you help...you can give me the
                        tetanus booster.

                                 DR. OLSEN
                              (tempted)
                        I’ve been waiting ten years for
                        that.

           She holds out her arm.

                                 LIZ
                        Please.

           Dr. Olsen looks at them. He sighs.

                                 DR. OLSEN
                        He’s not crazy - he’s one of the
                        smartest people to ever come out of
                        this town. You know that.

                                 LIZ
                        That’s the problem, then? He’s so
                        smart he doesn’t know what to do?

                                 DR. OLSEN
                        There is no problem. Maybe he has a
                        slight delusion, but once upon a
                        time you were convinced you were a
                        wizard.

                                 LIZ
                        I was ten.

                                 LIZ
                        But this is suicide!

                                 DR. OLSEN
                        It’s only suicide if he goes
                        through with it. So far he’s just
                        living out a fantasy. What’s the
                        difference between that and someone
                        who plays video games all day?

           Jeff looks to Liz: he has a point.

                                 DR. OLSEN (CONT’D)

                        More than you’d imagine. What you
                        have is an exceptionally
                        intelligent brother, Liz. And
                        sometimes those kinds of people
                        have the hardest time living.
                        Sometimes they have the hardest
                        time coping. Consider that this
                        might be something he needs to do.

                                 LIZ
                        We can’t let him keep believing
                        it’s real.

                                 DR. OLSEN
                        It is real to him.

                              (hesitant)
                        What about the fact that it’s
                        space?

                                 DR. OLSEN
                        What about it?

                                 LIZ
                        You know when he was a kid he used
                        to be obsessed with space.
                              (reluctantly)
                        They both were.

           Jeff cringes. Olsen watches the reaction.

                        brought him back in here. What
                        would you have me say? That he’s
                        not going to Mars? Would he listen?

                        doesn’t need to talk about what

                                 ALEX
                        I wasn’t paying attention.

                                 DAISY
                        Can’t. Breathe.

                                 ALEX
                        You’re not going to show me how to
                        do it?

                                 DAISY
                        You’re on your own. Don’t kill me.

           He puts his arms around her waist. Doesn’t see her smile.

           INT. MCALLISTER HOUSE - ALEX’S BEDROOM - DAWN

           Alex does knee ups. Sets the timer on his watch and:

           EXT. VERMONT - DAY

           He runs. Shoes THUD on asphalt down a long road.

           He breathes HEAVILY. Likely because another pair of shoes
           THUD ahead.

           It’s Daisy. And he’s struggling to keep up with her.

           She stops at a light post, waiting for him.

                                 DAISY
                        Come on!
                              (checking her watch)
                        You were two minutes and twelve
                        seconds quicker yesterday. Two and
                        thirty last week.

           Huffing and puffing, he finally catches up:

                                 ALEX
                        Just so you know, I completely
                        regret this.

           He takes off again, trying his darndest to get a head start.

           She smiles, knowing it won’t last, turns and follows.
           EXT. BARTLET - TOWN SQUARE - DAY - LATER

           Post run, they’re walking through town, Alex still panting.

                                 DAISY
                        Oh my god, look-

           Alex turns to see the three boys, on the balcony and in
           astronaut suits. Their career change. He’s touched.

           They’re "walking on the moon" but stop and salute him with
           the utmost severity as he passes.

           EXT. MCALLISTER FARM - FIELDS - DAY

           Alex leads Daisy through the flowers, showing her the farm.

           INT. MCALLISTER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Jane and Liz watch from the windows.

                                 LIZ
                        He’s outside. With a girl.

                                 JANE
                        That’s his insurance agent.

                                 LIZ
                        She’s really going above the line
                        of duty...

           Their eyes gleam with hope.

           INT. MCALLISTER FARM - GREENHOUSE - DAY - LATER

           Alex demonstrates his machine.

                                 DIMITRI
                        We’re calling it The Germinator.

                                 ALEX
                        No we aren’t.

                                 DIMITRI
                        But we should.

                                 DAISY
                        I think you should.

                        That’s the least important part.

                                 DAISY
                        I don’t know - people judge books
                        by their covers.

                                 ALEX
                        Anyway...this is how the world will
                        work one day. Underground,
                        self-sustaining farms. There’s one
                        in an old tube station in London
                        already. I just need to be able to
                        make it work-

                                 DIMITRI
                        -on Mars.

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah. The International Space
                        Station got some seeds growing but
                        Mars is another story. I have to
                        account for the lack of atmosphere,
                        the radiation, the gravity...

                                 DAISY
                        This could go to NASA, Alex. I mean
                        it. This could be your career.

                                 ALEX
                        It’s only a small bit.

                                 DAISY
                        It’s the survival bit!
                              (off his skepticism)
                        You could take it to the Vermont
                        Space Consortium. They’re run by
                        NASA. You could get grants and
                        funding and a team and everything!

           Dimitri looks excited, Alex less than thrilled.

                                 ALEX
                        Nah. Probably won’t work anyway.

                                 DAISY
                        Come on-

           They’ve all stayed on for dinner. Jane runs the room.

                        Dimitri, you get the potatoes.

                        Yes, I forget about the glory of
                        the word potato.

           Liz looks up from her phone.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Yes, you. Can you take the plates?

                                 LIZ
                        In a sec.

                        the tarelkas.

           He over-pronounces it, enjoying annoying her.

                                 LIZ
                        Whatever, comrade.

           Daisy and Alex watch them from the kitchen bar.

                                 DAISY
                        Well, that’s an inevitability.

                                 ALEX
                        What?

           Something twinges in Alex.

                                 ALEX
                        He said potato in another language.

                                 DAISY
                        It was charming.

           Beat.

                        That’s potato in Spanish.

           Daisy turns to respond but-

                                 JANE
                        Daisy, dear, if you could just
                        carry this plate out. Then please,
                        take a seat.

           INT. MCALLISTER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           She does. The others are already there, including Jeff.

           Alex and Jane join them. They pass the food. Liz watches as
           Daisy plates potatoes for Alex. Watches when she says:

                                 DAISY
                        -Patata-

           -to Alex, before laughing. Watches as Alex grumbles, then
           laughs in spite of himself.

                                 LIZ
                        So, Daisy, you seem normal.

                        I read a feature on one of the

                        revealed everything to this
                        reporter feigning friendship. I
                        mean, Daisy, you get it-

                        I’m looking out for you.

           They both lean back in their chairs, harumph-ing.

           Daisy puts it on herself to break the silence:

                        They really suit their names, Mrs.

                        I certainly hope so - I spent my
                        pregnancies buried in books.

           Alex and Liz SIGH: they’ve heard this a thousand times.

                                 JEFF
                        What she means to say is you were
                        looking like a Genghis for a minute
                        there, Alex.

                                 JANE
                        Well, at the end of the day, the
                        right names were given to the right
                        people and I have no regrets.

                        What about Christopher, then? Is he
                        a big traveler?

           The room falls into a swift and terrifying silence.

           Nobody really knows what to do. Alex won’t look at her.

           Jane forces a smile, scrubbing at a small water mark on the
           table, and, unnaturally brightly:

                        They’re great.

                                 JANE
                        Good. Dimitri used a recipe he
                        brought over from Russia.

                                 LIZ
                        Mom, he put paprika on them. It’s
                        hardly revolutionary.

                                 DIMITRI
                        Maybe it is. We’ve had quite a few.

                                 LIZ
                        That’s not what I meant.

           As they continue to bicker, everything back to normal, Daisy
           looks at Alex. He’s still looking at his plate.

           EXT. MCALLISTER HOUSE - PORCH - NIGHT - LATER

           Daisy waves goodbye from her car before driving off.

                                 LIZ
                        Sorry about cornering her.
                              (off his skepticism)
                        Sort of sorry.
                              (continued skepticism)
                        She’s nice. I like her.

                                 ALEX
                        I heard that.

                                 LIZ
                        Heard what?

                                 ALEX
                        She’s just a friend, Liz.

                                 LIZ
                        Why?

                                 ALEX
                        I can’t form attachments when I
                        have to prepare for training.

           Liz tries to maintain calm despite her head exploding.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LIZ
                        Why even be friends with her then?

                                 ALEX
                        It’s good practice for the mission.
                        She’s different from most people
                        around here so makes a good stand
                        in for the other astronauts.
                        Relationship building will be half
                        the battle before launch.

           Though she doesn’t push it, she doesn’t buy it for a second.

                                 LIZ
                        Does she know she’s not your
                        girlfriend?

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah.

                                 LIZ
                        Do you?

           He pauses for a moment, then exits, leaving her baffled.

           EXT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mike’s sorting the recycling. Daisy greets him as she walks
           past. Then she stops. Walks again. Stops.

                                 DAISY
                        You said you’ve known them for
                        years, right?

                                 MIKE
                        Known who?

                                 DAISY
                        The McAllisters. What happened to
                        them?

           Mike stands up tall and looks at her.

                                 MIKE
                        Rats, he’s crazy, isn’t he?
           EXT. MCALLISTER FARM - FIELDS - DAY

           Alex hauls several bunches of lavender over to Jeff.

                                 ALEX
                        We can do another field today and
                        be ahead on the orders.

                                 JEFF
                        Let’s finish this one first. My
                        knees are getting too crook.

                                 ALEX
                        You should go to the doctor.

                                 JEFF
                        It’s age Alex. There’s no
                        outrunning it.
                              (a glance at his son)
                        I would like to leave the business
                        in good hands, when the time comes.

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah.

                                 JEFF
                        I want to sign it over to you.

           Alex stops, genuinely surprised.

                                 ALEX
                        Dad, I’m going to space, remember?
                        I won’t be here to take it.

                                 JEFF
                        But realistically-

                                 ALEX
                        I am being realistic.

                                 JEFF
                        You won’t even consider it?

                                 ALEX
                        No.

                                 JEFF
                        Because you’re going to space...

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah - it’d be a waste of time for
                        both of us.

           Jeff just looks at him - no IDEA how to handle this.
           EXT. FOREST - DUSK

           Daisy and Alex walk through a dense, less traveled part of
           the forest, pushing aside branches and stepping over logs.

                                 ALEX
                        You know I saw some at my house
                        last night. It’s not some magical
                        forest thing. They aren’t fairies.

                                 DAISY
                        But today is the day most of them
                        are out. It’s like their reunion.

                                 ALEX
                        You mean they’re mating?

                                 DAISY
                        Yeah...or dying. I forget which.

                                 ALEX
                        How did you get your scar?

                                 DAISY
                        You ask things at strange times.

                                 ALEX
                        Sorry.

                                 DAISY
                        Are you still asking?

                                 ALEX
                        Yes.

                                 DAISY
                        We spun out on the freeway when a
                        tire came off our car. My sister
                        and I both went-

           She SLAMS a balled up fist into her hand.

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        -through the windshield. The
                        doctors could see my skull.

                                 ALEX
                        That’s disgusting.

                                 DAISY
                        My sister was worse. We thought she
                        was dead.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Alex’s expression changes - very much against his will - to
           one of sorrow.

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        Shit. I didn’t mean to-

                                 ALEX
                              (deliberate)
                        Sorry you had to see her like that.

           It reads very clearly: he doesn’t want to talk about it.

                                 DAISY
                              (cautiously)
                        It wasn’t all bad. She was a mean
                        teenager. This leveled out her
                        brain and made her tolerable again.

           He laughs as they sit on a tree stump.

                                 ALEX
                        You know, you’re weirder than I
                        thought you were.

                                 DAISY
                        Well, you’re less weird than I
                        thought you were.

           They smile at each other, when suddenly a firefly LIGHTS UP
           in her face. She instinctively SWATS at it:

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        Ah!

                                 ALEX
                        Did you kill it?

                                 DAISY
                        No!

                                 ALEX
                        Then where is it?

                                 DAISY
                        I don’t know!

           There is a tense few seconds. Then a little light near them.

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        Ok, he’s fine.

           There’s another light. And another. She loves it, pointing
           at them all like he can’t see them with his own eyes.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        You’re getting joy out of a bug’s
                        ass lighting up.

                        No, I’m not.

           She puts her arm around him. He tries very hard to act like
           this means nothing.

                                 DAISY
                        Yes, you are. Watch those pretty,
                        pretty butts.
                              (off his laughter)
                        Now how could you think about
                        giving this up?

           At that moment, he doesn’t know.

           INT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY

           Alex opens his eyes.

           He turns to see Daisy asleep beside him. He watches her. The
           vein in her neck pulsing very subtly with her heart beat.

           And then he frowns. Jumps up.

                                 ALEX
                        What happened?

                        Look down.

           He does. He’s fully dressed.

                        If you stop panicking you might
                        remember falling asleep. Very
                        scandalous. Especially when you
                        drooled.

                        I have to go.

           And he’s out the door.

           EXT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Alex CLAPS his hands in the cold morning air. Does knee ups
           in the driveway. Furious at himself for slipping.

           Mike watches from the main house, concerned.

                        It’s not what you think.

           She glances down at the Kindle. SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC. A
           surprised SWEDISH VOICE. The murderer is REVEALED.

                                 LINDA
                        It never is.

           As he grabs his newspaper, he catches the USA TODAY
           headline:

           BOSTON MISSION MARS FINALIST: IT’S A SCAM.

           His face clouds. He throws money down and leaves.

           EXT. BARTLET - MAIN STREET - DAY

           Alex is walking down the street when there is a:

                        Schizo!
           He spins around. People stare, but no one reads guilty. He
           studies the second story windows. Whoever it was is hiding.

           A glum Alex is on a VIDEO CALL with Curtis.

                        Of course they’re calling it a scam
                        - they’re angry they didn’t get
                        through.

                        And they’re going to call it
                        impossible until the day we take
                        off. But then who’ll be laughing?

                        Maybe it’s not just a slight

                        Don’t you think something might
                        have gone wrong in his brain, then?
                        If he really wanted to go to space
                        wouldn’t he have gone to NASA?

                        anymore! He’s killing himself.
                        That’s all this is. He’s just being
                        really fucking creative about it.

           Jeff really, really doesn’t know what to do. Liz takes a
           deep breath, preparing for the backlash that will follow:

                        Is this because of Christopher?

                        No, dad!
                              (to Alex)
                        You can’t escape by jumping on a
                        rocket. You will feel all the same
                        things about Chris up there.

                                 ALEX
                        How do you know what I feel?

                                 LIZ
                        Really? I don’t know what it feels
                        like? You have it worse because you
                        were his brother and I’m just the
                        lowly fucking sister?

           All now YELLING, Jane stands up between them.

                                 JANE
                        Stop it, stop it, both of you. Show
                        some respect and leave him out of
                        this. This conversation is OVER.

           She says it with such ferocity that they’re instantly quiet.

           Alex GLARES at Liz as he storms back to his room. Liz GLARES
           at Jane as she exits the house. Her CAR is heard speeding
           off. Jane looks to Jeff, but he’s looking into the distance.

           In a daze, she slowly goes back to cleaning the windows.

           INT. ALEX’S CAR - DAY

           Daisy drives. Alex stares out the window. She glances over.

                                 DAISY
                        What’s happened?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 ALEX
                        Nothing.

                                 DAISY
                        You’ve been weird all day.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m fine.
                              (she remains concerned)
                        I’m fine.

           And suddenly he is fine, because this is his area of
           expertise. He smiles.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Maybe I’m a bit scared of your
                        driving...

                        Shut up.

           EXT. TRAIL - DAY - LATER

           They hike a forest trail until they emerge-

           EXT. NATIONAL SEASHORE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           -to find themselves on the edge of a bluff overlooking the
           Atlantic Ocean. The vast beach before them is dwarfed only
           by the ocean stretching out in all directions beyond it.

                                 ALEX
                        I know you miss swimming, so...

           She turns and hugs him.

                                 DAISY
                        But I mean, don’t get me wrong, I
                        also hate swimming.

                                 ALEX
                        I know.

                                 DAISY
                        It ruined my life.

                                 ALEX
                        Temporarily.

           He has such a faith in her she believes it.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           A PEELING WHITE FENCE stops people from tumbling down the
           steep, eroded hill. She hoists a leg over it.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 DAISY
                        Come on.

                                 ALEX
                        Wait, there’s a trail that leads to
                        the beach-

                                 DAISY
                        No time-

                                 ALEX
                        -No way.

                                 DAISY
                        If you’re going to get to Mars then
                        you can also get down this cliff.

                                 ALEX
                        No.

           She swings the other leg over.

                                 DAISY
                        Come on Alexander the Great.

                                 ALEX
                        No.

                                 DAISY
                        Trust me.

           With a smirk, she disappears, SQUEALING, SKIDDING - and then
           unwittingly SLIDING - down the enormous dune.

           He waits, hesitates, um’s and ah’s, until:

                                 ALEX
                        Fuck it.

           And he follows. SCREAMING...more than he’d probably like.

           After reaching the bottom, he races after her.

           Daisy RUNS into the surf, sun beaming down on her back, not
           caring about anything except the water. She lets the waves
           crash over her. It makes him happy to see her happy.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 DAISY
                        Alex!

           He BOUNDS in, dodging the waves en route to her. She’s a
           little over waist deep, where they break.

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        Let them hit you.

                                 ALEX
                        What?

                                 DAISY
                        I used to love doing it when I was
                        younger.

                                 ALEX
                        Why?

           They duck under a wave. Surface.

                                 DAISY
                              (insistent)
                        Because.

           Another wave is approaching-

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        Let it hit you.

           She backs away from him. Holds out her arms to the wave.

           Alex reluctantly turns to face it. It CRASHES into them.
           They’re both thrown around in the surf. It’s exhilarating.

           Another wave BREAKS. She’s flung down. He helps her up.
           Instinctively, he brushes her hair off her face.

           He blinks. He loves her.

           He blinks again. Oh shit, he loves her.

           Then BAM, they’re thrown by another wave. She SHRIEKS.

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Neat houses in neat rows. Daisy and Alex approach one,
           though the lawn needs mowing and the rafters some paint.

                                 DAISY
                        You’ve really never met Curtis?

                        We’re two hours from your house.

                        Oh, we should meet Curtis then.

           EXT. CURTIS’ HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           She laughs and rings the DOORBELL. It swings open.

                                 CURTIS
                        Hey hey!

           They embrace. Curtis notes Alex’s MISSION MARS shirt. He
           wears a similar one.

                                 CURTIS (CONT’D)
                        Nice!

                        Sorry, this is Daisy.

                        What insurance agency do you work
                        for? I’m thinking of switching.

           He WINKS at Alex. Daisy does not like it.

           INT. CURTIS’ HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

                        Welcome to mi casa!

           A CHILD CRIES upstairs. Another RUNS past, followed by a
           very nice but very tired looking WOMAN, who stops.

                                 TIFFANY
                        I’m Tiffany. Sorry for the ruckus.

           Tiffany glances at the logo on Alex’s shirt.

                                 TIFFANY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, you’re a colonist.

                                 CURTIS
                        He’ll be waving down at you, too!

           She looks at Daisy. A desperately cheery warning:

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        I thought it was just a phase!

           A BLUR of a child zooms past again.

                                 TIFFANY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry - I better get him.

           She disappears. Curtis slaps Alex on the arm.

                                 CURTIS
                        Best part about Mars is the no kids
                        policy, am I right?

           He LAUGHS LOUDLY and leads them through, sliding open the
           back door to reveal a shed in the corner of the yard.

           INT. CURTIS’ SHED - DAY

           Computer monitors. A stereo with the volume on high. A couch
           with a pillow and Curtis-sized indent. A mini fridge.

           He turns on SPACESHIP by Kanye West.

                                 DAISY
                        Your wife is nice.

                        Yeah, Tiff’s great. Sit, sit.

           They gingerly perch on the couch. Daisy is not impressed.

                                 CURTIS (CONT’D)
                        It’s good to meet you properly, my

                        training start? I’m ready to go!

           He holds his hand out for a high five. Alex HALF FIVES it.

           A KNOCKING on the door.

                                 CHILD
                        Daddy!

           Curtis leans over and turns the music up.

           INT. ALEX’S CAR - DAY

           Alex drives in a stunned silence. He nervously glances over
           at Daisy a few times but she just gazes out the window.

                                 ALEX
                        Curtis is very intelligent. He
                        published a paper several years ago
                        on the topic of solar flares on

           He doesn’t have anything else. She turns his CD Player on.

           It’s SPACE ODDITY by David Bowie. She switches it off.

           And then she turns back to him:

           the keys and follows.

           He sighs, hands in his pockets, all defenses up.

                                 ALEX
                        Can we talk about this later? When

                                 DAISY
                        No way. You let all these things
                        churn inside of you and you don’t
                        acknowledge them and you don’t let
                        anyone else acknowledge them and it
                        isn’t healthy and I won’t

                        died last year, but you still can’t

                        That’s a happy thing and you still
                        won’t acknowledge it. And the
                        stupid thing is I like you too, and
                        we have to pretend it isn’t
                        happening because it doesn’t fit

                        I thought we weren’t dating.

                        the beach because we’re buddies.

           He watches a SQUIRREL run down a tree and onto the road,
           picking at something on the asphalt. It seems to glance up
           at him. Then it turns to face an oncoming CAR. Frozen.

           Right before the car makes contact, it LEAPS out of the way
           and runs back into the forest past him.

                        Well...have a swell night.

           She smiles a weak smile.

           There’s a moment where he hesitates. Wanting to reach out to
           her. But he just nods and drives away.

           INT. MCALLISTER HOUSE - ALEX’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Alex’s alarm BUZZES. It’s promptly THROWN across the room.

           MUSIC: SPACE ODDITY by David Bowie.

           He passes the computer. Curtis is CALLING. It goes ignored.

           INT. MCALLISTER HOUSE - ALEX’S BATHROOM - DAWN

           Unwashed Mission Mars T-shirt on, he addresses his mirror:

           He does jumping jacks. Push ups. Puts his earphones in.

                        Sorry I left you all to die.

           And he runs. Angrily. Tearing through the forest. Purposely
           STOMPING on whatever CRUNCHES and bypassing the town.

                                 ALEX (V.O.)

                        except overpopulation and
                        commercial breaks...

           Reaching the open plains, he takes off, running as fast as
           he can, the world a blur around him.

           He runs until he can’t go a second longer and COLLAPSES in
           the middle of a field.

           He watches a plane pass through the blue sky above him.

           Busted. Liz smiles.

           EXT. BARTLET - TOWN SQUARE - DAY - LATER

           Alex and JEFF cross the festival to JANE, Liz and Dimitri.

           DAVE (40’s) and his FRIEND have spotted Alex and are PUSHING
           through the crowd towards him. They meet at the same time.

                                 DAVE
                        Hey Jeff.

           He shakes hands with Jeff. Everyone knows everyone.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Alex, wanted to have a quick word?

                                 ALEX
                        Sure.

                                 DAVE
                        I’ve been told you’re talking at
                        the school again.

                                 ALEX
                        Looks like it.

                                 DAVE
                        Some of the parents and I wondered
                        if you might reconsider.

                                 ALEX
                        Why?

                                 DAVE
                              (uncomfortable)
                        You know...

                                 ALEX
                        No?

                                 DAVE
                        I mean, it’s not like you’re from
                        the observatory...

                                 ALEX
                        So?

                                 DAVE
                        So I’m all about knowledge and
                        learning but my kid doesn’t need to
                        hear about some scam.

                                 ALEX
                        It’s not a scam.

                                 DAVE
                        Come on, he thinks he knows an
                        astronaut, for God’s sake. He
                        thinks he’s going to follow in your
                        footsteps!

                                 JEFF
                        And last week he thought he was in
                        World War II. I don’t think any
                        harm has been done here.

                                 DAVE
                        There is if he believes it can
                        happen. If he becomes deluded like-

           He stops himself on Jeff’s look, but Alex understands. Is
           that what people actually think of him?

           He see’s Daisy in the small crowd around them. She’s heard
           everything. She’s sympathetic. It makes him FURIOUS.

           EXT. MCALLISTER FARM - FIELDS - DAY

           Alex pulls out VIOLETS in a FLOWER KILLING RAGE.

           He KICKS another bunch. Grabs a handful and THROWS THEM as
           far as he can. Petals and leaves FLOAT to the ground, unable
           to keep up as the stalks TORPEDO through the sky.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He stops to catch his breath. Jeff calmly walks out of the
           house. Notes the circle of destruction around Alex.

                                 JEFF
                        You gonna replant those?

           Alex stops.

                                 ALEX
                        Yes.

                                 JEFF
                        Now?

           Beat. Then, begrudgingly:

                                 ALEX
                        Yes.

           Jeff heads back inside-

           INT. MCALLISTER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           -where Liz and Dimitri have been watching.

                        It’s really good that he’s angry,

           EXT. MCALLISTER FARM - FIELDS - DAY - LATER

           Alex rakes the destroyed flowers, leaving the ground barren.

           EXT. MCALLISTER FARM - FIELDS - LATER

           He’s on his hands and knees, pulling out damaged bulbs and
           replacing them with fresh ones.

           Dimitri comes to help, digging to coerce debris out.

                        came here never intending to
                        return. I came to America to die in
                        America. Ideally after many more
                        years. But that’s my truth. I did
                        it and it’s not easy but people
                        have always done these things and I

                        have to be sure. That’s all.

           Alex is quiet.

           EXT. MCALLISTER FARM - BARN - DUSK - LATER

           Alex lies on the roof, tired and dirty.

                                 LIZ
                              (from below)

                                 LIZ
                        I can see his feet.

           The feet disappear and suddenly he’s peering down at Liz.

                        Can I come up?

                        The roof might collapse with two
                        people on it.

           He watches as she disappears into the barn. A few moments
           later she can be heard CLIMBING the ladder.

           He goes to the hole and pulls her up.

                                 LIZ
                        I haven’t been up here in so long.

           As she surveys the land spread out around them, he lies back
           down, looking up at the stars. She sits beside him.

                        Killed enough flowers for one day?

                        Every time I look at you I see
                        Chris. Then I imagine you dying as

                        need colossal amounts of therapy to

           Something is resonating with him.

                        Look, mom and dad are their own
                        people and they can handle things
                        how they like, but I get angry
                        because I care. I can’t face losing
                        another brother and that’s exactly
                        what they’re letting happen with
                        you. We’re losing you.

                        I thought there was something wrong

           Back from his run, Alex picks up a stack of mail. Under it

           There’s a YELLING outside. He looks out to see her in the
           fields, wearing farm clothes and helping Dimitri. Dimitri
           says something and she throws her head back and laughs.

           He spots a Mission Mars logo on one of the envelopes.

                        That’s where I want to work!

                        Good! Tell your dad that!

           They are lying on chairs that have been turned horizontal,
           to better mimic a space shuttle launch. Alex is on board.

                                 EVAN
                        Houston, we are ready for launch.

                                 ALEX
                        Roger that.

                                 EVAN
                        Lift off in 10, 9, 8, 7-

           As the boys madly flip imaginary launch buttons, Alex looks
           through the railing and sees Daisy walking below.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        6, 5, 4-

           He’s conflicted. He wants to call out.

           A stream of BLAST OFF and FIRE noises courtesy of the
           astronauts. Alex takes part, BUMPING his chair around.

           A series of WHOOPS as they celebrate a successful launch.

                        We did it, son.

           Apparently, Brad Pitt’s made it onto the shuttle, too.

           Alex grins. This might be enough.

           INT. MCALLISTER HOUSE - ALEX’S BEDROOM - DAY

           He paces, looking at the Space Station stream, the Mission
           Mars forums, the unopened letter...

           INT. MCALLISTER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           The family and Dimitri eat breakfast. Jane cleans the pans.
           Liz gets up and steers her to the table.

                                 LIZ
                        Stop! Don’t move. I’m doing it.

           Jane tries to resist but Liz has already taken over.

           Alex sticks his head in:

                                 ALEX
                        Mom, do you know where my suit is?
                        The grey one?

                                 JANE
                        The hall closet.

           Alex disappears. She and Liz exchange looks. He bounds back
           in a moment later, suit in hand.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m going to the dry cleaners, if
                        anyone wants me to take anything.

                                 LIZ
                        What’s the occasion?

                                 ALEX
                        Getting my suit dry cleaned.

                                 LIZ
                        Thank you. I meant why.

                                 ALEX
                        I have a job interview.

           More glances. Rising hope.

                              (fiddling with the suit)
                        The Vermont Space Grant Consortium.
                        They have some impressive resources
                        - I was surprised - plus they
                        expressed interest in my project-

                                 DIMITRI
                        The Germinator!

                                 ALEX
                        Still not calling it that. I don’t
                        know. They’re run by NASA, so-

           He shrugs, aiming for nonchalance.

                                 JANE
                              (tentatively)
                        That’s great, honey. And the
                        mission is OK with it?

                                 ALEX
                        Well, I was thinking of just
                        concentrating on this.

           A COMMUNAL GASP that ripples round the table. And then
           silence as they all look hesitantly to Jeff.

                                 JEFF
                              (genuine)
                        I think that’s a great idea.
                        Really. Much better than mine.

           The group attempts not to EXPLODE from complete and utter
           joy. Liz breaks first, reaching out and grabbing his arm:

                                 LIZ
                        It is great.

                                 JANE
                        Wonderful.

                                 ALEX
                        It’s just an interview.

                                 LIZ
                        It’s still great.

                        It was great when Daisy suggested
                        it, too.

           All eyes are back on Alex.

                                 ALEX
                        I don’t remember that.

                                 DIMITRI
                        Yes, remember she was like "they’ll
                        give you funding" and you were like
                        "no thanks, I’m fine in my
                        greenhouse?"

                              (Yep)
                        No.

           More furtive glances. More hope.

                                 LIZ
                        I always liked her.

                                 JANE
                        So did I.

                                 JEFF
                        Me too.

                                 DIMITRI
                        I like anyone who likes The
                        Germinator.

                              (grumbling)
                        Ok, I get it, you all like Daisy.

                                 LIZ
                        They’re just observations.

           He grabs the keys and heads out the door:

                                 ALEX
                        Bye!

           EXT. MCALLISTER FARM - FIELDS - DAY

           They’re installing a new watering system along a flower row.
           Dimitri SINGS along to his stereo. A JAZZY SONG begins:

                        Or is Frank Sinatra an American
                        Vladimir Krestovozdvizhensky?

           He sings the lyrics in English over Vladimir.

                                 DIMITRI (CONT’D)
                        There was something in the sky that
                        night, there was something in the
                        air like light, there’s a magical
                        spark like breaking car parts-
                              (he pauses)
                        That sounds more romantic in
                        Russian...

           Alex stops. He grins and shakes his head.

                                 ALEX
                        God dammit.

                        What? It’s not that bad.

                                 ALEX
                        It sounds like he’s talking about
                        fireflies.

                                 DIMITRI
                        No it doesn’t, we don’t even have

           They prepare soil.

           And plant seeds. Dimitri is singing again.

           EXT. MCALLISTER FARM - FIELDS - LATER

           Daisy stands before Alex. Skeptical.

           And Alex’s grand gesture: a field of brown dirt.

                                 ALEX
                        I know you can’t tell but they’re

           She surveys her seeds.

           Liz and Dimitri are "picking flowers" nearby. They are the
           most suspiciously silent they have ever been.

                        -and this is terrifying. I’m

                        sudden. He was one of the only
                        things I thought was a constant in
                        my life, but in a second he wasn’t
                        there anymore. And I have to wake
                        up every morning and remember that.
                        And I’m scared, I’m so scared, of
                        it happening to anyone else I love.
                              (looking at the ground)
                        I’m scared of it happening to you.

           She’s touched.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        So that’s how I know this is the
                        real adventure. For me.
                              (he frowns as she smiles)
                        That’s corny.

                                 DAISY
                        Sure is.

                                 ALEX
                        But you know what I mean.

                                 DAISY
                        I do.

           He moves closer and strokes her cheek. He goes to brush her
           hair back when Jeff saunters out:

                                 JEFF
                        What have you got there?

                                 ALEX
                        Daisies.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 JEFF
                        Weeds, huh?

                                 ALEX
                        Couldn’t really do roses...

           Jeff glances over at Daisy, with the hint of a smile:

                                 JEFF
                        As it happens, I rather like them.
                              (unable to help himself)
                        Though keep them separated from the
                        rest of the fields.

                                 LIZ
                              (from her flower picking)
                        Dad, go away!

           He leaves and Alex turns back to Daisy.

                                 DAISY
                        Forever a weed.

           He reaches out to her again. She hesitates.

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        What about Mars?

           He stops, thinks - he’s got it.

                                 ALEX
                        There are no daisies on Mars.

                                 DAISY
                              (laughing)
                        Wow. Did you rehearse that?

                                 ALEX
                        Actually, it just came to me.

                                 DAISY
                        Well, you nailed it.

                                 ALEX
                        Really?

                                 DAISY
                        Really.

           And in the middle of a field of dirt, with the sun shining
           down and the wind blowing through the fields, he looks at
           her. Finally out of words and hesitations and apprehensions
           and deliberations, he pulls her close and kisses her.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Liz jumps up and down, CLAPPING.

                                 DIMITRI
                        Yes. Now we die here together.

           He pulls his shirt over his head and runs around the field,
           as if scoring a soccer goal. Liz is suddenly distracted.

           OVER BLACK:

                                 ALEX (V.O.)
                        This is Mars.

           VISUAL: the projector’s image of Mars.

                        This will be the first colony on
                        Mars.

                        For 210 days, people will travel
                        there in this.

           CLICK. A shuttle.

                                 ALEX (V.O.)
                        Then this will be their home.

           CLICK. The white dots are pods, connected by hallways.

           Beat.

                                 ALEX (V.O.)
                        But I will be here.

           ZOOM IN: An apartment he shares with Daisy.

                                 ALEX (V.O.)
                        This is where I sleep. Where I eat.
                        Work. Play.

           FAST CUTS: A comfortable bedroom, a kitchen with two
           discarded mugs, a lab at the consortium where a high-tech
           version of his machine is worked on. Alex showing children
           the stars. Daisy teaching the same children how to swim.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Machu Picchu.

                        Grow old, and live.

           VISUAL: Him hiking with Daisy. The sun cutting through the
           trees. Them on top of a mountain. Her touch on his skin.

           Then, more satisfied, as we zoom out to show the earth:

                                 ALEX (V.O.)
                        This is where I live.
