           NORM GOLDWORM (30s), a man so proudly uncomfortable with his 
           own skin, lies in bed looking up at nothing.

           He sits up and pulls out a notebook from the night stand.  It 
           reads on the cover in black marker “WEIRD DREAMS BOOK.”

           He flips it open and writes: “896. I dreamt I danced with a 
           beautiful woman.  Weird.”  He underlines weird a few times.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                 NORM (V.O.)
                        Definition of Life...

                                 NORM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Life is a biological condition... 

           NORM downs a few prescription pills from his medicine cabinet.

                        But may also refer to 
                        phenomenological life...

           NORM, in business attire, walks down a busy New York street.

                        Personal life...

           NORM sits in a cubicle, blankly staring at his computer.

                                 NORM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        A biography...

           NORM sits outside by a water fountain, eating a sandwich.

                                 NORM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        A life bar-- used in videogames to 
                        indicate how many life points a 
                        character has...

           NORM takes a dump in the office bathroom while playing on his 
           Iphone. Someone TRIES his stall which makes him JUMP.

                                                           END MONTAGE:

           INT. RIPLEY’S TAVERN - NIGHT

           NORM reads Wikipedia search results off his Iphone.
                                 NORM
                        And life imprisonment, often 
                        shortened to "life."

           Last definition doesn’t sit so well.  He puts away his Iphone
           with a quiet growl of discontent and does a shot of Jameson.  

           He continues to nurse a Jack and Diet.  A witnessing bystander 
           could argue the Jack and Diet is nursing him.

           IN THE CORNER
           A BAD KARAOKE SINGER wails the pop tune “Dreams” by Gabrielle.

                                 BAD KARAOKE SINGER
                        Dreams can come true, Look at me babe 
                        I'm with you, You know you gotta have 
                        hope, You know you gotta be strong,
                        Dreams can come true...

                                 NORM
                             (scoffs cynically to 
                              himself)
                        Dreams can’t come true.  Stupid.

           Sufficiently drunk and disgusted, Norm stands to leave when...

           An ATTRACTIVE WOMAN sits next to him.  She is precision 
           beauty, a genuine breath taker sans self-awareness.  

           He decides to sit back down to the confusion of the BARTENDER.  
           Norm quickly chugs his full glass of drink, then raises it.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Barkeep, another Jack and Diet.

           The BARTENDER reluctantly complies with odd hesitation. 

           Norm peers over at the attractive woman and the alcohol’s 
           powers channels the otherwise elusive courage to speak.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        I’m Norm.

           She completely ignores him, preferring to blankly stare into 
           the nothingness in front of her.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Did you not hear me?

           Again, nothing.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Oh, I see, my apologies.  You’re 
                        hearing impaired...
           He waves his hand in front of her just as the BARTENDER 
           delivers Norm his drink.  He glances at Norm suspiciously.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        It’s okay, I think she’s deaf.

           He says nothing and walks away.

           Norm taps the woman on her shoulder.  Still nothing.  

           He accepts the possibility this could be an unusual form of 
           rejection.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Are you pretending I don’t exist?

           We’re talking no response at all.

           Norm recoils to his corner, claiming defeat.  However, for 
           lack of anyone else around and his drunkenness, he presses on. 

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Norm Goldworm is my full given name.  
                        It’s a pretty funny name, I usually 
                        get a chuckle every time I tell 
                        people.
                             (no response, no chuckle)
                        Truth is I hate my name.  My 
                        therapist says it’s because I’m stuck 
                        in between my quarter and mid-life 
                        crisis, so there’s that...
                             (no response)
                        Interesting factoid about me: for 
                        some reason I can’t speak in a 
                        British accent.
                             (in a really bad British 
                              accent)
                        Hello love, your face makes me randy, 
                        do you have a fag I can suck on?

           He shakes his head, embarrassed by his unintentional phrasing.  

           He stands up and puts a napkin over his drink.

           OUTSIDE PATIO - MOMENTS LATER

           Norm wobbles as he attempts to stand.  He’s SLOSHED.

                                 SALLY’S VOICEMAIL (V.O.)
                        This is Sally.  Leave a peep at the 
                        beep, creep!

           BEEP.  Disgruntled, Norm hangs up.
           BAR - LATER

           Norm returns to his seat.  The woman still sits there, 
           drinking alone.  

           Norm continues his already-in-progress-one-way conversation:

                                 NORM 
                        I’ve had one of those lives, let me 
                        tell ya.  The doctors removed a 
                        peculiar cyst that developed on my 
                        left ass cheek a week ago.  

           HOSPITAL (FLASHBACK) - DAY

           Norm, in a hospital gown, lays on his side while a TEAM OF 
           DOCTORS work on his ass.

                                 HEAD DOCTOR
                             (chuckles at the sight)
                        Ain’t this the stuff of nightmares?
                             (to Norm)
                        It’s benign, don’t worry.  Big as a 
                        golf ball though.  This might tickle 
                        a touch.

           Pain surges through Norm’s ass.  He SCREAMS.

           OFFICE (FLASHBACK) - DAY

           Norm pensively sits in his cubicle while on the phone.

                                 NORM (V.O.)
                        Found out my mom is dying.

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                             (flatly)
                        Your mother is dying.

                                 NORM
                        Oh my God.  Can anything be done?

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                             (defensive)
                        What?  No.  She’s dying.

           BAR (PRESENT DAY)

                                 NORM
                        Tonight’s my birthday and the one 
                        person that even agreed to have a 
                        drink with me bailed.  And somewhere 
                        in the malaise I surmised that I have 
                        no life... Anyway, how about a 
                        birthday clink for yours truly...
           He raises his drink for a birthday clink.  Nothing.

           He goes to clink her glass sitting on the bar, but she picks 
           it up first and takes a sip, ignoring him completely.

           This woman is really making things plain weird.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        If you’re worried that I’m hitting on 
                        you, know that my heart is set on 
                        someone else.  There’s a girl I’ve 
                        been in love with since high school, 
                        Sally Wind...

           GRAPHIC: A flurry of Sally Wind pictures fly by.  It goes 
           super fast and lands on a picture of Norm and Sally; he looks 
           at her lovingly and she’s giving him a distant buddy pat.

           BAR - CONTINUOUS

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Except she doesn’t know it because 
                        every time I try to tell her I go 
                        into a nervous cry.  
                             (puts his hand up)
                        Fear not, for I have made a promise 
                        to myself to tell her how I feel by 
                        the end of this week.

           THERAPIST ROOM (FLASHBACK) - DAY

           Norm lies down on a therapist’s sofa and looks up.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Doc, I’ve decided to make a promise 
                        to myself...to tell Sally how I 
                        really feel about her.  This week.

           His face melts into overwhelming fear. On the verge of crying:

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        I wanna shed a million tears. 

           BAR (PRESENT DAY) - CONTINUOUS

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        I get the same way about flying.  
                        Deathly afraid of planes.  If you ask 
                        me, it’s the people who aren’t afraid 
                        of flying who are weird, you know?

           No, she doesn’t know and thus, doesn’t respond.  

           Norm downs his drink and raises his glass for another.  The 
           Barkeep hesitantly obliges.  Norm is getting wasted.
                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, I was supposed to tell Sally 
                        tonight but perhaps on the way here 
                        she bumped into a much better looking 
                        man, a Robin Thicke type.

           Upon saying this, Norm dreadfully realizes it might be true.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        This is actually cathartic for me, to 
                        talk so openly to a stranger like 
                        this.  It feels good, like I ripped 
                        someone off on ebay. Did I tell you 
                        I work for an online dictionapedia?  
                        It’s very rewarding.  Definitions, in 
                        a way, are the final say on the true 
                        meanings of life.  To think that any 
                        idea, thing, or feeling witnessed by 
                        the human experience has been jotted 
                        down... well, words can’t really 
                        describe it.

           He laughs at his own ironic witticism.  She does not.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        You’re right, not laugh out loud, 
                        more of an internal smile-- a smirk 
                        of the soul if you will.

           Nope.  Nada. Zilch.  Absolutely nothing.  Norm presses on.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        I do have another friend.  A male 
                        comrade by the name of Reynold.  He’s 
                        very overweight.  Ever since his 
                        girlfriend Jessica died, he’s turned 
                        into sort of a recluse...

           INT. REYNOLD’S APARTMENT (FLASHBACK)

           REYNOLD, a portly man with no shirt, smokes a cigarette as he 
           watches “Bring it On” on his small iBook in his pig sty of an 
           apartment.

           Kirsten Dunst cheers and she is hot.

                                 REYNOLD
                             (picks his ear)

                                 NORM
                        I can tell he doesn’t even like me 
                        that much but no one’s dying to be 
                        friends with him either so... I got 
                        the upper hand in that relationship.

           Norm somberly takes in his own life’s review with a smile.

           Another huge swig, but the Jack SPILLS over his mouth.  The 
           embarrassing visage is too much to take.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        I see your point now.  I would ignore 
                        me too.  Why would you give me the 
                        time of day, you’re beautiful...

           He looks at her.  Really looks at her.  She is breathtaking.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        ... almost impossibly so.

           Norm swallows his self-respect.  He’s a sad sack.

           The woman’s eyes blink and GLANCE over at him, for the first 
           time acknowledging him.  She licks her lips, about to say 
           something...

           CRASH!  Drunk out of his mind, our Norm FALLS TO THE FLOOR.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           Norm wakes up in his small New York apartment.  His face wears 
           the same sad expression owned by the night before.  He yawns.

           He sits up and slaps his face to wake himself up.

           BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Norm is now in the shower, naked.  He SHRIEKS and JUMPS OUT 
           quickly.  He spins around, unsure of how he got there.

           Something is strange... Even for Norm.  He looks in the mirror 
           and washes out his eyes.  Perhaps a dream?  

           With a shrug, he opens his medicine cabinet for his daily pill 
           popping routing.  Before taking the first one, he turns the 
           bottle around.  
           It reads: “DO NOT MIX WITH ALCOHOL.”  Next to it: BADLY DRAWN 
           FACE WITH EYES BULGING OUT.

           Norm BURPS and smells the alcohol on his breath.  Better to 
           play it safe and not take the pills.  He puts it away.

           He brushes his teeth.  A few seconds go by WHEN--

           UPPITY MOVIE SCORE begins playing from nowhere.  His eyes dart 
           around.  What the F?

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           INT. SUBWAY - LATER

           Norm is now dressed in a business suit, standing in a crowded 
           subway car.  The uppity music score continues.

           He TWIRLS around, CONFUSED AS HELL.  

           Norm reacts to every cut in the movie as a jump in his life.

                                 NORM
                        I was just in my bathroom?

           A HOMELESS PERSON nods and creepily smiles.  

                                 HOMELESS PERSON
                        As was I, my son.  

           He puts his hand on his shoulder.

                                 HOMELESS PERSON (CONT'D)
                             (ominous)
                        As was I.

           Everyone inches away from the creepy homeless person and Norm.  
           The uppity music continues to play.  Norm looks around, 
           searching for the source.

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           He is now in the throes of a New York crowd bustling down the 
           street.  Due to his jump, he stops short to the CURSES AND 
           GROANS of his fellow New Yorkers.

           Norm takes a moment and collects himself.

                                 NORM
                             (mutters to himself)
                        This has gotta be a dream.
           He shrugs off his confusion and walks with the crowd.  The 
           uppity score continues to play, encouraging him to walk.

           Norm asks everyone around him:

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Does anyone else hear that music?

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           Norm is now being shoved out of the elevator onto his floor. 
           Again, Norm is befuddled by the cut.  

           The music dies down.  His cell RINGS.  He answers quickly.

                                 NORM
                        Hello?

                                 SALLY (O.S.)
                        Norm?  I know I didn’t show, I’m 
                        sorry.  Happy Birthday!

                                 NORM
                        Sally?

                                 SALLY (O.S.)
                        Why are you being weird?

                                 NORM
                        I don’t see how I’m being weird, but 
                        something weird is going on.

                                 SALLY (O.S.)
                        Are you still on Percocet from your 
                        ass surgery?  It’s probably the 
                        Percocet. They have weird side 
                        effects.  My mom was high off it once 
                        and woke me up in the middle of the 
                        night to sing the entire Abbey Road 
                        album to me.  You would like that 
                        album Norm.  It’s strange and sweet 
                        like your face.

                                 NORM
                        I don’t think it’s Percocet. I’ve 
                        been jumping.

                                 SALLY (O.S.)
                        I don’t understand, you mean up and 
                        down?
                                 NORM
                        No, not literally jumping.  Time 
                        jumping.  One second I’m by my bed, 
                        the next I’m in the shower, then I’m 
                        in the subway, then I’m walking down 
                        the street.

                                 SALLY (O.S.)
                        Naked?  Hold on, I’m on YouTube, if 
                        you were, it’s probably already on 
                        here.  I slept with a guy who works 
                        there, he can delete it for me... 
                        Unless you want me to leave it up?  
                             (beat)
                        Do you want me to leave it up Norm?

           Norm searches the hallways for the source of the uppity music.

                                 NORM
                        There’s music, like an orchestral 
                        score playing.

                                 SALLY (O.S.)
                        That cute black Israelite on 10th 
                        street that plays the Schindler’s
                        List soundtrack? God I love that 
                        score.  I used to listen to that CD 
                        after every break-up in Junior High.  
                        It was like my own personal holocaust 
                        everyday... everyday.

                                 NORM
                        Why are you answering everything with 
                        a clever quip?

                                 SALLY (O.S.)
                        What?  Norm, you’re not making any 
                        sense.  I’m always clever.

           DENTON, a nerdy co-worker, walks up to Norm.

                                 DENTON
                        Norm, we’re late for the staff 
                        meeting.

                                 NORM
                             (into the phone)
                        Sally, can we pick this up later?

                                 SALLY (O.S.)
                        Pick what up?  You’re still being 
                        weird.  I’ll come by your apartment 
                        tonight.  Toodles!

           Norm hangs up and shoots Denton a crazed look.
                                 NORM
                        Denton... Is this real?  Or is this a 
                        dream?

                                 DENTON
                             (taking this question way 
                              too seriously)
                        Hmmm... I will study this brain 
                        teaser and have an answer by noon if 
                        that’s acceptable?

                                 NORM
                        What?  No, I meant--

           Norm lets a SIGH subside his fears.  

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get to that staff meeting.

           He walks with Denton, anticipating and fearing another jump.

           Maybe it’s okay now.  He picks up the pace, irrationally 
           racing away from the invisible nightmare.

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Norm, again shocked by the JUMP/CUT, looks around the 
           conference room filled with his co-workers.  

           His boss, a mean Bill Gates-esque named RICHARD WINCHELL, 50s, 
           is at the head looking over finances.  He eyes Norm who seems 
           discombobulated.

                                 RICHARD
                        Goldworm!

           Norm tenses up.

                                 NORM
                        Yes?

                                 RICHARD
                        Are you going to answer the question?

                                 NORM
                        A question?  I’m sorry Richard I must 
                        have missed it.

                                 RICHARD
                        Have you been paying attention to 
                        anything at all in this meeting?
                                 NORM
                        To be honest Richard, I haven’t.  I’m 
                        not feeling well today.  I think I 
                        might be sick.  I think it might be a 
                        memory disorder.  I took ecstasy a 
                        few years ago.  I’m not sure what I’m 
                        saying right now.

           His co-workers look away, not wanting to witness the impending 
           doom.  Richard leans back, locks his fingers together.  

                                 RICHARD
                        Goldworm, did you know it has been a 
                        long held fantasy of mine to find the 
                        one thing you care about most in this 
                        world and destroy it?

           This doesn’t shock anyone.  They’ve clearly heard this before.

                                 NORM
                             (shaky voice)
                        You’ve shared that with me before, 
                        yes.

                                 RICHARD 
                        I hate you and what you represent.  
                        But not the kind of hate that a nerd 
                        has toward a schoolyard bully, no, 
                        that’s too pedestrian.  This is a 
                        special, purer kind of hate usually 
                        reserved for child pornographers and 
                        socialists.  If you have to take the 
                        rest of the day off, then take the 
                        day off.  But don’t tongue me in the 
                        ear while you pinch the toosh of the 
                        guy next to you.  

           THE GUY NEXT TO NORM shakes his head and whispers:

                                 THE GUY NEXT TO NORM
                        Don’t.  Not interested.

           Richard SLAMS his fist on the table to mark his final plea.

                                 RICHARD
                        Sell human empathy somewhere else, 
                        I’m trying to run a motherhuggin’
                        company.

           Startled by the odd use of the word, Norm looks up.

                                 NORM
                        Sorry, I’m just... what’d you say?  
                        Motherhugger?
           Everyone in the room GASPS.  Richard licks his lips, thinking 
           he’s in for a challenge.

                                 RICHARD
                             (defensive)
                        You flippin’ callin’ me a 
                        motherhugger now?

                                 NORM
                        Flippin’? Why are you talking like 
                        that?  Are you trying to say flip?

           Except Norm didn’t say flip, he said fuck.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Why am I saying flip when I’m 
                        supposed to be saying flip?

           Norm stands up, perplexed more than ever.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        This must be a dream.  I have to see 
                        my therapist.

           He RUSHES OUT of the room in a panic.

           Denton CHUCKLES, thinking he’s solved the brain teaser.

                                 DENTON
                        Oh, I see, so this is a dream.

           INT. DR. NORTON’S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - LATER

           Norm is now transported to his therapist’s waiting room.  A TV 
           PLAYS A REPEATING AD FOR DR. NORTON’S BOOK.

           ON TV:

           DR. NORTON, 60s and gray-haired, sits in a chair pretending to 
           read his book.  He stops to look into the camera.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Why hello!  I didn’t notice you were 
                        there.  
                             (fake chuckle)
                        I bet that’s how you feel all the 
                        time, isn’t it?  Walking about life, 
                        invisible to your friends and family.  
                        Thinking you’re not so special.
                             (his fake smile fades)
                        The truth is you’re not.  You see, 
                        we’re all born into the biochemical 
                        prisons of our minds and bodies that 
                        impose certain limitations on our 
                        lives.  
                                 DR. NORTON (CONT'D)
                        A lot of hogwash out there claim that 
                        you can be special and escape these 
                        genetic walls, but the fact is it’s 
                        simply impossible. That’s why I’ve 
                        come up with this...

           He lifts up his book, showing the title “UNDERSTANDING YOUR 
           LIFE’S PRISON CELL.”

                                 DR. NORTON (CONT'D)
                        Understanding your life’s prison 
                        cell.  Rather than being disappointed 
                        time and time again by living in some 
                        lofty denial that you can be more 
                        than the sum of your genetic parts, 
                        accept your mind and body for what 
                        they are.  The better you understand 
                        your life’s prison cell, the better 
                        you can understand you, and the freer 
                        you will be.

           HAPPY PEOPLE RUNNING in a grassy field.  Pull back to reveal 
           they’re in a huge prison cell in the middle of a park.  

           GRAPHIC appears: “UNDERSTAND YOUR LIFE’S PRISON CELL TODAY.”

           The video repeats itself.

           THE CHEERY RECEPTIONIST shouts out:

                                 CHEERY RECEPTIONIST
                        Mr. Goldworm!

           Shocked by the sudden voice, Norm SCREAMS... For awhile... 
           then it drops off as he realizes he’s embarrassed himself.

           He stops and walks past the SHOCKED PATIENTS waiting in the 
           room and goes up to the receptionist.

                                 CHEERY RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
                             (with a fake smile)
                        Next time, please try to remember to 
                        scream on the inside.  Okay?

           THERAPIST ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Norm jerks at the cut.  He’s now laying on Dr. Norton’s couch.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        You okay, Norm?  You look a little 
                        silly today.

           Norm lies back down on the couch and takes a deep breath.
                                 NORM
                        Please tell me this is a dream.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Dreams are odd, furry monsters, 
                        aren’t they then?  One good way to 
                        tell if this is a dream is by looking 
                        at your watch.  If the characters are 
                        unreadable or odd, that’s a good 
                        indication you’re in one.

           Norm looks at his watch.  Nothing odd about it.

                                 DR. NORTON (CONT'D)
                        Any odd characters?

           Norm lets out a sigh of confusion and shakes his head.

                                 NORM
                        No.  How can this not be a dream?  
                        Nothing is making sense today.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Why don’t you start from the 
                        beginning?  When did things stop 
                        making sense...
                             (patronizing)
                        ... to you?

                                 NORM
                        Last night I was supposed to make 
                        good on the promise to myself to 
                        finally tell Sally Wind how I feel 
                        about her.  I went to a bar after 
                        work because she wanted to buy me a 
                        birthday drink.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Happy belated.  I had no idea.

                                 NORM
                        Actually your office sent me a card, 
                        misspelled my first name too.  Added 
                        a couple of n’s so it read Nnnorm.  
                        Happens a lot, I’ve told you about it 
                        before because it screws up my online 
                        billing.  Regardless, Sally stood me 
                        up, so I got drunk on my own-

                                 DR. NORTON
                        -Drunk you say?  You never get drunk.

                                 NORM
                        I wanted to live a little.
                                 DR. NORTON 
                        But you never live a little.

                                 NORM
                        Can we move on from this?  Thank you.  
                        I remember trying to talk to this 
                        beautiful girl but she completely 
                        ignored me.  It was really bizarre.

                                 DR. NORTON 
                        Come now, is it that unusual for a 
                        woman to be ignoring you at a bar?

                                 NORM
                        You’re right, a thousand thanks for 
                        the spot on perspective.  Anyway, I 
                        woke up this morning.  That’s when 
                        things stopped making sense.  I was 
                        jumping in time.  One second I was in 
                        my apartment, then on the subway, 
                        then at work, like that.

           He SNAPS his fingers.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Please refrain from making sharp 
                        sounds, it makes my office turtle 
                        anxious.

           Sitting in the corner of the office is a LARGE SLEEPY TURTLE. 
           He pops out his head briefly...then returns into his shell.

                                 DR. NORTON (CONT'D)
                        Now then, you don’t recollect getting 
                        on the subway or arriving at work?

                                 NORM
                        No.  And I heard music, like 
                        instrumental score.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        So an auditory hallucination?

                                 NORM
                        And Sally, she was speaking in clever 
                        quips.  Not like usual.  I took 
                        ecstasy three years ago if that 
                        helps.  Does that help?

                                 DR. NORTON
                        No.  Go on.

                                 NORM
                        And here’s something weird: I can’t 
                        say the word flip.
                                 DR. NORTON
                        Flip?

                                 NORM
                        Or shoot, or crud, or funbags. I 
                        can’t swear.  You try it.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        I don’t swear.

                                 NORM
                        Not the point.  I mean I physically 
                        cannot swear.  I go to say the words 
                        and those words come out instead.  
                        It’s gotta be something with my 
                        synapses.  I can’t be sure the 
                        ecstasy wasn’t mixed with something.  
                        You know how drug dealers LOVE doing 
                        that, for cost reasons I’m sure.

           Dr. Norton crosses his legs.  This could be serious.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Did you stop taking your medication?

                                 NORM
                        I skipped it this morning because I 
                        still had some alcohol in my system.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Ah.  There’s our filthy skank.

                                 NORM
                        Skipping one day’s worth of 
                        medication can’t be the source of all 
                        these issues, can it?

                                 DR. NORTON 
                        Perhaps.  I’m going to call a 
                        neurologist friend of mine.  I can 
                        pull a few strings, get him to do an 
                        MRI right away for us.  We’ll see if 
                        there’s something wrong with that 
                        strange little noodle of yours.

           Norm sits up quickly with tremendous glee.

                                 NORM
                        Thank you so mu--

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:
           INT. HOSPITAL - RADIOLOGY LAB - DAY

           Norm, still sitting up from the previous scene, HITS HIS HEAD 
           HARD against the MRI Scanner and is KNOCKED OUT COLD.

           Through the intercom, the neurologist DR. GARZA speaks:

                                 DR. GARZA
                        Mr. Goldworm, please be still or the 
                        MRI will do us no good.

           A HOSPITAL ATTENDANT sees that Norm is unconscious.

                                 HOSPITAL ATTENDANT
                        I think he’s unconscious Dr. Garza.

           Dr. Garza gets extremely angry, then calms himself down.

                                 DR. GARZA
                             (to the attendant in a 
                              forced calm voice)
                        No, this is my fault.  Somehow I led 
                        you to believe I cared about your 
                        thoughts.

           INT. HOSPITAL - RADIOLOGY LAB - XRAY ROOM - LATER

           Norm is now sitting on a cold hospital bed looking at x-rays 
           of his brain.  Dr. Garza is in mid-explanation:

                                 DR. GARZA
                        ... which shows zero indication of 
                        damage in the cerebrum or frontal 
                        lobe... 

           Dr. Garza pauses as he looks at Norm, who is thoroughly 
           confused and playing catch up.

                                 DR. GARZA (CONT'D)
                        Mr. Goldworm, are you okay?

                                 NORM
                        To be fair, I wasn’t really okay 
                        before this, but after this, I think 
                        the word okay decided to give me the 
                        finger and peace the eff out of my 
                        life forever--  There I go again with 
                        the clean swearing.  
                             (shakes his head 
                              disapprovingly)
                        I’m so effed. So very, very effed.

                                 DR. GARZA
                             (not impressed)
                        I see.  
                                 DR. GARZA (CONT'D)
                        You know Mr. Goldworm, I cancelled an 
                        interview with Psychos, Psychos, 
                        Psychos Magazine to come see you as a 
                        personal favor to Dr. Norton.  I 
                        don’t find it amusing that you’re not 
                        paying attention to my diagnosis. 

                                 NORM
                        No, no, it’s not that.  I keep 
                        cutting from one place to another, 
                        and in mid-conversation.  I have no 
                        idea what you’re talking about 
                        because I wasn’t here for the 
                        diagnosis. 

                                 DR. GARZA
                        Mr. Goldworm, you were sitting right 
                        there as I was explaining it to you.  
                        Nurse Linde here can attest.

           NURSE LINDE, a beautiful redhead, sits in a chair nearby with 
           a clipboard in her hand.  She looks up with hesitation.

                                 NURSE LINDE
                        I attest.
                             (unsure of the word 
                              ‘attest’)
                        What do you mean?

                                 NORM
                        I know I was here, but I wasn’t here, 
                        I missed it all.  Last thing I 
                        remember I was in the MRI thingy, 
                        next thing I’m sitting here and 
                        you’ve concluded your diagnosis, thus 
                        methinks me mad.  Did I tell you I 
                        took ecstasy three years ago?  Almost 
                        to the day.  It had a picture of the 
                        Batman symbol on it, if that helps.  
                        Does that help?

           Dr. Garza has had enough.

                                 DR. GARZA
                        Mr. Goldworm, what you are describing 
                        is severe short-term memory loss, 
                        something I assure you my MRI thingy
                        would have caught.  So this is either 
                        a funny little yarn you can bore 
                        someone else with or an extreme case 
                        of psychosomatic hallucinations that 
                        you should take up with Dr. Norton.  
                                 DR. GARZA (CONT'D)
                        Either way, I’d suggest you drink 
                        some warm milk, go home, and take a 
                        good night’s sleep in your bed 
                        thingy.

           With that, Dr. Garza walks away in a huff with his Nurse.

           Norm braces for the cut.

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           EXT. NORM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Norm stands in front of his door in the hallway of his 
           rundown, shitty apartment building.  

           He composes himself, getting used to the cutting.  He notices 
           a NOTE on the door from Sally.  He starts to read:

                                 SALLY (O.S.)
                        Hey Norm!

           Startled by the sound of Sally’s voice, he stops reading and 
           looks around.  The hallways are empty.

                                 NORM
                        Sally?

           Nothing.  He goes back to reading.

                                 SALLY (O.S.)
                        Hey Norm!  Where were--

           He stops again and twirls around like a clumsy ice skater.

                                 NORM
                        Sally!

           Halls are empty.  No Sally.  He looks at the note, realizes 
           what’s happening.  He lets out a deep breath and tries again:

                                 SALLY (O.S.)
                        Hey Norm!  Where were you?!  I had 
                        some bombshell worthy news to air and 
                        you, my best friend, are not here to 
                        receive!  

           He smiles at the note: finally something that makes sense.

           A SACCHARINE PIANO MEDLEY begins playing.  Norm rolls his eyes 
           at the cheesy score.  He looks up at whomever.

                                 NORM
                        If I’m being real with you, it’s a 
                        little on the nose.
           He continues to read:

                                 SALLY (O.S.)
                        I bet you wanna know what the big 
                        secret is?  Well, too bad, so sad!  
                        You’re just going to have to wait 
                        until I can hit you up in person!  
                        Holla, Sally!  XOXOXOXO!  P.S. I 
                        checked, no videos of your naked 
                        person on subways.  I got your 
                        backside partner!

           Norm puts the note away and walks into his apartment.

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           INT. NORM’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Norm drinking a warm glass of milk, but because of the jarring 
           cut, it SPILLS ALL OVER HIS FACE.

           He dries himself off with a nearby kitchen towel.

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           INT. NORM’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           He’s now in bed. He looks around, curls up and shuts his eyes.

                                 NORM
                        Please let this be a dream.  Please.  
                        I already have so much against me, 
                        please don’t add insanity to the 
                        list.  I won’t even complain about my 
                        life being meaningless anymore.  I’ll 
                        gladly accept that over insanity.  
                        Thank you for your understanding.  
                        Yours truly, Norm Goldworm.

           He lets out a hopeful sigh and cuts the lights off.

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           INT. SUBWAY - MORNING

           Norm stands in a subway full of commuters again.  He shakes 
           his head, he can’t believe it.  It’s still happening.  The 
           uppity music score returns.

                                 NORM
                        No!  I was just in my warm bed!

           The commuters stare ahead, attempting to ignore him.  The same 
           HOMELESS PERSON, now wearing a kilt, grabs his attention:
                                 HOMELESS PERSON
                             (Scottish accent)
                        As was I, me lad.

           He goes to put his hand on his shoulder but Norm moves it away 
           and screams like a scared child:

                                 NORM
                        No!

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

           Uppity music continues.  Norm now in the midst of a crowd like 
           before.  He jumps out of the people traffic.

                                 NORM
                        This is impossible.

           Norm pulls out his phone and calls Reynold:

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Reynold, I need your help.  I’m 
                        coming over, okay?! ... It’s Norm, 
                        Norm, how do you not see me on your 
                        caller ID? ... You did, then why did 
                        you ask?  ... It’s not funny to tell 
                        me you hate me, just don’t go 
                        anywhere!  I need your help!

           INT. BLOCKBUSTER - LATER

           REYNOLD is at the checkout, debating between “Can’t Hardly 
           Wait” and “Cruel Intentions.”  There’s a long line behind him.

                                 REYNOLD
                             (to the Store Clerk)
                        You’ve put me in a tough predicament 
                        dear sir.

           Behind him, through the STORE WINDOW, we see Norm out on the 
           street, confused like before, looking inside.

           He BANGS loudly on the window.

                                 NORM
                        Reynold!

           Reynold looks over his shoulder and spots his unstable friend.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Norm?  Why the hell can’t I have 
                        normal friends?
                                 STORE CLERK
                        Hey, aren’t you Jessica’s boyfriend?

           Reynold’s face goes bright red, his anger simmers to a boil.  

                                 REYNOLD
                             (sarcastic)
                        My, how I love it when a douchenozzle
                        reminds me of my dearly, departed 
                        girlfriend.

           A DEEP BREATH keeps him from blowing a gasket.

                                 REYNOLD (CONT’D)
                        Let’s just go with the bigger jugs 
                        before anyone gets hurt.

           He picks out “Can’t Hardly Wait.”  Norm RUSHES up to him as 
           Reynold completes his checkout.

                                 REYNOLD (CONT’D)
                        Norm, does this have something to do 
                        with your pledge to tell Sally Wind 
                        how much you love her?  Cause if it 
                        does, I hate to tell you I told you 
                        so, but let’s face it, why would she 
                        like someone like you--

           Norm puts up his hands.  They begin a walk out the store.

                                 NORM 
                        I need to tell you something, but 
                        it’s going to sound strange.

           EXT. STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Reynold lights a cigarette as they walk down the street.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Strange happens to be my subject of 
                        interest, second only to advanced 
                        poonology of course.  Let’s hear it.

                                 NORM
                        My life, it’s... It’s been moving 
                        fast.  I’ve been jumping.  One second 
                        I’m in bed, the next I’m on the 
                        subway.  I’m hearing music.  Like 
                        this sort of awful uppity music when 
                        I walk down the street.  Or 
                        yesterday, when I was reading this 
                        note from Sally, this awful piano 
                        medley, and the note!  The note!  
                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        When I would read the note, I would 
                        hear Sally’s voice out of nowhere 
                        read the note for me!

           Reynold furrows his eyebrow as he let’s out a FART mid-walk.

                                 REYNOLD
                        I think I’m going to need to smoke 
                        something else to better understand 
                        this situation.

           He pulls out a corn cob from his pocket, stuffs some weed in 
           it, and smokes it like an old, stodgy professor.

                                 REYNOLD (CONT'D)
                        As you were.

                                 NORM
                        What if I’m on the verge of a nervous 
                        breakdown?  Am I going to wind up 
                        being one of those people that needs 
                        religion?

           Reynold takes another puff.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Let’s not throw out all logic just 
                        yet.  When exactly was this bit of 
                        strange birthed?

                                 NORM
                        Yesterday, or the night before, but 
                        to me that was like 25 minutes ago.  
                        That’s how much I’ve been jumping 
                        around.  The whole thing has been a 
                        blurry haze.

           Reynold lifts up his bag of weed.

                                 REYNOLD
                        That happens to be what I’m currently 
                        medicating myself with.

           The label reads “Blurry Haze.”

                                 NORM
                        Wow.  Always a step ahead.

           Reynold clears his throat to pronounce his faux gravitas.

                                 REYNOLD 
                        25 minutes you say?
                                 NORM
                        Yes.  I’ve been to my therapist, I’ve 
                        had an MRI done.  I thought for sure 
                        it was the ecstasy I took three years 
                        ago.  Like a synaptic disorder?

                                 REYNOLD
                             (arrogant)
                        Exactly what I was going to 
                        postulate.  And I didn’t even need a 
                        degree and a fancy MRI machine--

                                 NORM
                        --except the MRI showed nothing.  

           Caught off guard, Reynold puffs on his corn cob.

                                 REYNOLD 
                             (defensive)
                        Well, sure, you need one of those 
                        machines to rule it out, I can’t do 
                        that on my own obviously, I don’t 
                        have superhuman x-ray vision.

                                 NORM
                        No one’s saying you were expected to 
                        have x-ray vision man.

                                 REYNOLD
                             (very defensive)
                        I can only give you my expert advice.  
                        Nothing more, nothing less.

           Reynold regains his composure, then eyes Norm suspiciously.

                                 REYNOLD (CONT’D)
                        You’re still on your meds, right?

                                 NORM 
                        It’s not the EFFIN MEDICATION!

           His clean swearing finally gives Norm the clincher!

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        The swearing!  I can’t swear!  

                                 REYNOLD
                             (appalled)
                        That is unacceptable.  I won’t allow 
                        clean-swearing in my presence, not 
                        while you’re still considered my 
                        effin’ friend!

           Reynold is taken aback by his own clean words.  They both STOP 
           SHORT in the middle of the street.
                                 REYNOLD (CONT'D)
                        Fudge?  Sugar!

           GASP!  Again, taken aback!

                                 REYNOLD (CONT'D)
                        I can’t effin’ swear!  C-sucker, 
                        pearlicker, lick my hairy THUMBS! 
                        Dagnabbit! EAT MY FILTHY SUNRISE!  
                        WHAT THE EFF AM I SAYING?

           Norm smiles.  Finally someone understands.

                                 NORM
                        See?  You can’t freakin’ swear.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Spank me willy...  What the eff have 
                        you done to me?

                                 NORM
                        Something is effin’ effed, and we’ve 
                        gotta freakin’ figure it out before 
                        they eff us right in the f-hole.

           Reynold nervously looks around as PEDESTRIANS walk by.

                                 REYNOLD
                        First of all, if we can’t properly 
                        swear, then let’s not clean-swear, 
                        because we sound like total 
                        starfruits. Let’s go inside.

           INT. REYNOLD’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Same apartment as before, a pig sty.

           Reynold sits in his chair, playing “Can’t Hardly Wait” on his 
           Ibook. He smokes his corncob, deep in thought.

           Norm sits on the filthy couch.  Next to him lies the CARCASS 
           OF A DEAD CAT.

                                 NORM
                        Is that your cat?

                                 REYNOLD
                             (emotional)
                        No, it’s Jessica’s, I haven’t had 
                        time to bury her yet.  Don’t worry, 
                        she won’t bite obviously.

           Norm decides to stand and frenetically pace instead.  

           A EUREKA moment finally hits Reynold.
                                 REYNOLD (CONT’D)
                        Of course!  These guys must think 
                        we’re AMATEURS!

                                 NORM
                        What is it?

                                 REYNOLD
                             (laughing)
                        It’s amateur hour at the Apollo is 
                        what it is.  Who is the number one 
                        public enemy of free speech in this 
                        country?

           Norm doesn’t indulge.

                                 REYNOLD (CONT'D)
                        It’s the government man.  This 
                        technology was bound to come.  
                        They’ve got us wired into their 
                        system.  I bet you it costs them 
                        nothing, ten cents per person at the 
                        most.  The most.

                                 NORM
                             (confused)
                        What costs them ten cents?

                                 REYNOLD
                        That’s the question, isn’t it?  Is it 
                        microchips or robotic bumblebees or 
                        biochemical Honey Combs?  Probably 
                        made in China is what it is.

           Norm doesn’t buy nor understand this theory at all.

                                 NORM
                        Don’t take this the wrong way, but I 
                        don’t think you made any sense, even 
                        to yourself man.

           ON THE IBOOK, “CAN’T HARDLY WAIT” IS PLAYING:

           Girl Whose Party It Is walks around the house party.

                                 GIRL WHOSE PARTY IT IS
                        Oh, wait.  Is that poop?  Someone 
                        have poop on their shoe?  Oh, my God.  
                        Someone has poop on their shoe!

           Like a light bulb going off, Norm beelines to the iBook.

                                 NORM
                        This is interesting...
           He turns up the volume.

           ON THE IBOOK:

           An Asian Girl sits on the sofa, crying to her friend:

                                 ASIAN GIRL
                        And then I heard... that he slept 
                        with some sophomore.

           Norm looks over at Reynold.

                                 NORM
                        On what planet does a hot high school 
                        teenager whose boyfriend just banged 
                        another chick says the phrase “he 
                        slept with some sophomore”?  

           Reynold nods his head knowingly.

                                 REYNOLD
                        She said “slept with” instead of 
                        “flippin’”, I mean “EFF” I mean-- eff
                        me in the orifice--

           Norm puts his hands on Reynold’s shoulders to calm him.

                                 NORM
                        Do you see what I’m saying?

           Reynold wraps his hands around Norm’s shoulder.

                                 REYNOLD
                        You are stuck in a movie!  A bad PG-
                        13 rated movie!

           Their eyes lock for a moment, the improbable theory lingers in 
           the air.  Then logic crashes down on Norm’s face.

                                 NORM
                        Except it’s impossible to be stuck in 
                        a PG-13 movie.

                                 REYNOLD
                        If you’re lucky.  It might even be 
                        PG, in which case, leave me the eff
                        out of it.  I’ve got something that 
                        resembles respect hidden somewhere.

                                 NORM
                        This is impossible.  Let’s go back to 
                        your government theory.  
                             (shakes his head)
                        But that’s so stupid too.
                                 REYNOLD
                        Don’t you see?  You’re in a movie 
                        where anything is possible, that’s 
                        how they get you!

           Norm pulls away and rejects the ridiculous premise.

                                 NORM
                        I can’t be stuck in a movie.  We need 
                        rational thought here.  Let’s pull up 
                        WebMD and start searching symptoms.

                                 REYNOLD
                        You do that you’re gonna be dying of 
                        nasal chlamydia within three clicks 
                        and I don’t even know if that exists.

                                 NORM
                        It doesn’t.

                                 REYNOLD
                        That’s what I just said.  Listen, 
                        Norm, those sites are not to be 
                        trusted.  This however makes sense!  
                        You’re jumping around just like they 
                        do in the movies.  You see it all the 
                        time, one minute they’re at work fake 
                        typing at a computer, doodly-doobie, 
                        next they’re making whoopie with the 
                        romantic lead, whoopie-woo! They cut 
                        out all the boring parts in between!  
                        The score, you said you heard score!  
                        It’s MOVIE score!  The voice-over, 
                        Sally’s voice-over of her own note!

                                 NORM
                        So?

                                 REYNOLD
                        So?  That’s what they do in the 
                        movies because people watching them 
                        don’t or can’t read.

           Norm sits down, taking this all in.  Reynold sits next to him.  
           Two minds gelling on the proposed absurd reality.

                                 REYNOLD (CONT'D)
                        It makes sense.  I’m the wacky fat 
                        friend, you’re the aloof loner, these 
                        are definitely the ingredients of one 
                        of those bad tragicomedies.  
                             (gets an idea)
                        Look at this.

           Reynold stands up and begins undressing.
           Norm retreats to a corner of the room.

                                 NORM
                        Please stop getting naked.

           Reynold strips until he’s BUTT-NAKED.  Norm has his eyes shut.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Look Norm.

                                 NORM
                        You understand that if I see you 
                        naked, it can’t be undone.

                                 REYNOLD
                        That’s how strong my convictions are.

           Norm peers over at Reynold who is naked, but his genitals are 
           being covered by the TV.

                                 REYNOLD (CONT'D)
                        You can’t see my penis, can you?

                                 NORM
                        Because you’re behind the TV.

           Reynold JUMPS from behind the TV, into the open and suddenly 
           BALLOONS APPEAR out of nowhere covering his penis mid-air. 

           ON LANDING, A NIGHT STAND with a LONG VASE appears to cover 
           his penis.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        What!  Where did those balloons come 
                        from, and how did that vase with-- 
                        you don’t own vases!

                                 REYNOLD
                        They’re Jessica’s, she thought they 
                        opened up the room.  But that’s not 
                        the point.  You’re in a clean movie, 
                        you can’t see me naked no matter what 
                        I do!

           Reynold does a HANDSTAND on one of the walls.  Norm at first 
           shies his eyes away, but then looks:

           Reynold, upside down against the wall, his penis covered by  
           the LONG BEAK OF A PELICAN hanging in a birdcage.

                                 NORM
                        Since when do you own a pelican?
                                 REYNOLD
                             (full of emotion)
                        A month ago as an emotional 
                        substitute for Jessica’s cat...

                                 NORM
                        You’ve had that carcass in here for a 
                        month?  Reynold, you really have 
                        issues with letting go man.

           Reynold gets off his handstand and angrily walks over to him.

                                 REYNOLD
                        ... again, not the point!  And if I 
                        were you, I would tread very 
                        carefully when speaking about my 
                        beloved.

           He shakes his head angrily and walks into his bedroom.

                                 NORM
                        What are you doing?

           Reynold returns with a PISTOL.  HE LOADS IT.

           Deeply frightened, Norm backs away.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Reynold, please don’t trust yourself.

                                 REYNOLD
                        You said you were about 25 minutes 
                        in, so seeing how you’re the main 
                        character of a movie, you can’t die.

                                 NORM
                        Reynold!  Stop!  Try to remember how 
                        out of touch with reality you can be--

           Reynold cocks and aims the gun at Norm.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        NO!!

           HE FIRES!

           Norm stands there, unscathed.  He checks his body, nothing.  
           No bullet holes, nothing.

           Reynold has a huge smile plastered on his face.

                                 REYNOLD
                        See?

           HE FIRES AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!!
           Norm SCREAMS throughout.  But no actual harm comes to him.

           The dust settles as the lunacy of their theory is confirmed 
           with a resounding bang.

                                 NORM
                        I’m stuck in an effin’ movie.
                             (beat)
                        I need to drink a lot.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

           Reynold (fully dressed now) PUSHES Norm in front of an 
           oncoming HUGE CITY BUS.  

           Norm SCREAMS, but the bus at the last minute JERKS AWAY and 
           TOPPLES OVER.

           Reynold laughs at his friend’s comical powers.

                                 NORM
                        Reynold, this isn’t a game.  This is 
                        my life we’re talking about--

           Without warning, Reynold SHOVES him into the street again. 

           An oncoming FIRE TRUCK swerves out of control and SMASHES into 
           the toppled bus, BURSTING INTO FLAMES.  

           The FIREMEN jump out and SPRAY THEIR HOSES ON THE FIRE.

           Norm looks at Reynold incredulously.  He smiles back at him.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        You can’t be this easily entertained--

           Reynold CHUCKLES dumbly at the spectacle.

                                 REYNOLD
                        --Look, it’s firemen putting out 
                        their own fire.  That’s so great.

           Norm returns to mission and MARCHES DOWN THE STREET.

                                 NORM
                        I need to drink a lot.

           INT. RIPLEY’S TAVERN - LATER

           Norm and Reynold walk into the mildly busy bar.  Norm fights 
           his way to the bar and shouts his order:

                                 NORM
                        Barkeep!  I need to drink a lot.
           The same BARTENDER as before shoots him an odd look, but 
           complies with his order.

           Reynold GAWKS at the BEAUTIFUL WOMEN that litter the place.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Unbelievable.  I would marry any one 
                        of these girls right now, without 
                        precondition.  I swear.  They could 
                        be unconscionably evil and I would 
                        give my heart to them if they allowed 
                        it.  I’m being serious Norm.  Even my 
                        love Jessica would approve.

                                 NORM
                        Reynold.  If I’m stuck in a movie, 
                        don’t you think we should find out 
                        how or why--

                                 REYNOLD
                             (shakes his head 
                              furiously)
                        --No, no, I don’t think that at all.

                                 NORM
                        I think I’m going to check myself 
                        into a mental asylum until this thing 
                        straightens itself out.

           Sensing this special gift could be snatched away, Reynold 
           quickly stops his friend from leaving.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Okay, okay, okay. If you have to 
                        know why, let’s figure it out then.  
                        Usually in these type of movies 
                        there’s some stupid device used to 
                        make the magic happen.

                                 NORM
                        Like what?

                                 REYNOLD
                        Like... did you make a birthday wish?

                                 NORM
                        A birthday wish to be stuck in a 
                        movie?  No, that would be stupid.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Did a kooky Christopher Walken type 
                        offer to help fix your life?

                                 NORM
                        Absolutely not.
                                 REYNOLD
                        God?

                                 NORM
                        God?  No.

                                 REYNOLD
                        While you were watching a movie 
                        recently, did you ever utter a phrase 
                        “if only my life were a movie” or 
                        something to that effect?

                                 NORM
                             (impatient)
                        I did not.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Did you do anything out of the 
                        ordinary?

                                 NORM
                             (thinking)
                        I got drunk on my birthday.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Drunk?  You never get drunk.

                                 NORM
                        I wanted to live a little.

                                 REYNOLD
                        But you never live a li--

                                 NORM
                             (annoyed)
                        --yes, I know, thank you, what’s your 
                        point?

                                 REYNOLD
                        Somehow you getting drunk on your 
                        birthday caused you to be stuck in a 
                        movie.

                                 NORM
                        How exactly would that happen?

                                 REYNOLD
                        Does it matter?  Don’t over think 
                        this gift Norm.  Your life is boring, 
                        monotonous, meaningless.  You think 
                        about suicide multiple times a day, 
                        as do I.  But now you’ve been given 
                        the opportunity to live like they do 
                        in the movies, the MOVIES...
           Norm takes pause to swallow this insight in earnest.  

                                 NORM
                        I see your point.  Maybe this 
                        experience could open me up.

                                 REYNOLD
                             (with a nod)
                        Yeah, I’m probably gonna start a bar 
                        fight.

           Reynold SUDDENLY SCREAMS and DECKS the GUY next to him.  
           Bedlam follows as a HUGE BAR FIGHT gets underway.

           Even Norm musters the courage to join in the festivities.  He 
           weakly PUNCHES the GUY next to him.  

           The GUY DECKS Norm back, SENDING HIM TO THE FLOOR.

           SLOW-MO as Norm FALLS...

           He CRASHES ON THE FLOOR, wearing an aloof expression.  He lies 
           still, watching the SHOES of the ensuing MADNESS, 
           contemplating the ramifications of his predicament.

           In the stillness of thought, two beautiful feet in SMALL RED 
           SHOES encroach his vision.  Feet not part of a fight, but two 
           splashes of color in a sea of chaos.

           Norm’s eyes turn sideways, to seek the owner of the red shoes.

           POLICEMEN help him up by LIFTING his arms aggressively and 
           HANDCUFFING him.

           Norm’s eyes stay locked on the owner of the red shoes...

           It’s the ATTRACTIVE WOMAN from the first scene. She STARES at 
           him confused.  Looks at him.  Acknowledges him.

           Their STARE stays locked as the POLICEMEN drag their captives, 
           Norm and Reynold, out of the bar.

           INT. JAIL - DAY

           Norm and Reynold sit like dopes in a crowded jail cell with 
           other victims of the aforementioned bar fight.  

           A huge smile is still plastered on Reynold’s face.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Look at this cheap jail we’re in? 
                             (checking out the jail 
                              with disgust)
                        They’ve got a clown school in charge 
                        of this production!
                                 NORM
                        We just got arrested for starting a 
                        random bar fight for no reason.

                                 REYNOLD
                        It felt great--

                                 NORM
                        --Stupid was the word I landed on.  
                             (with assurance)
                        It felt stupid.

                                 REYNOLD 
                             (re: jail)
                        We’ll get all the street cred of 
                        regular jail and none of the sodomy.  
                        If you chew on that for a minute 
                        it’ll make your head spin.

                                 NORM
                             (softer, more discretion)
                        That silver lining aside, we can’t 
                        keep ignoring the fact that I am 
                        magically stuck in a movie since the 
                        very notion of that idea defies the 
                        laws of sane reality.  What’s the 
                        plan here?

                                 REYNOLD 
                        Norm, you can’t figure this out?  
                        This is monkey business they’re 
                        doling out here!

                                 NORM
                        I’m really puzzled as to why you 
                        think you have all the answers?  Have 
                        you been stuck in a movie before?

                                 REYNOLD
                        Not only have I NEVER been stuck in a 
                        movie, but you can be sure as bukaki
                        is sticky that I wouldn’t be caught 
                        dead watching trash like this.  
                             (as if screaming at the 
                              movie)
                        Caught DEAD!

           POLICE OFFICER bangs on the cell to quiet Reynold down.

                                 REYNOLD (CONT'D)
                        It’s not rocket science Norm.  If 
                        you’re stuck in a movie then the 
                        movie has to end at some point.  
                                 REYNOLD (CONT'D)
                        We just ride this out for another 
                        hour, enjoying all the hijinks and 
                        fun along the way.

                                 NORM
                        Let me just say this out loud so I 
                        don’t risk actually internalizing any 
                        of it.  What you’re saying is, we 
                        just go along with the extremely 
                        bizarre logic that I’m stuck in a 
                        movie, and when it ends it ends and 
                        my life will go back to normal?

                                 REYNOLD
                        Exactly what I’m saying, and by the 
                        looks of it, it’s not even going to 
                        be that long.  Look at you.  You’re a 
                        goofy loser, clearly whatever movie 
                        about you isn’t going to be some 
                        three hour biopic of any real 
                        significance.  
                             (whispers)
                        I don’t even know how they’re gonna
                        get a feature length out of all this 
                        if I’m being honest.

           Norm ponders a movie about his life.

                                 NORM
                        Well, you cut out all the boring 
                        parts of my life and you’re pretty 
                        much left with...

           Reynold sympathetically pats him on the back.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Let’s face it pal, you and I both 
                        know there’s not much there.  But 
                        that’s not a slight against you...

                                 NORM
                        It isn’t?

                                 REYNOLD
                        Well, it is and it isn’t.

                                 NORM
                        What do you mean?

                                 REYNOLD
                        It’s self-explanatory.

                                 NORM
                             (confused)
                        How is something is and isn’t--
                                 REYNOLD
                        --Just leave it alone.
                             (pats him on the back)
                        Leave it alone.

           With sexy gusto, a voice shouts:

                                 SALLY (O.S.)
                        Norm!

           From the other side of the crowded police station, a stunning, 
           beautiful and cool SALLY WIND (30s) walks towards Norm.  She 
           is the definition of hipster.

           She uses her looks to PART CLUSTERS OF PEOPLE out of her way. 

           She uses her smile to convince POLICEMEN to let her by.

           She uses her limberness to DODGE ESCAPING CRIMINALS. 

           All to make her way to Norm’s cell.

                                 NORM 
                        Sally Wind?

           Their eyes remain locked, they share a smile between them.

                                 SALLY
                        After our weird phone call the other 
                        day, somehow I had a hunch you’d wind 
                        up in jail.  I guess you can call me 
                        your Samantha Stephens.

                                 NORM
                             (with a goofy smile)
                        What?

                                 SALLY
                        Give me a minute, I’m gonna bail you 
                        out crazy man.

           With a LAUGH, she heads over to a policeman’s desk to post the 
           bail.

           Norm can’t believe his eyes.  Sally Wind is here.  A sudden 
           realization slaps him across the face.

                                 NORM
                             (to Reynold)
                        Oh my God.  I made a promise to 
                        myself to tell Sally Wind that I love 
                        her.  What if the movie has something 
                        to do with this?  What if it’s about 
                        us getting together?
           The realization of how crazy his suggestion sounds out loud, 
           slaps Norm across the face even harder.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        What am I saying?  The minute I tell 
                        Sally we have to be together because 
                        I’m stuck in a movie she’ll mace me 
                        blind.  I can’t be blind, my life is 
                        already full of so much darkness.  
                             (shakes his head)
                        So much.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Norm, you’re thinking in real life 
                        terms again.  Of course in the real 
                        world Sally would have nothing to do 
                        with you because she’s a winner at 
                        life and you’re... well, you’ve lost 
                        a lot.  Everyone knows that.  But 
                        you’re not in the real world, you’re 
                        in a movie.

           He stands up and walks over to a mirror above the toilet.

                                 REYNOLD (CONT’D)
                        Come here and look in the mirror.

           Norm reluctantly acquiesces.

                                 REYNOLD (CONT'D)
                        Have you ever seen your skin so 
                        clear?

           Norm’s skin is immaculate.

                                 NORM
                        It can’t be.  My doctor diagnosed me 
                        with severe adult acne until I 
                        reached seventy when he said the 
                        advanced wrinkles would hopefully sag 
                        the pimples away. Hopefully, he said.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Look at your hair.

           Norm shakes his head and brushes his hair wildly, then looks 
           in the mirror again.  Perfectly quaffed.

                                 NORM
                        That’s impossible.
                                 REYNOLD
                        Look at those jeans!  Those are like 
                        $400 jeans you buy at douchebaggery
                        dot com, not the $20 jeans you buy on 
                        sale at TJ Maxx.

           POLICE OFFICER unlocks the CELL DOOR.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Goldworm! Your free to go.

           Standing across the way is Sally Wind wearing a sly, sexy 
           smile as she waits for her presumptive hero Norm.

           Reynold puts his hand on Norm’s shoulder.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Go, win Sally’s heart.  But remember, 
                        don’t be yourself.

                                 NORM
                        Who do I be then?

                                 REYNOLD
                        Be the better version of you Norm... 
                        be the movie you.

           INT./EXT. SALLY’S CAR - NIGHT

           Norm sits quietly in the passenger seat as Sally drives 
           through the city streets.  They curiously smile at each other.  

           Romantic music SWELLS.  The scene is heart-gushing.

                                 SALLY
                        You look really good Norm.

                                 NORM
                             (extremely flattered)
                        Thank you so much.

           Sally inspects Norm’s face with concern.

                                 SALLY
                        Are you okay?

                                 NORM
                        People have been asking me that a lot 
                        lately.

                                 SALLY
                        Maybe it just means you’re the only 
                        normal person in a world full of 
                        crazy.
                                 NORM
                        Or I’m the only crazy one in a world 
                        full of normal.

                                 SALLY
                        Is there really a difference?

           Norm nods, fair enough.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        Normal or crazy, I’m taking you to my 
                        place.  I’ve got news so big that 
                        it’s not fit to print.

                                 NORM
                             (feigning shock)
                        Wow.  That sounds big.

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           INT. SALLY’S BROWNSTONE - MOMENTS LATER

           Norm stands in the kitchen, and not realizing from the cut 
           that he’s holding a drink, DROPS A WINE GLASS.

                                 SALLY
                        Whoa, Norm, what up with that?

                                 NORM
                             (shakes it off)
                        Sorry, it’s been very, well, somewhat 
                        psychologically horrific recently if 
                        I’m being truthful.  
                             (a shrug and a chuckle, 
                              playing it off)
                        Keeps me young.

           They share a forced laugh, followed by a beat of odd tension.

                                 SALLY
                        I’m sorry, it’s actually not that 
                        funny.  That wine glass was a gift 
                        from my dead aunt who succumbed to 
                        cancer only a year ago this February, 
                        so...

                                 NORM
                        Oh.  Let me pay something--
                                 SALLY
                             (serious)
                        --That’s actually really offensive, 
                        because it’s priceless, in the way a 
                        baby’s smile or a shared sunset with 
                        a lover is.  Let’s just drop it 
                        before feelings get hurt.

           She grabs a towel and starts cleaning up the spill as an 
           awkward moment passes.  Norm tries to help.  His voice shakes 
           as he closes in on his goal.

                                 NORM
                        Sally, there’s something I need to 
                        tell you...

           Terror strikes his face again.  He’s on the verge of tears.  

           Not noticing, Sally takes the recent spill to the trash.

                                 SALLY
                        Honestly, feelings got hurt.  I don’t 
                        think you understand how much I loved 
                        my aunt.  I have nothing to remember 
                        her by now.  She was a very simple 
                        woman.  

           She turns to see that Norm is fighting back tears.

                                 SALLY (CONT'D)
                        Unbelievable.  You’re going to make 
                        me feel bad about being honest?  Well 
                        I refuse to feel guilty.  She was 
                        simple Norm.  Really simple. Spartan-
                        like almost.

           He shakes his head vigorously.  In the midst of this, he SPOTS 
           THE DIAMOND RING on Sally’s finger. His face regains normalcy.

                                 NORM 
                        Is that an engagement ring?

                                 SALLY
                        Oh, right, with all the emotional 
                        trauma over my aunt’s wine glass I 
                        almost forgot my big news.  I’m 
                        getting married!  Tom proposed!

           Norm’s heart sinks 20,000 leagues under the sea.

                                 NORM
                        What?  Who’s Tom?  When did this 
                        happen?
                                 SALLY
                        Last weekend, that’s what I’ve been 
                        trying to tell you this whole time 
                        but you’ve been... well, Norm, you’ve 
                        been acting very creepy.  And not in 
                        a good way.

           Norm clears his throat to mute his inner turmoil.

                                 NORM
                        I-- ummm...

           Words escape him.  Color and blood drain his face.

                                 SALLY
                        Norm?  What’s the dealy, yo?

           A moment of silence.  Norm TAKES THE PLUNGE AND KISSES HER.  

           Sally pulls back.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        Back up mofo. What’s this?

                                 NORM
                        It’s me kissing you.  It’s me wanting 
                        you to be with me, not Tom.

                                 SALLY
                             (discombobulated)
                        I don’t know what to say, my mind is 
                        like speed racer right now.
                             (looks at Norm like he’s a 
                              stranger)
                        It’s like I don’t even recognize you 
                        anymore!

                                 NORM
                        I want you to be with me.  I love 
                        you, and Tom’s a douche, I know I’ve 
                        never met him but if it’s consistent 
                        with your previous trysts, what I 
                        mean is you develop a pattern, and 
                        when one studies your judgment in 
                        men, it’s like a drunk person who 
                        shouldn’t drive sort of, cause 
                        they’ll get into accidents that could 
                        kill people, you know?

                                 SALLY
                             (angry)
                        --Trysts?
                                 NORM
                        An agreement, as between lovers, to 
                        meet at a certain time and place.  
                        Look, Sally, I’ve always loved you.  
                        You and I should be together, not you 
                        and Tom.  The only one for me is you, 
                        and you for me.  Happy...
                             (stops before he quotes a 
                              song)
                        That’s it... just happy.

           Sally shakes her head in disbelief.

                                 SALLY
                        I can’t believe you.  I mean, I do, 
                        but...
                             (shakes her head in 
                              disbelief)
                        I don’t at the same time.
                             (gets weepy)
                        It’s like a paradox.  You’re like a 
                        big paradox monster right now.

           She quickly gets up and STORMS OUT of the house.

           Norm puts his head down in defeated humiliation.

                                 NORM
                        Why?  Just why?

           He gets up and runs after Sally.

           EXT. SALLY’S BROWNSTONE - STREETS - NIGHT

           It’s POURING RAIN.  Sally is marching down the street, 
           drenched.  Norm follows her and looks up at the rain.

                                 NORM
                        When did it start raining?
                             (to Sally)
                        Sally! Sally!

           Sally turns around, pissed off.

                                 SALLY
                        What!

           Norm looks at the rain.

                                 NORM
                        You wanna have this conversation out 
                        here?  It’s like a category five.

                                 SALLY
                        Don’t change the subject!
           Norm nods.  He looks into her eyes.

                                 NORM 
                        I love you and I want to be with you.  
                        I’m sorry, but it’s true.  I had to 
                        tell you.

           They sadly look at each other as the rain pours down.

                                 SALLY
                        Why?  Why are you telling me this?

                                 NORM
                        Because I promised myself I would.  
                        Because I’ve been waiting to tell you 
                        since the day I met you, like 
                        everything in my life was put on hold 
                        until this moment.

           Pete Townsend’s “Let My Love Open The Door” starts playing.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                             (reacting to the song)
                        Do you hear that?

                                 SALLY
                        Hear what?  

                                 NORM
                        The song.

                                 SALLY
                        Oh my God Norm, are you 
                        schizophrenic?

                                 NORM
                        I don’t think so, my blood work 
                        appears to be clean.

           The rain comes down hard, Sally and Norm locked on each other.

                                 SALLY
                        Do you really love me?

                                 NORM 
                        Yes Sally.  I love you with every 
                        ounce, pound, gram, really any metric 
                        system you want to use to describe 
                        the weight of my love for you 
                        applies.  It’s a love with a good old 
                        American obesity problem.  I love you 
                        Sally.  And I don’t want you to marry 
                        Tom, I want you to marry me.

           Sally starts to cry.
                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Just so you know, if you’re crying I 
                        kinda can’t tell because of the 
                        monsoon we’re standing in.

                                 SALLY
                        I am crying Norm.  I’m crying 
                        because... I think I love you too.

                                 NORM
                             (taken aback)
                        You do?

                                 SALLY
                        Yeah, I do.

           She smiles and nods her head.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        I do.

           The rain POURS DOWN hard.

                                 NORM 
                        What’s say we get back inside and let 
                        God piss on nature and homeless 
                        people like he intended--

           Sally runs up and kisses Norm.  The chorus SWELLS and it is 
           romantic.  THUNDER CRACKS THE SKY to underline the majesty of 
           the scene.

           INT. SALLY’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Dripping wet, Sally rips Norm’s clothes off.

                                 NORM
                        We’re taking off clothes?

           Norm starts taking her clothes off as they passionately kiss 
           and fall on the bed.

           Sally pauses the passion and looks into Norm’s trembling eyes.

                                 SALLY
                        I love you.

                                 NORM
                        I love you too.

           They kiss sweetly for a few moments.
                                                           JUMP CUT TO:
           LATER
           Sally, in her bra and panties, lies next to Norm catching her 
           breath post-sex.  She speaks while a lit cigarette dangles 
           from her mouth.

                                 SALLY 
                        God Norm.  You were so boss.

           Confusion strikes Norm as he realizes he missed the sex.

                                 NORM
                        I was?

                                 SALLY
                        You were.

           Norm sits up in disbelief.  He missed the sex!

                                 NORM
                             (mutters to himself)
                        I gotta get out of this movie.

                                 SALLY
                        Norm... this might sound stranger 
                        than strange, but every time you say 
                        something that’s insane in the 
                        membrane, I get turned on.

           She straddles him sexually, cigarette still dangling.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        Pump me full of nonsense Norm...

           She starts to take off her bra and we--
                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           LATER
           Lying next to each other again, Sally is even more out of 
           breath.  This time the sheets cover her breasts.  She BURPS.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        Yowser, Norm, that was on point.  I 
                        have to say, you were even better the 
                        second time.

           Norm holds back his frustration on missing the sex AGAIN.

                                 NORM 
                        I’m never better the second time at 
                        anything.  
                             (shakes his head)
                        God has to be dead.

                                 SALLY
                        What’s wrong?
                                 NORM
                        Nothing, how about we go again?

                                 SALLY
                        Again?  Seriously, Norm, this is the 
                        last time, and then we have to take a 
                        breather and just talk because I have 
                        a lot of feelings to get to.  

           Norm wastes no time and quickly disappears under the covers in 
           some attempt to out psych the movie...

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           LATER
           TOILET FLUSH!  Now Norm is sitting up in bed, having missed 
           the sex again, and reading “Water for Elephants” with a pair 
           of old man’s reading glasses on.

           Sally walks of the bathroom in a silk robe.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        You can’t tell me you wanna go again, 
                        that last go around was probably the 
                        best sex I’ve ever had in my life.

                                 NORM
                             (angry)
                        Of course it was the best sex ever.

                                 SALLY
                        Oh my God, am I lame or something?  
                        Was that like the worst for you?

                                 NORM
                        No, no, no, it’s just that it was 
                        so... crazy... sexually... like old 
                        school crazy... I can’t even remember 
                        any of it, cause it was so wild and 
                        old school--

                                 SALLY
                             (fondly)
                        --Sometimes I wonder who you are 
                        behind your silly little idioms.

           She kisses him.  They lay there in a mound of bliss.

                                 SALLY (CONT'D)
                        Are you sure you’re not 
                        schizophrenic, because you’re 
                        exhibiting all the signs.  Seriously.
                                 NORM
                        I’m just so overwhelmed by actually 
                        being with you.  All this is going to 
                        take some getting used to.  I’ve been 
                        waiting for this moment for a long 
                        time.

           Sally playfully lies her head on Norm’s stomach.

                                 SALLY
                        Since we met?  Back in high school?

           Norm smiles at the memory...though the memory of their first 
           meet cannot be placed at all.

                                 NORM
                        Actually, how did we meet?

                                 SALLY
                             (scoffs)
                        Gee, Norm, you really know how to 
                        sweet talk a girl into having sex.

                                 NORM
                        We already had sex.

                                 SALLY
                        Well, know this, I would have never 
                        agreed to any of these shenanigans if 
                        you really couldn’t remember.

           Norm sits up a bit, alarmed that the most significant memory 
           in his life seems to have evaporated.

                                 NORM
                        Seriously, I don’t remember.

                                 SALLY
                        Don’t say that and it be true!  Come 
                        on, it was senior year...

           Norm’s eyes dance nervously as the screen DISSOLVES...

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL (FLASHBACK, LATE 80S) - DAY

           A HIGH SCHOOL NORM, with longer hair, a Super Mario shirt, and 
           a misguided attempt at a goatee, sits in a classroom.

                                 NORM
                        What the hell is this?
                             (looks at his shirt)
                        Why am I wearing a Super Mario shirt?  
                                 NEARBY PRETTY GIRL
                             (sarcastic)
                        Because girls like you.

           GIGGLES.

           MRS. SCHMICK, the angry white-haired teacher at the head of 
           the class, screams loudly:

                                 MRS. SCHMICK
                        Mr. Goldworm! Are you lost again?

           GIGGLES.  Sitting next to him is HIGH SCHOOL REYNOLD, a little 
           thinner, and wearing a shirt that reads “Give Me Head Until 
           I’m Dead.”

                                 REYNOLD
                        Smooth, dude, real smooth.

                                 NORM
                        Reynold, where the hell are we?

                                 MRS. SCHMICK
                        Mr. Goldworm! Would you and your 
                        rotund friend like to take thou 
                        lover’s quarrel to a nunnery?

           GIGGLES.  

                                 REYNOLD
                        Thanks a lot dude, now I’m gonna be 
                        called the rotund nun for the rest of 
                        the year.

                                 NEARBY PRETTY GIRL
                        Hey rotund nun, you got an eraser I 
                        can borrow?

           GIGGLES.

                                 REYNOLD
                             (mutters)
                        And I was just getting my weight 
                        under control.  It’s like the dumb 
                        leading the dumber!  Eff it.

           He takes out a cupcake from his desk and EATS IT.

           Norm mentally fights to place the memory.

                                 MRS. SCHMICK
                        Before Mr. Goldworm so rudely 
                        interrupted, I was about to introduce 
                        a new student to the class. 
                                 MRS. SCHMICK (CONT'D)
                        She hails from Cleveland, Ohio.  
                        Let’s give a warm homeroom welcome to 
                        Sally Wind.

           At the head of the class, HIGH SCHOOL SALLY stands up.  She’s 
           stunning, gorgeous, and the light hits her perfectly through 
           the windows.  The rest of the class DIMS.

           A nearby BLACK STUDENT begins playing NEW EDITION through his 
           BOOMBOX. Norm and Sally exchange awkward teenage smiles.

           Reynold interrupts the moment by whispering to Norm:

                                 REYNOLD
                        I think I’m gonna be sick, I just ate 
                        four cupcakes in a row after being on 
                        a 3 week Disco Sweat intensive...

           He covers his mouth, but the geyser shoots.  HE THROWS UP.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - BATHROOM - DAY

           Norm stands tasked with wiping throw up off his shirt.  
           Reynold is in a nearby stall PUKING.

                                 NORM
                        Reynold?  What the h-e double hockey 
                        sticks is going on?  I don’t remember 
                        any of this.

                                 REYNOLD
                        I’m yakkin’ sprinkles dude, let’s 
                        reconvene post-haste--

           BARF!

           Norm backs away from the stall and darts outside.

           HALLWAYS
           SMACK!  He bumps right into Sally, getting vomit on her.

                                 SALLY
                        Gross.  You got vomit on me.

           Norm attempts to make light of the situation.

                                 NORM
                        Prove it.

           He laughs at his own wit but Sally does not.

                                 SALLY
                        Why should I prove anything to you?

           He stops smiling at his miscalculated joke.
           DOUCHE FOOTBALL PLAYER walks by with his clique and LAUGHS.

                                 DOUCHE FOOTBALL PLAYER
                        Hey look, it’s the vomit twins!

           GUFFAWS GALORE.  Sally stands up for them.

                                 SALLY
                        Lay off dirtbags. We may have vomit 
                        on our sleeves but you guys have 
                        vomit in your hearts.

           The douche clique collectively exchange puzzled looks.

           Norm attempts clarity in his explanation:

                                 NORM
                        No, it just means we have vomit on 
                        our sleeves, there really isn’t much 
                        more of a commentary than that...

           Sally grabs Norm and says:

                                 SALLY
                        It means this.

           She hugs him tight, the vomit getting all over their clothes.

                                 NORM
                        Don’t do that, that’s not even really 
                        explaining anything, oh God...

           The douche clique quickly disperse at the disgusting sight.

                                 SALLY
                        Are they splitsville?

                                 NORM
                        Yes, please back away now.

           She doesn’t.

                                 SALLY
                        Good.  I’m Sally by the way.

                                 NORM
                             (shakes his head 
                              disapprovingly)
                        I’m... Norm.

                                 SALLY
                        Hey Norm.  Wanna be my first Jersey 
                        friend?  It’d be très killer.
                                 NORM
                        Sure, but can we stop smushing the 
                        two vomit stains, I think it’s 
                        procreating.

           Sally laughs.

                                 SALLY
                        You’re like Woody Allen funny.

           She laughs more.

           INT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT

           High School Norm is now sitting in the bleachers next to High 
           School Reynold who is disguised in a hat and sunglasses.

                                 NORM
                        Reynold?

                                 REYNOLD
                        Shh!  Don’t say my name, someone 
                        might hear you!

           A HOT CHEERLEADER points from the field.

                                 HOT CHEERLEADER
                        It’s the rotund nun everyone!

           A NEARBY DOUCHE seated next to them laughs hard.

                                 NEARBY DOUCHE
                        Hey rotund nun...

           He pulls down his pants and moons Reynold.

                                 NEARBY DOUCHE (CONT'D)
                        Give me 5 hail marys, I’ve been a bad 
                        student!

           His douche friends join in the laughter.  Reynold turns from 
           the ass to Norm.

                                 REYNOLD
                             (sad and desperate)
                        Life keeps slipping away.

           Sally sits next to Norm.

                                 SALLY
                        Hey Norm.  Why is that guy mooning 
                        your friend?

                                 NORM
                        They think he’s a rotund nun.
                                 SALLY
                        Okay, how’s the game?  Are we 
                        winning?

           DOWN ON THE FIELD

           The DOUCHE FOOTBALL PLAYERS from before score a touchdown.  

           The crowd goes nuts.  The CHEERLEADERS cheer.

           Sally stands up to chastise the football players.

                                 SALLY (CONT'D)
                        Boo!!!  They have vomit in their 
                        hearts!!!  BOO!!!  Vomit-hearted 
                        football players!!!  BOO!!!

           Everyone throws trash at Norm as he miserably sits in between 
           an embarrassing preachy Sally and Reynold who is inches away 
           from a bare ass.

           Norm suddenly SPOTS the ATTRACTIVE WOMAN from the bar, now a 
           cheerleader wearing a bright RED HAIR-TIE.

           The picture begins to DISSOLVE.  Norm RACES towards the woman.

                                 NORM
                        Wait!

           He stumbles down the bleachers as the DISSOLVE chases him.

           He YELLS after the Attractive Woman.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        I need to talk to you!

           He runs, but the DISSOLVE wins...
                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. SALLY’S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

           Norm and Sally lying in bed as the memory dies slowly.

                                 SALLY
                        I should have known that first time 
                        there was something other than that 
                        vomit between us... 
                             (looks at him endearingly)
                        Something special.

                                 NORM
                             (lost in thought)
                        Do you remember other details of our 
                        friendship?
                                 SALLY
                        Norm, why are you getting all Bourne-
                        Identity on me?

           Something’s not right.  Norm sits up and begins dressing.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

           Norm continues to dress frantically.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        Norm?  What up with you?

           Norm looks at Sally, contemplating whether or not he should 
           break the craziness to her.

                                 NORM
                        Ok, I’m gonna tell you, but know I do 
                        so with tremendous amounts of regret.

           Sally listens intently with a mischievous grin.

                                 SALLY
                        This sounds like it’s gonna be muy
                        loco.  I’m already getting hot--

                                 NORM
                        --I’m in a movie.

                                 SALLY
                        Okay, Norm, you’ve said that joke 
                        already.  And frankly, if you have to 
                        explain it, how funny is it to begin 
                        with?

           Norm has to use other measures.  He stands up quickly and 
           looks around the enormous bedroom.

                                 NORM
                        Look at this place.  You make nothing 
                        at your job, yet you live in a huge 
                        brownstone in Manhattan.

           Sally looks around her nice, spacious bedroom.  It is HUGE.

           Norm goes through her big closet and pulls out her CLOTHES.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Look at this.  You’ve got expensive 
                        designer clothes that you could NEVER 
                        afford.

           Norm frantically points at her ROBE.
                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Take off your robe.

                                 SALLY
                        Norm, you’re scaring me.  And not in 
                        a good way.

                                 NORM
                        Sally, please.  Take off your robe.

           Sally slowly takes of her robe.  Underneath, is a sexy nighty.

                                 SALLY
                        Okay, so what?

                                 NORM
                        Take off the nighty.

                                 SALLY
                        Norm, if this is some role-play 
                        aggressive thing, I’m down, but we 
                        should agree on safe words first.

                                 NORM
                        Sally, please.

           Sally takes off her nighty.  Underneath, a bra and panties.

           Confused, Sally takes off her bra and panties, underneath a 
           bikini top and bottom.

           She takes those off, underneath whip cream over her nipples 
           and vagina.

                                 SALLY
                        What’s going on?

                                 NORM
                        You can’t get naked.  That’s what’s 
                        going on.  Because I’m stuck in a 
                        movie.  A PG-13 movie. Do you 
                        understand now?

           Sally finally concludes, without question, that Norm is crazy.

                                 SALLY
                        I think you should leave.

                                 NORM 
                        Sally--

                                 SALLY
                        --Norm, I love you, I always have.  
                        But this isn’t right.  I’m engaged to 
                        Tom now.  
                                 SALLY (CONT'D)
                        The wedding is this weekend.  I can’t 
                        call it off.  He’s a Quaker for 
                        Peter’s sake.  I can’t leave him, 
                        it’s virtually impossible.

                                 NORM
                        Sally, you don’t understand--

           She goes into the bathroom on the verge of tears and SLAMS the 
           door shut.

           Norm is left baffled but not necessarily hurt.  

           Sally’s CALENDAR catches his eye.  He sees that this weekend 
           is circled in RED.  It reads inside the bubble: “Getting 
           married to Tom in Lehigh, Pennsylvania!!  XOXOXO!!”

           With that, he leaves.

           EXT. STREETS - DAY

           Norm walks down the street, drowning in a sea of confusion and 
           grief. Why can’t he remember anything? What does it all mean?

           He walks past TWO MEN deep conversation.  He stops and turns, 
           noticing something odd about the exchange.  They’re not really 
           talking, just MOUTHING silently to each other.

           Norm waves his hand between them.

                                 NORM
                        Hello?

           Nothing.  

           He SLAPS one of them.  Really hard.  Still nothing.  They 
           continue mouthing to each other.

           A LOUD WHISTLE from behind causes Norm to spin around.  He 
           SEES Reynold desperately running towards him.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Norm, GO!

           Behind Reynold, a TEAM OF HULKING FIGURES chase him.

           Norm and Reynold run as the TEAM OF HULKING FIGURES are on 
           their tails.  They DUCK into an...

           ALLEYWAY

           Reynold stops, out of breath.
                                 NORM
                        What are you doing, we can’t just 
                        stop, they’re gonna find us--

           THE HULKING FIGURES run past them.  All is quiet.

           Our heroes speak through short breaths:

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        What happened back there?

                                 REYNOLD
                        It’s nothing.  A girl blew her rape 
                        whistle.

                                 NORM
                        Why?

                                 REYNOLD
                        I licked her areola through her 
                        bikini top.  Figured if that worked, 
                        it’d prove I was stuck in a movie 
                        along with you, ya know?

                                 NORM
                             (disturbed)
                        No, and honestly I don’t think that’s 
                        a leap of logic a normal person would 
                        make.

           Taking this as a compliment, Reynold pats him on the back.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Agreed.  So how goes it, did you bang 
                        Sally?

                                 NORM
                        Sort of.  Every time we tried to have 
                        sex it cut away, but look, that’s not 
                        what my main concern is.

                                 REYNOLD
                        She didn’t like your banging?

                                 NORM
                        She said I was her best.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Aces dude!  Look at you, maybe it was 
                        better you weren’t there.

                                 NORM
                        Absolutely, but that’s not what I’m 
                        concerned about.  She’s marrying Tom.
                                 REYNOLD
                             (scoffs)
                        Tom?  He sounds like a total douche.

                                 NORM
                        You know him?

                                 REYNOLD
                        You know what’s funny, I’ve never 
                        even met a Tom in my entire life!

                                 NORM
                        Get this, he’s a Quaker?  I don’t 
                        even really know what that means.  
                        She’s marrying him this weekend, but 
                        again, NOT what I’m concerned about.

                                 REYNOLD
                        The love of your life getting married 
                        to a Quaker douchebag named Tom this 
                        weekend, I say this is cause for 
                        concern.

                                 NORM
                        No, Reynold, what I’m concerned about 
                        is that I don’t have any recollection 
                        of meeting Sally.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Norm, I recall vomiting sprinkles 
                        like it was 10 minutes ago.

                                 NORM
                        That’s because it was 10 minutes ago.  
                        Until the flashback happened, I 
                        didn’t remember any of it.  Do you 
                        understand now?

           Long beat.

                                 REYNOLD
                             (feigning comprehension)
                        I see exactly what you’re saying.

           Norm knows he doesn’t.

                                 NORM
                        I know you don’t.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Thing is, I don’t know if it’s me or 
                        if it’s how you’re saying it, gotta 
                        be honest on this one.
                                 NORM 
                        I don’t remember any other detail of 
                        my life.  Meeting you, being a kid, 
                        my parents, your parents, 
                        Christmases, birthdays, anything!

           This gives Reynold pause for some very serious concern.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        The only things I remember are the 
                        things that happen in the movie. 

                                 REYNOLD
                        Which means... you’re in some kind of 
                        Total Recall comedy of errors 
                        nightmare?

           Norm is baffled by Reynold’s utter illogic.

                                 NORM
                        No.  It means I’m not stuck in a 
                        movie.  Reynold... we are not real 
                        people... we are just characters in a 
                        movie.

           Reynold desperately attempts to grasp the implications.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Think about it, can you think of 
                        anything that happened the hour, 
                        week, or month before I saw you 
                        yesterday?

           Reynold shakes his head like a scared kitten.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        That’s because you didn’t even exist 
                        until I showed up, until the movie 
                        introduced you.  We’re not real.  
                        We’re just characters in a stupid 
                        comedy.  That’s it.

                                 REYNOLD
                        That can’t be.  How do we know we’re 
                        friends if we didn’t exist outside of 
                        the movie?

                                 NORM
                        Those were just our pre-defined back 
                        stories. The movie set us up as 
                        friends.  Like it set me up as a guy 
                        pining away after Sally Wind, a guy 
                        who is miserable, a guy who loses at 
                        life.
           Norm sinks back into his self-pity comfort zone.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        I’m not even a real loser.  I’m just 
                        a fake loser thought up by a real 
                        loser...  I thought I had no life 
                        before, now it’s confirmed.

           The gravity of the realization grounds them simultaneously.  
           They sit against the wall, destroyed beyond recognition.

                                 REYNOLD 
                        Hold the phone.  If this is all true, 
                        then what happens when the movie 
                        ends?

           After a moment of dooming realization...

                                 NORM
                        We end, we die.

           SAD MUSIC begins playing.  Reynold yells at the heavens:

                                 REYNOLD
                        Amateur hour!

           As if responding, the music continues to play.

                                 REYNOLD (CONT’D)
                        Norm, this can’t be true.  What about 
                        Jessica?

                                 NORM
                        She wasn’t real--

                                 REYNOLD
                        --don’t you dare!!

           Reynold GRABS Norm by the neck and CHOKES him.

                                 REYNOLD (CONT’D)
                        SHE WAS REAL!!  SHE WAS REAL!!!

                                 NORM
                             (through the choking)
                        Reynold... she didn’t exist... none 
                        of it did...

           Norm KNEES Reynold in the balls, SENDING him to the ground.  

           Reynold curls up in a fetal position, dreaded with the thought 
           of his utter non-existence.
                                 REYNOLD
                        Her death, all that pain, everything 
                        was fake?  What kind of SADISTS are 
                        we dealing with here?!

           Reynold shakes his head furiously.

                                 REYNOLD (CONT’D)
                        No, no... I can’t believe it... 

                                 NORM
                        Face it Reynold, we have to accept 
                        what we are.  We’re not real and in 
                        less than an hour, we’ll be dead.  
                        Erased from existence...

           A harsh silence with sad music as the two characters are 
           wrought with existential peril.  

                                 REYNOLD
                        Well, it’s not like we looked forward 
                        to living anyway.  Let’s face it, 
                        Norm, we did not live.

                                 NORM
                        No we did not.

           Norm stands and walks towards the end of the alley, looking at 
           a HUGE CROWD OF PEOPLE passing through WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        All those people are only there for 
                        the benefit of my pathetic story.

           Old couples, kids, dogs, hippies, and pot dealers walk around 
           in harmonic bliss.  Norm’s heart goes out to them.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        These people don’t deserve to die.  
                        Even if I don’t want to live, that 
                        doesn’t mean they shouldn’t.

                                 REYNOLD
                             (scoffs)
                        In no way whatsoever did we live.  We 
                        didn’t even come close.

           Norm nods his head in agony.

                                 NORM
                        This existential crisis is giving me 
                        a massive headache, I need some 
                        aspirin--
           Norm spots a BOTTLE OF ASPIRIN on the ground.  He curiously 
           picks it up.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        I need some water too...

           A BOTTLE OF WATER SMACKS HIM IN THE FACE.

           He searches around, looking for the source.  No one’s around.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                             (thinking)
                        Wait a minute...

           Norm gets an idea.  He looks back at the CROWD IN THE PARK.  

           He closes his eyes and thinks hard. After a beat, he opens 
           them up, searching for something or someone...

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Where are you...

           His gaze LANDS on the ATTRACTIVE WOMAN! She walks through the 
           crowded park alone.  

           Norm’s heart skips a beat.  A flicker of hope.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Come on Reynold, we’ve gotta go.  We 
                        can’t let these people die...

                                 REYNOLD
                             (disgusted)
                        People?  Not only would I let them 
                        die, I would with glee watch every 
                        one of their individual deaths.  
                        That’s 6 billion deaths I would watch 
                        with glee.  With masturbatory glee--  

           Norm spots the ATTRACTIVE WOMAN getting into a cab.

                                 NORM
                             (to Reynold)
                        We gotta grab a cab.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Why should I do anything for you?  We 
                        don’t even have a real friendship.  
                        I’m just a fat sidekick whose sole 
                        purpose is to fart for laughs.

                                 NORM
                        Be that as it may, I still care about 
                        you despite the fact that this is all 
                        imaginary.
                                 REYNOLD
                        You’re just written to care about me.  
                        How do I know you really do?

                                 NORM
                        Because I think I figured out a way 
                        to save you and everyone else from 
                        total non-existence.  I think I 
                        figured out a way to stop the movie 
                        from ending.

                                                           BEGIN CHASE:

           Our two heroes hop into a CAB and scream at the DRIVER:

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                             (gestures to the cab of 
                              the ATTRACTIVE WOMAN)
                        Follow that cab!

           The CAB PEELS away and turns down a busy city street, only to 
           hit a major TRAFFIC BLOCKADE.  The cab with the ATTRACTIVE 
           WOMAN turns onto another street, getting away.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        She’s getting away.

           They quickly hop out of the cab and make their way into 
           another CAB on a less trafficked street.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                             (gestures)
                        Sir, please, follow that cab!

           The CAB PEELS out and the CHASE IS BACK ON.

           Reynold pulls out his corncob from his pocket and stuffs it 
           with weed. 

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Reynold, what are you doing--

           Reynold puts his finger up.  With full pomposity, he takes a 
           puff, returning to his professorial, cocky demeanor.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Allow me to mullify.  

                                 NORM
                        Not a real word.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Immaterial.  We both are intelligent 
                        peop-- characters.  
                                 REYNOLD (CONT'D)
                        As such we’ve deconstructed that the 
                        movie, our known universe that we 
                        currently coexist in, is indeed a 
                        horrible comedy.  One that involves 
                        effing with my emotions and you 
                        professing your long lost love to 
                        your high school crush Sally Wind.

                                 NORM
                        Except that’s not true because there 
                        was nothing long and lost about it.  
                        She’s a figment of some weinerface’s
                        imagination, as am I, as are you, as 
                        is this entire world we occupy.

           Reynold jockeys back Norm’s logic with glee.

                                 REYNOLD
                        The movie, our universe, clearly 
                        wants you, Norm, the main dude, to 
                        crash the wedding that Sally is 
                        having this weekend to the Quaker 
                        douche Tom-- 

           The CAB SWERVES off road and the DRIVER suddenly is in the 
           midst of a FULL-ON SEIZURE.  

                                 REYNOLD (CONT’D)
                             (gestures to the driver)
                        He’s flopping around!

           The CAB RAMS right into a brick building.

           Norm again exchanges glances with the ATTRACTIVE WOMAN who is 
           in her cab getting away.

           Our heroes JUMP OUT and in another cab and Norm again screams:

                                 NORM
                        Follow that cab!

                                 ANGRY CAB DRIVER
                        With pleasure.

           Cab SPEEDS faster than the others, and the chase is still on.  
           Norm and Reynold pick up their conversation in progress.

                                 REYNOLD
                        If you don’t crash the wedding at the 
                        last minute, don’t stop Sally from 
                        marrying Tom, and don’t have her 
                        marry you to live happily ever after, 
                        then we’re golden.  All we have to do 
                        is not give the movie the ending it 
                        wants. 
                                 NORM
                        Exactly.  All I have to do is not
                        marry Sally Wind...  
                             (looking at the cab ahead 
                              of them)
                        ... and fall in love with someone 
                        else.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Whoa movie man.  That don’t make a 
                        whole lot of sense.  You fall in love 
                        with someone else, you might as well 
                        be giving these clowns ass-to-mouth.

           The cab ride gets VERY BUMPY.  FAINT SCREAMS are heard.

                                 NORM
                             (pursing his lips, 
                              nervous)
                        Except I won’t actually fall in love 
                        with her.  As long as I don’t crash 
                        Sally Wind’s wedding and make the 
                        movie about a new girl I never fall 
                        in love with...

           EVEN BUMPIER, MORE FAINT SCREAMS.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Genius!  Movies can’t end like that!  
                        Makes no sense!  Proud children of 
                        incest could have figured this--
                             (gestures towards the 
                              road)
                        He’s killing people!

           The cab DRIVES through a street fair, MOWING DOWN PEOPLE LEFT 
           AND RIGHT.  Norm and Reynold exchange equally horrified looks.

                                 NORM AND REYNOLD
                             (to the driver)
                        Here is good.

           Angry Cab Driver stops abruptly while toppling PEDESTRIANS.

                                 ANGRY CAB DRIVER
                        What a rush.

           They quickly HOP out and walk away as AMBULANCES flood the 
           street fair now lined with DEAD CORPSES.

           Norm shakes his head in horror.

                                 NORM
                        The movie...it’s turning on us...it’s 
                        getting darker.
           Norm spots the ATTRACTIVE WOMAN walking into a SKYSCRAPER 
           across the way.  

           Our heroes follow her.

           INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Norm and Reynold run through the crowd of mouthing, quiet 
           EXTRAS.  Reynold curiously tries to get their attention.  

           Norm grabs him, and they ESCAPE into an...

           ELEVATOR
           ... in the nick of time and catch a moment of reprieve.

           Norm and Reynold, winded, catch their breaths as they stand 
           next to even more EXTRAS who are quietly mouthing words.

                                 REYNOLD
                        They’re extras. How pathetic is this?

           Reynold waves a hand in between them.

           DING!  The elevator doors open.  Norm has a feeling.

                                 NORM
                        She’s on this floor.

           OFFICE

           They run PAST SECURITY through a busy office.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Hey, you can’t come in here!

           Norm and Reynold sneak into an empty cubicle.  Norm peers 
           around the corner and sees the ATTRACTIVE WOMAN.

                                 NORM
                        She was the girl in the bar that I 
                        was hitting on.  
                             (unsure of himself)
                        She’s the one I’m gonna not fall in 
                        love with.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Perfect pick.  About the only thing 
                        this beautiful flower would share 
                        with you is a few seconds of her time 
                        while she’s on a quick fart walk.  
                        She’ll never fall in love with 
                        someone like you.

           Norm sadly agrees.
                                 NORM
                        She’s perfect.

           The ATTRACTIVE WOMAN walks into an office.

           BEHIND THEM, a collection of SECURITY GUARDS are searching.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Let’s relocate to her office.

           They quickly sneak into the ATTRACTIVE WOMAN’s office and shut 
           the door.  The dark-haired beauty, now posing as an office 
           worker, sits at her desk and mindlessly mouths into the phone.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Hey!  Hello!  Hey!

           The ATTRACTIVE WOMAN, not knowing anything beyond mouthing 
           into the phone, ignores Norm completely like before.

           Norm walks around the desk and stands in front of her.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Listen!  Please stop!  We’re in 
                        trouble, we need your help!

           Like a broken robot, the ATTRACTIVE WOMAN repeats her action.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Of course!  Why didn’t I think of 
                        this before?  Any half-wit can see 
                        she’s a computer generated copy by 
                        the odd texture in her face!  Wave 
                        your hand through her.

           Norm attempts to wave his hand through her face but SMACKS her 
           hard on the nose instead.

           The ATTRACTIVE WOMAN SCREAMS AND JUMPS FROM HIM.

                                 NORM 
                        You’re not CGI, you’re real!  You 
                        don’t have to mouth everything, you 
                        can speak.  Try saying something.

           The ATTRACTIVE WOMAN speaks as if talking for the first time.

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                        What do you want?

           Taken aback by her own words, the Extra blanches.  Norm beams, 
           he got her say something.

                                 NORM
                        Me and my friend, we need your help.
           Norm looks behind him to see Reynold already plasticuffed by 
           the SECURITY GUARDS.

                                 REYNOLD
                        Plasticuffs?  What’d this cost?  Ten 
                        cents?  It’s like we’re in an 
                        infomercial made by assfaces!

           Norm and the Woman move close to each other, backing towards 
           the window.

           The HEAD SECURITY GUARD lifts up his GUN and inches towards 
           Norm.  The ATTRACTIVE WOMAN SHRIEKS with fright.

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                        Please don’t!  I didn’t do anything!

           He FIRES!

           Norm JUMPS in front of the bullets, grabs the Woman, and 
           CRASHES through and out the window.  They sail through the 
           air...

           ... AND LAND in a moving truck-bed full of SOFT PILLOWS.  The 
           truck drives away.

           The Security Guard shakes his head at his misfortune. 

                                 REYNOLD
                        Only in the effin’ movies.
                                                             END CHASE:

           INT/EXT. TRUCK BED - DUSK

           The truck leaves the city and goes onto a winding highway as 
           the sun sets.  Norm and the Woman sit looking opposite ways.

                                 NORM
                        I’m sorry I dragged you into this.

           The Woman, in spectacular confusion, looks at Norm.  She sees 
           no bullet holes in his shirt.

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                        What exactly is it that you dragged 
                        me into?

                                 NORM
                        ME?  This is all your fault, if you 
                        hadn’t sat next to me in the bar then 
                        I wouldn’t have-- trust me, when this 
                        truck stops, you can go back to your 
                        mime life and pretend to pretend I 
                        don’t exist.
                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                             (shakes her head)
                        I don’t think I can do that.  I don’t 
                        feel the same.  Something feels very 
                        wrong.  Something’s changed.

           Norm mulls over how to empathize with such an experience.

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m talking... to you.  I’m not in my 
                        office.  This doesn’t feel right.

                                 NORM
                        I don’t know how else to say this 
                        without sounding like I flew over the 
                        cuckoo’s nest, so I’m just gonna say 
                        it.  You’re in a movie.

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                        What do you mean?

                                 NORM
                        You’re in a movie.  This, all this, 
                        it’s a movie.  We’re in a movie.

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                        A movie?  About what?

                                 NORM
                        About yours truly, okay, I know, not 
                        what you’d expect, but there you have 
                        it in its full frontal absurdity.  
                        You’re in a movie about me.

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                        Who would want to do a movie about 
                        you?

                                 NORM
                        Let’s just take it easy with the mind-
                        bending questions.

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                        And why would a movie about you have 
                        anything to do with me?

                                 NORM
                        Don’t you understand?  We are in a 
                        movie right now.  This conversation 
                        is just a scene in a movie.  You were 
                        an extra in an office scene, now 
                        you’re a plot twist.  Try not to 
                        analyze it, trust me, you start going 
                        down that path and you’ll wind up 
                        tripping balls.
                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                             (hurt)
                        I was a what?

                                 NORM
                        An extra.  Background.  

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                        I’m just a background character in a 
                        movie about you?

           Norm catches the horror of the Woman’s logic and considers it 
           deeply for perhaps the first time.  The Woman’s face jaunts 
           through pain and confusion.

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, it’s just the realization 
                        my life has little to no purpose... 
                        it’s overwhelming me.

                                 NORM
                        That’s not lost on me.  I’m going 
                        through the same thing.  I used to 
                        think my life was meaningless then 
                        discovered it did have meaning... 
                        just a really really stupid one.  
                             (mulling)
                        Ironically it turns out I had it 
                        better when it was meaningless.  I 
                        should have quit while I was ahead.

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                        This movie sounds like a sort of 
                        hell.

           Norm agrees, it’s exactly like a sort of hell.  But he has a 
           plan that could potentially save them both.  He looks around 
           for discretion, then shares the plan in a whisper:

                                 NORM
                        So far we’re heading north.  As long 
                        as we keep going further and further 
                        away from a wedding taking place in 
                        Pennsylvania then the movie can’t end 
                        and we can live... sort of.

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                        If we don’t go to a wedding in 
                        Pennsylvania, we live... sort of?

                                 NORM
                        We keep our distance, then my friend 
                        Sally Wind should be able to get 
                        married.   After that, we should be 
                        fine as long as we don’t...
           Norm gets caught up staring at the Woman’s intense beauty.  
           The truck RATTLES, snapping him out of it.

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                        This is so strange... it’s like I 
                        have no personality, no memories, no 
                        likes or dislikes, no soul... I don’t 
                        even have a name.

           The Attractive Woman sits glumly, lost in her own emptiness.

           She catches a GLIMPSE of herself in the truck’s back window 
           reflection.  It’s the first time she’s ever seen herself.

           Norm attempts to console her:

                                 NORM
                        How about Mary?  Mary’s a nice name.

           She shakes her head.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Tiffany, Cindy, Debbie?

           She shakes no, doesn’t like it.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Too 80’s pop star.  How about 
                        something funky, like Star, Amber, or 
                        Precocious?

           Nah, she doesn’t like it.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, too 80’s porn star.

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                        Precocious?

                                 NORM
                        There’s a successful porn franchise 
                        from the mid-80’s called “Precocious 
                        Puberty.”

                                 EXTRA
                             (thinking...)
                        Is that what it sounds--

                                 NORM
                        --exactly what it sounds like.  
                             (thinking)
                        How about Amelia?
                                 EXTRA
                             (smiles and nods)
                        That works.  I like it.  I’m...

                                 AMELIA
                        ... Amelia.

           Norm likes it too.  The name fits beautifully.  Sensing he’s 
           getting carried away, he fake yawns in an attempt to dispel 
           any emotion he might have.

                                 NORM
                        Listen, Amelia, I’m glad we did this, 
                        but I’m super sleepy.  I’ve only been 
                        up for only an hour but it feels like 
                        days...

           Amelia looks at him, dripping with concern.

                                 AMELIA
                        Norm...  We’re really not real?

                                 NORM
                             (shakes his head)
                        Looks like we’re just pre-conceived 
                        fictional characters created for the 
                        amusement of a-holes, d-bags and c-
                        rags.  

           The news hits Amelia hard.  She solemnly looks at OTHER 
           DRIVERS IN THEIR CARS: a family, a couple, a lonely man. 

           Norm SEES what she sees, the other drivers living out their 
           nothing existences.

                                 AMELIA
                        We’re not real.  I don’t understand 
                        how you can take that so lightly?

                                 NORM
                        It’s like my therapist always said, 
                        when life’s got you on your knees, 
                        you might as well shut your eyes and 
                        hope it’ll stop at foreplay.  

                                 AMELIA
                        I’m serious.  If this whole thing is 
                        fake, including us, then what’s the 
                        point of even fighting it?

                                 NORM
                        Because I don’t have any better 
                        ideas.  
                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Because part of me actually holds out 
                        hope that I’m crazy and this whole 
                        thing is just a horrible existential 
                        misunderstanding.

           She doesn’t really get it, but...

                                 AMELIA
                        Okay.

           They share a look and a moment.

                                 NORM
                        I think you like red.
                             (gestures)
                        Your shoes, and hair-tie, and your...

           Embarrassed, he references the red bra underneath her top.  
           She looks down with a smile, somewhat proud of herself.

                                 AMELIA
                        You’re right.  I think I do like red.  
                        Red’s a good color.

                                 NORM
                        Yes, well, not for sports cars, high 
                        insurance rates, but that’s not what 
                        you were referring to, so...

           He pathetically lets his own voice trail off.

           She sweetly looks at him.

                                 AMELIA
                        Thank you for taking me with you.

                                 NORM
                        Don’t thank me yet.  I don’t know how 
                        this is all going to end.

                                 AMELIA
                        Thank you for saving me from the 
                        background...

           They exchange timid smiles, when Amelia notices something...

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Norm, is your ass pussing?

           Norm sits up quickly.  He looks down and sees his ass is 
           indeed PUSSING through his PANTS.
                                 NORM
                             (trying to laugh it off)
                        Shoot, my ass is pussing. Well, 
                        isn’t this embarrassing?

           Amelia nods in agreement.

                                 AMELIA
                        Yes.  It is.

                                 NORM
                        Don’t worry, I had an abscess removed 
                        from my left ass cheek not so long 
                        ago and I haven’t changed the bandage 
                        in awhile.

           Amelia GAGS on the evil of the situation.

                                 AMELIA
                        Really bad job at lowering the worry.

           The truck JERKS to a stop.  They both see a MASSIVE GAY 
           PROTEST in the middle of the highway.  A POLICEMAN walks up to 
           the TRUCK DRIVER and directs him to an off ramp.

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Sorry sir, you’re gonna have to turn 
                        around.  There’s a peaceful gay 
                        protest going on.  Hey, I don’t like 
                        it either, but what are you gonna do?  
                        They’re people from far away.

           Amelia looks over at Norm.

                                 AMELIA
                        A gay protest in the middle of the 
                        highway?

           Norm sees the off ramp sign: “SOUTH - PENNSYLVANIA”

                                 NORM
                        The movie’s doing this.  We have to 
                        get off this truck.

           EXT. STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           Amelia helps Norm walk towards a SMALL AIRPORT.

                                 AMELIA
                        Let’s get to that airport, we’ll head 
                        up north faster--

           Norm shakes his head vigorously, his face melting in fear.  A 
           PLANE FLIES OVERHEAD, turning Norm into a scared little girl.
                                 NORM
                        No, no, no, no.  I can’t fly or I’ll 
                        die on the inside.

           He spots a TRAIN STATION nearby.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Trains are so nice, let’s try that.

           INT. TRAIN STATION - LATER

           Amelia helps Norm through the busy station.

                                 AMELIA
                        Do you have any money?

                                 NORM
                        Check my back pocket.

           Amelia looks at his back pocket and it’s drenched in GOO.

                                 AMELIA
                        I don’t think I can and still want to 
                        live.

                                 NORM
                        I understand.  Tell you what.  Just 
                        flirt with the ticket guy.

                                 AMELIA
                        Come on, that stuff only works in 
                        the...

           Norm gestures with his head “exactly.”  Amelia nods in 
           agreement.

           She lets her hair down, unbuttons her blouse, and puts on a 
           smile.  She’s stunning.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        Am I good?

           Norm is too mesmerized by the sheer power of her sexuality.

                                 NORM
                        Good as wood... 
                             (not realizing what he’s 
                              saying)
                        ... Woodchuck could, would, what, I 
                        forgot how that went, how does it go 
                        again?  That second part, ah, it’s 
                        such a stupid limerick, I’ll get it 
                        though, give me a minute.

           Amelia awkwardly waits while Norm struggles to remember.
                                 AMELIA
                        Is whatever you’re thinking about 
                        important?

                                 NORM
                        ‘Important’ isn’t the right word, no.

           Amelia hands Norm her RED HAIR TIE and STRUTS toward a TICKET 
           BOOTH and flashes a huge smile at the GUY manning the station.

                                 AMELIA 
                        I need two tickets for any train 
                        going as far north as possible and I 
                        have no money.

                                 TICKET GUY
                        Money is for ugly people.

           He quickly HANDS her two tickets.

           INT. TRAIN CAR BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Norm and Amelia sit in a tiny booth as other PATRONS walk back 
           and forth.  Norm is still in pain from his ass pus.

                                 NORM
                        I can’t sit for much longer.  My ass 
                        is on fire dammit!

                                 AMELIA
                        Inside voice Norm.  Inside voice.

                                 NORM
                             (leans in and whispers)
                        I’m sorry, I just need a new bandage 
                        soon.  My ass is starting to feel 
                        like the humid swamps of the Amazon.

                                 AMELIA 
                        I didn’t mean whisper it to me, I 
                        meant keep your thoughts inside your 
                        head.  Kind of like you’re talking to 
                        yourself, but not out loud.

           Amelia spots a GRAY-HAIRED MAN carrying a DOCTOR’S BAG with a 
           stethoscope hugging the handle.

           He walks past them and sits in the booth behind them.  Norm 
           looks at the back of the man’s head.  He seems familiar.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                             (whispering)
                        That guy’s a doctor.
                                 NORM
                        How do you know?

           She points to the DOCTOR’S BAG which now sits on the floor.

                                 AMELIA
                        Go to our car.  I’m gonna steal his 
                        bag and meet you there in a minute.

           Norm stares at the back of his head.

                                 NORM
                        Something weird is happening.  I know 
                        that guy.

                                 AMELIA
                        The doctor?

                                 NORM
                        Yeah.

                                 AMELIA
                        Who is he?

           Norm draws a blank.

                                 NORM
                        I don’t know.

                                 AMELIA
                        Want me to take him out? 

                                 NORM
                        Why would I want you to do that?

                                 AMELIA
                             (shrugs)
                        Because he might be dangerous?

                                 NORM
                        That’s a possibility.

                                 AMELIA
                        So I should take him out then?

                                 NORM
                        Just so we’re clear, are you talking 
                        about killing him?

                                 AMELIA
                        No, I don’t want to kill anyone.

                                 NORM
                        Knocking him out then?
                                 AMELIA
                        Why on earth would I do that?

                                 NORM
                        Okay, this conversation probably 
                        isn’t going to be a useful exercise.  
                        How about I go back to our car and 
                        you steal the doctor’s bag and no one 
                        goes out?

           Amelia nods.  Norm stands up and stammers away.

           The DOCTOR looks behind him and sees the back of Norm, 
           recognizing him as well.

           INT. TRAIN CAR - LATER

           Norm is lying face down on the fold out bed.  Amelia is 
           straddled on top of him, wearing a surgical mask, and changing 
           the bandage.

           In mid-conversation:

                                 AMELIA
                             (gagging at the smell)
                        God this reeks like a thousand farts.

                                 NORM 
                        I get it, you don’t have to keep 
                        upping the number.

           Amelia finishes putting the bandage on.

                                 AMELIA 
                        All done.  Here, I stole the doctor’s 
                        pants too.  Don’t ask me why, just 
                        thank your lucky stars I’m that good.

           Norm sits up and puts the oversized pants on.  Amelia removes 
           the surgical mask.  They sit on the fold out bed together.

                                 NORM
                        Thanks again.  Feels much better.
                             (re: pants)
                        That wasn’t some sly way of telling 
                        me you slept with the doctor, right?

           Amelia puts her head down, deep in thought.

                                 AMELIA
                        Norm, we have to face... fictions 
                        here.  Every movie has to end.  It’s 
                        inevitable.

           Norm LAUGHS in relief.
                                 NORM
                        Oh man, I really thought you were 
                        about to tell me you DID sleep with 
                        that doctor.  I am rah-lieved.

           Beat as Norm’s awkward laughter continues to trail off.

                                 AMELIA 
                        Do you ever wonder why you were 
                        picked to be the star of the movie?

                                 NORM
                        Have not, no.  
                             (wonders...)
                        But even now that I’m thinking about 
                        it, I can’t really see it.  I’m a guy 
                        so familiar with failure we’re 
                        practically Facebook friends.  I’m 
                        alone, my friends only relate to me 
                        on an opportunistic level, I shuffle 
                        paper around for a living, only I 
                        don’t even do that cause everything’s 
                        online, so we use emails and PDFs.

           Norm’s realization hits him in the pit of his stomach.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        I literally just push buttons that 
                        aren’t even real for a living.  If 
                        you can even call it ‘living.’

                                 AMELIA 
                             (sympathetic)
                        That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t like 
                        yourself...despite all the 
                        overwhelming reasons to the contrary.

           The proposition is foreign to Norm.

                                 NORM
                        My therapist always told me it’s 
                        dangerous to like myself unless I had 
                        a very good reason.

                                 AMELIA
                             (horrified)
                        Who is this f-face? Norm, not 
                        everything has to have an 
                        explanation.  Besides, if this is all 
                        a movie, isn’t that stuff pointless 
                        to believe in anyway?

           A moment of understanding breaks through Norm’s force field.
                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        If this movie is about you, then why 
                        not make it about what you really 
                        want and forget all that malarkey 
                        your therapist said.

           Norm’s heart drips with emotion.  He fights it off.

                                 NORM
                        A, I think you’re just getting swept 
                        up in the little adventure we’re on 
                        and b, I can’t have what I want or 
                        everyone dies.  It’s hard to explain, 
                        you’ll just have to trust me.

           She looks into his eyes fearlessly.

                                 AMELIA
                        I know why they picked you.  
                        Overwhelming reasons to the contrary 
                        notwithstanding.  You see things.

                                 NORM
                             (scoffs)
                        Me?  No, I’m spiritually blind, I 
                        can’t see anything.

                                 AMELIA
                        You saw me.  You saved me.

           Norm’s force-field is obliterated.

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Maybe that’s why they picked you.  
                        They thought, no way this could 
                        happen with someone who hates himself 
                        so much that it’s almost funny.  
                             (beat)
                        But you aren’t what they see Norm, 
                        you’re something more.

           Norm is uncomfortable by the intensity.

                                 NORM
                        You really mean all that?

                                 AMELIA
                        Asking me with such definitiveness is 
                        making think about it a little but 
                        let’s go with it.

           Norm shifts, he’s never felt this kind of adoration before.
                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        You started to say something earlier, 
                        that this was all my fault.  What did 
                        you mean by that?

                                 NORM
                        First scene of the movie, I was 
                        sitting in a bar having a drink.  I 
                        should have gotten up and went home, 
                        but you sat next to me so I stayed to 
                        talk to you.  If I hadn’t done that, 
                        then I wouldn’t have gotten drunk, I 
                        would have taken my pills, and the 
                        movie would have gone on as planned.

                                 AMELIA
                        Then why did you stay?

                                 NORM
                        Because you were so b--

           He stops at beautiful, remembering he can’t do this at the 
           risk of everyone’s existence.  He can’t fall in love with her.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Because I was lonely, I wanted to 
                        talk to someone.  It didn’t matter 
                        anyway, you completely ignored me.

                                 AMELIA
                        That’s not my fault, extras aren’t 
                        allowed to talk.  Sort of by 
                        definition.

                                 NORM
                        You don’t recall meeting me at the 
                        bar, do you?

           Amelia searches, but can’t place the encounter.  Norm’s 
           fleeting happiness is suddenly muted.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        If I’m something more, then don’t you 
                        think you would have remembered me?

           An awkward, sad moment passes.  The SUN RISES through the 
           windows and the scene is romantic.

           Norm pulls away, closes his eyes and thinks hard.

                                 AMELIA
                        What’s wrong, what are you doing?
                                 NORM
                        Nothing.  I just don’t want the movie 
                        getting any ideas...  I need to pee.

           EXT. BATHROOM - HALLWAYS

           Norm looks at both pictures on the bathroom doors.  One is of 
           a PINK ALLIGATOR, and the other is a GREEN CHEETAH.  He’s 
           confused as to which sex is which.  He goes for the green 
           cheetah.

           OUT comes a MAN from the pink alligator.  Norm switches to the 
           pink alligator, and OUT comes a WOMAN with disheveled hair and 
           a smile.  Clearly she’s just had guilty sex with the MAN.

                                 NORM
                        Sorry, is this the men’s--

                                 PINK ALLIGATOR WOMAN
                             (guilty, frantic)
                        --So what?  I didn’t do anything!  
                        It’s not against the law to have sex 
                        on the train, is it?  Is it?  He 
                        raped me!

           SCREEEEECH!!  The train JERKS to the right.  

           Amelia JUMPS INTO THE HALLWAY and runs to Norm.

                                 AMELIA
                        What’s happening?

           Norm looks out the window.  The train is turning ONTO ANOTHER 
           TRACK, in effect doing a complete 180.

                                 NORM
                        The movie’s turning the train around.

           Norm sees TWO TRAIN SERVICEMEN KNOCKING on car doors.

           Norm and Amelia run down the hallway away from the two train 
           servicemen.  The servicemen SPOT them and run after them.

                                                           BEGIN CHASE:

           EXT. TRAIN (MOVING) - DAY

           Through the windows of the moving train, we see Norm and 
           Amelia being chased by the two train servicemen throughout the 
           different cars.

           CAR #1 - KITCHEN CAR.  Norm and Amelia dodge ERRATIC KNIFE 
           PLAY by the CHEERY, ALOOF CHEFS.  
           Norm dodges one dangerous KNIFE SWIPE, which stabs the leg of 
           TRAIN SERVICEMEN #1 behind him.  He now BLEEDS PROFUSELY.  The 
           chase goes on.

           CAR #2 - DINING CAR.  Norm and Amelia dodge WAITERS AND FOOD 
           CARTS as they try to make their way across.  

           Close on their tails, TRAIN SERVICEMAN #2 helps the limping 
           Train Serviceman #1 who still bleeds profusely from his leg.  

           Norm dodges A FLAMING DISH aimed for him, which lands on Train 
           Serviceman #1 instead and sets him on FIRE.  Train Serviceman 
           #2 puts it out with a nearby fire extinguisher.

           CAR #3 - BAR CAR.  Norm and Amelia dodge the DRUNKS of the bar 
           as they make their way to the other side.  Train Serviceman #2 
           continues to help the limping, blackened burn victim that is 
           Train Serviceman #1.  

           Norm accidently bumps into a PRETTY WOMAN which angers her 
           HUGE BOYFRIEND.  The boyfriend turns to see Train Serviceman 
           #1, thinking he’s the culprit. He PUNCHES THE SHIT out of him.

           CAR #4 - DANCE CAR.  Norm and Amelia dodge and dance around 
           the CRAZY DANCERS as they make their way across.  

           Train Serviceman #2 helps the limping, blackened, bloody mess 
           that is Train Serviceman #1.  In the midst of the dance floor, 
           Norm eludes an AGILE MALE DANCER who instead takes Train 
           Serviceman #1 by the hands and sweeps him in between his legs.

           Train Serviceman #1 SLIDES across the car into the...

           LAST CAR - END OF THE TRAIN.  Norm and Amelia see the sliding 
           serviceman heading their way.  They JUMP on the rails of the 
           end car as Train Serviceman #1 SLIDES through and OFF THE END 
           of the train to his death.

                                                             END CHASE:

           Train Serviceman #2 RUNS to the rails and watches his friend 
           fade in the distance.  He looks at Norm and Amelia who stand 
           defiantly against him.

                                 TRAIN SERVICEMAN #2
                        Please.  Stop.  No more.  The doctor 
                        just needed his bag and pants back.  
                        I will beg if you require it.

           Norm and Amelia don’t quite know how to respond.

                                 NORM
                        I’m sorry but I think your friend was 
                        the victim of a horrible movie gag.
                                 TRAIN SERVICEMAN #2 
                             (thinking they’re crazy)
                        Very well then.

           He kneels and begins BEGGING.

           BEHIND NORM AND AMELIA

           The DOCTOR stands with an alarmed expression and no pants.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Norm?

           Norm turns around and sees his...

                                 NORM 
                        Dad?

           Norm’s Dad hugs him tightly, on the brink of tears.

                                 NORM’S DAD 
                        I’ve missed you so much.  Where have 
                        you been?

           A mix bag of emotions, Norm hugs him back.

                                 NORM
                        Dad... it’s you?  It’s really you.

           Norm clings on to his understanding of the non-reality he is 
           stuck in and pulls away abruptly.

                                 AMELIA
                        Norm, is this your father?

           Confusion tears through Norm’s face.

                                 NORM’S DAD
                        Son, it’s me.  We have to get off at 
                        the next stop.  Your mother’s--

                                 NORM
                        --Sick?  She’s dying.

           Norm’s Dad solemnly nods.

                                 NORM’S DAD
                        That’s right.

           The train JERKS to a stop as Norm and his father look at each 
           other.  Amelia doesn’t know what to make of any of this.

                                 NORM’S DAD (CONT’D)
                        Your mother’s been asking for you 
                        son.  I don’t know how much longer--
           He can’t bring himself to say the words.

           A wave of confusion crashes over Norm.  His eyes tremble.

                                 NORM
                        I... I have to see her.

           INT. GOLDWORM FAMILY HOUSE - LATER

           Norm and Amelia look around the aged, dimly lit living room.  
           Amelia attempts to bring Norm back to our preposterous logic.

                                 AMELIA
                        Norm?  This guy really your father?

                                 NORM
                        I don’t-- yes, I think so?

                                 AMELIA
                        But how can he really be your 
                        anything--

           Norm spots FAMILY PICTURES on the mantle.

                                 NORM
                        --Oh my God.  It’s me.  As a kid.

           Norm’s Dad enters the living room.

                                 NORM’S DAD
                        What’s the matter Norm?

           Norm looks at his dad.  Amelia senses something’s sketch.

                                 AMELIA
                        Norm, we should think about this.

           Norm’s Dad holds up a picture of a CHUBBY KID AND YOUNG NORM 
           in little league uniforms.

                                 NORM’S DAD
                        Here’s you and Reynold.  You weren’t 
                        the best in little league, but you 
                        weren’t the wor--
                             (stops himself before 
                              making a false statement)
                        Hmm.

           With a CHUCKLE, he lifts up another PICTURE.

                                 NORM’S DAD (CONT'D)
                        And here’s one of me and you buying 
                        your first car.  Lasted four days 
                        before you totaled it.  
                                 NORM’S DAD (CONT'D)
                        Kinda broke the bank on me a little 
                        cause that was the same year of the 
                        88 recession when my holdings went 
                        down by 50%.
                             (chuckles uncomfortably)
                        As it happened anyway.

           A rapid flurry of emotions swipe at Norm’s understanding.

                                 NORM’S DAD (CONT'D)
                        And here’s another one of you and 
                        your...

           A PICTURE of LITTLE NORM and his BEAUTIFUL MOTHER.

                                 NORM
                        Mom.  That’s my mom.  Where is she?

           MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Norm slowly walks into the arcane bedroom.  There, his sick 
           MOTHER lies still in bed.

           Amelia hesitantly stands by, unsure of her place now.

                                 AMELIA
                        Norm?  Please tell me what’s going 
                        on...

           He offers no response, his eyes locked on his MOTHER.  He 
           walks over to her and kneels by her bed.

                                 NORM
                        Mom.

           She WHEEZES AND COUGHS.  Her eyes light up when she sees Norm.

                                 MOTHER
                        Norman.  Where have you been my boy?
                             (inspects his skinny body)
                        Skin and bones, skin and bones.  
                             (to Amelia)
                        Girl, wipe that gawk off your face 
                        and fix my dear son a sandwich before 
                        I dock your wages.

                                 NORM
                        No.  This is Amelia.  She’s a friend 
                        of mine. Sort of. We’re like cousins.

                                 MOTHER
                        You seem lost Norm.  True, you always 
                        were, but different this time, more 
                        stupefied.  Tell me, are you still 
                        mentally ill?
                                 NORM
                        More than ever, more than ever.
                             (emotional)
                        Mom... I don’t remember anything.

                                 MOTHER
                        Do you remember that I’m dying 
                        Norman?

                                 NORM
                        I do.

                                 MOTHER
                        My wish was to see you.

           Norm’s eyes begin to well up.

                                 NORM
                        I’m here now.

           His mother shoots Amelia an evil glance.

                                 MOTHER
                        I thought I raised you better than to 
                        date the help. 

                                 NORM
                             (with a smile, fondly)
                        You were always critical of my 
                        choices as an adult.

                                 MOTHER
                        Marry Sally Wind, Norm.

           The mention of Sally FLOORS Norm.

                                 NORM
                        What?

                                 MOTHER
                        Marry her.  She made you so happy.  
                        You two were so perfect together.  
                        Marry her.

                                 NORM
                        But Mom, she’s already getting 
                        married.  Today.  To Tom.

                                 MOTHER
                        She doesn’t love him.  She loves you.  
                        A mother can sense these things.  Go 
                        to her Norm.  Go to her...

           She COUGHS AND WHEEZES.
           Norm’s Dad rushes to her aid.  Norm backs away with care.

                                 NORM
                        What’s happening?

           Norm’s Dad checks her vitals.  He listens with his 
           stethoscope.  After a moment, he puts his head down.

                                 NORM’S DAD
                        She’s passed son.  Perhaps she was 
                        holding on to see you one last time.

           Norm looks around with a long face of guilt and grief.

                                 NORM
                        Where’s the sad music?
                             (he looks up, angry)
                        Where’s the sad music!

           Silence only greets him.

           LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Norm, wearing a petrified and exasperated expression, sits 
           next to Amelia who remains suspiciously concerned.

                                 AMELIA
                        Norm, I know you’re confused but we 
                        can’t stay here. We have to head 
                        north, remember?

           Norm is too dizzy with emotion to comprehend.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        Norm!  Look at me.

           She pulls his face to hers.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        Remember this is a movie.  Those are 
                        your fake movie parents.

                                 NORM
                        That was my mom.

                                 AMELIA
                        What are you talking about?  Remember 
                        me, Amelia, I’m the office extra that 
                        you saved.  Remember that?

           Norm is lost in a gaze.

                                 NORM
                        I officially don’t know what’s 
                        happening anymore.
           Norm’s Dad enters the living room with Dr. Norton behind him.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Hello Norm.

                                 NORM’S DAD
                        I called Dr. Norton and told him that 
                        your mother passed.  He felt it would 
                        be prudent to pay a visit.

           Norm reluctantly nods and stands up.  

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Perhaps a moment in the den.

           He follows Dr. Norton into the den.

           Amelia follows, but Norm’s Dad interrupts her.

                                 NORM’S DAD 
                        I think they’d like to speak in 
                        private.  Would you like some tea?

           As Norm leaves her, Amelia feels her life slip away.

           DEN - LATER

           Norm lies down on the couch.  Dr. Norton takes a chair behind 
           the couch, using the same set up as he does in his office.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        How do you feel about your mother’s 
                        death Norm?

                                 NORM
                        How do I feel?  It just happened five 
                        minutes ago?  I don’t know how I 
                        feel.  Let me kill your mother and 
                        ask you in five minutes.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Have you fantasized about killing my 
                        mother?

                                 NORM
                        What?  No, why would I fantasize 
                        about that?

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Because you secretly want to cause me 
                        pain?

                                 NORM
                        Is that what you think--
                                 DR. NORTON 
                        --You said something curious before.  
                        You said your mother died five 
                        minutes ago.  But your father said it 
                        happened about three hours ago.  This 
                        morning in fact.  Have you still been 
                        experiencing some memory loss?

                                 NORM
                        It’s not memory loss Dr. Norton.

           He sits up, looks him eye to eye.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        I’m a movie character.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Say again?

                                 NORM
                        This...

           He gestures at the world they occupy.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Is a movie.  About me. There’s a 
                        score, there’s flashbacks, and voice 
                        over--

                                 DR. NORTON
                        --Norm.  You’re not in a movie.  I’m 
                        afraid you’re experiencing what is 
                        commonly known today as the “Truman 
                        Show” disorder.  A schizophrenic 
                        delusion that engenders a creeping, 
                        pervasive feeling that your every 
                        move, inside your home and out, is 
                        being filmed for a movie starring 
                        you.

           The news sucker punches Norm.  

                                 DR. NORTON (CONT’D)
                        Since the proliferation of video and 
                        digital media, this disorder was 
                        birthed as sort of a nasty by-product 
                        of the YouTube generation.  These 
                        cases have unfortunately been 
                        reported around the world in growing 
                        numbers, usually to patients who feel 
                        they lead mundane existences such as 
                        yourself. 
                                 NORM
                        This can’t be all in my head.  What 
                        about Amelia?  She’s an extra.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Norm, you weren’t with anyone when 
                        your dad found you.  You kept 
                        referring to someone with that name, 
                        but no such person was there.

                                 NORM
                        What are you talking about?  She was 
                        with me.

           With a PANIC, he WALKS out of the den and into the...

           LIVING ROOM

           And sees his father sipping tea.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Where’s Amelia?

           Dr. Norton walks in behind him.

                                 NORM’S DAD
                        There is no Amelia, Norm.  You kept 
                        calling the maid Amelia.

           He gestures to the OLD SPANISH MAID.

                                 NORM’S DAD (CONT'D)
                        But Karla doesn’t even speak English.

                                 KARLA
                             (in Spanish, subtitled)
                        I put something special in your 
                        sandwich Norm.  The same special 
                        sauce your dear, dear evil mother ate 
                        the day before her sickness.  Your 
                        death will be even sweeter.

                                 NORM’S DAD
                             (not understanding her)
                        Yes Karla, you may bring out the 
                        sandwich now.

           Karla exits.  Norm’s Dad shakes his head.

                                 NORM’S DAD (CONT'D)
                        The Mexicans sure do flap a lot for a 
                        little.  All that for a sandwich?
                                 NORM
                        What about my ass pus?

           He pulls down his pants.  No bandage.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        What about Reynold, talk to Reynold.  
                        He’s in jail because they were trying 
                        to stop us.  Ask him!

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Reynold phoned us.  Last we spoke, he 
                        was heading down to Sally’s wedding 
                        to take Tom out on the town for his 
                        bachelor party.  He said you never 
                        showed up.  He took all your 
                        designated lap dances as a result.  
                        He’s uploaded them on flickr and 
                        emailed you a share link.

           Norm desperately tries one last attempt at his movie theory.

                                 NORM
                        Okay, you wanna know how I know I’m 
                        not crazy.  Listen to this: FUCK!

           The word ECHOES with deafening certainty.

           Reality crashes down on Norm.  He covers his mouth quickly.  
           He shakes his head at the defining realization.

           He said the word FUCK.  It’s official.  He is crazy. FUCK!!!!

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        I can’t believe this.  I’m going 
                        crazy.  I’m actually nuts.  It felt 
                        so real...  Reynold, Sally, Amelia... 
                        all of it felt so real.

           Norm’s Dad rises quickly.

                                 NORM’S DAD
                        How about we take in some fresh air?

           EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Norm, his Dad, and Dr. Norton walk through the large grounds.  
           The fall colors are beautiful.  Norm sees a TIRE SWING, a TREE 
           HOUSE, an OLD BICYCLE.  He’s dumbfounded.

                                 NORM
                        All my old stuff.

                                 DR. NORTON 
                        It’s going to be okay Norm.
                                 NORM
                        Tell me Doc, was it the ecstasy?

                                 DR. NORTON
                        The reasons for this kind of thing 
                        are different in each case.  I read 
                        in one case a patient reported that 
                        he came to New York to see if the 
                        Twin Towers were still standing, 
                        because he believed that seeing their 
                        destruction on television was part of 
                        his reality show.  If they were still 
                        standing, he said, then he would know 
                        that the terrorist attack was all 
                        part of the script.  Who knows what 
                        the actual onset was in your case, 
                        what we have to do right now is focus 
                        on getting you better.  We have all 
                        the time in the world for 
                        psychoanalysis.

           Norm swims in his own pathos, the moment so unreal for him.

                                 DR. NORTON (CONT’D)
                        It’s foreseeable when a close 
                        relative is dying, such as your 
                        mother, and one feels the illness is 
                        without their control, they will slip 
                        into schizophrenic delusions as a way 
                        to deflect coping with the pain.  In 
                        your case it physically materialized 
                        as a fabricated ass abscess initially 
                        then progressed into this whole movie 
                        business thereafter.

           Norm nods, the full extent of his mental illness coming into 
           focus.  He looks at his Dad with regretful eyes.

                                 NORM
                        I’m sorry I took ecstasy three years 
                        ago.  A girl swindled me into taking 
                        it.  She said I’d feel like Batman.  
                        I didn’t.

                                 NORM’S DAD
                        It’s okay, son.  Like the doctor 
                        said, the key right now is to get 
                        better.

                                 NORM
                        And Dr. Norton, I’m sorry.  I broke 
                        your cardinal rule and thought I was 
                        special.
                                 DR. NORTON
                        Don’t tear yourself up about it Norm, 
                        lots of people suffer from that 
                        belief.  Your father’s right, the key 
                        is to really make a breakthrough 
                        today and help you get healthy again.

           Norm nods.

                                 DR. NORTON (CONT’D)
                        Tell me something Norm.  What did 
                        your mother say on her death bed?

                                 NORM
                        What does that matter?

                                 DR. NORTON
                        I’m curious is all.  Your dad felt 
                        she mentioned something of peculiar 
                        interest.

                                 NORM 
                        She told me to go to Sally Wind.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        I see, the girl we have discussed 
                        being the cause for most of your 
                        social anxiety in a number of our 
                        sessions together.

                                 NORM
                        Yes.  She’s getting married today.  
                        In Lehigh, Pennsylvania.  She wants 
                        me to go to her.

                                 DR. NORTON
                             (smiles)
                        Sounds like your mother was a 
                        hopeless romantic?

                                 NORM’S DAD
                             (nods with a forced smile)
                        She was.
                             (shakes his head, mutters 
                              to himself bitterly)
                        Hopeless.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        If you want, the White Plains 
                        airfield is nearby.  I could get you 
                        to Lehigh on my small private plane 
                        within the hour.  I know you have a 
                        deathly fear of flying, but--
                                 NORM
                             (suspicious)
                        --What?  You wanna take me to Sally 
                        Wind’s wedding now?  I knew it, this 
                        is all a trick!  That’s what the 
                        movie wants!

           Dr. Norton and Norm’s Dad trade concerned looks.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        You think the movie wants you to go 
                        to Sally Wind’s wedding?

                                 NORM
                        Yes.  It wants me to crash it so I 
                        can stop her from marrying Tom and 
                        ask her to marry me instead.  Now 
                        you’re suspiciously offering to take 
                        me!  Why on earth would I do that?  
                        I’m clearly not well, why would you 
                        be encouraging me to crash a wedding 
                        at a time like this?

                                 NORM’S DAD
                        But Norm, you wouldn’t be crashing 
                        it.  You were invited, see?

           Norm’s Dad holds up the wedding invitation that has a POORLY 
           MADE SKETCH of Sally and Tom.  He grabs it and begins reading.  

           After a moment, he searches in the air.  Reads, then searches 
           once again.  Once more, he resigns to his hallucinations...

                                 NORM
                        No voice-over...  That’s impossible, 
                        people who see movies don’t read.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Perhaps going to the wedding could 
                        help demystify this whole movie 
                        illusion once and for all?

           Norm’s trust for Dr. Norton wavers.  He looks at his father.

                                 NORM’S DAD
                        Only do it if you want son.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        It’s completely up to you Norm.  We 
                        don’t want to push you.

                                 NORM
                             (nods)
                        I’ll do it.  For Mom.  Because she 
                        was a hopeless romantic.
                                 NORM’S DAD
                             (smiles)
                        She was.
                             (mutters with disgust)
                        Hopeless.

           I/E. DR. NORTON’S SUV - LATER

           Norm sits in the passenger seat next to Dr. Norton who’s 
           driving.  He smiles at Norm.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        You doin’ all right slugger?

           Norm doesn’t respond.  Dr. Norton nods.

                                 DR. NORTON (CONT'D)
                        We’ll be on the plane in no time.  
                        You sure you don’t want any Dramamine 
                        for the flight?  No extra charge of 
                        course.  I’ll bill your insurance 
                        directly.

                                 NORM
                             (adamant)
                        No more pills. Besides, I’m too 
                        depressed to be scared.

           I/E. DR. NORTON’S PLANE - LATER

           Dr. Norton checks his dials as he prepares for take-off.  Norm 
           uncomfortably sits in the passenger seat.

           Dr. Norton looks over at Norm.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        How ya doin’ chief--

                                 NORM
                        --Feels uncomfortable when you call 
                        me kid nicknames.  A little 
                        pedophilic even, though I’m of age.  
                        Let’s just stick with Norm.

           Norm lets out a sigh as he mulls over the consequences of his 
           present actions.  He thinks long and hard about the craziness 
           inside him.  How long has it been there?  How did he get here?

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Don’t worry Norm, you’ll be with 
                        Sally in no time.  You’ll finally 
                        have what you’ve always wanted.

           Is this what he wanted?  He shakes his head.
                                 NORM
                        This isn’t what I want.  I want 
                        some...one else

           Dr. Norton laughs this off nervously.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Who?

           Norm stops himself from saying ‘Amelia.’  He turns away from 
           the doctor and stuffs his hands in his pockets.  He feels 
           SOMETHING.  It’s a RED HAIR TIE.  It’s Amelia’s.

           Norm’s been had.

           He looks over at Dr. Norton with contempt.

           The ENGINES SPIN UP.

                                 NORM
                        You motherhuggin’ eff-faced child-
                        effer.

           The jig is up.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Everyone knows you’re allowed one use 
                        of the ‘F’ word in a PG-13 movie.

                                 DR. NORTON
                             (angry)
                        You’re going to the wedding.

           The plane makes its way down the runway.

                                 NORM
                        Stop this plane.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        This is what you’re meant to do Norm.  
                        All of this, us, were created for 
                        this purpose.

                                 NORM
                        STOP THE PLANE DR. NORTON.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Think about this Norm.  What’s the 
                        alternative?  If we miss out on our 
                        only purpose, if that wedding doesn’t 
                        get stopped by you, then what?  We 
                        walk about with no meaning, no reason 
                        to live, no end in sight?  Is that 
                        really what you want?
           Norm contemplates the doctor’s conjecture.

                                 DR. NORTON (CONT'D)
                        This is what we’re created to do.  
                        This is what we were meant for.  This 
                        world was made for you to win Sally 
                        Wind’s love.  Do you really want your 
                        existence to mean nothing?  Do you 
                        wanna feel like you did before?  A 
                        life without definition?

           A faint voice from the outside is heard:

                                 AMELIA (O.S.)
                        Norm!!!

           He looks out the window and sees AMELIA BEING CHASED BY 
           HOSPITAL ORDERLIES as she runs after the plane.  Norm tries to 
           open his door but can’t.

                                 NORM
                        Amelia?

           Dr. Norton with more determination than ever, continues to 
           accelerate the plane down the runway.

           Norm starts HITTING all the dials.

           The plane slows down on the runway as Dr. Norton struggles to 
           stop Norm from damaging the plane.

           Amelia still chases the plane, getting closer to the plane’s 
           backseat as the ORDERLIES get closer to her.

           Norm jumps in the back and tries to open the door.

           He grabs a fire extinguisher and JAMS the lock open.

           Amelia inches away from the door, RUNNING.

           Dr. Norton SPEEDS UP, JERKING THE PLANE AWAY.

           Amelia falls behind.

           Angry, Norm walks back to Dr. Norton.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        What I’m meant for isn’t good enough.

           Dr. Norton says nothing and continues to drive.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        This is a lie.  All of it.  I want to 
                        really swear.  I want to pick out my 
                        own songs for my life.  
                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        I want to like who ever I really
                        like.  I want real meaning Dr. 
                        Norton.

           The airplane SHAKES VIOLENTLY.

                                 DR. NORTON
                             (chuckles)
                        You’re not even real.  Real meaning 
                        isn’t possible for me and you.

                                 NORM
                        It’s the movies. Anything’s possible.

           NORM SPRAYS DR. NORTON WITH THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

           Dr. Norton can’t see at all, and the plane stalls again.

           Amelia finally catches up to the plane.  Norm pulls her in.  

           They kiss!  They’re reunited.

                                 AMELIA
                        We gotta go!

           Norm pushes the foamed out Dr. Norton out of the driver’s seat 
           and onto the runway.  He climbs into his seat.

           The ORDERLIES catch up to the plane.  A FAT ORDERLY jumps at 
           the door, but Amelia CLOSES it in the nick of time.

           Amelia takes the passenger seat.

           AIR TRAFFIC POLICEMEN AND HUMMERS make a wall with drawn guns 
           IN FRONT OF THEM.

           Norm presses the gas and the plane SPEEDS past the COPS.

           The COPS FIRE at them from behind, but nothing.

                                 NORM
                        Eff the police.

                                 AMELIA
                        Eventually we have to fly.

           Amelia points ahead.  The runway ends and the WOODS begin.

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Are you still afraid of flying?

                                 NORM
                        Deathly afraid.
           Norm closes his eyes and pulls the lever down.  The plane is 
           AIRBORNE.  They SCREAM in unbridled enthusiasm.

           She looks down at the ground.  The policemen and dogs are 
           getting smaller and smaller.

           Norm looks at the COMPASS.  It points north.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        We’re heading north.

           Amelia looks out the window.  A HUGE HURRICANE starts to 
           appear before their very eyes.

                                 AMELIA
                        Norm... Norm...

           Norm sees the hurricane.

                                 NORM
                        No...

                                 AMELIA
                        That’s a hurricane...

                                 NORM
                        How the hell can a hurricane come out 
                        of nowhere?

                                 AMELIA
                             (troubled)
                        It’s the movies. Anything’s possible.

           The enormity of the storm multiplies before their eyes.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        You have to turn around.

           The hurricane grows larger and more menacing.

                                 NORM
                        Can’t turn around.

                                 AMELIA
                        Norm, there’s a hurricane right in 
                        front of us.  Turn around NOW!

           The hurricane’s winds build faster and faster.

                                 NORM
                        If they think a hurricane is going to 
                        make me turn around, then they 
                        apparently don’t know that people 
                        that lead mundane existences don’t 
                        have very much to lose.
                                 AMELIA
                        You wanna fly into a hurricane?  
                        Really think about that one.  Really 
                        dig in there.

                                 NORM
                        Amelia, we have no choice.  If we go 
                        to the wedding and this movie ends, 
                        we end.  We’ll die anyway.

           Amelia knows they have no other options.

                                 AMELIA
                        You’re right.  This is it.

           They look at each other.  This is it.

           THE HURRICANE IS MASSIVE AND UP CLOSE NOW.

           THEY SCREAM AS THE PLANE GETS ENVELOPED INTO THE HURRICANE’S 
           HUGE WINDS.  COMPASS GOES BERSERK.

           DEBRIS SMACKS THE PLANE, TEARING IT APART.  

           Norm and Amelia continue to SCREAM!

           MORE DEBRIS SMACKS THE PLANE!  THE HURRICANE ROARS!

           Amelia looks over at Norm and SHOUTS:

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        It was your birthday.  You’re in 
                        between your quarter and mid-life 
                        crisis.  You hate your name.  And you 
                        talked with a weird accent that you 
                        claimed was British but come now.

           Windows inside the plane CRACK OPEN.  COMPASS SPINS.

                                 NORM
                        You remembered me?

                                 AMELIA
                        It took me a second, but I was 
                        initially conceived as a one-
                        dimensional character. Can you blame--

           Amelia’s head hits the door, KNOCKING HER OUT COLD.

           Wind sucks from within as Norm attempts to hang on.

                                 NORM
                             (screaming at the 
                              hurricane)
                        What do you want?  
                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        What will make you stop?  Tell me!  
                        What will make you stop?  I’ll do it, 
                        I swear.

           He looks over at Amelia’s beautiful, lifeless face.

           BANG!!  MORE DEBRIS!

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                             (full of emotion)
                        Please stop!  Please...

           WOOSH! THE PLANE’S ENGINE IS SHOT. COMPASS POINTS SOUTH.

           Norm holds Amelia’s limp hand.

           The plane HEADS DOWN RAPIDLY.

           Norm looks out the front window and he sees a HUGE CHURCH 
           quickly approaching.

           CRASH!!!!!!!!

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           The plane nose dives right through the roof of a church.  

           A weak Norm looks at Amelia.

                                 NORM
                        Amelia?

           He shakes her and she stirs awake.  Norm smiles in relief.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        We movie landed.

           They climb out of the wrecked plane, COUGHING from the dust as 
           they wipe themselves off.  Norm looks around.  He can’t 
           believe it.

           A wedding in service.  SALLY’S WEDDING.  A crowd of SEATED 
           WEDDING GUESTS stare at them.

           Sally, in her bride’s dress, runs to Norm and hugs him.

                                 SALLY
                        Norm, you came after all.

           Stunned, Norm tries to explain by gesturing the hole in the 
           roof.

                                 NORM
                        The hurricane got us--
           Except the sun is SHINING beautifully through the plane-sized 
           crack and there’s no hurricane.

           Norm sees Reynold, in NUN ATTIRE, standing in between two 
           beautiful BIKINI-CLAD WOMEN off to the side.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Reynold?

                                 REYNOLD
                             (whispers to him)
                        They offered me a spin off, the 
                        misadventures of the rotund nun, it 
                        sounded campy in a good way.  Look.

           He sticks his TONGUE OUT, towards the AREOLA of one of the 
           BIKINI-CLAD WOMEN.  

           A FLURRY OF BUTTERFLIES appear out of nowhere to COVER the 
           salacious licking.

                                 REYNOLD (CONT’D)
                        See?  No rape whistle.

                                 NORM
                        You sold us all out for a spin-off?

                                 REYNOLD
                        They dangled a dream sequence with 
                        Jessica Norm.  That or a zombie sub-
                        plot where she comes back from the 
                        dead.  I’m sorry Norm.  I had to do 
                        it.  I still miss her, even though 
                        she never existed.

           He puts his head down in shame.  Norm HUGS his friend.

                                 NORM
                        It’s all right man.  I think I 
                        understand what you mean.

                                 REYNOLD
                        I’m sorry I ever doubted you Norm.  I 
                        don’t care what dumb-f’s are in 
                        charge of this make-believe we’re in, 
                        you’re my friend for real.

           QUAKER TOM, 30s, in full stately Quaker attire walks over to 
           Norm and offers his hand and a smile.

           Sally rushes to save Norm from what she perceives to be Tom’s 
           lashing out.
                                 SALLY
                        Don’t you dare Tom!  If I want Norm 
                        here then I will have Norm here.  
                        You’re impossible!

           She breaks down in tears.

                                 QUAKER TOM
                        Honey, I’m glad Norm’s here.

                                 SALLY
                             (through tears)
                        Every time you say his name I want to 
                        squeeze all the air out of your 
                        lungs.

                                 QUAKER TOM
                        Are you sure?

           Norm takes Tom’s hand with a smile.

                                 NORM
                        Thanks for the invitation Tom.  But 
                        I’ll be honest with you, I didn’t 
                        want to come to your wedding.

           The whole congregation swap stares between Norm and Amelia.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Truth is, I’m not here to stop the 
                        wedding.

                                 SALLY
                        But Norm, I love you!

           GASPS FROM THE CROWD.

                                 QUAKER TOM
                        Sally, is that true?  You love Norm?

                                 SALLY
                        It is true Tom.

           Tom, clearly rattled by this, is lost for words.

                                 QUAKER TOM
                        We can make this work.  As long as we 
                        love each other it’s still worth--

                                 SALLY
                        --I’m also questioning my love for 
                        you.

                                 QUAKER TOM
                        Hmm.  Interesting.
           Amelia looks at Norm and forces a smile.  Fueled by this, Norm 
           returns his attention back to Sally.

                                 NORM
                        Sally, it was never my intention to 
                        interrupt the wedding, because the 
                        truth is... I don’t love you.

           Gasps, utter shock in the crowd.  

           In the back of the church, DR. NORTON and a TEAM OF HOSPITAL 
           ORDERLIES barge in.  Dr. Norton wipes fire extinguisher foam 
           off his face and eyes Norm.

                                 SALLY
                        Norm... how can you say that?  Did 
                        you tell me you loved me just so you 
                        can lay me three times.

           GASPS.

                                 QUAKER TOM
                        Just out of curiosity, was the sex 
                        befo--

                                 SALLY
                        --after we were together, only a 
                        couple of days ago.

                                 QUAKER TOM
                        Got it, I’ll just keep the pain to a 
                        quiet whimper.

           He nervously CHUCKLES.

                                 NORM
                             (to Sally)
                        I told you I loved you because I 
                        thought I did.  I thought it was what 
                        I was supposed to feel.  I thought it 
                        was real.

                                 SALLY
                        So you are schizo.

                                 NORM
                        I don’t think I completely get what I 
                        am.  But I do know this, that 
                        contrary to everyone’s opinion, 
                        Quaker Tom is not a douche.

           MURMURS.

                                 QUAKER TOM
                        Was that... like the popular opinion?
           Crowd nods.  Norm puts his arm around him.

                                 NORM
                             (to Sally)
                        He’s just a guy that loves you and 
                        wants to marry you.

           Sally smiles at Tom.  He smiles back at her.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        And I know deep down you love him and 
                        want to marry him too.

           Norm brings Sally into his arms, so that he’s bringing the 
           bride and the groom together.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                             (looking at Tom)
                        How we’re perceived is not the 
                        reality.  And who we think we are 
                        isn’t all that accurate either.  The 
                        only place we truly exist...
                             (he looks at Amelia)
                        ...is in that space between.  We 
                        can’t be jotted down as just a 
                        collection of words, phrases, or even 
                        stories.  We exist off the pages.

           Tom and Sally beam.

                                 SALLY
                        What do you say Uncle Tom?  Anyway 
                        you can forgive a girl for being a 
                        complete jackass.  Give me some 
                        credit for not drinking my own pee.

                                 QUAKER TOM
                        Clever reference, but I’m not going 
                        to lie, it’s kind of a big mountain 
                        to climb at this point what with the 
                        questionable love and cheating...

           Dr. Norton, worried the wedding might happen, begins MARCHING 
           towards Norm with the rest of the ORDERLIES.

           Norm sees Amelia and continues his speech:

                                 NORM
                        All of us can be more than our 
                        definitions...
                             (pointing to a random 
                              WEDDING GUEST)
                        You!  Say something!  I know you’re 
                        just an extra and you’ve never talked 
                        before, but SAY SOMETHING!
                                 WEDDING GUEST
                        Something!

           Dr. Norton and the Orderlies MARCH FASTER.

           Wedding Guest now HAPPILY BLABBERS ON AND ON.

           Norm points to ANOTHER GUEST.

                                 NORM
                        Say something!

                                 ANOTHER GUEST
                             (with a goofy smile)
                        Boy are my arms tired!  What does 
                        that even mean?  Why did I just say 
                        that?  I feel alive!

           Laughs.  BLABBER.  JOY!

           Dr. Norton and Orderlies MARCH FASTER.

                                 NORM
                             (pointing at all the 
                              guests)
                        You, you, you! Say something!!

           All the WEDDING GUEST EXTRAS STAND UP AND TALK FOR THE FIRST 
           TIME.  This causes a LOUD HUGE CROWD OF JOY.  Dr. Norton and 
           the Orderlies struggle to march through.

           Norm turns back to Sally and Tom quickly.

                                 NORM (CONT'D)
                        Now is the time.  Tom, don’t be 
                        douche.  Marry the girl.

           Tom thinks fast as he looks at Sally.  They love each other.

                                 QUAKER TOM
                        I do.

           The PRIEST jumps in on cue:

                                 PRIEST
                        I now pronounce you man and wife!

           The crowd CHEERS!  Wedding BELLS go off.

           Norm and Amelia stay locked on each other, the space between 
           them remaining defiant to the infringing disorder.

           The noise of chaos reprieves, the bells soften into quiet, and 
           the crowd goes slow-mo, save for Norm and Amelia.
           They walk towards each other.  TV on the Radio’s “Family Tree” 
           begins playing.

           CREDITS START TO ROLL. THEY BOTH SEE THEM. THEIR HEARTS SINK.

                                 AMELIA
                             (horrified)
                        Norm?  What’s going on?  Are those 
                        the ending credits?

           Norm drudges up the courage to nod at the sad realization.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        Why Norm?  We did what we were 
                        supposed to do!  Why is the movie 
                        still ending?

           She frantically searches the faces of the joyful crowd 
           cheering in slow-mo.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        Don’t they get it?  It’s all gonna
                        end!  We have to do something!

                                 NORM
                        Amelia--

                                 AMELIA
                        --Do something! We have to stop this!

                                 NORM
                        Amelia, we can’t!

                                 AMELIA
                        Why!  We didn’t give the movie what 
                        it wanted!  It can’t end!

                                 NORM
                        Yes it can!

           A silence as Norm’s voice begins to quiver.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        It can because I made the movie about 
                        what I wanted.

           His face is about to melt into fear and weeping, but he 
           successfully fights it off with a smile.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        You.

                                 AMELIA
                        What?  Why?
                                 NORM
                             (hurt by her reaction)
                        It was an accident, the hurricane was 
                        going to kill us.

                                 AMELIA
                             (upset)
                        You fell in love with me because you 
                        were scared of a little wind and 
                        rain?

                                 NORM
                             (angry)
                        Listen lady, movies don’t end because 
                        someone loves the other someone 
                        without that someone loving them 
                        back.  You had to have fallen in love 
                        with me too.

           The anger subsides.  It’s true.  The moment is bittersweet.  
           The end is near.  Our heroes lost.  They fell in love.

           Amelia’s smile breaks.  She puts her head down to mask the 
           grief behind her eyes.

           For Norm, the real joy found in the surrounding molasses of 
           faces gives him peace.  He resigns to the movie’s ending.

                                 NORM (CONT’D)
                        Dance with me.

           Once again, Amelia is flummoxed by Norm’s cavalier reaction.

                                 AMELIA
                        Does impending doom not worry you?

           He answers by pulling her close.  They slow dance.  

           Amelia CRIES on his shoulder.  Norm hears it.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        I don’t want us to end.

                                 NORM
                        ‘End’ has so many definitions.

                                 AMELIA
                        Isn’t one of them death?

                                 NORM
                        Yes.  But there’s also “the point in 
                        time when an action, an event, or a 
                        phenomenon ceases or is completed; 
                        the conclusion.”  That’s doesn’t so 
                        bad, to be a phenomenon.
           Amelia’s eyes react with a half-smile.  Doesn’t sound bad.

                                 AMELIA
                        Phenomenon sounds nice. 
                             (then again, with a smirk)
                        But I’m pretty sure it can also mean 
                        death.

           Broken smiles at the morbid wise crack. Yes it can mean death.

           An intimate silence is shared as the music softly continues.  
           Full of emotion, Amelia whispers softly in Norm’s ear:

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t care what anyone says, this 
                        was real to me.

           Norm holds her tight and whispers back:

                                 NORM
                        Don’t let me go, even after it ends.

           Amelia never had any intention of letting go.

           They slow dance, holding each other tight, as the song fades 
           away and the last credit rolls off screen.  

           Norm and Amelia exchange looks of sadness, grief, love, 
           happiness, exhilaration, life, and death.  The moment is 
           theirs and theirs endlessly.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
