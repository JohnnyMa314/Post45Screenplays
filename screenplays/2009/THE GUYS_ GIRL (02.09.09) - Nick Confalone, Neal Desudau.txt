           SUPER: EIGHT YEARS AGO

           INT. COLLEGE DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

           In his boxers, RYAN HARPER bangs on his dorm room door. It’s 
           locked. Ryan is a college sophomore-- lanky but good-looking, 
           confident but fidgety. Right now though, he just really has 
           to pee. 

                                 RYAN
                        My bladder’s going to explode! I 
                        know you guys can hear me! 

           Giving up, he KNOCKS on his neighbor’s door. Nothing. He runs 
           down the hall, knocking on every door while pinching his 
           crotch to help hold it in. 

           The hall is empty. Thinking quickly, he opens the lone window 
           at the end of the hall and unzips. A wave of relaxation 
           washes over Ryan’s face.

           A girl SCREAMS.

           EXT. COLLEGE QUAD - MOMENTS LATER

           JENA MADURO (sophomore; indie-cute) strides purposefully 
           towards the entrance to Ryan’s building. Her clothing is 
           soaked-- a magician’s performance ensemble-- cloak, top hat, 
           etc.

           Ryan peeks down at her from the window above, feeling sorry-- 
           not about peeing on her, but about getting caught.

           INT. COLLEGE DORM HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           The stairwell door BANGS open and out charges Jena. Ryan 
           takes a step back. Sees the anger on her face. She charges at 
           him, magician’s cloak billowing behind her.

                                 RYAN
                        I didn’t know anyone was out there!

           He backs away from her until he’s up against his dorm room 
           door. Nowhere to go. She stops in front of him. She flicks 
           her fingers in his face, shaking urine on him. 

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        YOU’RE GETTING MY PEE ON ME!

                                 JENA
                        I’m just returning it to its 
                        rightful owner. 
                                 RYAN
                             (wiping his face clean)
                        I got locked out. 

                                 JENA
                        I don’t see how urinating out the 
                        window is the next logical step to 
                        being locked out. 

                                 RYAN
                        It’s 3 am-- what were you even 
                        doing down there?!

                                 JENA
                        I just broke up with this dick, but 
                        whatever. I go through boyfriends 
                        like tampons.

                                 RYAN
                        That’s disgusting.

           Jena brings her pee-soaked sleeve up to his face.

                                 JENA
                        Don’t judge me. You’re the one 
                        who’s so cavalier about taking a 
                        leak onto a well-trodden pedestrian 
                        walkway.

           Ryan’s dorm room door opens. His roommate peeks out. 

                                 COOPER
                        Were you knocking just now?

           Ryan’s grateful to be saved. He slides inside.

                                 RYAN
                             (to Jena)
                        Well... see ya.

                                 JENA
                        I’m not walking six blocks like 
                        this.

           INT. RYAN’S DORM ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ryan sits outside the bathroom door. Jena is taking a shower. 
           The door’s cracked open a bit so he can talk to her. Cooper 
           lurches over a textbook in the background. A Penn ‘04 pennant 
           hangs on the wall.

                                 RYAN
                        What if you peed on me and we call 
                        it even?
                                 JENA (O.S.)
                        What?

                                 RYAN
                        Nothing!

                                 JENA (O.S.)
                        Come in here-- I can’t hear you!

           Ryan and Cooper exchange a glance.

           INT. RYAN’S DORM - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Mirrors steaming up in Ryan’s dirty bathroom. Jena’s still in 
           the shower, the curtain drawn. Ryan sits on his hair-caked 
           bath mat. He considers Jena’s pee-soaked magician outfit 
           strewn on the floor.

                                 RYAN
                        What were you even wearing? I mean, 
                        besides my pee?

                                 JENA
                             (with a flourish)
                        I am a magician. You know-- parlor 
                        tricks and whatnot? I had a show at 
                        my boyfriend’s frat-- ex-boyfriend, 
                        now, I guess...

                                 RYAN
                        Show me a trick.

                                 JENA
                        Never. 

                                 RYAN
                        Just one.

                                 JENA
                        Tonight was disaster town. Total 
                        debacle. I’m done performing in 
                        public.

                                 RYAN
                        So what, you’re majoring in Magic?

                                 JENA
                        Yeah, because we go to Hogwarts. 

           Ryan stares at her silhouette behind the shower curtain.

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        English. 
           INT. RYAN’S DORM - LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER

           Down in the basement. Wearing Ryan’s oversized Penn t-shirt 
           and shorts now, Jena loads her wet clothes into one of the 
           many washing machines.

                                 JENA
                        You owe me something juicy. Tell me 
                        an embarrassing story. Your deepest 
                        darkest secret. 

                                 RYAN
                        I’m your father.

                                 JENA
                        Seriously. Do you eat your own 
                        boogers? Are you a bed-wetter? Do 
                        you save your toenail clippings? 

           Ryan pours in detergent, ignoring her. It makes her crazy.

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        Do you say “I love you” on the 
                        first date? You have to give me 
                        something!

                                 RYAN
                        Actually, it’s so embarrassing to 
                        say “I love you” that I always have 
                        to use a silly voice when I say it.

           Jena starts nodding quickly, knowing exactly what he means.

                                 JENA
                        I hate it! It’s this expression 
                        that’s totally been co-opted by TV 
                        and movies and Pepsi and hallmark.

                                 RYAN
                             (surprised she agrees)
                        I always feel like I’m quoting 
                        Jerry Maguire when I say it.

                                 JENA
                        One time I said “I love Jew” just 
                        to avoid the cliche.

           Ryan nods, warming to her.

                                 RYAN
                        “I love you too” is even worse 
                        because it’s a rote obligation.
                                 JENA
                        There should be a code that means 
                        the same thing as “I love you.” 
                        Something unexpected and original.

           They both stare off into space, thinking of codes.

                                 RYAN
                        What about “Bananapants?”

                                 JENA
                        That’ll do.

           She finishes loading the machine.

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        Pay for my pee laundry.

           INT. RYAN’S DORM - THE COMMON ROOM - LATER

           Jena checks out the room-- posters of rock bands, Scorsese’s 
           gangster movies, and original art adorn the walls.

           Cooper sits on the couch. He’s trying to concentrate on a 
           European history textbook but it’s hard-- someone is having 
           sex behind a closed bedroom door. And it’s LOUD.

                                 SORORITY GIRL (O.S.)
                             (sexual ecstacy)
                        Oh yeah-- gimme that beef jerky!!!

           Cooper gives Ryan and Jena an annoyed look-- “see what I have 
           to deal with?” Ryan introduces Jena like he’s showing off a 
           prize on The Price is Right.

                                 RYAN
                        Cooper, this is Jena. We’re 
                        becoming friends through the magic 
                        of urine.

           Cooper looks Jena up and down.

                                 COOPER
                        Do you like Japanese cinema, fine 
                        dining, and browsing travel 
                        bookstores?

                                 JENA
                        Yes, yes, and sometimes.

           Everything about Cooper is efficient: the way he dresses, 
           what he says, how he acts-- efficiency born from an OCD-like 
           personality. And he always wears a tie.
                                 COOPER
                        Friendship... approved.

                                 JENA
                        Wow, that’s fast. Kim and Nancy are 
                        only my friends when they want to 
                        watch Survivor. 

           There’s one final SCREAM from the sex room and then quiet. 
           The third roommate emerges wearing only boxer briefs-- ERICH 
           GRABOWSKI (in-shape, but slouchy). We catch a glimpse of a 
           half-naked girl on his bed as the door shuts.

                                 ERICH
                        My exercise for the day is 
                        complete. 

           He starts thrusting his pelvis at Cooper before turning to 
           Jena. He doesn’t stop air-thrusting.

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        Who the fuck are you?

                                 JENA
                        What’s with your hands?

           They’re covered in clay. Erich mimes sculpting a woman while 
           continuing to thrust.

                                 ERICH
                        I was sculpting her. 

           Jena raises an eyebrow.

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        She was already naked for me. What 
                        was I going to do, not fuck her? 

           He hasn’t stopped gyrating his hips. 

                                 JENA
                        Are you going to stop thrusting?

                                 ERICH
                        I’ll fuck you one day too.

                                 JENA
                        You guys aren’t really my type.

           All three guys give a “we’ll see about that” nod.
           INT. JENA’S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           Jena finishes a complex slight-of-hand card trick in front of 
           a mirror. Ryan barges in just after she finishes, 
           disappointed he missed it. Jena shakes her head-- “never.”

           INT. NICE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The check comes. Ryan, Cooper, Erich, and Jena stare at it 
           for a measured moment. They simultaneously dash for the door.

           INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           In pajamas, Jena and Cooper sit on the couch watching The OC. 
           Jena holds up three colors of nail polish. After careful 
           deliberation, he picks one. She agrees.

           EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Jena spits water at the guys in someone’s fancy backyard hot 
           tub. Floodlights come on. A HUGE GUY charges outside with a 
           baseball bat. They jump out of the hot tub and run away.

           INT. COLLEGE LIBRARY - DAY

           Jena and Ryan tiptoe through the stacks. They take pictures 
           of an unsuspecting college student scratching his crotch. 

           EXT. COLLEGE GRADUATION - DAY

           Graduation caps fly through the air. We find the four of them 
           in the crowd, caps still on, engrossed in conversation.

           EXT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - DAY

           Jena and the guys move into an old four-bedroom house in 
           North Philly. Erich breaks a bottle of champagne on the front 
           door. But instead of the bottle breaking, he breaks a hole 
           through the front door.

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - DAY

           The living room. The decor is almost the same as college. The 
           TV is slightly bigger, the furniture is slightly nicer, and 
           there’s slightly more original art on the walls. 

           SUPER: PRESENT DAY

           After a hard day’s work they converge on the couch, joking 
           and ready to watch TV. Ryan dressed business casual, Erich 
           covered in paint, Cooper in a suit, and Jena in a Monty’s 
           Magic polo shirt. They simultaneously open beers and relax. 

                                      THE GUYS’ GIRL
           EXT. DOWNTOWN PHILLY - DAY

           An art deco high-rise gleams in the sun.

           INT. DOWNTOWN ARCHITECTURE FIRM - DAY

           A conference room on the 33rd floor with views of Philly. 
           Ryan unfurls blueprints across a large central table.

           The client, PHIL NOTOPOLOS (beefy yet well-coiffed) looks 
           over the plans. He nods slowly, taking everything in.

           Ryan exchanges a nervous look with his co-worker, BETH (late 
           20s, doesn’t leave the house without dark eyeliner).

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        I have some adjustments. 

           Notopolos draws an octagon right on the blueprints. Ryan and 
           Beth wince.

                                 NOTOPOLOS (CONT’D)
                        You know what I want from you? One 
                        word: a goddamn gazebo.

                                 RYAN
                        Two feet from the swimming pool?

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        I didn’t become the man I am today 
                        by taking no for an answer.

           Ryan snorts. Beth quickly defuses--

                                 BETH
                        Not a problem, Mr. Notopolos. It 
                        would be the greatest of all honors 
                        for you to let us make these 
                        changes.

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                             (drawing another)
                        And I want another one in the 
                        solarium. 

                                 RYAN
                        ...An indoor gazebo?

           Ryan and Beth stare.

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        I’m big into symmetry. Less hard 
                        lines. More soft curves. I want a 
                        basement in my garage.

                        And for all that is holy, please 
                        let’s lose all these windows in the 
                        living room. You want me to watch 
                        football with glare on the TV? 
                        Don’t you know I love football? 

                                 BETH
                        You’re right, if we had only known 
                        you loved football... we would have 
                        made the living room a dark cement 
                        box. 

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        Don’t get cute with me. I hate 
                        cute. Is she getting cute with me?

                                 RYAN
                        She can’t help it. She’s always 
                        cute.

           Beth rolls her eyes.

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                             (looking at Beth)
                        I’d say you’re hot. Cute isn’t for 
                        me. I hate cute. In fact, go 
                        through the plans and lose anything 
                        in the house that seems cute-- 
                        Except the gazebo of course.

           INT. DOWNTOWN ARCHITECTURE FIRM - LATER

           Ryan and Beth weave through cubicles together. Beth looks 
           over Notopolos’s blueprints-- covered in sharpie notes.

                                 BETH
                        Is it weird that I sort of respond 
                        positively to his advances?

                                 RYAN
                             (eyeing the blueprints)
                        We should add in other crazy stuff 
                        and see if he notices. 
                        “I don’t remember asking for a hot 
                        tub in the kitchen, but I love it.”

                                 BETH
                        This is going to take all night.

                                 RYAN
                        Oh...
                                 BETH
                        I’ll send Amed out for Chinese and 
                        beers.

                                 RYAN
                        Actually I was thinking we could 
                        start tomorrow?

                                 BETH
                             (shaking her head)
                        We’re on-site with the Davidsons.

                                 RYAN
                        I have a thing tonight.

           Beth smiles as she takes her hair down. 

                                 BETH
                        What could possibly be so amazingly 
                        important?

                                 RYAN
                             (duh)
                        It’s bowling night.

           Beth nods. She hands him half the blueprints.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                             (ready to make his case)
                        Beth--

           She puts a finger to his lips.

                                 BETH
                        Shhhhh...
                             (before he can protest)
                        I have Spoon tickets tonight, but 
                        you don’t see me weaseling. You’re 
                        always ditching out-- you never 
                        think about how much more work it 
                        is for the rest of us.

           Ryan makes a big show of thinking it over.

                                 BETH (CONT’D)
                        You’re not weaseling out of this.

                                 RYAN
                        You are absolutely right, Beth. I 
                        need to take more personal 
                        responsibility in my life.
           INT. DOWNTOWN ARCHITECTURE FIRM - LATER

           A cramped cubicle. AMED (early 20s, summer associate) works 
           at his computer. Ryan tosses Notopolos’s blueprints onto his 
           desk.

                                 RYAN
                        I need you to stay late today.

                                 AMED
                        Tonight’s my fantasy basketball 
                        draft, dogg.

                                 RYAN
                        Guess what, dogg? You’ll also be 
                        “drafting” these blueprints.

           EXT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

           A run-down alley.

           INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

           A strike. A BOWLING ALLEY RAT pumps his fist. In the lane 
           next to him we find Ryan and Cooper watching him bowl. They 
           finish beers. 

           The score boxes are set up for the four roommates: RYAN, 
           COOPER, ERICH, JENA. The three guys have bowled the first 
           frame. They’re waiting for Jena. Ryan flips his phone closed. 

                                 RYAN
                        No missed calls.

                                 COOPER
                        Pete.

                                 RYAN
                        Did she call you?

                                 COOPER
                        She’s with Pete.

                                 RYAN
                        ...Pete. I’m drawing a blank.

                                 COOPER
                        We’ve met him. Pete?

                                 RYAN
                        I just keep picturing Pete Rose.

                                 COOPER
                        He gave you that shirt.
                                 RYAN
                        My birthday shirt?

           Ryan looks down at his birthday shirt: a stick figure baby 
           saying, “Lordy, Lordy! My daddy’s forty!”

                                 COOPER
                        Yeah. Pete.

                                 RYAN
                        That was six months ago. The same 
                        Pete? It can’t be the same Pete.

           Erich comes back from the bar with three new beers. 

                                 ERICH
                        This is stupid. I’m gonna roll for 
                        her. She’s not gonna win anyway. 

                                 RYAN
                        It’s Thursday. She should be here.

                                 ERICH
                             (takes her ball)
                        Watch. I’ll just roll it into the 
                        gutter every time. Same as her.

                                 COOPER
                        Erich--

                                 ERICH
                        I don’t know how to say this, but 
                        I’m a cyborg sent here from the 
                        future with only one mission: TO GO 
                        BOWLING.

                                 COOPER
                        Give her five minutes.

                                 RYAN
                        Is this the reason she doesn’t come 
                        to Trivia Night anymore?

                                 ERICH
                             (Austrian accent)
                        “I’ll be back... TO BOWL.”

           Erich DROPS the ball-- CRUNCH-- and goes to the bar. 

                                 RYAN
                        And she missed movie night twice in 
                        a row. This is unacceptable 
                        behavior.  
           Erich comes back with a DRUNK GIRL on his arm.

                                 ERICH
                        Meet Nancy Allen. She’ll be bowling 
                        in Jena’s stead.

                                 COOPER
                             (points to the monitor)
                        We already made it say Jena.

                                 ERICH
                             (British accent)
                        “Until a trumpet fanfare marks her 
                        grand arrival, Nancy Allen will be 
                        Jena’s designated bowler.”

           Annoyed, Ryan grabs the ball and rolls for Jena. Straight to 
           the gutter.

                                 RYAN
                        I don’t even like bowling.

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - LATER

           Back at home, the three guys play Wii Bowling. Next to Erich, 
           Nancy Allen nurses a beer. Ryan rolls a virtual strike in the 
           10th frame. The score comes up-- It’s a tie. 300 each.

                                 RYAN
                        Ahhh, much better.

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - LATER

           Erich raids the fridge and comes back from the kitchen with 
           three more beers. Nancy Allen has passed out on the couch.

           He finds Ryan staring at the TV, Wii remote in hand. We hear 
           relaxing video game music.

                                 ERICH
                        Oh shit. That’s him?

           Ryan nods. All three guys stare at the TV.

                                 COOPER
                        Pete...

           It’s Pete’s Mii character. He’s got short, curly hair. Brown 
           eyes. Stubble. A round head. A blue shirt.

                                 RYAN
                        He’s been to our house enough times 
                        to have a Mii?
                                 COOPER
                        I told you they’re serious. Jena 
                        and I were watching Gossip Girl and 
                        she kept mentioning him.

                                 ERICH
                        You’re so gay.

           Ryan zooms in so Pete’s Mii takes up the whole screen.

                                 RYAN
                        Pete’s probably like “Hey Jena, 
                        let’s make out.”

                                 ERICH
                        More like “Yo Jena, why don’t you 
                        suck on my Pete dick?”

           Pete’s Mii stares blankly.

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        If you were Pete, you’d stick your 
                        Pete fingers in her vagina and be 
                        like, “What’s up vagina? It’s your 
                        old pal, Pete.”

           Ryan and Cooper laugh. Jena walks in from the kitchen. Ryan 
           and Cooper wave to her. Erich doesn’t notice.

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        If you were Pete--

                                 RYAN
                        Uhhh--

                                 ERICH
                        No no no-- if you were Pete, you’d 
                        want Jena to get in a car accident 
                        where her colon gets all fucked up 
                        so she needs a colostomy bag, then 
                        you’d be like, “What’s up Jena, 
                        don’t you like it when I use my 
                        Pete dick to fuck your colostomy 
                        hole?”

                                 JENA
                        Only on his birthday.

           Erich turns around and goes with it-- never embarrassed.

                                 ERICH
                        Where have you been?
           She holds out her left hand. A diamond engagement ring 
           sparkles. The guys don’t notice. Ryan pushes her hand away.

                                 RYAN
                        Get your own controller. I’m not 
                        your mom.

           Jena’s dumbfounded, but the three guys are back to the Wii.

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - LATER

           The foursome play Black Sabbath’s Paranoid in Wii Rock Band.  
           Nancy Allen is passed out on the couch. Jena plays guitar. 
           She wails her solo right in the guys’ faces. Her ring only 
           inches from their eyes.

                                 RYAN
                             (trying to drum)
                        I can’t see the screen.

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - GARAGE - LATER

           The garage has been converted into Erich’s art studio. There 
           are several sculptures crafted out of junk. Erich glues their 
           empty beers to an in-progress abstract beercan sculpture 
           while Cooper, Ryan, and Jena cheer him on.  

           Jena opens a new can of beer like she’s in a commercial. Slow 
           and dramatic. The guys are oblivious to her ring. It’s 
           driving her crazy.

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - LATER

           The TV room. Getting drunker. Playing a card game. Nancy 
           Allen is still passed out behind them. Jena makes a big show 
           of turning over her card with her ring hand. She holds it up 
           and moves it around elaborately in the air.

                                 COOPER
                        We know what the jack of spades 
                        looks like.

           EXT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - LATER

           They’re drinking and listening to music in the living room.  
           Drunk Nancy Allen jolts awake and in a hazy stupor, she 
           reaches for Jena’s hand--

                                 NANCY ALLEN
                        Your ring is so shiny...

           All at once, the guys see the ring. Holy shit. Jena smiles.
                                 ERICH
                        Nancy Allen from the bowling alley, 
                        You have to leave right this 
                        second. 

           EXT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - BACK YARD - LATER

           Ryan, Jena, Cooper, and Erich hang out on the cramped back 
           porch.

                                 RYAN
                        Pete?

                                 JENA
                        Pete.

           Erich grabs Jena’s wrist and slides the ring off her finger. 
           She watches him inspect it. 

                                 RYAN
                        You’ve been on like six dates. 

                                 JENA
                        Try 8 months. 

           Ryan and Erich are shocked.

                                 COOPER
                        Told you.

                                 JENA
                        You guys ignored him at Ryan’s 
                        birthday, so I just figured... why 
                        force it?

           Ryan sits on a stool facing Jena, trying to process all this. 
           He’s stunned.

                                 RYAN
                        This is your first real 
                        relationship and you’re ready to 
                        get married? 

                                 JENA
                             (shrugs)
                        He makes me happy.

                                 ERICH
                        You disgust me.
                                 RYAN
                        We haven’t even vetted him. This 
                        guy we barely know wants to be with 
                        you forever, and you already said 
                        yes?

                                 JENA
                        I’m glad you guys can share in my 
                        joy like this.

                                 COOPER
                        When Rachel and Ross got married 
                        you said, “This is the lamest thing 
                        ever.”

                                 JENA
                        I meant that you were watching 
                        Friends.

           Cooper tries to cut a circle in the garage window with the 
           diamond. Jena snatches it. Ryan puts his ear to her stomach.

                                 RYAN
                        What is the current status of your 
                        uterus? a) empty or b) occupied by 
                        the tiny miracle of life that is 
                        the union between Pete’s sperm and 
                        your egg.

                                 JENA
                        c) I’m on fucking birth control.

           Jena crosses her legs, annoyed.

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        Can’t you guys at least pretend to 
                        be happy about this? I’m starting 
                        real life! I’m a grown-up! 
                             (they stare at her)
                        Like how excited I was for your 
                        architecture exams, Ryan?
                             (to Cooper)
                        Or when you passed the bar?
                             (to Erich)
                        Or when you had sex with your first 
                        black girl?

                                 ERICH
                        Pete’s black?

                                 RYAN
                        Your boyfriends have always been 
                        extensions of us. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RYAN (CONT'D)
                        We satisfy your emotional needs. 
                        They satisfy your vaginal and/or 
                        clitoral needs. 

                                 COOPER
                        That’s disgusting. Jena, we don’t 
                        think about your vagina.

                                 RYAN
                        But marriage? You won’t need us for 
                        anything. 

           Jena shakes her head. She won’t buy into it. 

                                 COOPER
                        Who are we gonna play Twister with?

                                 ERICH
                        Three dudes playing Twister is gay, 
                        Jena.

           EXT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - NIGHT

           Ryan, Erich, Cooper, and Jena lie on the roof looking at the 
           stars. The sky is pre-dawn. Erich throws an empty beer can 
           off the roof. Down below, empty cans litter the backyard. 
           They’re all pretty drunk. 

           Ryan and Jena idly tap their feet against each other. A 
           comfortable and familiar game for them.

                                 JENA
                        I didn’t know he was going to ask 
                        me. We were walking along the water 
                        and he caught me completely off 
                        guard. He got down on one knee and 
                        all that. I always thought I’d be 
                        filled with dread or imagining my 
                        own decapitation if someone 
                        proposed to me. But it was the 
                        opposite.
                             (afterthought)
                        ...which is unusual given my 
                        natural disposition. 

                                 COOPER
                        Did you pause before saying yes?   
                        It’s trouble if you pause.

                                 JENA
                        No pause. I shocked myself.
                                 RYAN
                        You know my cousin Eva rushed into 
                        things with her first love-- they 
                        were divorced in two years.

                                 JENA
                        You don’t have any cousins.

                                 RYAN
                        I know, but... you shouldn’t get 
                        married.

           Erich sighs with something weighing heavily on his mind.

                                 ERICH
                        We should fuck before it’s too 
                        late. Like one, final, meaningless 
                        hurrah.

                                 JENA
                        Is it ever meaningful with you?

           Erich shrugs.

                                 RYAN
                        Face it, you’re done with us. 

                                 JENA
                        I know this is the lamest thing in 
                        the world, but it was my first 
                        thought when Pete proposed. Will 
                        you three be my, um, bridesmaids?

           The guys smile.

                                 COOPER
                             (immediately)
                        ‘Twould be an honor.

                                 ERICH
                        I’m not wearing a dress.

                                 RYAN
                             (convincing himself)
                        Your wedding’s gonna be badass.

                                 JENA
                        And now that we’re engaged, it 
                        means Pete isn’t disappearing 
                        anytime soon, which means I get to 
                        incorporate him into other aspects 
                        of my life. And that means you 
                        guys. 
           They nod... sweet. 

                                 ERICH
                        Seriously though, no dresses. 

           EXT. NORRISTOWN - NIGHT

           Ryan drives with Erich and Cooper through one of the many 
           small towns West of Philly. 

           EXT. JENA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - NIGHT

           It’s a big house. Ryan pulls into the circular front 
           driveway. He’s met by a hired valet who takes the car. The 
           three guys ring the doorbell. It rings Here Comes the Bride.

           With baited breath, JENA’S MOM (Mid 50s, pretty and petite) 
           opens the door. She’s wearing a Little Black Dress with a 
           large whale-shaped broach pinned to her chest. She envelops 
           the boys in a warm family hug. 

                                 JENA’S MOM
                        You’re going to be the best 
                        bridesmaids ever.

           The guys smile. An older man in Tommy Bahama attire shimmies 
           through the foyer.

                                 JENA’S DAD
                             (singing Here Comes the 
                              Bride)
                        “Da da da daaa”

                                 JENA’S MOM
                        Stop singing! I told you-- you sing 
                        too much!

           Jena’s dad confides in the boys, but loud enough so he’s sure 
           Jena’s mom can hear him.

                                 JENA’S DAD
                        And I told her if she knits me one 
                        more scarf, I’d hang myself with 
                        it. Am I right?

                                 JENA’S MOM
                        Boys, promise me you’ll always 
                        appreciate gifts from your wives.
                             (to Jena’s dad)
                        And change that doorbell. It’s 
                        tacky. I told you to change it!

           Jena’s Dad pointedly rings the doorbell. Here Comes The 
           Bride.
                                 JENA’S MOM (CONT’D)
                        Do that one more time...

           He rings it again. As their argument continues, Jena comes 
           out and pulls them inside. She’s actually wearing make-up for 
           tonight.

                                 RYAN
                             (soft, to Jena)
                        Marriage is awesome.

                                 JENA’S DAD
                             (singing)
                        HERE COMES THE BRIDE!!!

           EXT. JENA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - NIGHT

           In the backyard there’s a long table with citronella candles. 
           The swimming pool glows blue. Friends and family mingle. Ryan 
           and the guys pull appetizers from wandering waiters.

           A passing CUTE BRUNETTE offers Cooper a friendly smile. He 
           freezes up, awkwardly turns away, and bumps right into Ryan. 
           Erich watches with dismay as she rolls her eyes and leaves.

                                 ERICH
                        The Academy Award for best 
                        documentary: “I Have no Balls, the 
                        Cooper Martin story.”

           Ryan spots Jena talking to a ruggedly good-looking guy with a 
           popped collar. He’s wearing sunglasses at night.

                                 RYAN
                        10 o’clock.

           The guy poses for a photo with Jena. He gives a thumbs-up and 
           points at her, like he’s Lynndie England in those Abu-Ghraib 
           naked Iraqi prisoner photos.

           Ryan and Erich stare at this unbelievable douchebag. Could 
           this be Pete?

           Behind Ryan, Cooper, and Erich comes a normal-looking guy 
           about their age. He too stares at the unbelievable douchebag.

                                 PETE
                        Look at that unbelievable 
                        douchebag.

           Cooper turns around and smiles at Pete.

                                 COOPER
                        How goes it, Pete?
           The other guys turn around. Pete gives them a sheepish smile. 

                                 PETE
                        How’s it going, fellas?

           EXT. JENA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - LATER

           Pete cuts the line to the caterer’s bar and grabs four beers. 
           He keeps one and distributes the others to Ryan, Cooper, and 
           Erich.

           Contrary to their imagination, Pete seems like a genuinely 
           nice guy. He looks kind of like his Nintendo Mii-- short. 
           Round face. Big smile. He should be played by someone normal 
           and likable to reinforce this normalcy.

                                 PETE
                        Glad you guys could make it. Good 
                        to see you again, Ryan.

                                 RYAN
                        What? Oh. Ah, you too. Thanks for 
                        the shirt?

                                 PETE
                        “Lordy, Lordy! My Daddy’s Forty!”

           All four take a sip of beer. Pete rocks on his heels. The 
           guys look at each other-- who should say something first?

                                 RYAN
                        Is it weird that you’re the fourth 
                        guy Jena’s dated named Pete?

           The guys watch his reaction, but he doesn’t miss a beat.

                                 PETE
                             (playing along)
                        She told me I was the eighth. She’s 
                        only with me to continue the 
                        tradition.

           They kind of laugh, half-liking Pete and half-annoyed that 
           they half-like him.

           EXT. JENA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - LATER

           Ryan entertains Jena and her parents. They’re having fun. 
           Across the party-- shoes off, pants rolled up, Cooper and 
           Pete dip their legs in the pool.

                                 PETE
                        You don’t seem like a lawyer. No 
                        offense. 
                                 COOPER
                        I have at least four more years 
                        before I become a complete a-hole. 
                             (awkward silence)
                        So. Jena says you do web design? 
                        I’ve been known to dabble. I made 
                        this site, kingshaq.com? It’s--

                                 PETE
                        --Where Shaq has the crown and 
                        scepter? You type in a wish and 
                        King Shaq grants it? I LOVE THAT 
                        SITE! 

           Cooper’s shocked. 

                                 COOPER
                        Did Erich put you up to this?

           Pete takes out his iPhone. It immediately loads up King Shaq.  
           It’s just as Pete described-- A photoshopped Shaq with a 
           crown and scepter. A curser blinks at us, awaiting a wish.

                                 COOPER (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe you have the mobile 
                        app. 

                                 PETE
                        One time I wished for a reality TV 
                        show where OJ Simpson goes on the 
                        run and Deputy Shaq chases him 
                        across the country.

                                 COOPER
                        That was you?! 

                                 PETE
                        So where’s my show?

                                 COOPER
                        Shaq is very discerning about the 
                        wishes he grants.

           They laugh. From another conversation across the party, Ryan 
           shoots Cooper a look-- STOP LIKING PETE!

           EXT. JENA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - LATER

           Pete and Erich talk near the back door.

                                 PETE
                        Oh, so your art is some sort of an 
                        off-shoot of neo-expressionism 
                        meets assemblage?
           Erich’s amazed.

                                 ERICH
                        I hate that you’re so awesome!

           INT. JENA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - LATER

           The living room. Ryan and Pete look at picture frames on the 
           mantel. Jena performing magic for stuffed animals. Jena 
           giving Barbie a haircut. Jena in elementary school-- complete 
           with a pink and blue laser background.

                                 PETE
                        Did you see Family Guy last night?

                                 RYAN
                        Nope.

                                 PETE
                        I don’t normally watch TV.

                                 RYAN
                        Was it funny?

           Pete shrugs.

                                 PETE
                        It’s not a good show.

                                 RYAN
                        No. 

           Ryan checks his phone. It’s off.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Thought I felt it vibrate.

                                 PETE
                        I hate that.

           Pete checks his own phone just in case. Nothing.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        So, um. Jena says we have a lot in 
                        common.

                                 RYAN
                        Oh yeah? Cool.

           Pete waits, but Ryan doesn’t offer anything else.

                                 PETE
                        Yep.
           EXT. JENA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - LATER

           Everyone is outside. Ryan, Erich, and Cooper stand to the 
           side, quietly judging. Pete stands on his chair for a toast.

                                 PETE
                        Thank you, everyone, for coming and 
                        making tonight special. I’m no good 
                        at public speaking, but here goes.

           Pete pulls out several pages of notes. Ryan visibly slouches. 
           Erich ribs Cooper. 

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        Just kidding. 

           Everyone laughs. Looking at him now, Jena’s eyes almost 
           sparkle. It’s hard to tell how Ryan’s feeling about it.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        Um. Cheers?

           Our guys raise their glasses with big smiles plastered across 
           their faces.

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - DAY

           Wii Rock Band. Ryan counts off R.E.M.’s Orange Crush, which 
           the guys sing/play over this “Pete fitting in” part:

           INT. IRISH BAR - NIGHT

           A tight huddle. Ryan, Cooper, Erich, Jena... and Pete.

                                 RYAN
                        It’s a trick question.

                                 PETE
                             (no)
                        I’m telling you, it’s a bear.

                                 COOPER
                        It’s definitely not a bear.

           Ryan peeks out of the huddle. It’s trivia night at their 
           favorite bar. Other teams turn in answers to a mustached 
           trivia announcer. Even the drunk sorority girls are done.

                                 PETE
                        It’s a bear. They did all these 
                        tests in the 60s.

           Erich snorts. Cooper writes down an answer.
                                 COOPER
                        I’m saying monkey.

                                                                CUT TO:

                                 TRIVIA ANNOUNCER
                        It’s a bear!

           Jena squeezes Pete’s hand. Ryan, Cooper, and Erich gulp down 
           their beers.

                                 TRIVIA ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        In 1962, a bear parachuted from 
                        35,000 feet and landed safely on 
                        Earth. His name... was JoJo.

                                 COOPER
                             (under his breath)
                        Eff you, JoJo.

           Pete stands up with a friendly smile. He affectionately 
           squeezes Ryan and Cooper on their shoulders.

                                 PETE
                        No worries, gents. Another round?

           The guys sheepishly nod.

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - NIGHT

           Cooper, Jena, and Pete watch Gossip Girl. Pete wraps his arm 
           around Jena. Cooper slides away from them, annoyed. 

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - GARAGE - EVENING

           Erich’s art studio. Erich welds a bunch of old cell phones to 
           a crowbar. Pete is watching him. 

                                 PETE
                        I’ve got some gallery friends if 
                        you want to meet them.

           Erich flips up his welder’s mask.

                                 ERICH
                        No offense, homey-- I have trouble 
                        concentrating with you in here.

           EXT. MONTY’S MAGIC SHOP - DAY

           Monty’s looks like the bastard son of LA’s Magic Castle. 
           Ryan, Cooper, and Erich walk towards the front door, carrying 
           a Carvel ice cream cake.
           INT. MONTY’S MAGIC SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Jena’s job. The guys find her selling a magic wand to an ACNE 
           FACED KID. She’s a sales person, not a magician. She turns 
           around. Her face has a big smudge of ice cream on it. 

                                 THE GUYS
                        Happy birthday!?

           They glance over to the checkout counter. Pete’s already 
           there, passing out slices of his own ice cream cake to the 
           other employees/magicians. Cooper holds out his cake.

                                 COOPER
                        Anyone want seconds?

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - NIGHT

           Ryan, Cooper, and Erich watch The Dark Knight. They hear 
           rhythmic sounds of a bed squeaking from Jena’s bedroom. Pete 
           GROANS with intense pleasure. Ryan turns up the TV volume. 

           Engrossed in the movie, Erich speaks along with the TV:

                                 JOKER (ON TV)
                        “Why so serious?”

           END MONTAGE.

           EXT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY

           A designer boutique tucked on a quiet street.

           INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY

           Cooper browses tuxedos. Erich tries to see into the dressing 
           room. Jena and Ryan are off in the corner together. Jena 
           stands at attention while two female ATTENDANTS take her 
           measurements.

                                 JENA
                        So?

                                 RYAN
                        He’s great.

                                 JENA
                             (relieved)
                        Yeah?

                                 RYAN
                        We love him.

           Ryan’s tone changes.
                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        He does blink a lot, though.

                                 JENA
                        Pete?

                                 RYAN
                        Kinda weird.

                                 JENA
                        You think?

                                 RYAN
                        Blinks more than usual, I’d say.

                                 JENA
                             (with a smile)
                        Fuck it. I’ll dump him.

           The shop attendants wince at her language.

                                 RYAN
                        He’s all like--

           Ryan blinks a lot.

                                 JENA
                        That’s not so bad.

                                 RYAN
                             (still blinking)
                        What’s up-- I’m Pete.

                                 JENA
                        It’s kind of hot.

           He blinks faster. She punches his arm.

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        Stop it. 

                                 RYAN
                        I can’t.

           She puts on a vampy tone and rubs her hands on his chest.

                                 JENA
                        You’re turning me on.

           An attendant beckons Jena towards a dressing room. Ryan 
           watches her walk away. He’s still blinking.
           INT. BRIDAL SHOP - LATER 

           Jena emerges from the dressing room. Ryan, Erich, and Cooper 
           perk up out of their bored reverie when they see her. 

           Jena pads softly across the carpet in her bare feet. The 
           dress fits perfectly.

                                 JENA
                        Do you guys think it’s too classy 
                        and elegant and hot for me? 

           She twirls in her classy, elegant and hot wedding dress.

                                 ERICH
                        I’d bonerize you in that.

                                 JENA
                        You’d bonerize anyone in anything.

                                 RYAN
                        I’m simultaneously dazzled and 
                        entranced.

                                 COOPER
                        I’m entrazzled.

           We see the first crack in Jena’s defenses. She actually 
           blushes. Her hands go involuntarily to the ornate fabric.

                                 RYAN
                        It’s weird. I always thought we’d 
                        get married eventually. I mean not 
                        really, but kind of, like how we’re 
                        safeties-- like both of us single 
                        at 40 and getting married?

                                 COOPER
                             (miffed)
                        We were already safeties at 45.

                                 JENA
                        I hedged.

                                 RYAN
                        I mean, I always thought I wouldn’t 
                        see your dress until you walked 
                        down the aisle. I mean not really, 
                        but... we’d get married because we 
                        were the only two single people 
                        left. But not really.

           Cooper and Erich exchange a weirded-out look. Jena keeps on 
           smiling, but it no longer seems genuine.
           Ryan realizes he’s being weird.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m joking. Do you know what a joke 
                        is? I could look it up for you.
                             (to a shop attendant)
                        Can you get us a dictionary?

           INT. DOWNTOWN ARCHITECTURE FIRM - DAY

           Ryan stares down at the new blueprints.

                                 RYAN
                        This sucks.

           Beth appears beside him.

                                 BETH
                        Maybe you should have helped me.

                                 RYAN
                             (patting her on the back)
                        No, no-- you did a good job.
                             (then)
                        But I don’t know what to do.

                                 BETH
                        You missed your chance, slugger.

                                 RYAN
                             (a mile a minute)
                        I know! But I never wanted to fool 
                        around with her because if we 
                        fooled around then we’d break up, 
                        and if we broke up then we’d 
                        pretend to be friends for a little 
                        while, and if we pretended to be 
                        friends for a little while, then 
                        we’d be all awkward together and 
                        eventually everything would fall 
                        apart and we’d never speak to each 
                        other ever again.
                             (deep breath)
                        But now? She’s suddenly capable of 
                        holding down a long-term 
                        relationship and it’s with some guy 
                        we don’t even know?!

           Beth nods.

                                 BETH
                        I meant you missed your chance to 
                        impress the partners with the new 
                        Notopolos designs.
                                 RYAN
                        ...that too.

           EXT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - NIGHT

           On the back porch. Ryan watches the lights go out in Jena’s 
           window. The house is quiet. He turns to Cooper and Erich.

                                 RYAN
                        Idea: we murder Pete.

                                 COOPER
                             (sarcastic)
                        Repercussions: none?

                                 ERICH
                        I’m in.

           Ryan speaks in a hushed whisper. He keeps glancing up at 
           Jena’s dark window.

                                 RYAN
                        He’s stealing Jena. Pretty soon 
                        we’ll never see her again. The four 
                        musketeers will be no more.

           Cooper shrugs. He seems ok with it.

                                 COOPER
                        We’ll go back to being the three 
                        musketeers. Like when D’Artagnan 
                        died at the Siege of Maastricht.

                                 ERICH
                        What the fuck-- “Spoiler alert?”

                                 RYAN
                        Listen. Pete’s no different than 
                        us. He’s like the three of us 
                        merged into one. Except also he 
                        gets to have sex with her.

                                 ERICH
                        She has three holes, we could 
                        totally do that.

                                 COOPER
                        She’s our friend, not a prostitute. 

                                 RYAN
                        I was thinking... what if we kinda 
                        sorta tried to break them up?

           Erich’s eyes light up.
                                 ERICH
                        Oh shit.

           Cooper starts shaking his head no. It only makes Erich nod 
           faster.

                                 COOPER
                        We have no right to interfere with 
                        her happiness. 

                                 RYAN
                        We’re not interfering with her 
                        happiness. We’re... redirecting her 
                        happiness?

                                 COOPER
                        Remember that time you won two 
                        front-row tickets to Daft Punk-- my 
                        brother’s favorite band of all 
                        time, but you told him you only had 
                        one?

                                 RYAN
                        I wanted room to dance.

                                 COOPER
                        This is just like that, but worse. 
                        You’re being a selfish a-hole.

           Erich is bouncing up and down. Can’t contain his excitement.

                                 ERICH
                        Shut up, Cooper! What if we gave 
                        Pete like ten Viagras and then 
                        slashed his tires. He’d die in a 
                        car crash and everyone at his 
                        funeral would be like, “that dead 
                        body has a crazy boner.”

                                 COOPER
                             (to Ryan)
                        What if we interfere and she never 
                        loves again?

                                 RYAN
                        You’re missing the point. We mess 
                        with her relationship and then a) 
                        they break up. It wasn’t meant to 
                        be. Or b) she stays with him and 
                        their love is stronger for our 
                        meddling.

           Erich shakes Cooper by the shoulders.
                                 ERICH
                        I love where this is going!

           Erich starts pacing before Cooper like a trial lawyer giving 
           a closing argument.

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        In fact, no one should be allowed 
                        to get married without us fucking 
                        with their relationship! 

                                 RYAN
                        If this were an 80’s movie, we’d 
                        start a business called 
                        Relationship Fuckers.

           Cooper stares up at Jena’s dark window. Mulling it over. 
           Erich can hardly contain himself.

                                 ERICH
                             (singing)
                        “Who you gonna call?! Relationship 
                        Fuckers!”

           Cooper sighs. He’ll go along with it.

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - RYAN’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Ryan picks up the phone. Sitting on the bed, Erich keeps 
           cracking up like a kid making a prank call, while Ryan 
           shushes him. Cooper works on his laptop, ignoring them.

                                 RYAN
                             (serious, into phone)
                        Hey this is Ryan Harper, I’m a 
                        friend of Jena and Pete’s? Listen, 
                        we’re doing this fun thing for the 
                        rehearsal dinner. It’s called 
                        Pete’s Most Embarrassing Moments?

           Erich loses it. 

           EXT. SPORTS BAR - SAME

           A fratty type-- apparently PETE’S FRIEND-- steps outside from 
           a crowded sports bar. He’s on the phone with Ryan.

                                 PETE’S FRIEND
                        That dude was on Super Sloppy 
                        Double-Dare back in the day. Kicked 
                        some ass. Did the obstacle course 
                        and everything. And he totally won!
                                 RYAN
                        How... embarrassing?

           INT. DMV - DAY

           At the front of the queue, Cooper steps up to a CUTE DMV 
           CLERK. He seems unprepared for her cuteness. Still, he tries 
           his best to do a suave, George Clooney-thing.

                                 COOPER
                        Hey pretty lady, I need you to bend 
                        the rules and get me a driving 
                        record... 

           She stares at him.

                                 COOPER (CONT’D)
                             (nervous)
                        I called you pretty, did you hear?

                                 CUTE DMV CLERK
                        If you want me to break the law, 
                        you’re going to have to hit on me 
                        harder than that.

           Cooper thinks about it. Nope, that’s all he’s got.

                                 COOPER
                        Okay, gotta go.

           INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           A HOT BLONDE sits in her cubicle talking on her headset. 

                                 HOT BLONDE
                        I don’t think Pete’s ever done 
                        anything embarrassing. 

           INTERCUT with Erich wrestling the phone away from Ryan.

                                 ERICH
                        From the sound of your voice I can 
                        tell you’re at least an Eight. Are 
                        you coming to the wedding?

           EXT. PETE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Binoculars up, Erich watches Pete get ready for bed. Erich 
           speaks into a pocket tape recorder.

                                 ERICH
                        It’s 10:35 PM. He’s heading to bed.

           Pete gets naked.
                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                             (into recorder)
                        His penis is medium to large in 
                        size.

           He clicks it off. Then presses record again.

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        Nice.

           EXT. PHILLY STREET - DAY

           A friend of Pete’s, FINKLER, walks down the street. He’s on 
           the phone with Ryan.

                                 FINKLER
                        Dude. What about “the thing that 
                        shall not be named.”

                                 RYAN (V.O.)
                        Refresh my memory.

                                 FINKLER
                        Oh shit. That’s one you’ve got to 
                        hear from the horse’s mouth.
                             (cracking himself up)
                        “HONK HONK!”

           INT. MONTY’S MAGIC SHOP - DAY

           Jena restocks shelves with magic sets. Behind her, MONTY, an 
           old man in a wizard costume, performs magic on a rinky-dink 
           demo stage for a group of adoring children. Jena looks on, 
           jealous. 

           Pete walks into the shop. He holds a blanket and sandwiches. 

           EXT. A PARK - DAY

           Ryan and Erich, both with binoculars now, spy on Jena and 
           Pete’s picnic.

                                 RYAN
                        What do you think it means?

                                 ERICH
                        Maybe it’s like a goose? 

                                 RYAN
                             (trying it, dubious)
                        “HONK HONK.”

                                 ERICH
                        Or a car? A duck? A clown’s nose?
           EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY

           A quiet street corner. Ryan, Cooper, and Erich are having 
           coffee with a cute twenty-something, MINDY, Pete’s ex-
           girlfriend.

                                 MINDY
                        One time at P.F. Chang’s, this guy 
                        totally grabbed my butt on purpose. 
                        Pete was like “hey!” and the guy 
                        got all up in his face and Pete 
                        kind of pushed him.

           The guys exchange a look.

                                 MINDY (CONT’D)
                        The guy slipped on a rice noodle or 
                        something and fell back onto a 
                        table. I think he broke his nose? 

           The guys are stupefied.

                                 MINDY (CONT’D)
                        Either way, he really burned his 
                        face bad with wonton soup cause it 
                        spilled on him and he was like, 
                        “Ahhh My face! My face!”
                             (then)
                        I still hear his screams whenever I 
                        smell Orange Peel Beef.

                                 RYAN
                        Pete should be in jail!

           Mindy shakes her head.

                                 COOPER
                        It was an accident?

                                 MINDY
                        He was just trying to protect me. 
                        He didn’t want to hurt anyone.

                                 ERICH
                        He’s a cold-blooded killer.

           Pete’s ex covers her face, acting it out again.

                                 MINDY
                        “My face! My face!”

           INT. RYAN’S CAR - LATER

           Driving back home.
                                 ERICH
                        We gotta do something. Make him 
                        snap-- Show Jena his rage.

                                 RYAN
                        No. But we should tell her about 
                        this. She should know everything 
                        about him. Even if he’s an 
                        accidental psycho.

                                 COOPER
                        Gentlemen. What she just described 
                        was a non-event. We tell Jena 
                        nothing. We cannot blow our cover. 
                        But rest assured, at some point we 
                        will find out what we’re looking 
                        for. Everyone has a secret.

                                 ERICH
                        Pussy.

                                 RYAN
                        You don’t think we should tell her?

                                 COOPER
                        I’d rather do nothing than do the 
                        wrong thing.

           Ryan looks out the window as it starts raining. He nods.

                                 ERICH
                        You gotta be kidding me!

                                 RYAN
                        Cooper’s right. Until we have 
                        something concrete, let’s just make 
                        the best of it. He’s a nice enough 
                        guy after all. Even if he did scald 
                        a dude’s face with hot wonton soup.

           Erich kicks his seat.

           INT. JENA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Jena’s Dad paces with a notepad.

                                 JENA’S DAD
                        What about Italian Wedding Soup?

                                 JENA’S MOM (O.S.)
                        Nobody wants to eat soup at a 
                        wedding!
                                 JENA’S DAD
                        SHE KNOWS I LOVE SOUP!!!

           Pete smiles.

                                 PETE
                        Everybody loves a hot bowl of soup.

           Dad storms out. Pete and Jena take a break from wedding 
           planning. She tosses aside an ever-growing guest list.

                                 JENA
                        Please God I can’t do this anymore.

                                 PETE
                        Let’s just invite everyone we know.

           She gets up and stretches.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        And you’re sure about the guys? 
                        Having them be bridesmaids?

                                 JENA
                        It’s the only part I’m looking 
                        forward to.

           Pete nods a little too quickly. Jena catches it--

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean--

                                 PETE
                        --I feel like they hate me. 

                                 JENA
                        They like you. 

                                 PETE
                        I can’t make any headway when 
                        they’re all together. 

                                 JENA
                        You need to pick them off one by 
                        one. Like you’re chasing a herd of 
                        buffalo... socially speaking.

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - NIGHT

           In the TV room. Ryan’s on his laptop, tweaking house plans. 
           Jena turns on the Wii and picks up the guitar.
                                 JENA
                        You want to come to dinner with me 
                        and Pete? He’s paying. 

                                 RYAN
                        Trying to buy my friendship?

                                 JENA
                        That’s Pete. The buyer of 
                        friendships. Imagine how much I 
                        cost him.

           Jena hovers really close, soloing the guitar right in his 
           face, sticking her tongue out like Gene Simmons from KISS. 

                                 RYAN
                        Should we go right now? I can have 
                        an intern do this. I’m a powerful 
                        man.

           Jena jams on the guitar.

                                 JENA
                             (Rock Opera singing)
                        “Not ‘til Saturday!! I’ll get a 
                        table for three!!”

           Ryan’s about to let it go but then he almost involuntarily 
           stops her--

                                 RYAN
                             (bad Rock Opera singing)
                        “Actually Four. Can I bring 
                        someone? That I’m dating?”

           He seems to not even know why he’s singing it. But he’s 
           obviously pleased with the results: Jena pantomimes breaking 
           the guitar on Ryan’s head, THE WHO style.

                                 JENA
                        Holy crap!!! You’re dating someone?

           Um....

                                 RYAN
                        Yeah. We’re sexual with each other?

                                 JENA
                        Have I met her?

                                 RYAN
                        It’s not my fault you categorically 
                        ignore my girlfriend. 
                                 JENA
                        Dude! You’re totally making this 
                        girl up right now. 

                                 RYAN
                        Why would I do that?

           She plops down next to him on the couch. 

                                 JENA
                             (knowing)
                        I don’t even wanna know.

                                 RYAN
                        Well I’m not making her up.

                                 JENA
                             (dubious)
                        What’s her name?

           After a moment...

                                 RYAN
                        ...Beth?

           INT. DOWNTOWN ARCHITECTURE FIRM - DAY

           Conference room. Notopolos is back, looking over the revised 
           blueprints. Ryan, Beth, and Amed watch him nervously.

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        I’m happy to say... I have no 
                        adjustments.

           Ryan, Beth, and Amed breathe a collective sigh of relief. 

                                 NOTOPOLOS (CONT’D)
                        And that hot tub in the kitchen? 
                        How’d you know I hate to eat when 
                        I’m dry?!

           Ryan winks at Beth. Notopolos ropes them for a group hug.

                                 NOTOPOLOS (CONT’D)
                        I’m sad. Will I ever see you 
                        beautiful people again?

           Notopolos takes out a digital camera. He sets the self-timer.

                                 NOTOPOLOS (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get a picture together. For 
                        Friendster.
                                 BETH
                             (mouthing to Ryan)
                        Friendster?

           Ryan laughs. Notopolos slides his hand to Beth’s butt. Her 
           eyes go wide as the flash POPS.

           INT. DOWNTOWN ARCHITECTURE FIRM - CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Ryan and Beth take down 3D renderings from the corkboard. 

                                 BETH
                        Who’s going to sexually harass me 
                        now that Notopolos is gone?

                                 RYAN
                        How about a date with me?

                                 BETH
                        That’s the cheesiest harassment 
                        ever. At least say the word 
                        “sugartits.”

                                 RYAN
                        I’m serious. Saturday?

                                 BETH
                        Wait, really?

           She seems mildly intrigued by the idea.

                                 RYAN
                        Settle down. A double date. With 
                        Jena and What’s-his-face. The 
                        fiancé.

                                 BETH
                        Don’t pretend like you forgot his 
                        name.

                                 RYAN
                        So you’ll come?

                                 BETH
                        I’ll come. All night long.
                             (playfully touching him)
                        Now that’s sexual harassment, baby.

           EXT. FANCY ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Walking down the sidewalk, Jena and Beth chat, keeping pace 
           in front of Pete and Ryan.
                                 JENA
                        Nice to meet you, Beth. It appears 
                        that you do, in fact, exist.

           Beth glances back and gives Ryan a smile. Out in the street, 
           a CITY BUS stops and the driver yells to Pete.

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        Hey dude! Why don’t you drive my 
                        bus! “HONK HONK!”

           Pete waves, then realizes Ryan is staring at him. Pete 
           suddenly tries to look confused.

                                 PETE
                        He must think I’m someone else.

                                 RYAN
                        I bet that happens a lot.

           They eye each other.

           INT. FANCY ITALIAN RESTAURANT - LATER

           The foursome sits at a table in the back.

                                 RYAN
                        A toast. To Jena and Pete. May you 
                        live forever, but not like zombies.

           Cheers. We see a moment of genuine gratitude from Jena, the 
           kind of glimmer that doesn’t come often with her.

           Pete gives Jena a passionate kiss. Ryan glances at Beth. Beth 
           stares slack-jawed at the intense, ongoing make-out session. 

           Ryan moves towards Beth for a kiss, wanting to match Jena. 
           Beth leans away from him.

                                 BETH
                        Settle down, settle down. 

           Reveal: a server waiting behind them. Pete and Jena are still 
           tonguing each other.

                                 RYAN
                             (to the server)
                        We might need a minute.

           INT. FANCY ITALIAN RESTAURANT - LATER

           A server comes out from the kitchen with appetizers. He 
           delivers it to the table, where Pete’s in mid-story. The 
           table dynamic shows body language rife with tension.
                                 PETE
                        We’d probably move in June after 
                        the wedding. June or July.

           Ryan seems disturbed by this. He glances at Jena.

                                 RYAN
                        Wow.

                                 JENA
                        It’s not definite.

                                 RYAN
                        I can’t picture you happy in Miami.

           Jena shrugs-- she kind of knows he’s right.

                                 PETE
                        I go down there a lot for business. 
                        It’s so great.

                                 BETH
                             (half-making fun)
                        You a big roller-blader, Pete?

           Ryan hasn’t taken his eyes off Jena. He’s grasping at straws 
           and he knows it--

                                 RYAN
                        What about Monty’s Magic shop? You 
                        were salesman of the month. 

                                 JENA
                        It’s only me and Monty. 

           Ryan picks at his food. We stay focused on him as:

                                 PETE
                        I’m sure we’ll be up to visit. 
                        Maybe after a year or two, when we 
                        get settled in. Unless we have kids 
                        of course. Heh-- just kidding. But 
                        I don’t know, a kid could be fun.

           Ryan takes a bite of food. Chewing a mussel.

                                 JENA
                        Totally.

           Ryan can’t believe she’s agreeing--

                                 RYAN
                        Wha--
           He starts coughing. Pete perks up.

                                 PETE
                        Are you okay? 
                             (miming)
                        Do you know the international sign 
                        for choking?

           Ryan waves him off. He’s having a COUGHING fit.

                                 JENA
                        I get it, Leslie Nielson, you’re 
                        shocked. Hilarious. Why don’t you 
                        do a spit take while you’re at it.

           Ryan gasps for breath.

                                 PETE
                        I know the Heimlich Maneuver. 

                                 RYAN
                             (between coughs)
                        I’m not choking.

           Pete stands up. 

                                 PETE
                        I’m an Eagle Scout.

                                 JENA
                        He’s not choking!

           Ryan’s coughing fit subsides, but now he’s panicked as Pete 
           runs behind him and wraps his arms around his middle.

                                 RYAN
                             (calming down)
                        Seriously Pete-- I’m talking, it 
                        means I’m breathing.

           Pete starts to relax his arms, but then Ryan COUGHS one more 
           time! Pete instinctively squeezes Ryan’s stomach as hard as 
           he can-- sending a hefty quantity of mussels, water, and wine 
           out of his mouth and RIGHT ONTO JENA.

           Ryan grips his stomach in pain.

                                 PETE
                        Looks like you were choking after 
                        all.

           Glaring at Ryan, Jena slowly removes the bile-covered mussels 
           from her chest. 
                                 RYAN
                        You made me throw up. 

           Pete considers this. After a moment, he hands Jena a napkin. 
           She gives the boys a tight smile and heads for the bathroom.

           EXT. FANCY ITALIAN RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           Ryan stands out in the cold. On his cell phone.

                                 RYAN
                             (into phone)
                        We are a go for Relationship 
                        Fuckers. I repeat: we are a go for 
                        Relationship Fuckers.

           INT. FANCY ITALIAN RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           Back at the table, Jena, Pete, and Beth eat their food. 

                                 BETH
                             (to Pete)
                        Have we met before? You seem so 
                        familiar...

                                 PETE
                        Would you believe I get that all 
                        the time. I think I just have one 
                        of those faces.

           Ryan sits back down. He clears his throat and says something 
           that he might have been rehearsing in his head for a while:

                                 RYAN
                        Pete, did you know Jena and I used 
                        to dine-and-dash at places like 
                        this? I think it reminded her of 
                        her shoplifting days.

                                 PETE
                        It’s cheaper than paying I guess.

           Pete smiles and takes Jena’s hand. He’s just too damn nice.

                                 JENA
                             (eyeing Ryan)
                        We’d always leave a tip.

           She glares at him. Ryan doesn’t give up.
                                 RYAN
                        Another classic Jena story: this 
                        one time she got drunk and told our 
                        buddy Winston she supported 
                        reparations because, and I quote, 
                        “without slavery we wouldn’t have 
                        the internet.”

           Beth glances at a black family eating nearby, nervous. 
           Meanwhile Pete’s laughing at Ryan’s story.

                                 PETE
                             (to Jena)
                        You said that?

           Jena stares daggers at Ryan. Beth changes the subject.

                                 BETH
                        Hey, have you guys heard the new 
                        Girl Talk?

                                 RYAN
                             (before anyone can answer)
                        Pete, did you know that Jena called 
                        me on the phone from Spain, long 
                        distance, to tell me that she got 
                        drunk and threw up down a 
                        Spaniard’s pants?

                                 PETE
                             (going with it)
                        Los Pantalones del Fuego.

           Jena leans towards Ryan so the others can’t really hear her. 
           She knows what he’s up to and she threatens him back.

                                 JENA
                        You sure you want to climb this 
                        jungle gym, kiddo?

           Ryan winks. Jena grins, always up for a challenge. She turns 
           to Beth and adopts a very scholarly tone:

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        Beth, did you know that as a young 
                        boy, Ryan used to wet the bed 
                        because the toilet was, and I 
                        quote, “too far away”? 

           Ryan gives Beth a look like-- “oh, please.”

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        Now he has what doctor’s call 
                        “secondary enuresis.”
           Ryan shakes his head. Jena wiggles a victory dance in her 
           seat. Pete watches, knowing he’s missing some part of an 
           inside joke.

           Ryan accepts her challenge. He turns to Pete.

                                 RYAN
                        Hey Pete. Jena moves her lips when 
                        she reads.

                                 JENA
                             (to Beth)
                        When he saw The Lion King, Ryan 
                        laughed when Simba’s dad died.

                                 PETE
                             (kind of sad)
                        Mufasa?

           They start making up lies on the fly:

                                 RYAN
                        Jena... saves all her toenail 
                        clippings in a mayonnaise jar under 
                        her bed.

           Pete frowns.

                                 JENA
                        Ryan microwaved a mouse just to see 
                        what would happen.

                                 BETH
                        For real?

                                 RYAN
                        Jena eats live spiders because she 
                        likes the way their crawling 
                        tickles her stomach.

                                 JENA
                        Ryan peed in a cup and then drank 
                        the pee and then he peed again and 
                        drank it one more time.

           Pete and Beth both grimace. This is getting too weird.

                                 RYAN
                        Jena went from doctor to doctor 
                        trying to find someone who’d 
                        surgically attach baby penises onto 
                        her nipples.
           Ryan and Jena start kicking each other under the table, like 
           a game of footsies gone horribly wrong. Pete and Beth 
           exchange a look. What the hell is going on?

                                 PETE
                             (trying to ignore them)
                        Beth, can I try your Rigatoni?

           Pete tries her food-- delicious.

                                 RYAN
                        One time Jena took a dump in the 
                        shower and mashed it down the drain 
                        with her foot.

           Jena taps her knife to her glass. DING DING DING!!! Everyone 
           in the restaurant turns to her.

                                 JENA
                        Attention everyone! This man has a 
                        micropenis.

           At every table, all conversation stops.

           EXT. FANCY ITALIAN RESTAURANT - LATER

           Ryan, Jena, Beth, and Pete are escorted out of the 
           restaurant. Ryan spots Erich across the street. Erich gives 
           him a thumbs-up and then ducks behind a car.

           As if on cue, a good-looking DRAMA STUDENT (Buddy Holly 
           glasses, UPenn sweatshirt) approaches Jena.

                                 DRAMA STUDENT
                        Don’t I recognize you? 
                             (lowering his voice)
                        ...from my dreams?

           Pete steps between them.

                                 PETE
                        Keep walking, Weezer.

                                 DRAMA STUDENT
                        And leave this gorgeous girl 
                        behind? Hey-- how about you show a 
                        little boob?

           Jena flinches. As for Beth, she’s slowly separating herself 
           from the group. Pete grabs the Drama Student by the 
           sweatshirt. Ryan tries to intervene.
                                 PETE
                        Tell your story walking, little 
                        guy!

           The Drama Student suddenly drops his suave act.

                                 DRAMA STUDENT
                             (scared, talking fast)
                        Hey-- whoa-- I’m just a drama 
                        major. These two shady guys gave me 
                        eighty bucks to get in your face. 
                        Look, they’re watching us right now 
                        from across the street...

           The drama student points at Erich and Cooper, standing behind 
           a car. They duck.

                                 DRAMA STUDENT (CONT’D)
                             (shaking his head)
                        They think they’re hidden.

           We can still see the tops of their heads.

                                 RYAN
                        We can see you!

                                 JENA
                        Ryan? What is going on...

           Ryan shakes his head, feigning innocence. 

                                 DRAMA STUDENT
                             (squinting at Pete)
                        Hey man, do I know you from 
                        somewhere?

                                 PETE
                        No.

           Pete lets go of the drama student. He walks out into the 
           street. He’s smiling.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                             (friendly)
                        Listen guys, I think we got off on 
                        the wrong foot here. Let’s just 
                        talk about this.

                                 ERICH
                        Stay back, psycho!

                                 PETE
                        I won’t stay back until I have your 
                        friendship!
           He keeps walking across the street.

           ON JENA AND RYAN:

           They watch Pete cross the street and walk right into the path 
           of an oncoming car. Brakes SCREECH. Pete CRASHES against the 
           windshield and tumbles to the pavement.

                                 JENA
                        Pete!

           EXT. FANCY ITALIAN RESTAURANT - LATER

           On a gurney, an unconscious Pete gets loaded into the back of 
           an ambulance. A shaken Jena climbs in the back with him. 
           Ryan, Cooper and Erich below her. Bathed in flashing red 
           lights.

                                 ERICH
                        This wouldn’t have happened if he 
                        wasn’t so crazy.

                                 COOPER
                        I told Erich not to do it.

           Erich looks at Cooper, annoyed.

                                 RYAN
                        Should I come with you? 

                                 COOPER
                        We could all come. For support?

           Ryan winces-- he doesn’t want to get bundled in with them.

                                 JENA
                        Yeah you guys have been so 
                        supportive lately, I think that’s a 
                        great idea. Here, let me clear some 
                        room in the ambulance next to my 
                        unconscious fiancé.

           The back doors close. The ambulance drives away, leaving 
           Ryan, Cooper, and Erich alone in the middle of the street.

           From the sidewalk:

                                 BETH
                        Ryan. Take me home?

           Erich checks her out. He elbows Ryan.

                                 ERICH
                        Nice jugs, dude.
           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - JENA’S ROOM - DAY

           Jena packs underwear into a box. In fact, she’s surrounded by 
           moving boxes. Ryan, Cooper, and Erich stand in the doorway.

                                 COOPER
                        Maybe we owe you an apology.

           Ryan steps away to distance himself.

                                 RYAN
                        “We,” being Erich and Cooper, I 
                        think.

                                 ERICH
                        The three amigos, we’re here to say 
                        we’re sorry.

                                 RYAN
                        Two amigos actually.

                                 ERICH
                        Jena, on behalf of all of us... 
                        we’re sorry.

           Jena straddles the box, really having trouble getting the 
           ends to close. Her face is tight-- frustrated at the box, the 
           guys, or both.

                                 JENA
                        No apology necessary. Want to help 
                        me pack? It’ll be fun.

           The guys weren’t ready for that. They nod, cautious.

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        Erich, you build boxes. Cooper, 
                        could you start disassembling my 
                        bed? Ryan, pack with me.

           Jena packs the next box with her back to Ryan.

                                 RYAN
                        ...We just wanted to make sure he’s 
                        right for you. It’s kind of our job 
                        to test him and be honest with you.

                                 JENA
                        In that case I should tell you-- 
                        Beth is a phony hipster bitch.
                                 RYAN
                        You’re never going to like whoever 
                        I date. Just like how we’ll never 
                        like whoever you date.

           Jena dumps the last drawer of clothes into a box. 

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Do you want the truth?
                             (after a moment)
                        We’re not quite comfortable with 
                        you marrying Pete.

                                 JENA
                        Wow Ryan, what a shocking 
                        revelation. I didn’t see this 
                        coming. What a twist. You’re like 
                        the M. Night Shyamalan of friends.

           Jena picks up a box and leaves. Music kicks in...

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - LATER

           Wii Rock Band. Ryan sings Weezer’s Say It Ain’t So. It plays 
           over the next few scenes.

           EXT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - DAY

           A cloudy rainy morning. Men load a moving truck with Jena’s 
           stuff. Pete and Jena load her car. Ryan, Cooper and Erich 
           stand on the porch watching. Jena gets in the passenger seat. 
           Pete slams the trunk. They drive away.

           EXT. FAIRMOUNT PARK - DAY

           Orange autumn leaves begin to fall off the trees.

           INT. PETE’S APARTMENT - NORTH PHILLY - DAY

           Black leather couch, glass coffee table, simple green rug. 
           Jena struggles to use Pete’s 60-inch plasma TV. She tries six 
           different remotes that work every device but the TV.

           INT. PETE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Bored and alone, Jena practices magic in front of a mirror. 
           She makes one of Pete’s remotes disappear and reappear at 
           will. It’s impressive. She hears the door OPEN and she 
           quickly tosses the remote on the couch. She smiles innocently 
           at Pete as he limps in on a cast. 
           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - NIGHT

           On the way to his bedroom, Ryan passes Jena’s empty room. 
           Where she used to sleep. With the dust, he can even see where 
           her bed used to be.

           INT. PETE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jena plays poker with Pete and his buddies. They sign his 
           cast. Jena’s tries to enjoy herself with these new friends. 

           EXT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - DAY

           The first snowfall dusts the house.

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - DAY

           Ryan adjusts the thermostat. He’s wearing gloves. Even 
           inside, his breath condenses in the cold air.

                                 RYAN
                        It’s up as high as it goes.

           Erich sits on the couch, bundled in winter clothes. Cooper 
           emerges from his room, dressed for work. 

                                 ERICH
                             (to Cooper)
                        You were messing with that thing 
                        last week. Trying to save money.

                                 COOPER
                        I didn’t touch it.

                                 RYAN
                             (realizing)
                        What’s today?

                                 COOPER
                        The fifteenth.

           Ryan’s face falls. He knows what’s up.

                                 RYAN
                        Jena always paid for gas.

                                 ERICH
                        Fuuuuuuck.

                                 RYAN
                             (to Cooper)
                        Call them up.
                                 COOPER
                        You call them. I’m not calling 
                        them. 

                                 RYAN
                        Suddenly you’re too busy?

                                 COOPER
                             (holding up his briefcase)
                        Actually I am. I’m being sued by 
                        Shaquille O’Neal for exploiting his 
                        likeness.

                                 ERICH
                        Oh shit you’re going to be in a 
                        room with Shaq?

                                 COOPER
                        His lawyers anyway.

           Ryan taps on the thermostat.

                                 RYAN
                        Ok, well, with that dumb site shut 
                        down you’ll have plenty of time to 
                        call the gas company. 

                                 ERICH
                        Somebody pick up the fucking phone!

                                 COOPER
                        It’s not my fault she moved out.

           Ryan catches Cooper’s accusatory tone and matches it.

                                 RYAN
                        You were with Erich, you could have 
                        stopped him.

                                 ERICH
                             (to Ryan)
                        You called me from the restaurant, 
                        dick.

                                 COOPER
                        I told both of you--

                                 ERICH
                             (warming his hands)
                        Motherfuck, my left ball just 
                        shattered.

           Cooper walks out the front door. 
                                 RYAN
                        Fine. Whatever. I guess I’m the 
                        responsible one now.

           Ryan picks up the phone.

           EXT. PHILLY PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

           Jena and Pete climb the marble steps and walk through the 
           immense front doors. Pete’s on crutches. Jena helps him up.

           INT. PHILLY PUBLIC LIBRARY - LATER

           Rows and rows of stacks. Jena slinks down an aisle, as quiet 
           as possible. Pete hobbles noisily along behind her.

           She puts her hand up. Pete stops. She gestures-- “one sec.”

           Jena sticks a high-end SLR camera through a separation of 
           books in the stack. She takes a photo of a man picking his 
           nose while he reads.

                                 PETE
                        Is this supposed to be enjoyable?

                                 JENA
                             (whispering)
                        People feel safe in a library. Each 
                        person is in their own quiet world. 
                        And we capture it on film. 

                                 PETE
                        You sure you don’t want to go to a 
                        movie? The Ritz is showing a new, 
                        new, new cut of Brazil. 

                                 JENA
                        Shhhhhh.

                                 PETE
                        You’re the only person in the world 
                        who likes doing this.

                                 JENA
                        Ryan went on Library Safaris with 
                        me all the time.

                                 PETE
                        Library Safari, huh...

                                 JENA
                        That’s what Ryan named it.

           Pete’s getting sick of hearing about Ryan.
                                 PETE
                        But there’s no animals.

           Jena ignores him. She snaps another covert photo-- a muscle-
           bound body-builder type woman using the outdated microfiche.

           Pete leans towards her on his crutches, possibly showing off 
           his bad leg for emphasis.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        I’m just gonna throw this out 
                        there. I think Ryan and those guys-- 
                        like, yes, they’re your friends, 
                        but also, they really want to have 
                        sex with you?

           Jena doesn’t take the camera from her eye. She speaks from 
           the side of her mouth, humoring him.

                                 JENA
                        I bet they wouldn’t be bad in bed.

                                 PETE
                             (trying to joke along)
                        Are you thinking orgy, or one at a 
                        time...

           Jena swirls an imaginary wine glass and samples it.

                                 JENA
                        Ryan Harper-- rambunctious and 
                        silly... yet very passionate. 
                        Cooper Martin-- fastidious with 
                        just a hint of ineptitude. Erich 
                        Grabowski--  

           She cringes and shudders at the thought.

                                 PETE
                             (he’s had enough)
                        Alright.

                                 JENA
                        You brought it up.

           Pete spots a generic MOM and her KID browsing magazines.

                                 PETE
                        Hey that’s a good picture.

           She looks. The mom and kid just stand there. Jena’s 
           expression says there’s nothing interesting about them.
                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        Are you gonna take it?

           Without much enthusiasm, she snaps their picture.

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

           A sprawling mansion sits half-finished on a hill. Twenty 
           annoyed construction workers stand in a clump, looking down 
           the hill at--

           --Ryan, Beth, and Amed, breathing into their hands. It’s 
           freezing. Notopolos steps between them and the house.

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        I have some adjustments.

           INT. NOTOPOLOS’S CONSTRUCTION SITE - LATER

           Notopolos leads them through his half-finished monstrosity. 
           Ryan and Beth hang back, talking softly to each other...

                                 RYAN
                        I thought we were done with this yo-
                        yo.

                                 BETH
                        Can we just do his adjustments so I 
                        can go back to not speaking to you?

                                 RYAN
                        Oh, how professional of you.

           Beth gives Ryan the finger. 

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        Goddamn hallways!

           Notopolos is a whirlwind of energy. Ryan, Beth, and Amed 
           absorb his “adjustments” with a tired acceptance.

                                 NOTOPOLOS (CONT’D)
                        Too many hallways, not enough 
                        foyers. If I have to walk down one 
                        more hallway I’m gonna blow my 
                        brains out. It’s like an intern 
                        designed this shithole.

           Beth glares at Ryan, who in turn glares at Amed.

                                 AMED
                        I told you I had the draft. Got 
                        Dwayne Wade, bitches. 
           Notopolos takes Beth’s hand. She twinges but forces a smile.

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        And I know you understand the 
                        importance of working out, seeing 
                        as how you possess a marvelous 
                        buttocks...

           Beth quickly withdraws her hand and takes a step away.

                                 NOTOPOLOS (CONT’D)
                        ...so you of all people should know 
                        my new exercise room’ll never fit 
                        in this closet!

                                 RYAN
                             (re: a builtin bookshelf)
                        Why not add a secret passage while 
                        you’re at it?

           Notopolos balks at the idea.

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        Don’t be ridiculous.

           INT. NOTOPOLOS’S CONSTRUCTION SITE - LATER

           While Beth consults the original plans, a befuddled Ryan 
           considers a STRIPPER POLE in the middle of the Notopolos’ 
           living room.

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        Are you telling me we can’t push 
                        back that wall for an in-house 
                        strip-club?

                                 RYAN
                             (like a diplomat)
                        I’d like to think your “strip club” 
                        could fit in a room this size. 
                        Without any changes.

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        What about the champagne room?

                                 RYAN
                        We’re not making these changes.

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        Then I’ll find someone who will.
                                 RYAN
                        The room is fine! There’s plenty of 
                        room. It’s the perfect strip club 
                        size.

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        Show me.

           Notopolos sits on a workbench. He gestures Beth towards the 
           pole.

                                 BETH
                        Oh no.

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        Prove it, baby. Dance for me.

                                 BETH
                        Yeah-- you first.

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        Screw it! We bulldoze everything.

           Beth looks offended, disgusted, and enraged all at the same 
           time. Her eyes plead with Ryan-- what am I supposed to do 
           with this creep?

           Notopolos heads for the stressed-out CONTRACTOR. Ryan and 
           Beth watch him discuss the situation. After a moment, the 
           contractor shrugs and starts YELLING to his crew. 

           Ryan and Beth watch in growing horror as heavy machinery 
           GROANS to life.

                                 RYAN
                        Wait!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NOTOPOLOS’S CONSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ryan cautiously swings around the stripper pole. He has no 
           idea what he’s doing. Beth hides a laugh.

           Notopolos returns and slowly nods. Intrigued.

           Ryan whips around the pole again, gaining speed. He launches 
           his legs in the air-- CRASH! He hits the ground. But he turns 
           it into a sexy tiger pose and slinks back to the pole.

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        Now we’re talking...
           EXT. NOTOPOLOS’S CONSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER

           Amed walks through the house while talking on his cell phone.

                                 AMED
                        King Shaq? No, it’s not a 
                        basketball site. It’s this awesome 
                        website where Shaq grants wishes.

           Amed turns a corner into the living room. He stops and 
           stares.

                                 AMED (CONT’D)
                        Yo, can I call you back?

           Ryan is gyrating HARD against the stripper pole. Fifteen 
           WORKERS in hard-hats clap along to a beat. Ryan somehow pulls 
           off a tight spin move. The construction workers chant.

                                 CONSTRUCTION WORKERS
                        Go Ryan! Go Ryan!

           Ryan pops up and does another spin. 

                                 RYAN
                        Tell me it’s my birthday!

                                 CONSTRUCTION WORKERS
                        Go Ryan! It’s your birthday! 

           Notopolos bops his head to the beat, pleased. Ryan spots 
           Beth’s face-- He catches a slight grateful smile from her. 

           INT. MONTY’S MAGIC SHOP - AFTERNOON

           All alone, Jena closes up the shop. When she’s sure no one’s 
           around, she shuffles a deck of cards three times. On the 
           third shuffle, the deck disappears from her hand. 

                                 MONTY
                        Outstanding prestidigitation.

           FRPT-- she drops the cards from her sleeve. Old Monty hobbles 
           toward her from the back room.

                                 MONTY (CONT’D)
                        May I present an idea to tickle 
                        your fancy? How’d you like to run 
                        the demo magic show next week?

                                 JENA
                             (gathering the cards)
                        I’m tickled all right, but... no 
                        thanks.
           Monty nods, skeptical. 

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        It’s your name on the sign after 
                        all.

                                 MONTY
                        If you change your mind, it’s all 
                        yours. Don’t forget to clean the 
                        rabbit cage before you go.

           He leaves, passing a rabbit cage filled with poop. Jena 
           stares at the rabbit. Its nose twitches.

           INT. PETE’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Pete and Jena having dinner. The clinking silverware covers 
           the silence. Eventually--

                                 PETE
                        How was work?

           She measures the pause. Decides not mention Monty’s offer.

                                 JENA
                        Good.

           They resume eating in silence. 

                                 PETE
                        We should go to an Eagles game 
                        sometime.

                                 JENA
                        Definitely.

           Jena reaches for a magazine. She flips through it.

                                 PETE
                        Any good articles?

           Jena shrugs. Pete’s feeling uneasy at the silence.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not too boring for you, am I?

                                 JENA
                        Absolutely not.

           She goes back to her magazine.

           EXT. EXPRESSWAY - EVENING

           Beth drives Ryan and Amed back towards the city.
           INT. BETH’S CAR - SAME

           Ryan, adrenaline still pumping from his stripper moves, 
           dances in the passenger seat next to Beth.

                                 BETH
                        Nice moves. You really took one for 
                        the team. 

                                 RYAN
                        I know. Now I don’t have to do 
                        anymore work on that shitty house.
                             (then)
                        Hey. What if I asked you on a real 
                        date to make up for the Jena one?

           Beth doesn’t react. 

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Just you and me, two on the town. 
                        Starting over. I see us miniature 
                        golfing. Then maybe we eat at a 
                        sketchy hole-in-the-wall restaurant 
                        beloved by pretentious food 
                        critics. We end the night with a 
                        water balloon fight at Independence 
                        Hall. I’ll even call you Sugartits 
                        if you want.

           Beth half-smiles at him and he keeps rattling on. Excited.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        And it’ll have nothing to do with 
                        my friendship with Jena or making 
                        Jena jealous. I won’t mention her 
                        the entire time.

                                 BETH
                        You mentioned her just now.

           Amed leans up front from the back seat. 

                                 AMED
                        She got you there, dogg.

           Ryan’s unnerved to have him butting in.

                                 BETH
                        I don’t want to go on another date 
                        with you, Ryan. Especially not the 
                        terrible one you just described.

                                 RYAN
                        Beth--
                                 BETH
                        Instead, you and I are going to 
                        work on a special project together. 
                        After hours.

           Ryan catches her look. He shuts his mouth, pleased.

                                 AMED
                             (doesn’t get it)
                        Oh shit, dogg! You thought you were 
                        gonna get the booty but instead you 
                        got more work!

           INT. BETH’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Ryan and Beth make out in her elevator.

           INT. BETH’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Ryan and Beth stumble into her loft, still making out. It’s 
           decorated Vice magazine chic. Eclectic and hip. A sharp 
           contrast to Ryan’s simple living conditions. 

           She slinks towards her bedroom area. Ryan glances at the 
           kitchen fridge. There’s a fund-raising thermometer, half-full 
           on its way to $10,000.

                                 RYAN
                        It’s a balmy five thousand dollars 
                        in here.

                                 BETH
                        When I save enough money, I move to 
                        Brooklyn and kiss the city of 
                        brotherly love goodbye forever.

           Beth sits on her bed. She makes room for Ryan. He jokes:

                                 RYAN
                        Wait a minute, this isn’t a work 
                        project.

           Beth opens her bedside drawer. Throws a condom at Ryan. He 
           catches it, slightly unnerved.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        You don’t waste any time.

           Beth unzips her dress...

                                 BETH
                        Come on...
                             (ironic seductive)
                        I know your cock is curious.
           Ryan shifts his weight from foot to foot. Things seem to be 
           moving a bit fast for him.

                                 RYAN
                        Hey you know what they say, 
                        “Curiosity killed the cock.”

           She gets under the covers and makes room in the bed for him.

                                 BETH
                        You know me. You don’t have to be 
                        scared.

                                 RYAN
                        You’re the one who should be 
                        scared... of orgasms. Multiple 
                        ones.

           But he’s still just standing there.

           INT. BETH’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Beth and Ryan in bed together, under the covers. Ryan’s still 
           really tense. Beth stops kissing him.

                                 BETH
                        What’s wrong?

                                 RYAN
                        Nothing. I’m just, you know, 
                        getting ready. Warming up. Hey 
                        why’d you decide to become an 
                        architect anyway? Did you--

           Beth puts her finger to his lips. She reveals her laptop from 
           her night stand.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Wait. Now we are doing work?

                                 BETH
                        I had a boyfriend who had issues... 
                        like the ones we’re having now. 

                                 RYAN
                        There’s no issues.

                                 BETH
                        This always helped.

           She loads a website: YOU MUST BE 18 TO ENTER. 
                                 RYAN
                        I could touch your breasts some 
                        more. That usually works. 

           The porn site loads: www.bangbus.com. She plays one of the 
           preview clips.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        What if we-- okay that’s a vagina.

                                 ALEJANDRO (ON COMPUTER)
                        Alejandro here. This week we found 
                        this gorgeous librarian named Brie. 
                        She was just walking down the 
                        street minding her own business-- 
                        until we convinced her to get on 
                        our bus and do the nasty!

           Beth starts kissing Ryan’s neck. He closes his eyes.

                                 BRIE (ON COMPUTER)
                             (over-the-top ecstacy)
                        Don’t stop, don’t stop!!!

           Beth reaches under the covers. 

                                 ALEJANDRO (ON COMPUTER)
                        We’re bringin’ you over 500 of the 
                        finest hos. We pick ‘em up on the 
                        street, fuck ‘em on the bus, and 
                        dump ‘em in the gutter.

           We hear sounds of DIRTY SEX from her computer, and the sounds 
           of TRAFFIC as the bangbus drives around.

                                 BRIE (ON COMPUTER)
                        I’m a bad librarian! Bad librarian!

           Then the bangbus cameraman pans to the bus driver who turns 
           around-- it can’t be...

                                 RYAN
                        Oh fuck!

           Ryan scoots away like in a horror movie.

                                 PETE (ON COMPUTER)
                        Pound that pussy!

                                 ALEJANDRO (ON COMPUTER)
                        Watch the road, Pete!
                                 PETE (ON COMPUTER)
                        How can I take my eyes off that hot 
                        wet kitty?!

           Close up on Pete, the bus driver. The same Pete. Jena’s Pete.

                                 PETE (ON COMPUTER) (CONT’D)
                        It’s just sliding up and down your 
                        rock hard cock, hombre!

                                 ALEJANDRO (ON COMPUTER)
                        All aboard the bangbus!

                                 PETE (ON COMPUTER)
                        “HONK HONK!!!”

           Ryan screams! Then his screams of terror change to screams of 
           excitement. He jumps up and down on the bed.

                                 RYAN
                        THIS IS AMAZING! BETH! YOU’VE MADE 
                        ME THE HAPPIEST MAN ALIVE!

           He jumps on top of her and starts making out, hard. 

                                 BETH
                             (taking a breath)
                        Works every time.

           EXT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - DAY

           SOUNDS OF SEX from within the guys’ house.

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - LATER

           The sound comes from Ryan’s laptop speakers. Ryan, Cooper, 
           and Erich stare at screen. A car in the video HONKS.

                                 COOPER
                        That’s dangerous-- he should watch 
                        the road.

                                 ERICH
                             (unfazed)
                        Wow, that’s totally Pete. I can’t 
                        believe I never made the 
                        connection.

                                 RYAN
                        You’ve seen this before?

           Erich picks up the laptop, still playing the porn video.
                                 ERICH
                        I’ll be in my room.

           EXT. JENA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - DAY

           Jena pulls into her parents’ driveway. The boys are waiting 
           for her at the back door. She parks the car. Not happy to see 
           them. She doesn’t get out right away-- considering how to 
           handle their appearance. 

           Ryan holds a burned DVD.

           Jena sets her face and gets out of the car. Before the guys 
           can even say hello...

                                 JENA
                        It’s girls only.

           The guys are confused.

                                 RYAN
                        We have something to show you.

                                 JENA
                        I’m already late. 

           She tries to outflank them and get to her parents’ door. Ryan 
           blocks her. He waves the DVD.

                                 RYAN
                        It’s important. 

           Ryan pushes DVD into her hand. Cooper gently touches her arm.

                                 COOPER
                        It’s about Pete. Watch it in 
                        private.

           Jena shakes him off. Cooper flinches, hurt. Jena goes inside. 

                                 ERICH
                        What a bitch. 

           INT. JENA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - THE KITCHEN - LATER

           Jena tosses THE BOYS’ DVD onto the kitchen table. She’s a 
           ball of anxiety, fretting about tiny details in her dress.

                                 JENA
                        Let’s just tell them I’m having 
                        uncontrollable diarrhea. No one 
                        questions that.
                                 JENA’S MOM
                        Aunt Hester drove all the way from 
                        Boston for this.

                                 JENA
                        She’s 84-- she’ll understand a good 
                        leaky bowel movement excuse.

           Jena’s mom actually laughs, but--

                                 JENA’S MOM
                        Just do this for me. 

                                 JENA’S DAD
                        The girl doesn’t want to do it!

                                 JENA’S MOM
                             (snapping at him)
                        Everyone’s already here!!!

                                 JENA’S DAD
                        I don’t blame her! Who wants to 
                        spend time with a bunch of old 
                        ladies?!

                                 JENA’S MOM
                        Stay out of it, Harry!

           Jena sighs and walks out of the room.

           INT. JENA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - LATER

           A wedding shower. Jena’s surrounded by two dozen women, 
           mostly her mom’s age. She’d rather be anywhere but here, but 
           at least there’s presents. 

                                 AUNT HESTER
                        You were always such a free spirit. 
                        I never thought I’d live to see you 
                        settle down. I’m so happy for you.

           Jena’s mom squeezes Jena’s arm. Jena forces a smile. She 
           opens another gift.

                                 JENA
                        Oh no. What’s this? A naughty gift?

           She holds up a pair of blue lacy underwear. The older women 
           giggle to each other.

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                             (mock scolding)
                        Aunt Hester!
                                 AUNT HESTER
                        Hey, it’s something blue!

           All the women laugh. Jena sighs. She drops the underwear into 
           a pile of various kitchen appliances, towels, and cutlery.

           INT. JENA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - THE KITCHEN - LATER

           An exhausted Jena staggers past her dad.

                                 JENA
                        I’ve officially become the girl I 
                        hate.

           Her uninterested dad sits at the table reading the paper.

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        Hey-- where’s my DVD?

           The table is empty. The DVD is gone. Jena’s dad shrugs.

           INT. JENA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - SAME

           The TV room. Jena’s mom gently places JENA’S DVD in the 
           player. She turns to the room with a smile.

                                 JENA’S MOM
                        The boys made a movie for Jena.

           Her friends and relatives lean in. They can’t wait to see it.

           The disc slot closes. 

           Jena’s mom frets over the two remotes. Confused.

                                 JENA’S MOM (CONT’D)
                        I can never remember which one...

           She presses play. The DVD player makes a noise...

           But nothing happens.

                                 JENA’S MOM (CONT’D)
                        Harry! I can’t make it work!

                                 JENA’S DAD (O.S.)
                        Video 2!!! Jesus Christ!!!

           Jena’s mom smiles to the guests. She’s got it now.

           INT. JENA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - HALLWAY - SAME

           Jena walks down the hall towards the TV room. She’s starting 
           to get suspicious. She walks faster...
           INT. JENA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - TV ROOM - SAME

           Jena’s mom switches remotes. She presses a few buttons and 
           finally something comes on the screen. Everyone sighs with 
           relief.

                                 PETE (V.O.)
                        Aww yeah, dude! Pulverize that 
                        thing!

           Jena’s mom flinches. She doesn’t quite know what to make of 
           that, and then the camera man turns away from Pete and---

                                 JENA’S MOM
                        Oh, Applesauce!

           Jena’s mom fumbles with the remote. The guests stare in shock 
           at the TV. SOUNDS OF SEX fill the house.

                                 ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
                        Watch the road, Pete!

                                 PETE (V.O.)
                        I’d rather watch your veiny dick 
                        destroy that bitch’s asshole!!!

           Aunt Hester gags. 

           From the doorway, Jena stares at the image of her fiance in a 
           porn movie. She can’t even process it. Her dad appears behind 
           her. He squints at the bangbus video and puts on his glasses.

                                 JENA’S DAD
                        Is Pete driving the bangbus? 
                             (catching himself)
                        I mean-- a bus? What is this thing?

           Jena cringes away from her dad as...

                                 PETE (V.O.)
                        “HONK HONK!!!”

           INT. PETE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Poker Night. Texas Hold’em. Pete and four friends sit around 
           the kitchen table, drinking and laughing and smoking cigars.

           The final card drops. Pete and the other guy with cards stare 
           each other down. An enormous pile of chips in the pot.

                                 PETE
                        All in.

           The pile doubles in size. All eyes on the other guy.
                                 FINKLER
                        Gentlemen. This is the hand to end 
                        all hands.

           The apartment door opens. A pissed-off Jena throws her winter 
           coat on the couch and stands behind Pete. He motions for her 
           to be quiet and stay back. Instead, she picks up his cards.

                                 JENA
                        He has pocket kings.

                                 WHEELER
                        I fold.

                                 PETE
                        What the fuck!

           He whirls on her, pissed. She gently squeezes Pete’s nose.

                                 JENA
                             (super-soft)
                        “Honk honk.”

           Pete freezes. The other guys exchange a glance.

                                 FINKLER
                        Dude. I think she knows.

           INT. PETE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           In the kitchen. Poker night’s obviously been cancelled. Pete 
           cleans up the kitchen-- tossing beer cans, wiping the table. 
           Jena follows him everywhere.

                                 PETE
                        They’re a small company and they 
                        needed extra help. 

                                 JENA
                        “Extra Help” usually means overtime 
                        at your computer.

                                 PETE
                        It’s once a month. The rest of the 
                        time I’m doing their web stuff.

                                 JENA
                        Porn web stuff?

                                 PETE
                        99 percent of the web is porn, 
                        Jena!
                                 JENA
                        Not King Shaq. 

                                 PETE
                        It’s part of the job!

                                 JENA
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 PETE
                        Maybe because it’s really 
                        embarrassing?

           Pete stops cleaning and tries to explain it to her. 

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        If I code a baseball stats site, 
                        I’ll play in their fantasy league. 
                        I’m there for them. Just like I’m 
                        there to drive the... bangbus. 

                                 JENA
                        Jesus, Pete!

                                 PETE
                        Well I don’t see how it’s any 
                        different than if I drove a regular 
                        bus.

                                 JENA
                        You spend all that time in Miami 
                        with girls who-- they’re not even 
                        real, they’re dolls, their stomachs 
                        are flatter than mine, their asses 
                        are firmer, and their boobs are 
                        bigger, and--

                                 PETE
                        Everyone has bigger boobs than you.

           She’s stunned for a moment.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        But the point is I love your boobs! 
                        I love your stomach! I love your 
                        ass!

           He tries to hug her.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        I love you, Jena!

           She dodges his arms. He doesn’t get it.
                                 JENA
                        You lied. It’s worse than fucking 
                        some girl on a bus.

                                 PETE
                        How can you say that!

                                 JENA
                        I’d rather you fuck them and tell 
                        me the truth!

                                 PETE
                        Sex is much worse than lying.

                                 JENA
                        Only cause you’re a guy. Watch-- 
                        you like imagining some random 
                        guy’s dick in my mouth?

                                 PETE
                        Honestly, it’s not in my top five 
                        sexual fantasies. 

                                 JENA
                        Oh, you wouldn’t want two dudes 
                        using me as a jungle gym?

                                 PETE
                        Come on.

                                 JENA
                        You wouldn’t like turning my vagina 
                        into a four-man co-op?

           Pete opens and SLAMS a cabinet.

                                 PETE
                        Fine, you know what? I’d love it if 
                        you fucked some dickhead just to 
                        get back at me. It would be a 
                        shining example of your blossoming 
                        maturity. 

           Jena’s had enough, she storms away. Pete follows her, not 
           ready to let it go.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        In fact-- I would pay cold hard 
                        cash to see you fuck some dude! 

                                 JENA
                        Shut up!
                                 PETE
                        I’ve got a great idea! How about I 
                        drive you guys around while you 
                        film it in my BANGBUS?!

           That’s too much for her. She storms out the front door.

                                 JENA
                        Go jerk off to yourself on the 
                        internet.

           INT. JENA’S CAR - LATER

           Jena speeds across the city, weaving through traffic.

           EXT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - NIGHT

           Jena’s car careens into the driveway.

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - NIGHT

           She storms through the empty house, grabbing two beers from 
           the fridge.

                                 JENA
                        Ryan! You and I are getting drunk 
                        right this second.

           But when she opens Ryan’s door, he’s not there. It takes the 
           wind right out of her sails.

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - TV ROOM - LATER

           Jena sits on the couch, alone. Doesn’t quite know what to do 
           with herself. She cracks a beer.

           EXT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - LATER

           Coming towards the house, Erich pulls a wagon filled with 
           found garbage. He’s wearing one of those camping headlamps.

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Erich comes into the TV room to find Jena sprawled on the 
           couch. Her face lights up the way only a drunk person’s can.

                                 JENA
                             (slurring a little)
                        Erich! What are you doing tonight? 
                        Let’s throw meat into the dog park. 
                        Watch the dogs go nuts.

           Erich realizes Jena is surrounded by 6 empty beer cans. 
                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        “Dog Wars!”

           Erich grins.

                                 ERICH
                        I got a lot of catching up to do.

           Erich grabs a full bottle of Jack Daniels from a hiding spot 
           behind the dictionary. He starts chugging. Jena laughs and 
           tosses him a Wii controller. He catches it one-handed, mid-
           chug.

           INT. BETH’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Sunlight pours into Beth’s loft. Ryan and Beth eat breakfast 
           together. Comfortable closeness. They’re both feeling good.

           On the kitchen table, Ryan’s cell phone starts VIBRATING. 
           It’s a text from Jena: “Can we meet?”

           He glances at the door, then Beth. 

                                 BETH
                        Are you kidding me?

           Ryan stands up. Gets his coat.

                                 RYAN
                        It’s my Aunt... Grandma. 

                                 BETH
                        ...I made breakfast.

                                 RYAN
                        Aunt Grandma. It’s a term of 
                        endearment. She needs me to pick 
                        her up at the train station.

           As he leaves, Beth shrugs and takes a bite of his food.

           EXT. COFFEESHOP - DAY

           It’s sleeting outside. Through the front window we see Jena 
           and Ryan sitting close together at a tiny bistro table. 
           Jackets drying on the backs of their chairs.

           INT. COFFEESHOP - SAME

           We stay close on Ryan’s face throughout:

                                 JENA
                        I had sex with Erich last night.
           After a long moment, Ryan finds his words. A tiny voice 
           escapes from his mouth.

                                 RYAN
                        Oh.

                                 JENA
                        I was just so mad about the stupid--

                                 RYAN
                        --Bangbus. The Bangbus.

                                 JENA
                        And you weren’t home and I didn’t 
                        know what to do and I got drunk and 
                        now-- I’m messing everything up. 

           Ryan says nothing.

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        It’s nothing-- I mean, he’s Erich. 
                        It’s kind of weird that it never 
                        happened before, right? It’s never 
                        complicated with him. But I 
                        shouldn’t tell Pete, right? 

           He’s still trying to absorb everything.

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                             (filling the silence)
                        I think we can make it work. It’s 
                        just a job, right? But I shouldn’t 
                        tell him. Do you think I should 
                        tell him?

           Ryan finally finds his voice.

                                 RYAN
                        Would you excuse me for one moment?

           INT. RYAN’S CAR - LATER

           Ryan drives through the snow and sleet. He keeps changing the 
           radio station, punching the buttons harder and harder until 
           he’s literally just pounding on the dashboard and the horn.

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - GARAGE - LATER

           A NUDE EUROPEAN MODEL is posing for Erich. He’s in the middle 
           of constructing her form out of found garbage.

                                 ERICH
                        Arch your back a little bit more? 
                                 RYAN (O.S.)
                        Erich!

           Ryan runs in and stops short. He wasn’t expecting to see a 
           naked woman. He stares at the model.

                                 NUDE MODEL
                             (with accent)
                        He is creeping me out.

                                 ERICH
                        Cover up, Famke.

           Famke wraps up in a towel.

                                 RYAN
                             (to Erich)
                        Come inside for a second?

                                 ERICH
                        What’s up, dude?

                                 RYAN
                        I want to talk to you, dude.

                                 ERICH
                             (duh)
                        I’m in the middle of something.

           Ryan stands there between Erich and the model. Erich holds up 
           two things for Ryan to choose: a rubber band and a small 
           tire.

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        I can’t decide. Which one of these 
                        is a more accurate representation 
                        of the female vagina?

                                 RYAN
                        Fanta’s or Jena’s?

           Erich slowly puts down the junk. 

                                 NUDE MODEL
                        My name is Famke.

           Erich glances at the model for second, then back to Ryan.

                                 ERICH
                             (soft; to Ryan)
                        Jena raped me. I’m the victim. 

                                 RYAN
                        Did you file a police report?
                                 ERICH
                             (shrugs)
                        She was ok. Not great.

           Famke pouts...

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        Not like you, baby.

           She rolls her eyes. 

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        Stop it baby, you know you are.

           He gets a smile out of her. Ryan snaps at her--

                                 RYAN
                        You! Get out of here!

           She waits for Erich’s cue. He nods-- get out. She goes 
           inside. When she’s gone...

                                 ERICH
                        Dude, Jena was Edward Crazyhands. 
                        And her labia? Great ratio of inner 
                        to outer. Tremendous.  

           The specifics hit Ryan like a cinder block to the stomach. 

           Cooper walks in from the house.

                                 COOPER
                        Hey, there’s a naked girl in our 
                        kitchen.

                                 RYAN
                        Not now, Cooper.

                                 COOPER
                             (to Erich)
                        Was she the one in your room last 
                        night? It sounded like you were 
                        strangling a manatee.

                                 RYAN
                        Stop.

                                 COOPER
                        She kept yelling “Pump me! Pump 
                        me!” You were like a gas station 
                        attendant.

                                 ERICH
                        “Fill ‘er up.”
           Their laughter makes Ryan snap.

                                 RYAN
                        He fucked Jena, alright!?

           Cooper can’t process this. He thinks back on the day.

                                 COOPER
                        Impossible. I spoke to her this 
                        afternoon. 

                                 RYAN
                        Oh weird, she didn’t mention it? 
                        Maybe it’s cause she’s too 
                        embarrassed.

           Erich suddenly takes offense.

                                 ERICH
                        It’s embarrassing to fuck me?

                                 COOPER
                        Wait a minute--

                                 RYAN
                        You drove a stake through my heart, 
                        Erich.

                                 COOPER
                        You had sex with Jena?

                                 RYAN
                             (to Erich)
                        You’re the Van Helsing of friends!

                                 COOPER
                             (confused, to Ryan)
                        Wait-- you like her too?

                                 ERICH
                        You think it’s embarrassing to fuck 
                        Erich Grabowski?

                                 RYAN
                             (to Cooper)
                        And you!!! When did you start 
                        liking her!?

                                 COOPER
                        The burden of proof isn’t on me-- 
                        She’s awesome. Who wouldn’t like 
                        her?

           Erich pulls down his pants and underwear.
                                 ERICH
                        Is my cock embarrassing?!

                                 RYAN AND COOPER
                             (averting their eyes)
                        Come on!

           Erich shuffles towards them, his pants still down.

                                 ERICH
                        That’s the problem with you two. We 
                        all like her, but your dicks are 
                        never out. You keep them all folded 
                        up in your little boy underpants. 
                        Air your balls out once in a while. 

                                 COOPER
                        This is unacceptable behavior!

                                 ERICH
                        Yeah-- I fucked her and you know 
                        what?

           He pulls up his pants.

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        Now it’s out of my system. You guys 
                        should do the same thing.

           Cooper looks away.

                                 COOPER
                        I’m moving out.

           Ryan whirls.

                                 RYAN
                        What!?

                                 ERICH
                        Pshh. Whatever, bitch.

                                 COOPER
                        I only stayed friends with you two 
                        because of Jena.

                                 RYAN
                        You’re not moving out!

                                 COOPER
                        So she’s the only one allowed to 
                        break her lease? Because you like 
                        her?
                                 RYAN
                        You guys are killing me.

                                 ERICH
                        It’s a dog eat dog world, buddy.

                                 RYAN
                        That doesn’t mean anything. 

                                 ERICH
                        Well every dog has its day.

                                 COOPER
                        You think I actually like bowling 
                        with you two? It’s utterly 
                        pointless. Every time you knock 
                        them down they just come back up.

           Ryan ignores him-- his beef is with Erich.

                                 RYAN
                        Nothing you say means anything. You 
                        just spit out other people’s ideas.
                             (re: sculptures)
                        Like all this.

                                 ERICH
                        You want to dance, little man?

           Ryan ignores him and gestures to Erich’s work.

                                 RYAN
                        I took a dump this morning and I 
                        realized I made something more 
                        beautiful than anything you’ve ever 
                        done.

                                 ERICH
                        Hit me. I dare you.

           Ryan shakes Erich’s sculpture of the nude model.

                                 RYAN
                        This? It’s... garbage!

           He knocks it over. It breaks into pieces.

           Erich takes a swing. He decks Ryan in the eye. Ryan falls 
           back into a pile of garbage.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, how original!

           Erich stomps away. Ryan gets up, his eye red and squinting. 
                                 COOPER
                        This is all your fault for-- for-- 
                        redirecting her happiness!

           He wipes some blood from his nose, flicks it onto Erich’s 
           “sculpture” and walks out the door.

           EXT. DINER - DAY

           A diner near an I-95 onramp. Through the window we see Ryan 
           sitting at a booth. He looks like shit. The waitress refills 
           his coffee but he doesn’t even look at her.

           Pete enters the diner. Ryan waves him over to the booth. He 
           sits down.

                                 PETE
                        What’s up, dude. I’m glad you 
                        called. It’s great to see you.

                                 RYAN
                        I’m glad you-- your leg looks 
                        better.

                                 PETE
                             (genuine)
                        I really appreciate that.

           Pete notices Ryan’s bruises.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        You alright?

                                 RYAN
                        I’ve been better.

                                 PETE
                        Man, your friends are crazy.

                                 RYAN
                        I know, right?

           Pete drums on the table with his fingers. 

                                 PETE
                        Live and let live.

                                 RYAN
                        Yup.

           Ryan begins to ball up a straw’s wrapper. 

                                 PETE
                        Did you see Family Guy last night?
                                 RYAN
                        Nope.

                                 PETE
                        I don’t normally watch TV.

                                 RYAN
                        We already talked about this.

                                 PETE
                        Oh. 

           Ryan stops fidgeting. He puts both hands on the table and 
           looks Pete in the eye.

                                 RYAN
                        I like you, Pete. Which is why I 
                        feel obligated to tell you 
                        something.

           EXT. DINER - SAME

           We watch the rest of the scene from outside, through the 
           diner’s window. Ryan talks and Pete listens.

           And then Pete gets up and leaves, tears in his eyes. Through 
           the diner window we see Ryan sitting there. Expressionless. 

           INT. DOWNTOWN ARCHITECTURE FIRM - DAY

           Ryan stares out the window. Not focused on anything.

                                 BETH
                        Hey you. I found a singer for my 
                        ironic deathmetal band. His name is 
                        Arturo Satan. He’s fifty and has 
                        like eleven piercings. Pretty 
                        authentic, right? 

           Ryan keeps staring. 

                                 BETH (CONT’D)
                        Um. Want to go do your stupid date 
                        tomorrow? Mini-golfing? Ping-pong. 
                        All those retarded date sports.

                                 RYAN
                        Maybe.

                                 BETH
                        Um... Okay. Dinner on Saturday?

           He hasn’t glanced at her.
                                 BETH (CONT’D)
                        And what about getting into a 
                        choreographed knife fight with a 
                        rival dance crew on Sunday?

                                 RYAN
                             (still not listening)
                        ...Maybe.

           Beth watches him for a moment. She tries to make eye contact 
           with his reflection in the window. He doesn’t even see her.

                                 BETH
                        Cool.

           EXT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - NIGHT

           Ryan drives up. He sees Jena’s car parked on the street. 

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - NIGHT

           Ryan steps lightly through the TV room. 

                                 RYAN
                        Jena?

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Ryan steps into his bedroom. Jena’s in his bed, eyes puffy 
           from crying. There are balled-up used tissues everywhere but 
           the trash. Snot on the sheets.

                                 JENA
                        Pete left. He went down to Miami. 
                        He won’t even talk to me.

           She slides over so he can sit on the bed. He keeps his 
           distance and chooses his words carefully...

                                 RYAN
                        Erich must have told him what 
                        happened.

           Jena nods sadly. Ryan thinks for a second.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        If I were you, I wouldn’t even get 
                        into it with Erich. He’s not worth 
                        it.

                                 JENA
                        I’ll just be secretly furious at 
                        him my entire life. It’s more me. 
           He slowly nods, hiding his expression from her for a beat, 
           processing what he just got away with.

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        No?

                                 RYAN
                        Yeah, best just to move on.

           He finally sits beside her.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Jeners. And I’m sorry I 
                        left you hanging in the coffee 
                        shop.

                                 JENA
                        You could’ve told me in person... 
                        You’re my best friend-- when you 
                        find out my fiancé makes porn, I 
                        want you to be there for me. 
                        Instead I had to sit with a bunch 
                        of old ladies I don’t even know.

                                 RYAN
                        Aunt Hester?

           She wipes snot with her sleeve. Ryan passes her a tissue.

                                 JENA
                        She threw up in our piano.

           She blows her nose. It’s red and puffy. She wipes her eyes.

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        Sexy, right?

           Ryan takes the balled-up tissue and arcs it into the trash. 
           Score. Jena crumples another one and takes a shot--

                                 RYAN
                        At the buzzer!

           The tissue bounces off the rim and lands on the floor. Jena 
           pulls the covers over her head. After a moment, Ryan grabs a 
           flashlight from the bedside table and follows her under the 
           blankets.

           INT. UNDER RYAN’S COVERS - SAME

           Lost in the folds of Ryan’s blankets, Ryan and Jena lie face 
           to face. Lit by the flashlight between them. 

           Ryan gently touches Jena’s left hand...
                                 RYAN
                        No ring?

           Sure enough, her ring finger is bare. She shrugs.

                                 JENA
                        Am I a bad person? 

                                 RYAN
                        Only on opposite day.

                                 JENA
                        I’m sad Pete left, but also half 
                        relieved. 

                                 RYAN
                        Maybe it’s okay to feel that way?

                                 JENA
                        Like we’d be sitting together on a 
                        Sunday morning reading magazines. 
                        And it’s like, “is this it?”

                                 RYAN
                        Isn’t it?

                                 JENA
                        I don’t know. And then I think, “am 
                        I just trying to sabotage something 
                        because I’m scared out of my mind?”

                                 RYAN
                        You didn’t sabotage anything.

           He gently rubs her shoulder.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry I’ve been such a 
                        penisface.

           He gently brushes some hair out of her face. She tests out a 
           smile.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Wouldn’t it be nice if this were 
                        it? Just the two of us under here. 

           She doesn’t react. Ryan decides to push a little more...

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        No one else.

           Jena scooches closer to him.
                                 JENA
                        I want to murder Erich in the face.

           The sting on Ryan’s face only lasts a fraction of a second 
           before he hides it and plays along with her.

                                 RYAN
                        I hope Erich gets tetanus from one 
                        of his sculptures.

                                 JENA
                        I hope he gets rabies and some 
                        little boy has to put him down.

                                 RYAN
                        I want to make Erich a jellyfish 
                        sandwich and when he eats it I’ll 
                        say, “feel that sting? That’s 
                        jellyfish, baby.”

                                 JENA
                        I hope Erich becomes a raging 
                        poopoholic.

                                 RYAN
                        I hope he gets Lupus. 

                                 JENA
                        ...that’s like an alcoholic but 
                        with poop... 

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - SAME

           In the hallway, Cooper moves a box out of his room. He stares 
           into Ryan’s bedroom, at the lump of blankets that is Ryan and 
           Jena. From his point of view, it looks like they’re making 
           out.

           He drops the box-- BANG-- and walks out.

           INT. JENA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - DAY

           Jena’s old high school bedroom. Painted black. It’s covered 
           in stickers and posters of 90s bands. Pavement. Bikini Kill. 
           Superchunk. Hole. Ryan examines a loose photo of Jena during 
           her chubby goth phase. She snatches it away and buries it in 
           a drawer.

           They’re almost finished unpacking. Ryan grabs a stuffed 
           animal from Jena’s bed. Paddington Bear. He makes it dance on 
           the bed.
                                 JENA
                        Watch out. I humped that guy all 
                        through middle school.

           Eek-- Ryan tosses it away. He picks up Teddy Ruxpin, the 
           talking bear. Ryan animates the bear’s mouth with his hand.

                                 RYAN
                             (Teddy-ruxpin voice)
                        Please have sex with me, Jena.

           She rolls her eyes, but can’t help laughing. 

           INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY

           Jena waits by the counter, looking a bit depressed. Her 
           wedding dress is folded over her arm. Ryan gets her attention 
           from across the store.

           INT. BRIDAL SHOP - LATER

           In front of a mirror, Ryan’s wearing a pink tux with a pale-
           blue ruffled shirt. Jena struts in wearing a hideous fuchsia 
           ball gown. 

           Ryan side-steps closer to her. They try to keep straight 
           faces while looking at their ridiculous reflection. 

                                 RYAN
                        If we got married, I bet we’d have 
                        a surprise wedding-- Like tell the 
                        guests it’s a massive pajama party, 
                        then surprise! 

                                 JENA
                        People’d be like “what’s going on, 
                        I came to this party to sleep in my 
                        Go-Bot pajamas.” And then we bust 
                        out the vows.

           Their eyes catch in the mirror. They quickly look away. 

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        Better go presto-chango out of 
                        these things before they make us 
                        buy them.

                                 RYAN
                        Yeah--and, um, then we’d actually 
                        have to get married. 
           EXT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - DAY

           Erich’s car pulls into he driveway. Famke’s with him. Erich 
           stops short when he sees Jena sitting on the front steps. 

                                 ERICH
                             (to Famke)
                        Stay here, baby.

           EXT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           We see it on Jena’s face-- she doesn’t want to deal with him.

                                 JENA
                        I’m just waiting for Ryan.

                                 ERICH
                        Listen, I’m really glad I caught 
                        you. I feel like we haven’t hung 
                        out in a goddamn eternity. 

           She looks around for something to be doing. The porch is 
           empty. She starts pulling a loose thread on her jeans.

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        Pull that enough and the whole 
                        thing’ll unwind until I see you 
                        naked. Again.

           He winks. Jena ignores it. Behind him, Famke rolls down the 
           window. 

                                 FAMKE
                        Get my jacket and let’s go, Baby!

           Erich’s eyes flash over at Famke for a second, And then he’s 
           back on Jena. Jena can only raise an eyebrow in response. 
           Erich actually looks nervous for some reason. He fidgets.

                                 ERICH
                        I’ve been thinking. About us. And 
                        what happened. You know? And... my 
                        feelings. The ones inside of me. 
                        About you. I don’t know. 

           Feelings aren’t his strong suit. Jena glances past him and 
           watches Famke re-apply smokey eye-liner. 

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        It’s like I have a boner... in my 
                        heart?

           He looks like a confused puppy, tender and stupid.
                                 JENA
                        Get over yourself.

           Erich looks stunned, but then he reverts to his old self.

                                 ERICH
                        Whoa. Damn, girl-- you thought I 
                        was serious? Bitches be stupid! Ha! 
                        You are one conceited ho-bag, Jena!

                                 JENA
                        You’ve got bigger balls than I 
                        thought, to say this shit after 
                        what you did.

                                 ERICH
                        What’d I do? ...Other than rock 
                        your world...

           She doesn’t answer. 

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        What’d I do?

           She just stares at him, hating him.

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck did I do?!

           She heads inside. 

           INT. DOWNTOWN LAW FIRM - DAY

           Cooper answers his RINGING office phone. His desk is 
           immaculately clean. Inbox empty, outbox full.

                                 COOPER
                        Cooper Martin.

                                 ERICH (V.O.)
                        Cooper Martin, Esquire? I’ve been 
                        in a work-related accident and want 
                        my settlement now now now!

                                 COOPER
                        That’s not what I practice. I’m 
                        hanging up now.

           INTERCUT with Erich, in the car with Famke.

                                 ERICH
                             (getting serious)
                        Ryan told Jena I told Pete.
           Cooper wrinkles his forehead.

                                 COOPER
                        I can’t quite parse that sentence.

                                 ERICH
                        Jena thinks I told Pete about the 
                        night I romanced her vagina.

                                 COOPER
                        ...did you?

                                 ERICH
                        Fuck no! Ryan’s lying about me just 
                        so he can romance her vagina!

           Cooper loosens his tie.

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        Why should he get her? What makes 
                        him so special?

           In fact, Cooper takes his tie all the way off.

                                 COOPER
                        I think Relationship Fuckers just 
                        got a new client.

           He cracks his neck. He hasn’t been this casually dressed in 
           years.

           EXT. SCHUYLKILL EXPRESSWAY - DAY

           Ryan’s car. He drives Jena away from the city. They listen to 
           music. Ryan keeps glancing over at her, something on his 
           mind. 

                                 JENA
                        What?

           He just smiles. She smiles back and shakes her head. 

           EXT. WOODED PARK - DAY

           Ryan parks at the top of a steep hill. The only car in a snow-
           covered winter wonderland. Ryan drags a simple wooden 
           toboggan out of the trunk.

           EXT. TOP OF THE HILL - LATER

           They push the toboggan to the edge of the steep hill. Ryan 
           passes her a bike helmet. She takes it from him. They 
           exchange a warm smile.
                                 RYAN
                        Safety first.

           They put on the matching helmets. Jena solemnly bangs her 
           helmet against his.

                                 JENA
                        For those who are about to sled, we 
                        salute you.

           Jena sits in the front of the toboggan. Ryan hesitates. How 
           should he sit down? He lowers himself onto the toboggan. Jena 
           reaches behind her and pulls him close. His chest now flat 
           against her back. Crotch to butt.

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        Seatbelt!

           Ryan wraps his arms around her stomach. Holds her tight. Deep 
           breath and--

           EXT. GIANT HILL - MOMENTS LATER

           Ryan and Jena tear down the hill together on the toboggan. 
           Faster and faster until they hit a bump.

           They soar through the air, tilting sideways and then PFOOM-- 
           they eat it. Tumbling down the hill, a cloud of snow and 
           limbs.

           They squirm in the snow. They’re both caked from head to toe. 
           Completely frosted over.

                                 JENA
                        Cold cold cold cold cold...

                                 RYAN
                        The helmet does nothing!

           They roll towards each other.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Keep me warm, big bertha.

                                 JENA
                        I got snow up my shirt.

                                 RYAN
                        I got snow in my pee-hole.

                                 JENA
                        Melt me, big boy.
           He rolls on top of her. They’re laughing. Rosy-cheeked faces 
           inches apart, their smiles fade.

                                 RYAN
                        Hi.

                                 JENA
                        Hi.

           He closes his eyes. She does too. 

                                 RYAN
                        I’m cold.

                                 JENA
                        Me too.

           He leans forward. She does too. Their lips touch.

           They kiss.

           It starts small and turns into a frenzy before she stops. He 
           does too.

                                 RYAN
                        Is this ok?

                                 JENA
                        I don’t know.

                                 RYAN
                        Ok.

                                 JENA
                        Maybe.

                                 RYAN
                        Yeah.

                                 JENA
                        I’ve made a lot of bad decisions 
                        lately.

                                 RYAN
                        Oh.

                                 JENA
                        Not that this is a bad decision. 

                                 RYAN
                        No. No.
                                 JENA
                        But what if it messed up our 
                        friendship?

                                 RYAN
                        It could.

                                 JENA
                        Who would we confide in if we break 
                        each others’ hearts?

           Ryan leans closer, his lips again within inches of hers. 

                                 RYAN
                        I could take it.

           She whispers.

                                 JENA
                        I’d mash your heart up like play-
                        doh and then put it through that 
                        machine that makes it a long hollow 
                        tube.

           Now he whispers in her ear.

                                 RYAN
                        The Fun Factory.

                                 JENA
                        But minus the fun.

           He kisses her again. She lets him do it for a moment.

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        What are we doing?

                                 RYAN
                        Exploring each other? Like Lewis 
                        and Clark. 

                                 JENA
                        I can’t believe you’re making out 
                        with an engaged girl. 

                                 RYAN
                        I think it’s technically adultery.

                                 JENA
                        I can’t believe I’m engaged.

           He sits up. Pulls her up with him. Holds her close. It starts 
           to lightly snow.
                                 RYAN
                        Listen. I want to tell you 
                        something kind of embarrassing. 
                        Actually, saying it is kind of the 
                        most embarrassing thing ever?

                                 JENA
                        Hit me.

                                 RYAN
                        Okay. Here goes...

           SHUSHHHHHHHHH!!! A blue plastic sled comes to a stop next to 
           them. It’s Cooper and Erich. They grin like super-villains. 

                                 COOPER
                             (innocent)
                        Oh, you’re sledding here too? 

                                 ERICH
                             (like a maniac)
                        Hope we’re not interrupting.  

           Ryan can’t take this right now. He throws a snowball at them. 
           Erich catches it and dramatically crumples it to the ground. 

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        “Who you gonna call?”

           Ryan shakes his head-- please no...

                                 COOPER
                        Jena, would you like to know some 
                        fascinating news?

                                 RYAN
                        Don’t--

                                 COOPER
                        Ryan’s the one who told Pete. About 
                        Erich. To make him leave. Because 
                        he wants you all to himself.

           Jena scooches away from Ryan.

                                 JENA
                        You told Pete?

                                 RYAN
                             (quietly)
                        Yeah but I have good news too.

                                 JENA
                        No, no, no-- what?
                                 RYAN
                        There’s good news too!

                                 JENA
                        You told Pete!

                                 COOPER
                        Not very neighborly of you, Ryan.

                                 RYAN
                        You don’t understand.

           Jena turns on all three of them.

                                 JENA
                        All of you! You guys made me hate 
                        Pete! All three of you are 
                        sociopaths!

           Cooper and Erich don’t say anything in defense.

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                             (to Erich)
                        Give me your keys.

           Erich shakes his head.

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        I’m not riding back with any of 
                        you.

           She reaches for his pocket. He smacks her hand.

                                 ERICH
                        Eat snow, ho.

           She DECKS him in the face crazy hard. Caught by surprise, he 
           falls. She snatches his car keys from his pocket.

                                 RYAN
                        Jena, wait!

           He trudges up the hill after her, but he keeps falling. 

           EXT. TOP OF THE HILL - MOMENTS LATER

           Jena climbs into Erich’s car. She starts the engine but 
           waits, breathing heavily. The “door ajar” chime BINGS at her.

           She makes up her mind. Just as she’s about to slam the door, 
           Ryan grabs it. She snaps at him.
                                 JENA
                        Suck it, Harper. This whole time-- 
                        you’ve been trying to do me since 
                        you met me. 

                                 RYAN
                        Give me one chance to explain and 
                        then you can never talk to me 
                        again. Please?

                                 JENA
                        You probably don’t even like 
                        Library Safari!

           She drives away, jerking the door from Ryan’s hand. Kicking 
           up a ton of snow that cakes Ryan head to toe.

           INT. CITY BUS - NIGHT

           Ryan rides the bus alone. Head against the window.

           EXT. BETH’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Cold and alone, Ryan waits on Beth’s front steps. He blows 
           into his hands to keep warm.

           An OLD LADY gets out of a taxi, punches in the building code, 
           and goes inside. As the door closes, Ryan discreetly props it 
           open with his foot.

           INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Ryan rings Beth’s doorbell. Eventually he hears steps from 
           within. The door opens a crack. Beth squints in the light.

                                 RYAN
                        I’m sorry I’ve been a bastard. I 
                        just want to sleep, and maybe do 
                        some crying.

                                 BETH
                        Go home, Ryan.

                                 RYAN
                        Maybe I could just come in and you 
                        could hold me? That would be nice.

                                 BETH
                        No. 

           Notopolos appears behind Beth. 
                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        Oh, hey Ryan. We havin’ a fuck 
                        party?

           Wearing a fuzzy robe, he opens the door all the way. Beth 
           shrinks, embarrassed to be caught with him.

                                 NOTOPOLOS (CONT’D)
                        Check it out--

           He pads back into the apartment where there’s now a stripper 
           pole.

                                 NOTOPOLOS (CONT’D)
                        Portable! Bought it on the 
                        internet!

           He does a twirl move. Ryan searches Beth’s face. 

                                 BETH
                             (weak smile)
                        Hey, you only live once, right?

           He isn’t in the mood to joke with her.

                                 RYAN
                        What about me?

                                 BETH
                        This has nothing to do with you.

           Notopolos throws his leg around the pole.

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        Recognize this move, Ry-guy?

           Ryan ignores him.

                                 RYAN
                        I can’t believe in the damaged 
                        state I’m in, between my psycho 
                        roommates and what’s happened with 
                        Jena, that I come over here for a 
                        little sympathy, and you’re... pole 
                        dancing with Mr. Indoor Gazebo?!

           Notopolos polishes the pole with his buttcheeks.

                                 BETH
                        You know what, Ryan? It’s not 
                        always about you.

           She closes the door.
           Wii Rock Band Music Cue: Ryan sings The Pixies’s Wave of 
           Mutilation.

           INT. TAXI - NIGHT

           Ryan sits alone in the back of a cab. Watching the city 
           lights go by. Up front, the cabbie speaks Farsi into his 
           bluetooth headset.

                                 CABBIE
                        Farsi-Farsi-Farsi-Farsi crying in 
                        my back seat Farsi-Farsi. 

                                 RYAN
                        I’m not crying.

                                 CABBIE
                             (laughing)
                        Farsi-Farsi-Farsi-Farsi.

           Ryan rolls down the window and sticks his head out.

           INT. 3625 SPRUCE STREET - NIGHT

           Ryan trudges through the empty house. The living room is a 
           mess. He methodically cleans up beer bottles, take-out 
           containers, and video game paraphernalia.

           INT. NEW APARTMENT - DAY

           Empty. One bedroom. Remodeled kitchen. Ryan signs a lease. 

           INT. MONTY’S MAGIC SHOP - DAY

           Monty finishes his stage act to a spatter of applause. He 
           walks up to Jena. 

                                 MONTY
                        My vacation’s next week. I need you 
                        up there.

           Jena looks at the stage. At the kids milling about. 

                                 JENA
                        Actually, my mom is really sick and 
                        I need to take care of her. I’m a 
                        loving daughter. So I guess this is 
                        my two week notice?

           INT. RYAN’S NEW APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Ryan hasn’t unpacked yet. He sits on a box and eats Chinese 
           takeout by himself. 
           EXT. DOG PARK - DAY

           Jena walks by herself with a bag of raw meat. She throws a 
           hunk of ground beef at a group of dogs. They fight over it. 
           She sighs. It wasn’t as much fun as she hoped.  

           INT. DOWNTOWN ARCHITECTURE FIRM - DAY

           Ryan walks up to Amed’s cubicle. Before he can speak--

                                 AMED
                        No way, dude. No way. I am not 
                        drafting any more shit for you. 
                        I’ve got plans.

                                 RYAN
                        Oh. I was just seeing if you wanted 
                        to hang out.

           INT. RYAN’S NEW APARTMENT - DAY

           Amed is helping Ryan unpack. He jabbers on about fantasy 
           basketball. Ryan sorts through boxes filled with Library 
           Safari photos, brochures, and ticket stubs. Memorabilia of 
           the guys and Jena. Amed grabs a photo of Jena.

                                 AMED
                        Yo, that’s the kind of ass I’m 
                        talkin’ about. That girl is fly. 
                        Did you ever tap that? A little 
                        tippy tappy? Come on, dogg... 

           Ryan tunes him out. He finds a shoebox labelled FLORIDA. It’s 
           filled with pictures of the three guys with Jena on vacation. 
           They’re all so happy. There’s even a dumb picture of Jena and 
           Ryan pretending to get eaten by the Jaws statue at Universal 
           Studios. 

           The nostalgia seems to eat at Ryan.

                                 AMED (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe we never hung out 
                        before. We are now straight-up 
                        bros. I’m serious, brometheus. 
                        Bromide. You give me a bro-ner. 

           Ryan stares at the shoebox lid for a long time. FLORIDA.

           EXT. MIAMI - DAY

           No snow here. Warm sun and palm trees. Ryan steps out of the 
           airport, wearing his puffy winter jacket and long pants.
           EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

           The Don’t Walk sign blinks on. After a moment, Ryan steps 
           into traffic and holds up his hand. A short bus screeches to 
           a halt inches from his hand. Through the windshield we see 
           Pete in the driver’s seat. 

           It’s the Bangbus. Eventually Pete pulls the lever and the bus 
           door opens.

           INT. BANGBUS - DAY

           Pete drives around the city. Ryan sits shotgun.

                                 PETE
                        What do you want? Did another one 
                        of your roommates have sex with my 
                        fiancée?

                                 RYAN
                        No.

                                 PETE
                        ...did you?

           We hear moaning from behind them. Ryan glances back.

                                 RYAN
                        Can you guys cool it for a sec?

           In the back, a CAMERAMAN shoots the tattooed ALEJANDRO having 
           sex with a BANGBUS GIRL. They’re in some exotic sex position, 
           glaring at Ryan, annoyed.

                                 ALEJANDRO
                        Who the fuck is this guy, Pete?

                                 PETE
                             (looking back)
                        Just keep, um, pounding that pussy!

           Ryan and Pete face forward again.

                                 RYAN
                        What I came down here to tell you 
                        is--

                                 BANGBUS GIRL (O.S.)
                        Fuck me, fuck me!

                                 RYAN
                             (concentrating)
                        --is that she still loves you. Jena 
                        loves you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RYAN (CONT'D)
                        And I’m sorry for meddling. It was 
                        a shitty thing to do and I’m a 
                        shitbird for doing it.

           Pete keeps his eyes on the road, considering this.

                                 ALEJANDRO (O.S.)
                        That’s right, squeeze my balls with 
                        your tight asscheeks.

                                 PETE
                        So where does that leave you?

                                 RYAN
                        I’m happy if she’s happy.

                                 PETE
                        Are you just saying that?

                                 RYAN
                        I came all the way down here to 
                        tell you this. She needs you. She 
                        made a huge mistake and she knows 
                        it.

                                 ALEJANDRO
                        Pete, check it out!

                                 PETE
                             (without looking back)
                        Work it, stud.

                                 RYAN
                        When I see her with you, she’s 
                        happy-- the kind of happiness my 
                        friends and I can’t give her. I 
                        don’t mean sexually. Although I’m 
                        sure that department is great.

                                 ALEJANDRO (O.S.)
                        I’M GONNA CREEEEAAAMMMMM!

                                 RYAN
                        You’re meant for each other. 

           Pete smiles. Alejandro taps Ryan on the shoulder.

                                 ALEJANDRO (O.S.)
                        Yo, stowaway-- you want some of 
                        this?

           Ryan glances back and considers the hedonism before him.
                                 RYAN
                        Nahhh.

                                 ALEJANDRO
                        Suit yourself.

                                 BANGBUS GIRL
                        ...Fag.

           INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

           Cinnabon, Sbarro’s, Aunt Annie’s Pretzels. 

           INT. BROOKSTONE - DAY

           Wearing a Brookstone company polo shirt, Jena helps a uni-
           browed PICKY CUSTOMER decide between two robotic cat food 
           dispensers.

                                 JENA
                        The Pet Oasis is our best-selling 
                        water dispenser. Your cat will love 
                        it. I think that’s even on the...

           She finds the slogan on the box: “Your cat will love it!”

                                 PICKY CUSTOMER
                        Will the water taste fresh?

           Jena takes his shoulders like a doctor delivering bad news.

                                 JENA
                        I’m sorry, but your cat lacks the 
                        cognitive ability to distinguish 
                        stale water from fresh water.

           Over the picky customer’s shoulder, she spots Pete. He’s 
           wandered into the store. He spots her. She’s frozen in place. 

           He comes toward her and she snaps out of it.

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me for a moment?
                             (then, to Pete)
                        Anything I can help you with?

           They stand there, a few feet apart. Careful not to get too 
           close. But not too far, either.

                                 PETE
                        I’m interested in, um, a massage 
                        chair?
           INT. BROOKSTONE - LATER

           Pete and Jena sit side-by-side in matching high-tech massage 
           chairs. They nervously toy with the controls, adjusting the 
           vibration settings throughout the conversation.

                                 PETE
                        Giving up the magic dream?

                                 JENA
                        Gotta pay the bills.

                                 PETE
                        I never got to see you do a trick.

                                 JENA
                             (not a chance)
                        ...maybe someday.

                                 PETE
                        How’ve you been?

                                 JENA
                        Really good actually.

           Not what Pete wanted to hear. She realizes and...

                                 JENA (CONT’D)
                        What about you? Are you... back?

           Pete’s chair starts vibrating on high.

                                 PETE
                             (vibrating)
                        Jena. I came by to apologize. About 
                        Miami, and not telling you about 
                        the bus, but mostly-- I shouldn’t 
                        have disappeared on you like that. 
                        It-- I made a huge mistake.

                                 JENA
                             (vibrating like crazy)
                        No you didn’t. I was a bitch.

                                 PETE
                             (vibrating)
                        I quit the bangbus. I thought maybe 
                        we could... do you want to get a 
                        Cinna-bon or something?

           She glances out into the mall. Fresh Cinnabons look good. She 
           offers a shy smile and nods. Pete’s happy. They enjoy their 
           massages.
           INT. JENA’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - LATER

           Jena’s mom makes pasta sauce. Jena dips her finger in the 
           bowl and tastes it. She thinks for a moment, but then asks:

                                 JENA
                        Mom? Why’d you marry Dad?

                                 JENA’S MOM
                        I don’t know. I just did.

           Jena waits for more but that’s it.

                                 JENA
                        Good mother-daughter talk. I guess 
                        it’s back to the Cosby show for 
                        life advice.

           She heads out of the kitchen.

                                 JENA’S MOM
                             (a mom-like Cosby 
                              impression)
                        “Wait just a minute, Rudy.”

           Laughing, Jena comes back.

                                 JENA
                        Whoa-- where’d you pull that from?

                                 JENA’S MOM
                        I was just like you. The wild 
                        child. But your father tamed me. 

                                 JENA
                        Gross.

                                 JENA’S MOM
                        It wasn’t like a big thunderclap 
                        and angels singing. Baby ducks and 
                        hearts. None of that stuff. But 
                        something was different with him. 
                             (then)
                        I see it in the way you look at 
                        Pete.

                                 JENA
                        Yeah...

                                 JENA’S MOM
                        Pete is “the one,” right?

                                 JENA
                        ...Yeah.
           Jena’s mom picks up on the hesitation. She softens.

                                 JENA’S MOM
                        So he’s your one-percent man?

                                 JENA
                        Is that a accountant thing? What is 
                        that?

                                 JENA’S MOM
                        Most people are almost perfect for 
                        anyone. There’s probably only a one 
                        percent difference between your 
                        father and all the guys I didn’t 
                        marry. But it’s that one percent 
                        that makes our love real.

                                 JENA
                        You guys fight every second of 
                        every day. 

                                 JENA’S MOM
                        I don’t know. It’s... how we 
                        communicate. Nobody fights like 
                        your father. It’s how I knew he was 
                        my one percent man.

           Jena considers this. Her mom smiles.

                                 JENA’S MOM (CONT’D)
                             (Cosby voice)
                        “Want some Jell-o Pudding for 
                        dessert?”

           Jena offers a placating nod and wanders out of the kitchen.

           INT. PETE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Pete and Jena watch football. Eventually--

                                 PETE
                        We should go to an Eagles game 
                        sometime.

                                 JENA
                        Definitely.

           Jena changes the channel. 

           EXT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

           A rundown street. We focus on the only well-lit building.  
           INT. ART OPENING - NIGHT

           A few middle-aged art collectors mill about, ignoring Erich’s 
           impressive garbage sculptures. It’s mostly hipsters. Ryan 
           checks out a sculpture of a naked woman. Erich’s model, 
           Famke, puts her hand on his shoulder.

                                 FAMKE
                        It looks like me, no? 

           Ryan pushes his fist through the tire at the sculpture’s 
           crotch.

                                 RYAN
                        It’s surprisingly realistic.

                                 FAMKE
                        I am so proud!

           Ryan spots Erich over by the bar, looking nervous and 
           somewhat depressed.

           INT. ART OPENING - MOMENTS LATER

           Ryan cautiously approaches Erich.

                                 ERICH
                        Nobody’s buying my shit.

                                 RYAN
                        I told you it sucked.

                                 ERICH
                             (with a smile)
                        Fuck you.

                                 RYAN
                        Blow me.

           Erich cocks an eyebrow.

                                 ERICH
                        Didn’t think you’d show.

                                 RYAN
                        Hey, there’s someone I want you to 
                        meet. He’s rich and has bad taste.

           Ryan steers Erich straight up to a man who turns around as 
           they approach. It’s Notopolos with Beth on his arm.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Phil Notopolos, this is Erich 
                        Grabowski, the artist.
           Ryan takes Beth aside. 

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Are you guys for real?

                                 BETH
                             (shrugs)
                        He’s got a hot tub in his kitchen. 

                                 RYAN
                             (re: Beth and Notopolos)
                        I give this three months.

                                 BETH
                        Ha. Two at most. 

           Meanwhile, Erich and Notopolos have really hit it off. 
           Notopolos takes him by the shoulders, man to man. 

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        You sculpt pussies. I like that.

           INT. ART OPENING - LATER

           Erich and Ryan getting wine at the open bar.

                                 RYAN
                        How’re the new roommates?

                                 ERICH
                        Good. Actually... Retarded. Two 
                        Canadian twin brothers and a grad 
                        student who likes Weird Al. I might 
                        kill myself.

           There’s a sudden commotion at the door. Ryan and Erich turn 
           to see--

           SHAQUILLE O’NEAL coming into the gallery.

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit. The Big Aristotle. 

           Cooper comes in right behind him. He spots Erich and Ryan, 
           then whispers something to Shaq.

           Ryan and Erich take a step back as Shaq approaches them. Shaq 
           stops right in front of them. He squats down to their level.

                                 SHAQ
                        Yo. Cooper says he’s sorry.

                                 RYAN
                        Shaquille O’Neal?
                                 SHAQ
                        Cooper made a wish, and that wish 
                        was for you to accept his apology. 
                        And as the new voice of King Shaq, 
                        I’m here to grant that wish.

           INT. ART OPENING - LATER

           Erich pours three glasses of wine. Cooper, Erich, and Ryan 
           stand by the bar.

                                 COOPER
                        Yeah. For the first time in my 
                        life, I didn’t back down. So when 
                        his lawyers showed him the site, he 
                        flipped out. Loved it. Now he does 
                        the voice.

           Across the room, Shaq towers over everyone at the gallery. 
           Erich takes a deep breath, savoring the moment.

                                 ERICH
                        It’s good to see you homos.

           Cooper smiles tentatively. Erich gets between them and hugs 
           each of their shoulders.

                                 ERICH (CONT’D)
                        We’re all victims of life, bros. 
                             (a very deep realization)
                        You know that expression, “bros 
                        before hos?” It’s bullshit.

                                 RYAN
                        “Hos before bros?”

           They’re still testing each other out, getting comfortable.

                                 ERICH
                        You know. I just need a taste of 
                        everything.

                                 COOPER
                        Forget her.

           Ryan puts on his best smile.

                                 RYAN
                        Seriously. I had no idea. I wasted 
                        so much time with that girl. She 
                        was like this black hole in my 
                        life. Sucking up all my time for 
                        nothing. For real... But now? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RYAN (CONT'D)
                        I’ve never been happier. I’m even 
                        doing all my work.

           He takes a sip of wine. There’s a pause while the guys decide 
           if he’s serious. Eventually Erich holds up his glass.

                                 ERICH
                        To the three dumbest motherfuckers 
                        in the world.

           Not the best speech, but Ryan goes with it. They cheers. A 
           passing BRUNETTE smiles at Cooper. Ryan and Erich are 
           shocked: Cooper smiles back.

                                 COOPER
                        Hi, I’m Cooper.

           She smiles and introduces herself. Shaq gives a thumbs up.

           INT. ART OPENING - LATER

           The opening is winding down. Cooper talks to his new lady-
           friend. Erich and Famke make out next to her sculpture. Amed 
           talks to Shaq.

                                 AMED
                        Yo, dogg. I drafted you in a middle 
                        round, but you’re killing me. 

           Shaq shrugs. He’s literally two feet taller than Amed. Amed 
           points up at him, furious.

                                 AMED (CONT’D)
                        Listen bro, I don’t like losing in 
                        Fantasy Basketball.

                                 SHAQ
                        My free throw percentage isn’t a 
                        secret. 

           Apart from all this, Ryan sits alone on a bench.

           And then Jena walks in. She wears her magician’s costume from 
           the beginning-- hat, cloak, and wand hanging from a belt.

           Ryan sees her, and for a moment he can’t hide how happy he is 
           to see her. But he quickly regains composure and looks away. 
           Then Pete comes in behind her.

           On seeing Pete, Ryan tries to look engrossed in his phone.

           Jena and Pete begin to walk around the gallery. Ryan gets up 
           and keeps pace with them. He’s always on the exact opposite 
           side of the gallery. 
           He watches Jena hug Erich. Even Pete’s shaking hands. Famke 
           gives kisses all around. 

                                 ERICH
                        Thanks for hooking this show up, 
                        hoss.

                                 PETE
                        Don’t mention it.

                                 ERICH
                        “Honk Honk,” right, motherfucker?

                                 PETE
                             (shaking fist, joking)
                        “Why I oughta!”

           Jena’s not really paying attention. She’s looking for Ryan. 
           She sees him, head down in his iPhone. She quickly looks 
           away. 

           Ryan senses something and looks up-- but Jena’s not looking. 
           Instead... Pete’s coming over. Ryan takes a step back, but--
           Pete hugs him. Holds it for a while. 

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                             (whispers)
                        You’ve made me the happiest man in 
                        the world. I owe you everything.

                                 RYAN
                        ...best of luck.

           Ryan looks over at Jena. They make eye contact.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Listen Pete, I’ve got to go. 

                                 PETE
                        Stay!

                                 RYAN
                        I can’t.

           Pete clasps Ryan’s hands.

                                 PETE
                        I love you, man.

           EXT. ART OPENING - MOMENTS LATER

           Ryan hurries outside like he’s running from the cops. He 
           presses his back against a wall and hides there.
           The city lights look beautiful in the distance. He takes a 
           deep breath. Hey, it could be worse. He starts walking.

           INT. ART OPENING - SAME

           Pete comes back to Jena. 

                                 PETE
                        Love that guy. He better still be 
                        your bridesmaid.

           She’s on edge, uncomfortable, but confused.

                                 JENA
                        Why would I do that?

                                 PETE
                        I mean the guy came all the way 
                        down to Florida just to talk to me. 
                        He convinced me to come back. Give 
                        it another shot.

           The wheels are turning in her head-- Ryan went to Florida?-- 
           but, she keeps a mask of calm.

                                 JENA
                        You didn’t come back on your own?

                                 PETE
                             (shrugs)
                        I’m here, aren’t I?

           She can barely get the words out. Like the rug’s been pulled 
           out from under her.

                                 JENA
                        Ryan told you to come back for me?

                                 PETE
                        He’s so awesome.

           Jena doesn’t move a muscle.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        I was so wrong about that guy. You 
                        pick good friends.

           Jena bites her lip.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, isn’t this art cool? 

           She’s paralyzed. Pete stands between her and the door.
                                 JENA
                        Yeah.

                                 PETE
                        Art is fucking awesome. 

           Erich and Cooper have been watching this whole exchange. They 
           look at each other.

                                 ERICH
                        One last Relationship Fuck?

                                 COOPER
                        For old times’ sake?

           They bump fists.

                                 ERICH
                        Pete, let’s get drunk!

           Erich escorts him towards the bar and gives Jena a pointed 
           look over his shoulder. Cooper taps her on the arm.

                                 COOPER
                        Hey idiot.

           Jena doesn’t look at him.

                                 COOPER (CONT’D)
                        Go. Find. Ryan.

           Erich and Pete disappear into a crowd. Jena has a clear path 
           to the door.

           She snaps into action. An entire bicycle is part of one of 
           Erich’s sculptures. She climbs across a velvet rope and rips 
           down the bike. She throws her leg over the seat and rides out 
           the door. Everyone stares at the broken sculpture. 

                                 NOTOPOLOS
                        I have to own this!

           In the crowd, Pete hears Notopolos.

                                 PETE
                        Erich! Making money! This is truly 
                        a great day.

           Pete and Erich cheers.

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA STREETS - SAME

           Jena peddles as hard as she can. Looking for Ryan. Her long 
           magician’s cloak flapping behind her.
           EXT. PHILADELPHIA STREETS - LATER

           She rides past the park. No sign of him.

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA STREETS - LATER

           She peddles slower now. Losing hope. But then, in the 
           distance, she spots the massive Public Library.

           Ryan sits on the steps. She stops in front of him, suddenly 
           realizing she has no idea what to say.

                                 RYAN
                        Cool outfit. Does it still smell 
                        like urine?

                                 JENA
                        Why’d you go get Pete?

           He glances at her left hand, at her ENGAGEMENT RING. It’s 
           back. He looks up at her, his face steeled. 

                                 RYAN
                        I didn’t do it for you.

           Jena idly and self-consciously fiddles with the ring.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        I screwed a nice guy over and I 
                        wanted to make things right.

           Jena shakes her head no.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        He’s great.

                                 JENA
                        That’s it? That’s why?

                                 RYAN
                        Yup.

                                 JENA
                        What was the good news, that night 
                        we went sledding?

                                 RYAN
                        It was dumb.

                                 JENA
                        I don’t care-- what was it?

                                 RYAN
                        I don’t remember.
                                 JENA
                        What was it!

                                 RYAN
                        Who cares! Pete’s back! You’re 
                        getting married! Mazel tov!

           She searches his eyes for the truth. He doesn’t back down. 
           Feeling like an asshole, Jena’s breath comes faster and 
           faster until suddenly she’s peddling away as fast as she can.

           Ryan watches her go. He could definitely catch her if he ran 
           right now... but... She’s gone...

           EXT. GRAND STREET - NIGHT

           Jena pumps the peddles as fast as she can. She sails over the 
           smooth street, trying to outride anything and everything. 
           Suddenly she starts wobbling. She looks down at the wheel-- 
           she has a moment to register what’s happening and then--

           --The front wheel separates from the bike. BAM! She hits the 
           cement hard. The bike skids down on top of her. 

           EXT. GRAND STREET - SAME

           Jena rolls over to the sidewalk and sits up. Her knee is 
           scraped and her hands have bits of gravel embedded in them. 
           She’s about to lose it-- could this night get any worse?

           She takes her cellphone out of her purse. It’s smashed.

                                 JENA
                        Fuckballs.

                                 RYAN
                        Ouch.

           She looks up. She can’t hide the hope in her eyes.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about the bike. I forgot I 
                        sort of loosened the wheels on 
                        Erich’s bike after you guys-- you 
                        know...

           He makes a sex motion with his fingers.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        For revenge.

           He sits down next to Jena. 
           She starts to softly cry. Ryan scooches towards her. She 
           wipes her face with a handkerchief but it’s not enough. She 
           pulls on the handkerchief and more appears from within her 
           sleeve. She keeps pulling until a good three feet of rainbow 
           handkerchief has blossomed out of nowhere.

                                 JENA
                             (teary-eyed)
                        Tada.

           She wipes her face with the magic handkerchief. 

                                 RYAN
                        Was that a trick? For me? Did you 
                        just do a trick for me?

           Jena shrugs. 

                                 JENA
                        I decided to give magic another go. 
                        It makes me happy.

           Ryan takes her hand and gently starts removing the embedded 
           pebbles. She watches him do it.

           He takes the last pebble out of her palm. She opens and 
           closes her hand. It feels better.

                                 RYAN
                        My question for you is this...

           He starts removing gravel from her knee-- reaching across her 
           body to do it. She sits perfectly still, watching him.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Do you think a buffalo could beat a 
                        gorilla in a fight?

           A soft smile from Jena.

                                 JENA
                        Definitely not.

                                 RYAN
                        You’re crazy. A buffalo has so much 
                        mass, it would crush the gorilla 
                        with a single charge.

                                 JENA
                        Gorillas have quick lateral 
                        movement. It would snap that 
                        fella’s leg right off.

           He tenderly wipes the dirt and grime from her knee.
                                 RYAN
                        We’re talking about the American 
                        Bison, right? It has deadly horns.

                                 JENA
                        Gorillas have thumbs.

           Without missing a beat:

                                 RYAN
                        I can’t be your best friend 
                        anymore. 

                                 JENA
                        I know.

           They sit on the curb in silence for a moment.

           For the first time in the film Jena looks nervous. She looks 
           down at the tiny pile of gravel Ryan removed from her hand 
           and knee.

           Their breathing is audible, heavy. Ryan touches her cheek. He 
           can only whisper.

                                 RYAN
                        Bananapants.

           Jena whispers back.

                                 JENA
                        ...What?

                                 RYAN
                        I bananapants you. Remember?

                                 JENA
                        ...remember what?

                                 RYAN
                        Are you really going to make me say 
                        it?

                                 JENA
                             (smirking)
                        Say what?

           Jena grins. Ryan wraps his arms around her and they kiss.  

           CUT TO BLACK.
