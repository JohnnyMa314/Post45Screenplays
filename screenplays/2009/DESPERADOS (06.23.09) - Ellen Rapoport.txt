           INT. HORSE STABLES - DAY

           WORKERS groom a STUNNING FEMALE HORSE, brushing her coat, 
           untangling her mane, tying a pink ribbon through her tail.  
           In nearby stalls, TWENTY OTHER MARES get spruced up.

                                 WESLEY (V.O.)
                        So I spent the day watching footage 
                        of racehorse breeding for this case 
                        I’m working on.

           HANDLERS lead a BLACK STALLION past the stalls.  He sniffs at 
           the mares, nonchalant, indifferent.  He reaches our mare and 
           stops.  Her PROUD OWNER shows her off.   

                                 WESLEY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s a painstaking process, rife 
                        with female competition, fickle 
                        behavior, unsatisfying sex...

           HANDLERS hold our mare down.  The stallion fucks her with his 
           ENORMOUS HORSE PENIS.  He finishes and is led off, trotting 
           happily.  Our mare stares after him, shame in her eyes.

                                 WESLEY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...and heartbreak.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           WESLEY ROBBINS, 30s, watches horse-fucking on a TV with her 
           CO-WORKERS.  Guys snicker at the size of the horse’s penis.  
           Girls look away, grossed-out.  Wesley’s mesmerized, pensive.  

                                 WESLEY (V.O.)
                        You know what I realized?  Add an 
                        excruciating dinner at a mid-priced 
                        Italian restaurant, subtract thirty 
                        inches and that’s my love life.

           EXT. WESLEY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Wesley changes outfits, catching a glimpse of the apartment 
           across from her. A BEAUTIFUL COUPLE spoons in their underwear 
           on the sofa, watching American Idol.  She sighs, jealous.

                                 WESLEY (V.O.)
                        Let me quantify.  Ten years, four 
                        hundred eighty seven blind dates, 
                        three rejections from eHarmony...

           INT. WESLEY’S CAR - DAY

           Bumper-to-bumper traffic.  Wesley flips through an LA 
           magazine, to an article with a picture of a HANDSOME GUY.  
           The article’s title: “The Myth of the Perfect Man.”  She 
           closes the magazine, annoyed.   

                                 WESLEY (V.O.)
                        Seven guys married to the next 
                        person they dated right after me, 
                        one and a half chlamydia scares...

           INT. UCLA, ROYCE HALL - DAY

           Wesley speeds by COUPLES IN THE THROES OF YOUNG LOVE.  

                                 WESLEY (V.O.)
                        And two exes who cared so little 
                        about our break-up that they named 
                        a pet Wesley, which is my name, but 
                        apparently works really well for a 
                        Golden Retriever.  Or a ferret.

           INT. OUTSIDE AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Wesley finds a sign reads “WOMEN IN LAW PANEL DISCUSSION.”  
           On the list, her name, WESLEY ROBBINS, CLASS OF ‘00.  

                                 WESLEY (V.O.)
                        You know those people who say you 
                        should treat dating like a second 
                        job?  I’d like to stab their eyes 
                        out with a three-foot horse cock.  
                        One eye at a time.  

           INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Wesley speaks to FIFTY LAW STUDENTS.

                                 WESLEY (V.O.)
                        I’m too old for this!  If I stumble 
                        across some amazing guy who wants 
                        to get married tomorrow, fine.  But 
                        I’m making zero effort.  Oh, you 
                        don’t believe me?  I have, in my 
                        possession, the phone number of a 
                        single, handsome, rich pediatrician 
                        who saved Knox Leon Jolie-Pitt from 
                        vaccine-resistant Rubella, and I’m 
                        not using it.  That... is done. 

           REVERSE ANGLE ON THE LAW STUDENTS

           They stare at her blankly.  She snaps out of her daze.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, what was the question again?
           INT. WESLEY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Wesley collapses on the sofa.  Turns on the TV.  Flips past A 
           CUTE OLD COUPLE on the news and a movie about KITTENS IN 
           LOVE.  Settles on an EXTREME MAKEOVER/SWAN type reality show.  

           ON TV: the UGLIEST WOMAN ALIVE speaks to camera.  

                                 UGLIEST WOMAN ALIVE (ON TV)
                        I have a turkey neck and crosseyes.  
                        My breasts reach my bellybutton.  
                        The first time I let a man see me 
                        naked, he winced, as if he’d just 
                        seen a rabbit squashed by a bus.

           Wesley checks out her own breasts.  Not bad.  She suddenly 
           feels a little better about herself.  

           ON TV:  AN AVERAGE-LOOKING MAN speaks to camera.

                                 AVERAGE LOOKING MAN
                        I think Lynne is beautiful the way 
                        she is, but I want her to be happy.

           TEXT ON TV identifies him as:  BO, LYNNE’S HUSBAND.  

                                 WESLEY
                        You have a husband?  What the fuck?

           Wesley throws her remote on the coffee table, knocking the LA 
           magazine on the floor.  It opens to the Perfect Man article.

           She stabs Perfect Man’s eyes out with a pen, then rifles 
           through her bag for a Post-it with a PHONE NUMBER ON IT.  

           She grabs her phone and DIALS.  A MALE VOICE answers.

                                 WESLEY (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Hi, Huck?  This is Wesley Robbins. 

                                 HUCK (OVER PHONE)
                        Who?

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh, she didn’t tell you about me?  
                        Amy?  Amy Miller?  She gave me your 
                        number about a month ago? 

                                 HUCK 
                        She must have forgotten to mention 
                        it.  But go ahead, shoot.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Shoot? 
                                 HUCK
                        Yeah, what can I do for you? 

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh... um... nothing.  I think Amy 
                        wanted to... I think she thought we 
                        would like each other or something.  
                        This is stupid.  Never mind.

                                 HUCK
                        No, wait.  Sure... I mean, why not. 

                                 WESLEY
                        That’s okay.  I think Amy’s just 
                        throwing shit at the wall...

                                 HUCK 
                        Kinda the definition of blind 
                        dating, isn’t it?

           Wesley stops for a moment... she might just like him.

                                 WESLEY
                        Yeah.  Exactly.  I’ve always 
                        thought you should get an 
                        “automatic out” on a blind date.  
                        You say hi, no chemistry, you say 
                        “no.”  Easy as that.

                                 HUCK
                        No harm, no foul?

                                 WESLEY
                        We don’t know each other well 
                        enough to be offended.

                                 HUCK
                        Well, I think first dates should be 
                        clothes shopping instead of dinner.  
                        I get to see what you look like in 
                        your underwear and you don’t have 
                        to pretend you eat bread. 

                                 WESLEY
                        (laughing)
                        Maybe we should start with a drink.   

           INT. FOUR SEASONS BAR - NIGHT

           Wesley enters.  A hideous guy with EXTREMELY TINY TEETH 
           waves.  She smiles, hiding her disappointment, then realizes 
           he’s waving at someone else.  Phew.  Tiny Teeth steps out of 
           the way, revealing HUCK SPENCER, 30s, at a table, perusing 
           the menu. He’s casual, sneakers and jeans.  Wesley’s pleased.
                                 WESLEY
                        Huck?

                                 HUCK
                        Hey.  Nice to meet you.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Phew!  I thought you were Tiny 
                        Teeth Guy. Can you imagine?  Our 
                        kids would be all gums.  

           She hangs her handbag on her chair and sits.

                                 HUCK
                        So...  how do you know Amy?

                                 WESLEY
                        I work for her dad’s law firm. You?

                                 HUCK
                        We dated a little in med school.   

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh right.  So I guess she’s doing 
                        that thing girls do, when they get 
                        married and try to move their old 
                        stock...  Were you at her wedding?

                                 HUCK
                        No.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Didn’t want to fly to Italy?

                                 HUCK
                        No, no, I mean...  no.

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh, sorry, were you not invited?

                                 HUCK
                        No.  I’m using my “automatic out.”  

                                 WESLEY
                        What?!  

                                 HUCK
                        No harm, no foul?

                                 WESLEY
                        Big foul!

                                 HUCK
                        But you said...
                                 WESLEY
                        We were riffing!

                                 HUCK
                        Riffing?  

                                 WESLEY
                        Yes!  Witty banter?  Have you never 
                        been on a date before?

                                 HUCK
                        Not in a while...  Look, Leslie...

                                 WESLEY
                        Wesley! 

                                 HUCK
                        Sorry.  Wesley.  Okay, let’s have a 
                        drink.  Maybe I’m wrong.  I didn’t 
                        mean to upset you.

                                 WESLEY
                        I’m not upset.  I’m just trying to 
                        figure out what the hell your 
                        problem is with me.

                                 HUCK
                        Nothing at all.  I made a mistake.

                                 WESLEY
                        (indicating her dress)
                        It’s an empire waist, it’s supposed 
                        to drape like that.  I run five 
                        miles a day!  Feel my calves.

                                 HUCK
                        You’re very pretty.  It’s just... 
                        I’m in a hanging-out-taking-things-
                        slow kinda place right now. 

                                 WESLEY
                        So what makes you think I’m not?

                                 HUCK
                        You dropped “kids,” “married” and 
                        “wedding” in five seconds flat.

                                 WESLEY
                        Not in the context of me wanting 
                        you to father my children!  God!

                                 HUCK
                        Look, I’m protecting you.
                                 WESLEY
                        From what?

                                 HUCK
                        From false expectations.  I just 
                        don’t think it’s right to lead on a 
                        woman of a certain age.

           Wesley’s mouth drops open at “a certain age”  Huck winces. 

                                 HUCK (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean anything by that.  

                                 WESLEY
                        God, get over yourself. You’re just 
                        another LA loser with too much hair 
                        product who thinks he’s entitled to 
                        sleep with twenty two year olds.  

                                 HUCK
                        You’re obviously a woman who knows 
                        what she wants... and I’m not it. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Don’t handle me!  I’m not one of 
                        your five year old patients! 

           Wesley and Huck both stand.  They shake.

                      HUCK
           Nice to meet you.  
                                               WESLEY
                                      Go fuck yourself.

           She walks off...  and SMACKS into a guy, spilling her drink.  
           She shrieks at the cold drink down her dress, wipes herself 
           off.  Then realizes her drink is all over the guy’s pants.  

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit.  I’m so sorry.  

           She tries to wipe him off but the stain’s right across the 
           bulge in his crotch.  Impressive, by the way.  She finally 
           breaks her awkward stare and glances up to find the MOST 
           BEAUTIFUL MAN SHE'S EVER SEEN.  This is JARED GRAYSON, 38.

                                 JARED
                        Now we’re both having a bad night.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Were you eavesdropping on my date?

                                 JARED
                        I was admiring you from afar. 
                        Wondering how to get you away from 
                        that tool.  I’m Jared, by the way.
                                 WESLEY
                        Wesley.  Have we met?  You look 
                        familiar... but I can’t place you.

           Jared gets a funny look on his face.

                                 JARED
                        I represent athletes...?

                                 WESLEY
                        Hmm...   No...  Did you go to UCLA?

                                 JARED
                        BU.  High school in the valley?

                                 WESLEY
                        Chicago.  This is driving me crazy.    

           She stares, trying to remember.  Jared sighs, resigned.

                                 JARED
                        Do you read LA magazine?

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh my god!  You’re the perfect man!  
                        From that article!

                                 JARED
                        I’ve been getting shit about this 
                        all week.  It’s not me!

           She finds the article in her bag.  Holds it up next to Jared. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Right.  I saw Jerry Maguire.  I 
                        know you sports guys all lie.

                                 JARED
                        Not this one.  Look, it’s in the 
                        article --  they blended the faces 
                        of People’s 100 best looking men 
                        and came up with this composite.  

                                 WESLEY
                        So you’re, actually, empirically 
                        the perfect man?   

                                 JARED
                        Come on, not you too.  I can’t take 
                        this abuse.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Awww.  Is it hard to be so good-
                        looking?
                                 JARED
                        You tell me.  

                                 WESLEY
                        You’re very sweet.

                                 JARED
                        Nope.  Just honest.  

           Wesley smiles.  He seems like a good guy.  

                                 JARED (CONT’D)
                        So... what do you say we salvage 
                        the rest of your night?

           INT. PILATES STUDIO - DAY

           Wesley works out with her friends KAYLIE (sweet and 
           enthusiastic) and BROOKE (irritable and cynical), both 30s.

                                 KAYLIE
                        (sing-song)
                        Great story to tell at your 
                        wedding!

                                 BROOKE
                        Kaylie, relax.  They had one drink.

                                 WESLEY
                        You know the most amazing thing?  
                        He said he’d call today so we could 
                        make a plan.

                                 BROOKE
                        Why is that amazing?

                                 WESLEY
                        Because he actually called!

                                 KAYLIE
                        Love.  Him.  

                                 BROOKE
                        Jesus Fucking Christ.  
                        (to Wesley)
                        Do not sleep with him.

                                 WESLEY
                        Do you think I’m an idiot?
                        (a beat)
                        How many dates do I have to wait?
                                 KAYLIE
                        It’s not about a number.  Just do 
                        it when it feels right.

                                 BROOKE
                        Kaylie, you utter ass-hat.

                                 WESLEY
                        Kaylie must know something.  She’s 
                        the only one of us who’s married.

                                 BROOKE
                        I was married.  It’s not my fault 
                        Alan went mahoola.

                                 KAYLIE
                        I still think it’s gonna work out.

                                 BROOKE
                        Kaylie, he became an Orthodox Jew.  
                        If Tad asked you to wear a wig and 
                        fuck through a sheet, would that 
                        work out?

                                 KAYLIE
                        Probably.  

                                 BROOKE
                        Sucker.  Have fun sweeping up payis-
                        hairs and breeding.  

                                 KAYLIE
                        Maybe not breeding...  

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh honey.  I’m sure you’ll get 
                        pregnant soon.  

                                 KAYLIE
                        I’m feeling pretty positive.  I got 
                        these hypnosis tapes that worked 
                        for my friend. It’s these calming 
                        British people telling me to relax.

                                 BROOKE
                        I’m sure that’ll work better than 
                        Tad getting rid of his extra 
                        testicle like your doctor advised.

                                 WESLEY
                        What?!  Tad has three balls?!
                                 KAYLIE
                        You can’t see it.  One’s hidden 
                        inside the other.  They found it 
                        after he got that... thing.  

                                 BROOKE
                        By that thing you mean... syphilis?

           Kaylie gives Brooke a dirty look.

                        Relax.  Your husband got a disease 
                        from fucking his assistant and now 
                        you literally get to chop his ball 
                        off.  Do you know how many women 
                        would kill for that opportunity?

           An uncomfortable moment.  Wesley intervenes.  

                                 WESLEY
                        So, um, Brooke.  You were telling 
                        me how many dates to wait?  

                                 BROOKE
                        It’s not the number of dates.  It’s 
                        the number of “Great Girl Moments.”  
                        And that number is five.   

                                 WESLEY
                        What’s a Great Girl Moment?

                                 BROOKE
                        You know, those times when he gets 
                        that look in his eyes, like he 
                        can’t believe he found such a great 
                        girl, and you’re so different from 
                        his needy, neurotic ex, and where 
                        have you been all this time, and, 
                        oh my god, is he falling for you?  

                                 WESLEY
                        But I am needy and neurotic.

                                 BROOKE
                        And that will always be our secret.

           EXT. PINK’S HOT DOGS - DAY

           Jared and Wesley order.

                                 WESLEY
                        I’ll take a double chili cheese 
                        dog, heavy on the cheese, extra 
                        onions, large fries.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 WESLEY (CONT'D)
                        (to Jared)
                        You eat fries, right?

           Jared’s amazed.  Wesley bites into her hot dog.  CHA-CHING!  

           INT. ARCLIGHT CINEMAS - NIGHT

           Jared and Wesley watch a melodramatic film.  Jared cracks up 
           at an insipid line of dialogue.  Wesley whispers.

                                 WESLEY
                        This is gayer than The Notebook.

                                 JARED
                        (eyes lighting up)
                        So... we can go?

           She nods.  They sneak out, pissing off their row.  Jared 
           holds her hand on the way out.  CHA-CHING!

           EXT. BARNES AND NOBLE - DAY

           Jared and Wesley browse through aisles of books.  She picks 
           up a book called “HEALING YOUR INNER YOU.”  Jared notices.  

                                 JARED
                        You want me to buy that for you?

                                 WESLEY
                        Do I seem like a girl who reads 
                        self-help?  I think they give you a 
                        cat and a vibrator with this book.  

           Jared laughs.  CHA-CHING!

           INT. GRACE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A romantic dinner.  Jared fidgets, uncomfortable.  

                                 JARED 
                        It’s not a big deal, but I didn’t 
                        want you to hear from someone else.  
                        (deep breath)
                        I was engaged.  To a girl named 
                        Gretchen.  We called off the 
                        wedding six months ago.  

                                 WESLEY
                        I’m sorry, that must have been 
                        rough.  Thanks for telling me. 

                                 JARED
                        That’s it?  No big discussion?
                                 WESLEY
                        I'll talk about whatever you want, 
                        but I don't need to.  I'm pretty 
                        low maintenance when it comes to 
                        this stuff.

           Jared exhales, relieved.  CHA CHING!

           INT. JARED’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jared and Wesley walk into his house.  He takes her coat.  

                                 JARED
                        We need to talk.  

           Shit.  Is he dumping her??  Wesley tries to hide her nerves.

                                 JARED (CONT’D)
                        My sister’s getting married two 
                        weeks from today.  I’ll understand 
                        if you don’t want to go, but I just 
                        thought it might be fun and you’d 
                        meet my family, of course, and...

           It’s all Wesley can do to stop herself from squealing.

                                 WESLEY
                        You want me to come to your 
                        sister’s wedding with you?  And 
                        meet your family?

                                 JARED
                        I know.  It’s a lot.  But I have an 
                        incentive for you.

           He opens the hallway closet and pulls out a garment bag.  She 
           opens it.  Inside is THE MOST AMAZING DRESS IN THE WORLD.

                                 WESLEY
                        You bought me a dress?

                                 JARED
                        I’m either very brave or very 
                        stupid.  You can be honest.

                                 WESLEY
                        That is so nice.  I’d love to.

           INT. JARED’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Wesley does a silent DANCE OF JOY.
           INT. JARED’S HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Wesley walks out of the bathroom, wearing the dress.  She 
           strikes a pose.  Jared smiles mischievously - CHA CHING!  

           INT. JARED’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jared peels off Wesley’s dress.  She strategically positions 
           her thighs under the sheets and sucks in her stomach.   

           INT. JARED’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           THE DRESS IS NOW ON THE FLOOR, having been ripped off last 
           night. TWO CONDOM WRAPPERS rest on the night-stand.  Wesley’s 
           sound asleep, smiling.  Jared’s in front of the mirror, 
           finishing his suit off with a stylish pocket square.  He SEES 
           her through the mirror as she wakes up.  Turns and smiles.  

                                 JARED
                        Thanks for such an amazing night.

                                 WESLEY
                        ...you’re welcome?

                                 JARED
                        That came out totally wrong, huh?

                                 WESLEY
                        It was a little pay-the-hooker.

                                 JARED
                        I’m sorry, I’m an idiot.  I guess 
                        I’m nervous.  It’s just... I really 
                        like you, Wes.

                                 WESLEY
                        (blushing)
                        I like you too.  

                                 JARED
                        I have to get to the office.  But 
                        I’ll call you later, okay?

           She nods.  He kisses her -- a good one.   

           INT. WESLEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Wesley enters, glowing.  A VASE OF PINK ROSES sits on her 
           desk.  She beams, goes for the card.  Before she can get it, 
           her actively gay assistant, STEVEN, grabs the vase.

                                 STEVEN
                        They’re from Brendan.
                                 WESLEY
                        How’s the wedding planning going?

                                 STEVEN
                        Nightmare!  Brendan insists on 
                        releasing doves at the moment we 
                        kiss.  One hundred percent they’re 
                        going to shit on everyone’s heads. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Sounds amazing...

                                 STEVEN
                        Oh.  My.  God.  You’re in a sex-
                        fog!  Tell me everything!

           The PHONE RINGS.

                                 WESLEY
                        I’m not in a sex fog.  Go answer my 
                        phone.

           He looks at her skeptically and walks out to his desk.  
           Wesley drops into her chair and spins dreamily.

           INT. WESLEY’S OFFICE - END OF DAY

           Wesley’s at her desk, bummed.  Steven enters tentatively.

                                 STEVEN
                        Maybe he’s dead.

                                 WESLEY
                        You’re just being nice.

                                 STEVEN
                        Want me to call his office?

                                 WESLEY
                        No.  Yes.  Don’t say it’s me. 

           He dials a number.  Someone answers on the other end.

                                 STEVEN
                        Hi, this is Lance from HR.  Can I 
                        speak to Mr. Grayson?  

                                 JARED’S ASSISTANT (ON SPEAKER)
                        He’s not here right now.  Can I 
                        take a message?

                                 STEVEN
                        So... he’s alive?
                                 JARED’S ASSISTANT (ON SPEAKER)
                        Um, yeah.  Who is this again?

                                 STEVEN
                        (hanging up)
                        He’ll call tomorrow.  And if he 
                        doesn’t, I’ll hunt him down and 
                        kick him in his little twat.  

           Wesley nods, opens a pack of birth control pills, takes one.  

           WE STAY ON THE BIRTH CONTROL PILL CASE --  One pill for each 
           day of the week.  Today’s -- Monday -- is gone.  The pills 
           are POPPED OUT, one by one.  TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY.  

           INT. WESLEY’S OFFICE - FOUR DAYS LATER 

           Wesley is near-catatonic.  Steven enters, holding a stack of 
           messages.  Wesley looks up, hopeful.  Steven shakes his head.  

           EXT. RUNYON CANYON - DAY

           Wesley hikes with Kaylie and Brooke, a fake smile plastered 
           on her face.  They have no idea what’s been going on.

                                 KAYLIE
                        He bought you a dress?!  It’s so 
                        romantic!!  And you deserve it.  
                        When’s the last time you dated 
                        someone for more than a few weeks?

                        No, no.  The other guy.  The one 
                        who had breast reduction surgery.

           Wesley BURSTS INTO GIANT, HEAVING TEARS. 

                                 WESLEY
                        (muffled sobbing)
                        I... had sex... with Jared... and 
                        it all... went... to shit!

           INT. KARAOKE BAR, STAGE - NIGHT

           A drunk, sad Wesley karaokes to the Eagles’ “Desperado.”
                                 WESLEY
                        Desssssssperado...  why don’t you 
                        come to your senses?  You been out 
                        ridin’ fences, for so long now...

           EXT. JARED’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           “Desperado” plays on the car stereo.  A crying Wesley does a 
           driveby, seeing if the lights are on.  They are.  She SOBS.  

           HONK!!!  She nearly gets hit by a passing car.  Wesley LEANS 
           ON HER HORN, irrationally angry. 

           INT. WESLEY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           A mess.  An infuriated Wesley holds a half-empty mimosa in 
           her hand.  She dictates to Brooke who types on a laptop.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Dear Jared.  How are you?  I’m 
                        fine.

                                 BROOKE
                        Not fine.  You’re doing great.  And 
                        we don’t ask him how he is.  We 
                        don’t care how he is. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Okay.  Dear Jared.  In case you’re 
                        wondering, I’m doing great.  Except 
                        for the fact that five days ago, 
                        after exactly four weeks of dating, 
                        your penis entered my vagina for 
                        the first time, and I haven’t heard 
                        from you since. 

           Kaylie, pouring tea in the kitchen, shakes her head.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps ignoring someone with whom 
                        you’ve exchanged bodily fluids is 
                        what gay men do.  Or perhaps you’re 
                        just a garden-variety asshole.  For 
                        the record, your dick bends to the 
                        left, your joke about Iraqi bikini 
                        models wasn’t funny, and I was 
                        fantasizing about my dentist while 
                        you were going down on me.  

           Kaylie enters and hands a teacup to Wesley, who hiccups.

                                 KAYLIE
                        Maybe you should sober up a little.
                                 WESLEY
                        I don’t want to sober up!  I feel 
                        energized for the first time all 
                        week!  Yay alcohol!

                        You really dodged a bullet, Wes.  

           Wesley nods.  Yes.  Yes she did dodge a bullet.  The phone 
           RINGS.  Wesley pulls herself together, grabs the phone and 
           heads out the door.  Newly resolved--

                                 WESLEY
                        Send the email.

           EXT. WESLEY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Wesley walks into the courtyard, then picks up her phone.

                                 WESLEY (ON PHONE)
                        Mom!  You know I don’t get 
                        reception in the apartment.

           She hears scratchy static and a muffled voice.  Frowns.

                                 JARED (OVER PHONE)
                        It’s me, Jared!  Can you hear me?

           Wesley’s shocked, but tries to hide it.

                                 WESLEY (ON PHONE)
                        Jared?  Oh Jared.  How are you?  

           EXT./INT. DR. AURELIO VALDIVIESO GENERAL HOSPITAL - SAME

           A ramshackle building in a low-rent strip mall.  Two 
           PARAMEDICS lean on a PARKED AMBULANCE, smoking cigarettes.  

           Inside, Jared lays in a hospital bed, in traction.  He looks 
           awful.  PILAR, a sexy Mexican nurse straight out of a 
           telanovela, holds a rotary phone to his ear.  

           INTERCUT SCENES AS NEEDED

                                 JARED 
                        You know Ron Jones?  Clippers guy?  
                        He’s my client.  Got arrested at 
                        the Ixtapa airport on Monday.
                                 WESLEY
                        Oh yeah, I saw that on the news.  
                        Who brings drugs into Mexico?

                                 JARED
                        Don’t get me started.  Anyway, I 
                        had to fly here and deal with it.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Wait, you’re in Mexico?

                                 JARED
                        Zihuatanejo.  I was staying at a 
                        nice place, by the way.  Las 
                        Playas.  We’ll go sometime.

                                 WESLEY
                        You were staying there?  Where are 
                        you now?

                                 JARED
                        That would be the local hospital.  
                        I got into a car accident.

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh my god.  Jared.  Are you okay?

                                 JARED 
                        Yeah.  Sort of.  They said it’ll be 
                        a few months of physical therapy, 
                        after the casts come off.

           EXT. WESLEY’S APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME

           Wesley is reeling.  She paces, still in shock.

                                 JARED (OVER PHONE)
                        I just wish I’d been able to get in 
                        touch with you sooner... I was in 
                        what they call a “twilight state.”  
                        You must have thought I was such a 
                        dick.  Especially after... you 
                        know...  what we did before I left.

           Wesley passes by a window to her apartment.  She stops in her 
           tracks.  Inside, Kaylie and Brooke sit at the computer.  In 
           SLOW MOTION BROOKE’S HAND moves the CURSOR toward the SEND 
           BUTTON.  A LOOK OF HORROR passes over Wesley’s face.

                                 WESLEY
                        Don’t be silly.  I’m an adult.

           She RUNS UP TO THE WINDOW and KNOCKS frenziedly, waving and 
           trying to get them to stop.  They wave back. 
           The line gets STATICKY, Jared’s voice muffled.  

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Hello?  Jared?

           Wesley backs away from the window so Jared can hear her, but 
           continues making FRANTIC GESTURES, pointing to the phone.

                                 JARED 
                        I hear you now.  What did you say?

                                 WESLEY 
                        I said I’m an adult!  Can I help?  
                        Let anyone know where you are?

           Wesley’s movements get WILDER and MORE DESPERATE.  Brooke 
           halfheartedly tries to open the window, but it’s stuck.

                                 JARED 
                        No, they all know.  That’s the 
                        other thing.  I hadn’t updated my 
                        emergency contact info.  The 
                        doctors got in touch with Gretchen, 
                        and, typical Gretchen, she called 
                        everyone but you.  

           Wesley MOUTHS A SCREAM, points to the laptop.  

                                 WESLEY
                        You were together for three years.  
                        It’ll take a while for her to 
                        accept that you’ve moved on.

                                 JARED 
                        See, this is what I love about you.  
                        You’re so reasonable. 

                                 WESLEY 
                        That’s me.  Always reasonable!

                                 JARED
                        You’re probably the last normal 
                        girl in Southern California.

           Wesley takes off one of her SHOES and HURLS it at the window. 

                                 JARED (CONT’D)
                        It’s such a change for me.  Jane, 
                        the girl before Gretchen?  She was 
                        bipolar.  She’d steam open my 
                        credit card statements to see if I 
                        was spending money on other girls.  
                        And Clara, before Jane?

                        I wouldn’t give her my email 
                        password and she tried to run me 
                        over with her car.

                                 WESLEY 
                        Wow.  They sound crackers.  

                                 JARED 
                        I’m a decent guy, and these girls 
                        just didn’t get it.  All they did 
                        was question my character.  

                                 WESLEY
                        And who wants a relationship 
                        without trust?

                                 JARED
                        Exactly.  Never going there again.

           Wesley picks up a ROCK and throws it at her window frame.  It 
           veers left and CRACKS Wesley’s neighbor’s window instead.

                                 JARED (CONT’D)
                        They’re releasing me in three days.  
                        Monday.  I’ll call you when I know 
                        more.  Miss you very much.

                                 WESLEY 
                        Miss you too.

           They hang up.  Wesley RACES through the courtyard.

           INT. WESLEY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Wesley bursts in the door.

                                 WESLEY
                        Stop, stop!  Don’t send that email!

                                 BROOKE
                        I know what you’re doing!

           Wesley GRABS for the laptop.  Brooke HOLDS it over her head. 
           Kaylie tries to intervene but gets knocked across the room. 

                                               WESLEY
                                      Jared was hit by a truck--
                  BROOKE (CONT’D)
           You’re hedging your bets, in 
           case he shows up next week--

                        Have some self respect!

           Wesley grabs the computer away, just as we hear a WHOOSH!  
           The “EMAIL SENT” sound reverberates from the computer.  

           INT. WESLEY’S CAR - LATER

           Wesley drives, her phone on speaker.

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           Wesley sits in a tiny chair, reasoning with someone.

                                 WESLEY
                        It’s just, he didn’t call me for 
                        five days!  One hundred and twenty 
                        hours of obsessing and Facebooking 
                        his exes and wondering if I make 
                        too much noise in bed.  Do you have 
                        any idea what that’s like?  

           REVERSE ANGLE to reveal Wesley’s been speaking to a stern 
           nun, SISTER BEASLEY, who clears her throat, uncomfortable.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Fine, maybe not.  But would it kill 
                        you to tell me the name of his 
                        second grade teacher?!  I know you 
                        keep records of former students.  

                                 SISTER BEASLEY
                        I can’t help you break into Mr. 
                        Grayson’s email account.

                                 WESLEY
                        I swear, I won’t read the other 
                        emails.  I’ll just delete mine.

                                 SISTER BEASLEY
                        It’s unethical and wrong.  

                                 WESLEY
                        How can I explain... what if you 
                        think of Jared as...  hmm... Jesus? 
                        And Jesus is gorgeous and brilliant

                        Jesus gives money to cancer kids 
                        and offsets his carbon footprint.  
                        And Jesus reads books!  Real books, 
                        with metaphors and obscure life 
                        lessons!  And you’ve somehow 
                        convinced Jesus that you’re not 
                        your irrational, compulsive self.  
                        That you’re light and breezy and 
                        easy.  Like Cameron Diaz in There’s 
                        Something About Mary!  And all that 
                        stands between you and Jesus 
                        enjoying eternal happiness is a 
                        teensy violation of privacy.  What 
                        do you do?

                        Sister Beasley!

                        Why buy the cow, blah, blah?  

                                 WESLEY
                        But you’re a nun! 

                                 SISTER BEASLEY
                        I discovered my true calling later 
                        in life.  

                                 WESLEY
                        How late?

                                 SISTER BEASLEY
                        Up until March, I was an IT tech at 
                        Pfizer.  

           Sister Beasley takes pity on Wesley and checks Jared’s file.

                        His teacher was Anne Marie Fox.

           Wesley whips out her Blackberry, answering the security 
           question to get into Jared’s email -- “Who was your second 
           grade teacher?”  She types “Fox.”  

           DING!  The program opens.  But... the mailbox is empty.

                                 WESLEY
                        No messages?  How is that possible?
                                 SISTER BEASLEY
                        He probably has a computer open.  
                        When an email disappears from the 
                        server, it’s because a program like 
                        Outlook or Mac Mail has already 
                        downloaded it.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Dude.  So what do I do now? 

                                 SISTER BEASLEY
                        You’d have to delete it from the 
                        actual machine.

                                 WESLEY
                        But the actual machine is in a 
                        hotel room in Mexico.

                        Though a jail term’s a great excuse

                        I haven’t been out of town in 
                        forever.  I kind of promised myself 
                        my next trip would be with a guy.

                        Well, it kind of will be.  He just 
                        won’t know you’re there.  

                                 WESLEY

                        Yes I do.  If you come, it’s a 
                        vacation.  If you don’t, it’s an

                        I read your self-indulgent blog.  I 
                        flew to Cleveland for your wedding.

                        So what if I did?  You’re supposed 
                        to discourage that kind of 
                        behavior.  But once again, your 
                        self-destructive friend had a 
                        disaster, and you glommed onto it 
                        like a couple of vultures!  You 
                        were living vicariously through me, 
                        like always, because your lives are 
                        so boring!  You’re underminers! You 
                        have a vested interest in keeping 
                        me miserable!  And I refuse to be 
                        your dancing monkey!  
                        (a beat)
                        I’ll pay for the tickets and the 
                        hotel.

           Kaylie and Brooke look at each other, defeated.

           EXT. PLANE - AFTERNOON

           A PLANE bearing the AIR MEXICALI LOGO -- A GRINNING DONKEY 
           WEARING A SOMBRERO -- ZOOMS across the sky.  

           EXT./INT. LAS PLAYAS RESORT - AFTERNOON

           A large resort above a pristine beach, framed by palm trees.  
           We’re in a serene open air lobby with a colorful stone-tiled 
           floor.  STAFFERS in linen pass through an arched entry way.  

           Brooke and Kaylie stretch out on rattan armchairs.  Brooke 
           chugs a Margarita.  Kaylie sips a disgusting-looking beverage 
           out of a bottle.  Wesley checks them in.  Her Blackberry 
           BUZZES WITH A TEXT:  “It’s Jared. Texting from nurse’s phone.  
           Feeling better.  Getting out Sun. eve maybe.  Keep u posted.”

           The genteel, somewhat officious hotel manager, QUINTANO, 
           slides over some paperwork for Wesley to sign.

                                 QUINTANO
                        We hope you’ll enjoy your stay at 
                        Las Playas, Señora Robbins.
                                 WESLEY
                        It’s Señorita.  I’m not married.

           Quintano smiles coldly -- he doesn’t like being corrected.  

                                 QUINTANO
                        Ramon will show you to your casita.  

           RAMON, the overeager bellman (portly, mustached, middle-
           aged), makes a move for Wesley’s luggage.  Wesley stops him.

                                 WESLEY
                        Before we go up, could you tell me 
                        which casita Jared Grayson is in?

                                 QUINTANO
                        (picking up the phone)
                        I’ll be happy to connect you.

                                 WESLEY
                        He’s not there at the moment.

                                 QUINTANO
                        In that case, I’ll be happy to take 
                        a message for Señor Grayson.

                                 WESLEY
                        I can slip a note under his door.

                                 QUINTANO
                        It’s our policy to protect hotel 
                        guests’ room numbers.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Protect them from whom?

           Quintano indicates a newspaper with the headline, “BANDITOS!”

                                 QUINTANO
                        Hotel bandits.

                                 WESLEY
                        Do I look like a hotel bandit?  I’m 
                        a lawyer.  An el abogado.  

                                 QUINTANO
                        I know what a lawyer is.

                                 WESLEY
                        Not to brag, but I was number three 
                        in my class at UCLA.

                                 QUINTANO
                        UCLA... isn’t that a state school?
           Ramon reaches for Wesley’s bag again.  She snatches it away, 
           losing her grip on it.  It bursts open.  

           Out spills a LEATHER BRA, SEX HARNESS and a ENORMOUS, FLESHY, 
           VEINED DILDO with DISTURBINGLY REALISTIC TESTICLES.  

           Wesley’s mortified. Brooke and Kaylie crack up at their joke.

                        Nice.  Now you can pay for your own 
                        minibar.  

           They laugh even harder.  Wesley gathers sex toys.  Brooke 
           offers a sip of her drink to Kaylie, who shakes her head.

           Kaylie points out Goiter Guy.  Wesley sighs.

                                 WESLEY
                        Everyone really is married but me.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Wesley?

           She turns.  It’s Huck, of the bad blind date.  He’s wearing a 
           straw hat and shorts, sporting a suntan, and holding a beer.

                                 HUCK
                        I thought that was you.  This is an 
                        awkward coincidence, isn’t it?

                                 WESLEY
                        Huck.  What the hell are you doing 
                        here?

                                 HUCK
                        Mexico’s a very popular destination 
                        for Southern California residents.   

                                 WESLEY
                        (asshole)
                        I know that.  I mean, at this 
                        hotel.

                                 HUCK
                        Hitting up Quintano for the 
                        employee rate.  

                                 QUINTANO
                        We were roommates.  At Stanford.  
                        (whispers to her)
                        I was number one in my class. 

           Quintano smirks triumphantly.  Wesley ignores him.  
                                 HUCK
                        I’ve actually been meaning to call.   
                        I feel bad about what happened that 
                        night.  ...  Is this leather?

           Huck bends down and picks up a leather bra.  He hands it over 
           to Wesley, who reddens and snatches it away.  

                                 WESLEY
                        This isn’t mine.  It’s this dumb 
                        joke we’ve had forever.  

                                 HUCK
                        Hey, no judgment here.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh, now I’m not just a tragic 
                        spinster, I’m a liar too?

                                 HUCK
                        You’re upset.  I get it.  Give me a 
                        chance to explain.

                                 WESLEY
                        Hmmmm....  No.

                                 HUCK
                        No?

                                 WESLEY
                        I’m using my automatic out.  Later.

           INT. GIRLS’ CASITA - MAGIC

           Kaylie and Brooke stand at the window, looking at the pool/ 
           hot tub area.  They check out Huck, who pulls his shirt off.

                                 BROOKE
                        Shirt’s coming off.   

                                 KAYLIE
                        Hot!  I like his puffy nipples.  He 
                        reminds me of Tom Hanks.

                                 BROOKE
                        Would you stop with Tom Hanks 
                        already?  Loving Tom Hanks is like 
                        loving beige.

           Wesley sighs and plops down on the bed.  Brooke glances over 
           and sees Wesley looking dejected.  She elbows Kaylie to look. 

                                 KAYLIE
                        We really feel bad about the dildo.
                                 BROOKE
                        It probably wasn’t a great idea to 
                        draw attention to ourselves before 
                        we commit a felony.  We’re sorry. 

                                 WESLEY
                        What are we even doing here? 
                        Jared’s in the hospital, they’re 
                        not going to tell us which room 
                        he’s in, and even if they did...

                                 KAYLIE
                        Let’s call his cell phone!

                                 WESLEY
                        Why? 

                                 KAYLIE
                        Because it’s in his room!   If we 
                        hear it ring, we’ll know...

                                 BROOKE
                        There’s three hundred rooms here.

                                 KAYLIE
                        It’s worth a try, right? 

           Wesley dials Jared’s number on her cell, listens.  Nothing. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Do you hear anything? 

                                 BROOKE
                        Me neither.

                        I do.  Follow me.

           EXT. LAS PLAYAS RESORT - NIGHT

           The girls follow Kaylie through the resort’s courtyard.  They 
           walk slowly past the rooms.  Wesley redials when it goes to 
           voice mail.  They keep listening for the RING.  Then... the 
           faint sounds of the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE THEME SONG.

                                 WESLEY
                        That’s it!  Mission Impossible!

                        I’ll refrain from commenting on the  
                        gayosity of that ring tone.
           EXT. JARED’S CASITAS - NIGHT

           Inside this casita is the PHONE.  The girls walk up to it --- 
           YES!  Wesley turns to Kaylie. 

                                 WESLEY
                        How did you do that?  

                                 KAYLIE
                        I’m on these new fertility drugs.  
                        They ramp up your senses.  And they 
                        make vinegar taste like chocolate!

                        So what does chocolate taste like?

                                 KAYLIE
                        Albacore.

                                 BROOKE
                        Cooked or sashimi?

                        Enough!  What do we do now? 

           EXT. STONE PATHS - NIGHT

           Tiki torches light the resort.  It looks like a tropical 
           paradise.  The girls pass by a cluster of casitas.

                                 KAYLIE
                        We need a room service cart, and a 
                        credit card to jimmy the lock.

                        out how to build a bomb online, I’m 
                        sure you can find this out too.

           EXT. RESORT - CONTINUOUS

           They pass a casita.  Inside, the loud SOUNDS OF DONKEY SEX.  
           We see a couple’s CONTORTED SHADOW through the curtains.
                                 BROOKE
                        What.  The.  Fuck.

                        They’re in a position called “The 
                        Snowman.”  Men find it erotic 
                        because it splays the vulva.

                                 BROOKE
                        Never say vulva ever again.

                                 WESLEY
                        But you’re okay with splays?  And 
                        how you even know that, Kaylie?

                                 KAYLIE
                        We’ve been peppering our love-
                        making sessions with porn.  Tad 
                        says it increases sperm motility!

                        slut” fertility cure.  

                                 KAYLIE
                        You are very cynical, lady! 

                                 BROOKE
                        Hey, I approve.  This way Tad can 
                        get all the strange pussy he needs 
                        in the comfort of his own home.  

           Wesley interrupts to stop the fight.

                                 WESLEY
                        The sex with Jared was amazing.

                                 KAYLIE
                        Really?  He was an attentive lover?

                                 WESLEY
                        Totally.  He knew exactly what to 
                        do without me having to tell him.  
                        I couldn’t even sleep after I was 
                        so (squealing gesture) wheeee!  I 
                        had take three extra Ambien to 
                        knock myself out.

                        I hate Ambien.  It makes me 
                        hallucinate.  
                                 WESLEY
                        Me too!  What do you see?

                                 BROOKE
                        Cloris Leachman fisting a clown.

                                 WESLEY
                        Same. 

           The sex sounds end. A RED-FACED MAN in a tiny towel walks out 
           of the casita and onto the balcony.  He closes the sliding 
           door behind him, lights a cigarette, then sees the girls.  

           They APPLAUD.  Embarrassed, he tries to re-open the sliding 
           door, then realizes it’s locked.  He knocks, urgently.  Hmmm.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        What if I pretended to be locked 
                        out of Jared’s room?  Like I was 
                        putting a room service tray outside 
                        and the door shut behind me?  Maybe 
                        they’d feel bad and let me in.

                                 BROOKE
                        Maybe. If you were pathetic enough.

                                 WESLEY
                        Define enough.

           INT. JARED’S CASITAS, STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Wesley wears a small towel wrapped around herself, barely 
           covering anything.  Kaylie and Brooke study her.

                                 KAYLIE
                        I think a different towel.

           Kaylie rummages in her beach bag and pulls out a TINY TOWEL.  

                                 WESLEY
                        That’s a wash cloth!  It won’t even 
                        cover my ass.

                                 BROOKE
                        Exactly.

           Brooke trades Wesley her clothes and phone for a room service 
           tray, then prods her through the door, to the hallway.

                                      Lots of energy!

           SLAM!  They shut the door.  Wesley backs up against a wall, 
           practicing “help, I’m locked out of my room” poses.  

           A YOUNG COUPLE enters the hallway, quietly carrying their 
           SLEEPING BABY into the room.  

           Wesley watches them wistfully, comparing their life to hers.

                        In love with a baby.  Half-naked, 
                        breaking into my not-even-
                        boyfriend's hotel room.  Ugh.

           INT. HOTEL GIFT SHOP - NIGHT

           Kaylie talks on the cell phone to Tad while browsing.  

           She notices the DEFORMED PEOPLE she saw earlier entering the 
           lobby....  Only now they’re not so deformed.  Wheelchair 
           lady’s walking.  Goiter Guy’s neck looks normal.  

           INT. BLUE PARROT BEACH BAR - SAME

           Brooke drinks a Margarita at the bar.  A HOT GUY approaches.

                        Hey, I’m Bill.

           She checks him out -- tall, dark, handsome.  Unacceptable.

                        “automatic out.”  It’s a new way of 
                        rejecting people efficiently. 

           INT. OUTSIDE JARED’S CASITA - NIGHT

           Wesley’s fallen asleep outside the door.

                                 BELLMAN (O.S.)
                        Señora?
           Wesley whips around to find a BELLMAN standing there.

                                 WESLEY
                        I was putting the room service tray 
                        out and the door slammed shut.

                                 BELLMAN
                        Si Señora.  Let me call a manager.

           He takes out his walkie-talkie.  Wesley panics.

                                 WESLEY
                        I’m in a towel.

                                 BELLMAN
                        It will just be a moment.

                                 WESLEY
                        This is ridiculous!

                                 BELLMAN
                        It is standard procedure, Señora.

                                 WESLEY
                        Fuck Señora already!  Do you see a 
                        ring on my finger?!  I’m one shit 
                        date away from freezing my eggs.  
                        I’ve dated every loser in the 
                        Pacific Times Zone.  I’ve probably 
                        dated you!  Open the fucking door!

           A beat.  The doorman opens the door to Jared’s room for her.  
           Wesley composes herself and backs into the room.

           INT. JARED’S CASITA - NIGHT

           Male-ish stuff everywhere.  JEANS draped over a chair.  An 
           open LAPTOP COMPUTER on the table.  Wesley sits on the couch, 
           marinating in Jared-ness.  Stands and walks over to the 
           laptop.  She plugs it in and waits for it to boot up.  

           She notices an open bathroom door, walks inside.  She turns 
           on the light, sees a scale.  Instinctively gets on.  

           She frowns, unhappy with what she sees - 125.2 POUNDS.  

           She takes off her earrings.  Looks again.  Still 125.2 
           POUNDS.  

           She sets her towel down on the sink.  Gets on the scale one 
           last time.  The number goes up to 125.4 POUNDS.

                                 WESLEY
                        What the hell?
           Just then, a MALE HAND REACHES INTO FRAME and lightly touches 
           Wesley’s ass.  She swats at it, thinking it’s a mosquito, 
           then sees it out of the corner of her eye and SCREAMS!!!!!  

           Wesley WHIRLS AROUND to find NOLAN, 14, in the bathroom, 
           wearing only his underwear.  He sports a huge boner and a 
           guilty expression on his face.  

                                 NOLAN
                        Hi.

           Wesley covers herself up with a towel and grabs a razor.  She 
           waves it in the air.  Nolan backs away.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Who are you?  Why are you in here?

                                 NOLAN
                        This is my room.

                                 WESLEY
                        This is my boyfriend’s room!  I 
                        mean, he’s not technically a 
                        “boyfriend,” but we’re on our way!

           Just then... the Mission Impossible ring tone.  Wesley looks 
           up -- the sound is coming from the casita above.  Oh oh.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Shit!  I’m so sorry --- they must 
                        have given me the wrong room key -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        ... but you’re naked.

           Wesley BOLTS out of the room, into--

           INT. OUTSIDE JARED’S CASITA - CONTINUOUS

           The door SLAMS behind her, shutting her little towel inside 
           the door.  Wesley, now completely naked, panics.  She pulls 
           at the towel, trying to dislodge it.

                                 WESLEY
                        FUCK!!!!!  

           Nolan’s mom, DEBBIE, 38, opens her door.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        Could you quiet-- Hey!  What were 
                        you doing in Nolan’s room???!!!
           INT. JARED’S CASITAS, STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Wesley tears down the stairwell, naked.  Debbie chases her.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Stop!  Cougar!  

           Wesley gasps, totally offended. 

           EXT. JARED’S CASITAS - CONTINUOUS

           Wesley pokes her head out, then sees a lounge chair.  She 
           grabs a cushion off the chair and wraps it awkwardly around 
           herself.  She takes off.  

           Debbie runs out after her, furious.  

           EXT. STONE PATHS - NIGHT

           Wesley sneaks down the path, past COUPLES HOLDING HANDS and 
           strolling.  She looks behind her -- she’s lost Debbie.

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - NIGHT

           Wesley, still covered by the chaise cushion, drives a golf 
           cart across the course.  A COUPLE MAKING OUT on the ninth 
           hole WHOOP as she goes by.  Startled, she makes a sharp left 
           and loses the cushion.

           EXT. INFINITY POOL - NIGHT

           Wesley covers herself awkwardly with a golf bag from the back 
           of the cart.  She notices a palm tree in front of the pool.  
           She rips a large leaf off of the tree and uses it instead.

           EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

           REVELERS party around a BONFIRE.  Wesley blends with the palm 
           trees on the beach.  She looks up at the bar, which sits high 
           above the beach, set on a rocky crag.  SHE SPOTS KAYLIE AND 
           BROOKE inside and waves.  They don’t notice.  

                                 HUCK (O.S.)
                        Wesley?  You okay?

           She turns, wraps the palm leaf around herself protectively.

                                 WESLEY
                        Why can’t I get rid of you?  You’re 
                        like a staph infection!    

           She starts scaling the rocky crag, still in her palm leaf. 
           INT. BLUE PARROR BAR - NIGHT

           Kaylie shows Brooke an internet printout about “Jose De 
           Deus,” a beatific man in long white robes.

                                 BROOKE
                        A faith healer?  Are you retarded?

                                 KAYLIE
                        You don’t get it!  The goiter was 
                        just... gone.  If he can do that, 
                        can’t he get me pregnant?

                                 BROOKE
                        Sure if by “faith healing” you mean 
                        blowing a load in your side-smile.

           Kaylie makes a face.  In the distance, a familiar SCREAM.  
           Behind them, WESLEY FALLS BACKWARDS INTO THE OCEAN.  

           INT. OCEAN - NIGHT

           Wesley SURFACES, sputtering and choking out water.  

           The bonfire revelers RUSH OVER TO HELP, as does Huck.  

                                 HUCK
                        Wesley, give me your hand.

                                 WESLEY
                        Not a fucking chance.  

           Huck takes off his shirt and throws it to her.  It lands in 
           the water and washes away.  Debbie approaches, Nolan in tow.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        Nolan, tell her.

                                 NOLAN
                        I can’t keep seeing you.  

                                 WESLEY
                        We’re not seeing each other!  And 
                        for the record?  You have to be in 
                        your forties to be a cougar!

                                 DEBBIE
                        No, you just have to be an older 
                        woman who thinks the fuzzy scrotum 
                        of a fourteen year old is erotic!  
                        And if I see you near Nolan again, 
                        I will cut your face!
           EXT. STONE PATHS - LATER

           Ramon drives Kaylie, Brooke and a shivering Wesley to their 
           room.  They hop out, head inside.  Ramon calls after Wesley. 

                                 RAMON
                        Señora, you left your sweater.

                                 WESLEY
                        (automatically now)
                        I’m not married.

                                 RAMON
                        Señora does not just mean married.  
                        It also means “woman of a certain 
                        age.”

           Wesley breaks into heaving, unexpected sobs.  Ramon hugs her.

           EXT. CASITA BALCONY - NEXT MORNING

           A TROPICAL BIRD perches on a tree, SQUAWKING.  Wesley sits, 
           drinking black coffee and willing the bird to die.  She reads 
           a newspaper.  The headline reads:  BANDITOS ROBAR OTRA VEZ.  
           Brooke and Kaylie open the door, and walk on the patio.  

                                 KAYLIE
                        Good morning, sunshine!  We were 
                        wondering when you’d wake up.  

                                 WESLEY
                        That bird needs to be fried in a 
                        pan of shut the fuck up.

                                 BROOKE
                        Someone’s not getting in the 
                        vacation spirit.

                                 WESLEY
                        Someone flashed forty hotel guests 
                        after six days of emotional eating.  

           The bird SQUAWKS louder.  Wesley SHAKES HER FORK, wildly.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Die!

           The bird flies away.  Wesley slumps in her chair.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        What the hell have I become?  I’m 
                        stalking Jared!  It’s pathetic.  
                                 KAYLIE
                        Love takes work, Wes.  Sometimes 
                        that work involves behavior that 
                        would look creepy from a distance, 
                        but is, in fact, totally necessary.  

                                 BROOKE
                        Let’s take the morning off and do 
                        something that doesn’t require any 
                        brainpower.  People get their best 
                        ideas when they’re concentrating on 
                        something mechanical and mindless.

                                 KAYLIE
                        Like washing dishes or giving head.

                                 WESLEY
                        If that were true, I’d have 
                        invented the iPod in high school.

           EXT. INFINITY POOL - DAY

           Wesley, Kaylie and CHILDREN play in the pool.  Brooke guzzles 
           a Daiquiri at the swim-up bar and looks on with disgust.  

           Suddenly, a LOOMING SHADOW blocks Wesley’s sun.  She turns -- 
           Quintano stands over her.  

                                 QUINTANO
                        I see you’ve recovered from last 
                        night’s hijinks?  

                                 WESLEY
                        You heard?

                                 QUINTANO
                        There were a few complaints.

                                 WESLEY
                        Any requests for my phone number?  

                                 QUINTANO
                        It would be best if you stepped out 
                        of the pool.

                                 WESLEY
                        What?  Why?

           Quintano gestures to Debbie, rubbing sunblock onto Nolan.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Nothing happened with her kid!  
                                 QUINTANO
                        You say tomato, she says statutory 
                        rape.

           An annoyed Wesley gets out of the pool and towels off.  Huck 
           appears, clad in a wetsuit.  He smiles at Wesley.

                                 HUCK
                        Morning.

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh you think because you’ve seen me 
                        naked we’re friends?  

                                 HUCK
                        Kind of.  So can we--

                                 WESLEY
                        No.

                                 HUCK
                        Maybe later then.  
                        (to Quintano)
                        I forgot my snorkel and I don’t 
                        have a key.  You got a master?

           Quintano takes a keychain off his neck and hands it to him.  
           Huck walks off.  Wesley watches him go, having a brainstorm.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Funny, we were thinking of going 
                        scuba diving too.  

                                 QUINTANO
                        Our boat is full.

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh, too bad.  I guess I’ll just 
                        stay here and molest small boys.

           She smiles disarmingly.  Quintano thinks about it.

                                 QUINTANO
                        Have you been on many dives?

                                 WESLEY
                        Define “many.”

                                 QUINTANO
                        I ask because it’s an advanced 
                        group.  I’ll be taking everyone to 
                        one hundred feet. 
                                 WESLEY
                        Don’t you work the front desk?

                                 QUINTANO
                        I am, as you might say, a Jacinto 
                        of All Trades.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Well, I’m quite comfortable in the 
                        ocean.  I’m, like, half-carp. 

                                 QUINTANO
                        The carp is a fresh-water fish.

                                 WESLEY
                        And the currency of Sri Lanka is a 
                        rupee.  

                                 QUINTANO
                        Excuse me?

                                 WESLEY
                        Sorry, I thought we were making 
                        annoying and irrelevant statements.

                                 QUINTANO
                        Ha.  We leave in ten minutes.  

           Quintano walks off.  Wesley walks over to Kaylie and Brooke.

                                 WESLEY
                        Didn’t you guys learn to scuba on 
                        that Australia trip?

                                 BROOKE
                        Yeah... why?

                                 WESLEY
                        Quintano has a master key.  We can 
                        snag it on the dive, so I can use 
                        it to get into Jared’s room.  

                                 KAYLIE
                        But you don’t know how to dive.

                                 WESLEY
                        I don’t have to know -- I’ll just 
                        fake a stomach ache and lay out 
                        while you guys do your thing.

                        I don’t know if I’m comfortable 
                        being on a boat with you.

                        I still remember your panic attack 
                        on the Senior Cruise.  “The ocean 
                        is scary!  The ocean is too blue 
                        and too unstable!”

                                 WESLEY
                        Clearly I’ve matured since then.

           EXT. DIVE BOAT - MOMENTS LATER

           Wesley SCREAMS, terrified, and latches onto Kaylie’s arm.  We 
           pull back and realize its all smooth sailing.  Brooke sighs.  

           EXT. DIVE BOAT - LATER

           DIVERS put on WET SUITS, SCUBA MASKS, and FINS.  

           Wesley’s Blackberry BUZZES.  She reads it.  TEXT:  “Jared 
           again.  May be leaving Sun. am now.  Stay tuned.”  

           Wesley’s anxiety grows.  Huck approaches.  She ignores him, 
           and tries to spy on Quintano.  

                                 HUCK
                        Hey.

                                 WESLEY
                        You’re relentless.  Fine.  Explain.

                                 HUCK
                        I was overwhelmed, I thought you 
                        were coming on strong, and I’m not 
                        in that head-space.  That said, I’m 
                        sure I overreacted.   I’ve had this 
                        bad situation with my love life--

           Wesley sees that Quintano isn’t stashing his key at all -- 
           he’s transferring it to a chain around his neck.  Oh oh.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Why are men such pussies?  Get.  
                        Over.  It.  

           Wesley walks to where Kaylie and Brooke perform an expert 
           buddy check on each other’s weight belts, releases and air. 

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Quintano’s wearing the key around 
                        his neck.  What do we do now?

                                 KAYLIE
                        Wait til he’s distracted by a 
                        school of jackfish and cut it off.
           Kaylie pulls a small knife out of her dive console and 
           demonstrates.

                                 BROOKE
                        How do you know what a jackfish is? 

           Kaylie points to a T-shirt on another diver.  It says, “You 
           don’t know jackfish til you dive in Mexico!”  

           Quintano approaches, now wearing a miniscule Speedo and zinc 
           oxide smeared all over his face.  He leers at Brooke.

                        Nice marble bag.

                        Nice turn of phrase.  

           He smiles lustily, then holds up his tube of zinc.

                                 QUINTANO (CONT’D)
                        May I zinc your face?

                        deformity?  Club foot, cystic acne,

           Brooke shakes her head no.  Quintano shrugs, turns to Wesley.

                        Why aren’t you in your wetsuit?

                                 WESLEY
                        I’m not feeling great, I’ll chill 
                        up here. Maybe snorkel with Carlos.

           CARLOS, the smarmy molesting boat captain, winks at her, then  
           pantomimes having sex.  Wesley gives him a dirty look.  

                                 QUINTANO
                        Toby needs a scuba buddy.

                                 WESLEY
                        I’m menstruating.

                        Toby has stage three liver cancer.  
                        He wins. 
           TOBY, 80s, elderly and gray and helpless, hobbles over.

                        Is this my scuba pal?  I sure hope 
                        so.  I’ve been dreaming about 
                        seeing some sting rays.

                                 QUINTANO
                        This will probably be the last 
                        vacation Toby ever takes.

           INT. DIVE BOAT - LATER

           Kaylie and Brooke wedge a terrified Wesley into her too-small 
           wetsuit.  They demonstrate all the equipment and zip her up.

                                 KAYLIE
                        And shark attacks are much rarer 
                        than you realize, if that’s what 
                        you’re worried about.

                                 WESLEY
                        I wasn’t!  Until now!

           Brooke shakes her head.  Kaylie tries to fix the situation.

                                 KAYLIE
                        Oh come on.  Would we let you get 
                        in there if there were sharks?  Do 
                        you know how hard it would be to 
                        find a husband with a missing limb?

           Brooke smacks Kaylie on the back of the head.

                        Stop!  Talking!  

           Toby hobbles up to Wesley.  
                                 TOBY
                        How’s it going, friend?  Thanks for 
                        doing an old man one last favor.

           The boat stops.  Toby falls into Wesley’s arms.

                        Fear is your enemy in the water, 
                        Wesley.  Pull it together.

           EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

           Wesley and Toby hold hands and jump in.  She panics.

                                 WESLEY
                        I CAN’T BREATHE!!!!!!!

           She notices that she’s forgotten to put her regulator in her 
           mouth.  Sneaks it in before anyone notices her freak-out.  

           EXT. OCEAN FLOOR - LATER

           The group, led by Quintano, swims toward a shipwrecked 
           Spanish galleon, an enormous, coral-crusted ship now fused to 
           the ocean floor.  

           Exotic fish weave in and out of the ship.  Toby zips through 
           the ocean, showing off his expert scuba maneuvers.  

           He gestures at his watch, irritated, then motions for Wesley 
           to move faster and follow him inside the boat.  

           She shakes her head no.  He swims off, furious.  

           Kaylie and Brooke approach.  Kaylie gets out her dive knife.  
           Brooke gestures toward Huck, telling Wesley to distract him.

           Wesley swims over to Huck, who is watching eagle rays.  He 
           makes a gesture to her, which she recognizes as sign 
           language.  She signs back, surprised.  We see subtitles:

                                 HUCK
                        You know ASL?

                                 WESLEY
                        Took it to fulfill a language 
                        requirement in college.  You?

                                 HUCK
                        My first girlfriend was deaf.

                                 WESLEY
                        Is she the one who broke your 
                        spirit?
                                 HUCK
                        Nah.  I was just using her for the 
                        parking spots.

           Wesley laughs, despite herself.  Behind them, Kaylie and 
           Brooke swim over to Quintano.  Kaylie points out stingrays 
           and makes exaggerated “Isn’t this so exciting??” faces.  

           Brooke sneaks up behind Quintano, pulls out a dive knife, 
           tries to fish the keychain out of the back of his wetsuit.  

           Meanwhile, Huck and Wesley continue to sign.

                                 HUCK (CONT’D)
                        Why are you so chatty?

                                 WESLEY
                        My scuba buddy abandoned me and I’m 
                        scared of being devoured by snakes.

                                 HUCK
                        I see.  Desperate times...  

           INT. SPANISH GALLEON - CONTINUOUS

           Wesley follows Huck through the ship’s many rooms.  For a 
           minute, she forgets why she’s here and enjoys herself. She 
           finds something cool, turns around to show it to Huck, and 
           finds him FACE TO FACE WITH A WOLF EEL.  

           The wolf eel’s mouth snaps, looking like it’s about to bite 
           Huck’s hand off.  

           Wesley SCREAMS, though all we see are AIR BUBBLES COMING OUT 
           OF HER MOUTH.  

           The wolf eel opens his mouth even further...  then eats 
           something off of Huck’s dive knife.  

           Huck grabs Wesley’s arm and stops her from swimming off.  He 
           demonstrates -- taking his dive knife and cutting a sea 
           urchin in half, then hand feeding the wolf eel.   Wesley 
           watches, simultaneously freaked out and fascinated.  

           A few more wolf eels swim up to Huck and Wesley. Huck hands 
           Wesley his knife and a sea urchin, and she manages to feed 
           the wolf eel.  She’s excited -- it’s all pretty cool.  

           They swim through the boat, coming out the other side, where 
           Toby is feeding some MORAY EELS.  He, however, is feeding 
           them not sea urchins, but HOT DOGS.  Huck frowns.   

                                 HUCK
                        What a douche.  I’ll be right back.
                                 WESLEY
                        No!  He has cancer!

           Toby throws more hot dogs at the eels, who attack them with 
           gusto.  Wesley waves to Toby, attracting the attention of the 
           moray eels.  

           MORAY EELS’ POV: Wesley’s FINGERS... which look exactly like 
           the hot dogs.  

           The eels approach. Huck grabs her arm, tries to get her to 
           swim away.  Wesley shakes him off her.  He signs.

                                 HUCK
                        They’re going to eat your fingers.

           Wesley’s eyes open wide.  She panics -- ALL THE EELS ARE 
           CONVERGING ON HER!  

           She swims away as fast as she can, back through the ship.  
           Huck follows her.  Wesley ascends, way too quickly.  Huck 
           tries to stop her, but she shakes him off.  

           She swims past Kaylie and Quintano, who check out fishlife, 
           and past Brooke, who holds up the master key, triumphant.

           Wesley is in too much of a panic to notice.  Brooke shakes 
           the key at her, trying to get her attention.  

           CHOMP!  A moray eel, still hot on Wesley’s blood trail, 
           mistakes the key for food and snatches it in it’s mouth. 

           EXT. DIVE BOAT - MOMENTS LATER

           Wesley surfaces, breathing heavily, and climbs on the boat.  
           She unzips her wetsuit, not noticing that her bikini top’s 
           come off in the process.  Carlos, the pervy driver, winks. 
           She smiles weakly, then throws up all over his legs.

           EXT. BEACH - LATER

           Debbie lays out.  Nolan floats on a boogie board staring at 
           girls.  The dive boat reaches shore.  Everyone walks off.

                                 HUCK
                        That was stupid, going up so fast.    
                        You could have gotten the bends.  

                                 QUINTANO
                        She still might have them.  
                        Sometimes people don’t develop 
                        symptoms until a few days later.  
           Quintano seems way too pleased to be saying this.  Wesley 
           hops off the boat, starts walking away from the ocean.   

                                 WESLEY
                        I’m totally fine.  I don’t know why 
                        everyone’s making such a big deal.  

           Suddenly, her eyes roll back into her head.  THUMP!  She 
           passes out on the sand.  

           Everyone gathers around Wesley, trying to wake her up.  
           Quintano SMACKS her a little too hard.  Nolan runs over.

                                 NOLAN
                        Stand back, everyone!  I learned 
                        CPR at sleepaway camp!

                                 BROOKE
                        I don’t think that’s necessary--

           Nolan gives Wesley mouth to mouth.  Debbie sees what appears 
           to be Nolan and Wesley making out.  She SCREAMS!  Wesley 
           opens her eyes, sees Nolan on top of her. She pushes him off.

                                 NOLAN
                        Hey!  I’m saving your life! 

                                 WESLEY
                        I’m not dying, you little perv!  
                        I’m just a little woozy...

           CRACK!  As Debbie’s fist connects with Wesley’s face.  Wesley 
           lands in the sand, again.  She moans.  Nolan freaks out.

                                 NOLAN
                        Fucking A, Mom!  Why are you always 
                        all up in my shit?!

                                 DEBBIE
                        Nolan Ryan Phillipe!  Watch your 
                        mouth!

           Nolan shoves past her.  Debbie loses her footing, twisting 
           her ankle in the sand.  She falls, landing with a CRUNCH!

           INT. RESORT INFIRMARY - DAY

           Wesley and Debbie lay on side-by-side cots, each with an ice 
           pack, Wesley’s on her head, Debbie’s on her foot.  Awkward... 

                                 DEBBIE
                        I’m sorry.
                                 WESLEY
                        For punching me?  Or calling me a 
                        pedophile?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Nolan is my baby, okay?  I’m not 
                        ready to see him kissing a woman. 

                                 WESLEY
                        He wasn’t kissing me.  And if you 
                        don’t leave that kid alone, he’s 
                        gonna spend the rest of his life 
                        playing out all that pent up anger 
                        on a series of psycho girlfriends 
                        who remind him of his mother. 

                                 DEBBIE
                        You in therapy too?

                                 WESLEY
                        Like you wouldn’t believe.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I know I’m nuts.  Trust me.  It’s 
                        what drove my husband away.  
                        Started with me telling him he 
                        can’t play golf on Sundays... And 
                        ended with him and his stripper 
                        girlfriend robbing my mom’s house 
                        to subsidize their OxyContin habit.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh, Debbie.  It sounds like he had 
                        his own problems.

                                 DEBBIE
                        You seem nice.  I guess if Nolan 
                        has to be with someone...

                                 WESLEY
                        Do you want to know why I was in 
                        your son’s room?  I was trying to 
                        break into the room below his, 
                        where a guy I’ve been on six dates 
                        with is staying so I could erase a 
                        raving-kook email I sent him when I 
                        thought he was blowing me off.  Oh, 
                        and I flew here to do it.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        Wow!  You’re a real wackjob.
                                 WESLEY
                        I’m aware, thanks.  And don’t you 
                        feel better about yourself now?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Kinda.  Yeah. 

           Debbie gestures at Wesley’s black eye.

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        How can I make all this up to you?

                                 WESLEY
                        Did your husband ever give you any 
                        tips on breaking and entering?

           INT. INFINITY POOL - DAY

           Bill, the man earlier rejected by Brooke, drinks a Daiquiri 
           at the swim up bar.  Goiter Guy, now all handsome and goiter-
           less, swims up next to him.  Smiles lasciviously.  

                                 GOITER GUY
                        Hi there.

                                 BILL
                        (freaked out)
                        No!  No!  Automatic out!

           Goiter Guy swims off, hurt.  Nearby, Kaylie and Brooke talk 
           to Elderly Man Formerly In A Wheelchair.  

                                 MAN FORMERLY IN A WHEELCHAIR
                        And then, Jose De Deus’s physical 
                        body was entered by the spirit of a 
                        fifteenth century Spanish nobleman.  
                        He lay his hands upon my legs and 
                        softly said, sadness be gone.  
                        Moments later, I walked for the 
                        first time in fifteen years.  

                                 KAYLIE
                        Amazing! 

                                 BROOKE
                        Amazing that anyone believes this 
                        kaka.  

                                 KAYLIE
                        Sir, can your bus take us to Jose 
                        De Deus’s woodside palapa?
                                 MAN FORMERLY IN A WHEELCHAIR
                        No, we’re traveling on to Chiapas, 
                        to see the Virgin Mary.  Her face 
                        has appeared in a tortilla.  

                                 BROOKE
                        Wowzers.  I hope no one eats her.

           INT. NOLAN’S ROOM/EXT. NOLAN’S BALCONY - DAY

           Debbie and Wesley sit on the floor, tying several pairs of 
           Nolan’s jeans together, and creating a makeshift rope.  We 
           notice Wesley absentmindedly rubbing her arm.

                                 DEBBIE
                        So if Jared knew what you were 
                        doing here, he’d flip out?

                                 WESLEY
                        Definitely.  He’s not big on 
                        deviant behavior.

                                 DEBBIE
                        But when you’re with him, do you 
                        feel safe?  Like are you 
                        comfortable being exactly who you 
                        are?

                                 WESLEY
                        Of course not.  I’m a festering 
                        mound of insecurity and turmoil.    

           Debbie grabs the “rope.”  They walk onto the balcony.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        But don’t you want to find someone 
                        who loves all of you? Even the bad.

                                 WESLEY
                        I’d rather find someone who makes 
                        the bad go away.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        (yearning)
                        Like Clay Aiken.

                                 WESLEY
                        No, not like Clay Aiken.

           Debbie looks wounded, so Wesley relents.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Like Nate.  On Oprah.
                                 DEBBIE
                        Nate’s gay. 

                                 WESLEY
                        And Clay is...  never mind.  

           Debbie looks around -- coast clear -- then dangles one end of 
           the jean rope off of the balcony.  She turns to Wesley.

                                 DEBBIE
                        And you’re not starting to feel at 
                        all... pathetic?   

                                 WESLEY
                        Well, of course.  But the thing is, 
                        if Jared and I end up together, 
                        this whole part of my life will be 
                        over and I’ll never have to worry 
                        about this stuff again.  Think of 
                        me as one of those movie cops who’s 
                        three days away from retirement and 
                        has to finish one last job. 

                                 DEBBIE
                        Be careful. This is how restraining 
                        orders are born.  Trust me, I know.

           Wesley hoists herself over the balcony wall.  She climbs down 
           the jean-rope, lowering herself one flight down.  

           Wesley tries to SWING onto Jared’s balcony.  Debbie’s hold on 
           the rope LOOSENS.  Wesley SLAMS into Jared’s balcony wall.  

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry!  This is hard! 

           Debbie pulls the rope and Wesley up a bit.  Wesley swings 
           wildly, then CRASH LANDS ON JARED’S BALCONY with a THUD.

           EXT. JARED’S BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

           Debbie quickly pulls up the jean rope and hurries back in. 

           Wesley tries to open the sliding glass doors.  Locked.  She 
           notices a SMALL SPACE WHERE THE DOORS MEET.  Looks around for 
           something to WEDGE THE DOORS APART.  Nothing.

                                 HUCK (O.S.)
                        Wesley?

           Wesley looks over the balcony.  Three stories down is Huck.  
           Of course.  
                                 HUCK (CONT’D)
                        How’s the eye?

                                 WESLEY
                        Could you get me a knife?

                                 HUCK
                        What?

                                 WESLEY
                        A knife!  I’m locked out of my room 
                        and I need to wedge my way in!

                                 HUCK
                        I’ll get a manager!

                                 WESLEY
                        No!  They already think I’m crazy!

                                 HUCK
                        Who cares?  You’re paying them.

                                 WESLEY
                        HUCK!

                                 HUCK
                        Okay, okay.  I’ll be back soon.  

           He leaves.  Wesley gets an idea.  Tries to lift either door 
           off its tracks.  Doesn’t work.  She attempts to FORCE THE 
           HANDLES DOWN. She gets a tiny bit of leverage but not enough.  

           She picks up an URN, tries to BREAK THE LOCK WITH IT.  Nope.  
           Frustrated, she DROPS THE URN.  It lands on her TOE.  

           SHE YELPS.  The PERSON IN THE CASITA TO THE RIGHT comes out 
           on their balcony, having heard the noise.  Wesley DROPS TO 
           THE GROUND, not breathing.  Her casita neighbor goes back in.

           DOWN BELOW, Huck returns with a steak knife.  He looks at it, 
           then back up at the balcony, not sure what to do.  

                                 WESLEY
                        (leaning over the balcony)
                        Throw it.  

                                 HUCK
                        I don’t think that’s safe.

                                 WESLEY
                        Just do it!  Hurry up!

           Huck walks back, and aims the KNIFE AT WESLEY.  It HURTLES 
           TOWARD HER.  She screams and ducks.  IT HITS THE DOOR.  
           Wesley picks it up and uses it to pry open the doors.  She 
           leans over the balcony and waves at Huck with the knife. 

           Huck waves back, confused but strangely charmed by her.  

           INT. JARED’S (REAL) CASITA, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The laptop sit open on the coffee table.  Wesley walks over 
           to it, sits down.  Jared’s email program is open.  

           She SCROLLS THROUGH THE EMAILS AND FINDS HER’S.  Highlights 
           it.  Presses DELETE.  And just like that... IT’S ALL OVER.

           CREAK!  The door to the room opens.  It’s a MAID, HERE TO 
           TURN DOWN THE BED.  

           Wesley RUNS INTO THE CLOSET.  Hides among Jared’s suits.  
           Suddenly, the noise of someone APPROACHING THE CLOSET.  

           The maid opens the closet, throws something in, and closes 
           it, without seeing Wesley.  LEAVES JARED’S CASITA.

           Oh oh.  Wesley realizes that the closet doesn’t have a 
           doorknob on the inside.  She’s trapped!  Wesley BANGS AND 
           PUSHES ON THE CLOSET DOOR, having a full-on MELTDOWN.  

           CREAK!  The maid re-enters, opens the closet door and grabs a 
           handful of hangers.  Wesley wedges her shirt-sleeve into the 
           crack of the door, keeping it open.  The maid leaves.  

           Wesley exhales, exits the closet, goes back over to the 
           computer, intending to close it.  Something on the screen 
           catches her eye.  Saved email folders:  “CONSTRUCTION.”  
           “DAD’S SURGERY.”  Then... the motherlode:  “PERSONAL.”  

           She stares at the screen, knowing she shouldn’t snoop.  
           Closes the computer with an emphatic thump.   

           As Wesley walks toward the door, she notices an extra key to 
           the room.  She snags it, then walks out.  

           A beat.  Then... Wesley walks back in and grabs the computer.

           INT. SPA - DAY

           Quintano and Huck, both wearing fluffy bathrobes, are in the 
           waiting area, sitting in cozy spa chairs.  They read US 
           Weekly and drink cucumber water.

                                 HUCK
                        I can’t believe I let you talk me 
                        into this. 
                                 QUINTANO
                        Relax.  It’s a Sportsman’s facial.

                                 HUCK
                        A sportsmen’s facial?  Like Tom 
                        Brady teabagging Peyton Manning? 

           Quintano rolls his eyes and flips a page in his magazine.  
           Huck hits a button on his chair, which elevates his legs.

                                 HUCK (CONT’D)
                        Hey, so how about Wesley all nuded- 
                        up the other night?

                                 QUINTANO
                        That one’s... intense.

                                 HUCK
                        She’s got a rocket body on her 
                        though, right?

                                 QUINTANO
                        Don’t do it.

                                 HUCK
                        Don’t do what?

                                 QUINTANO
                        First one back should be easy.  
                        Uncomplicated.  Señora’s ready to 
                        snap. 

                                 HUCK
                        Señorita.  Look, easy’s boring.  
                        And it’s my vacation.  Sitting 
                        around, commando in a robe, 
                        drinking cucumber juice isn’t what 
                        I came to Mexico for.   

           EXT. BLUE PARROT BEACH BAR - LATER

           Wesley sits at a table, an iced tea in hand, Jared’s computer 
           open in front of her.  Brooke and Kaylie approach.

                                 KAYLIE
                        Nice work, little felon!  I never 
                        stopped believing in you.  

                                 BROOKE
                        Are you reading Jared’s stuff?

                                 WESLEY
                        I don’t know what happened to me.  
                        It was this involuntary reflex.

                        when black people touch her.  

                                 KAYLIE
                        Any crazy ex emails?  Or naked

                        Ew, no.  He’s not like that.

                        Jared doesn’t follow the market... 

           They share a look.  Wesley opens the computer as her phone 
           RINGS.  She looks at CALLER ID -- BLOCKED CALL.  Answers.

                                 JARED (OVER PHONE)
                        Me again.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Jared?  Hi!  How are you?  

           Wesley slams the computer shut, as if Jared can see her.

                                 JARED
                        Great!  The doctors said they’ve 
                        never seen bones heal this fast.  

                                 WESLEY
                        You’re a model patient!  Not that 
                        I’m surprised.  

           Wesley hears a BUZZING SOUND over the phone.  

                                 JARED
                        Sorry about the buzzsaw.  They’re 
                        giving me new casts for the flight.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Tomorrow morning, right?

                                 JARED
                        Nope!  Got moved up again.  Could 
                        you pick me up from LAX at 5:30?  

                                 WESLEY
                        5:30 as in four hours from now?!  
                                 JARED
                        Seven hours.  Unless you’re on 
                        Mexico time for some reason.

                                 WESLEY
                        (babbling)
                        Yeah, wouldn’t that be funny, if I 
                        came to Mexico to surprise you?

                                 JARED
                        It would be scary.  Hold a second.

                        (back to Wesley)
                        Sorry.  That was Pilar.

                                 WESLEY
                        Who’s Pilar?

                                 JARED
                        My nurse.  Really sweet girl.  She 
                        volunteered to go to the hotel and 
                        pick up my stuff and she’s lost. 

                                 WESLEY
                        (says it to the room)
                        She’s going to your hotel?  Right 
                        now?  As in... right now? 

           The girls all panic. 

                                 JARED
                        Yeah.  Why? 

                                 WESLEY
                        No reason.  So, I’d love to pick 
                        you up at the airport.

                        Wear something easily removable.  

           Wesley smiles to herself and hangs up the phone.
                                 WESLEY
                        Oh god.

           EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - DAY

           Wesley runs, propelled by the sheer force of her own anxiety, 
           a cell phone to her ear.  Kaylie and Brooke follow her.  

                                 WESLEY 
                        There’s only one seat left.

                        He’s comfortable letting me see him 
                        in a vulnerable state.  He’s a 
                        wounded bird, and he needs someone 
                        to fix his broken wing.  And he 
                        chose me.  That means...

           They enter to find TOBY EXITING THE BEDROOM, carrying Jared’s 
           watch, passport and bags of clothes.  Wesley GASPS.

                                 WESLEY
                        Toby?  What are you doing in here?

           Toby makes a run for the window.  Brooke and Kaylie jump on 
           him.  Toby hits Brooke with his bag, shakes Kaylie off his 
           back.  Wesley leaps to action, SMACKING Toby on the head with 
           the laptop computer.  He goes down.  The girls SCREAM. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

           Two fashion-forward Federales with heavily shellacked hair, 
           EMILIO and RAUL, interrogate Wesley, Kaylie and Brooke.

                        Señor Toby claims you, not he, are 
                        the hotel banditos.  He says he 
                        entered the room because he heard 
                        the noise of a kitten in distress.

                        The hotel manager, Quintano Roos,

                        location of Señor Grayson’s room 
                        when you checked in.  Now you come 
                        across a robbery in that very room?

                        Perhaps Señor Grayson will be able 
                        to shed some light on this matter.

                                 WESLEY
                        Don’t call him!  I’ll explain 
                        everything.  Okay, have you ever 
                        heard the term “biological clock”--

           Brooke KICKS Wesley under the table.  A KNOCK on the door.  
           Raul opens it.  Huck stands outside, holding a beach bag.  

                                 HUCK
                        Hola -- these girls dropped a bag 
                        full of tight-fitting Guess jeans 
                        and irregular Polo shirts on the 
                        way into the station.

           EXT. POLICE STATION, PRESS CONFERENCE - AFTERNOON

           FLASH!  A PHOTOGRAPHER takes pictures of the girls shaking 
           hands with Emilio and Raul, who are wearing their new outfits 
           - CROTCH-HUGGING JEANS AND DOUBLED POLOS WITH THE COLLARS UP. 

           Raul hands Wesley a CERTIFICATE OF APPRECIATION for capturing 
           the hotel bandito.  A LARGE CROWD, including Huck, claps.  
           Brooke and Kaylie speak sotto to Wesley.

                        He just feels like a jerk.  
                        Rightly, I might add.

                                 BROOKE
                        Try not to fuck him right away.

           The press conference ends.  Huck walks up to Wesley.  

                                 HUCK
                        And the wheels of justice keep 
                        turning...

                                 WESLEY
                        Hey.  Thank you.  How did you even 
                        know how to do that?

                                 HUCK
                        My ex and I did a month-long road-
                        trip around Mexico one year.

                                 HUCK (CONT'D)
                        Clothing bribes were a good way to 
                        get past the military roadblocks, 
                        so I figured I’d try.

                                 WESLEY
                        That was really nice of you.  So...  

                                 HUCK
                        You need a ride back to the hotel?

                                 WESLEY
                        I’m going straight to the airport.  
                        Flying home to see my boyfriend.  

           Wesley walks off.  He follows.  Kaylie and Brooke hang back. 

                                 HUCK
                        Boyfriend?  Wow.  You work quickly. 

                                 WESLEY
                        That’s what happens when you give 
                        someone more than ten seconds at a 
                        dinner table. You let the magic in. 

           She immediately regrets saying something so stupid.

                                 HUCK
                        Well, good for you.  Glad it all 
                        worked out.  Magic, huh?   

                                 WESLEY
                        It’s a Mexican expression.  Se te 
                        pasaron las copas, Señorita.  

                                 HUCK
                        That means, “Lady, you’re drunk.” 

                                 WESLEY
                        Semantics. 

                                 HUCK
                        Let me take you to the airport.  
                        This looks like a real clusterfuck.

           He gestures to the cab stand, which they’ve reached.  The 
           tourists are so fat that they can only fit two per cab.  And 
           they move slowly.  Wesley notices an oncoming bus.  

                                 WESLEY
                        I’ll just take the bus.

           The bus slows down to a stop.  It is full of LIVESTOCK.   
                                 HUCK
                        Goats carry encephalitis, Norwalk 
                        virus, Lyme disease.

           Wesley ignores him. A WOMAN boards with a basket of CHICKENS. 

                                 HUCK (CONT’D)
                        And chickens?  Forget it.  E. coli, 
                        salmonella...

                                 WESLEY
                        Okay, okay.  I get it.  We’ll take 
                        the ride.  

           Wesley looks around - Kaylie and Brooke duck down a side 
           street, waving and laughing.  Huck waves back.  Wesley sighs.

           INT. HUCK’S RENTED JEEP - AFTERNOON

           Huck drives.  Wesley scratches her legs, checks her watch.

                                 HUCK
                        Are you sure you should be flying?  

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh god, you too?  I’m fine.

                                 HUCK
                        Really?  Because itching is one of 
                        the first signs of decompression 
                        sickness.  Or scabies.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Do you always drive this slowly?  
                        No wonder it took you and your ex a 
                        month to make it around Mexico.

                                 HUCK
                        I’m not sure you get the point of a 
                        road trip.  

                                 WESLEY
                        They invented airplanes for a 
                        reason.  And don’t tell me I’m 
                        missing out on the world’s biggest 
                        ball of twine.  

                                 HUCK
                        It’s actually amazing.  Check it 
                        out next time you’re in Darwin, 
                        Minnesota.  

           Wesley rolls her eyes.  Loser.  She starts to rub her legs.  
                                 HUCK (CONT’D)
                        You’re getting the bends, Wesley.  
                        You need to go to one of those 
                        hyperbaric chambers.  Your 
                        boyfriend will understand.

                                 WESLEY
                        Trust me, he won’t. 

                                 HUCK
                        Look, he knows you, he’ll know how 
                        much you want to be there.

                                 WESLEY
                        It’s complicated, okay?

           Wesley rubs harder.  Huck exits the highway.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Hey!  What are you doing?

                                 HUCK
                        I can’t take you to the airport.  
                        It’s not right.  

                                 WESLEY
                        It’s none of your business!  

                                 HUCK
                        Someone has to take care of you.  

                                 WESLEY
                        What is this, 1950?  I can take 
                        care of myself.

                                 HUCK
                        Obviously not.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Turn the car around. 

                                 HUCK
                        No.

                                 WESLEY
                        Do it!

                                 HUCK
                        No.

                                 WESLEY
                        Fine!
           She grabs the wheel, TURNING IT ALL THE WAY AROUND.  SCREECH!  
           The Jeep does a U-TURN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET AND STOPS.

                                 HUCK
                        What the hell are you doing?    

           CRASH!!!  As an AMBULANCE SMASHES INTO THE FRONT RIGHT SIDE 
           OF THEIR CAR.  They careen across the intersection.   

           EXT. INTERSECTION - MOMENTS LATER

           The rental car is drivable but smashed up; the ambulance has 
           a flat tire and a mangled bumper.  A miraculously uninjured 
           Wesley and Huck climb out of the Jeep to inspect the damage.

                                 WESLEY
                        -such a control freak fuckhead--

                                 HUCK
                        Just relax.  

                                 WESLEY
                        The worst thing you can tell a 
                        stressed-out person is to “relax!”

           Wesley crosses her arms, in a huff.  Two paramedics (who we 
           might recognize from page 15) appear alongside the Jeep, 
           surveying the damage.  One touches the bruised fender.

                                 PARAMEDIC 1
                        I got a cousin who can pound this 
                        right out for you.

                                 PARAMEDIC 2
                        Maybe throw on some chrome rims.

           The guys examine the damage.  Wesley digs through her wallet.

                                 WESLEY
                        I have four hundred American 
                        dollars.  Will that cover the 
                        damage to your vehicle?

                                 HUCK
                        This is a rental.  I have to wait 
                        for the police.  

                                 PARAMEDIC 1
                        He is right, Señora.  He will get 
                        in big trouble if he leave now.  

                                 WESLEY
                        But I have to get to the airport.
           A paramedic gestures to the unseen patient in the ambulance.

                                 PARAMEDIC 1
                        Si, so does he.  But it is not 
                        gonna happen today.

                                 WESLEY
                        You have a patient in there?  

                                 PARAMEDIC 2
                        Si, un Americano.  Two broken legs.  

                                 PARAMEDIC 1
                        Better than three! 

           The paramedics cackle Cheech & Chong-style.  

           The ambulance’s back doors open.  Pilar wheels out a gurney -- 
           ON WHICH IS JARED - casts on both legs and arms.  

           Wesley’s eyes might as well fall out of their sockets.  

                                 PILAR
                        Here you go, Señor Grayson, you no 
                        claustrophobic no more.  

           Pilar flips her lustrous hair to the side, helping him up.  
           She touches him a little too intimately for Wesley’s taste.

                                 JARED
                        Gracias, Pilar.  Can you unstrap 
                        me?  Might as well try out my new 
                        best friends.

           He indicates the crutches.  Pilar lets out a sexy, throaty 
           laugh and unstraps Jared.  He attempts to balance.  

           Wesley runs to the front of the ambulance, where Jared can’t 
           see her, making desperate eye contact with a baffled Huck.  

                                 JARED (CONT’D)
                        Hey there.  Could I borrow your 
                        phone for a second?  Pilar’s cell 
                        doesn’t get a signal and I need to 
                        let my friend know I won’t be 
                        making my flight.   

           From behind the ambulance, Wesley reacts.  Friend?  Friend?!

                                 HUCK
                        Sure.  Want me to dial for you?

                                 JARED
                        Yes, please.  323 995 7105.  
           Huck dials the numbers onto his phone.  The name “Wesley 
           Robbins” comes up -- Huck has her programmed in.  

           Huck looks at the car -- Wesley’s phone is on the front seat.  
           If he dials her number, it will ring and give her away.

                                 HUCK
                        Sorry man, I just remembered I 
                        never got the Sim card--  

                                 JARED
                        You don’t need it in Mexico--

           Jared reaches for the phone.  Huck steps back, slightly.  

                                 HUCK
                        I wanted to program my Tivo over 
                        the phone yesterday.  It’s amazing 
                        what you can do remotely now--

                                 JARED
                        I’m sure you’re right, but I’d love 
                        to see for myself--

           Huck steps back again.  Jared follows, but loses his balance.  
           HE FALLS, CRUTCHES SLAMMING ONTO THE STREET.  Pilar gasps.  

                                 PILAR
                        Pobrecito!

           The paramedics try to hoist Jared up.  He waves them away.  
           Jared falls again, this time with a SICKENING CRUNCH.  

           EXT. MERCADO DE ARTESANIAS - LATER

           Brooke and Kaylie wander through an outdoor flea market, past 
           vendors hawking cheap silver and fringed clothing.

                        We’ve been through this!  TiVo was

                        That’s what they want you to think.

                        Oh my god.  Fine.  Whatever.  You 
                        can pick what we do this afternoon.

                        Great.  Look left.

           Brooke does so.  PEOPLE file into a mini-van.  A placard 
           reads, “JOSE DE DEUS DAYTRIPPERS!”  She groans.

           INT. HUCK’S RENTAL CAR - MAGIC HOUR

           Huck and Wesley drive in silence.

                                 WESLEY
                        I would be dying to know.  

                                 HUCK
                        Because you lack the ability to 
                        delay gratification.  

                                 WESLEY
                        How can you not even be a little 
                        interested?  

                                 HUCK
                        Fine.  Tell me.

                                 WESLEY
                        Now I don’t want to.  

                                 HUCK
                        Okay.

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh come on!

                                 HUCK
                        Let me see if I can figure it out.  
                        You have a boyfriend, who, by the 
                        way, refers to you as his friend--
                                 WESLEY
                        You noticed too!  Do you think 
                        that’s weird?  It is, right?  

                                 HUCK
                        Depends.  Does he know you tracked 
                        him to Mexico like a bounty hunter? 

                                 WESLEY
                        Who told you?!

                                 HUCK
                        Debbie.  After the police took you 
                        in.  So...  can I read the email?

                                 WESLEY
                        What?  No.  I erased it.

                                 HUCK
                        You must have a copy somewhere.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Why the hell would I keep a copy?

                                 HUCK
                        So you can laugh about it one day?

                                 WESLEY
                        Are you insane?  I’m taking this to 
                        my grave. 

                                 HUCK
                        You know what’s strange?  You must 
                        have met this guy after our date, 
                        and that was only a month ago.  
                        That’s not normally enough time to 
                        get worked up over someone, unless 
                        someone else really fucked you up.

                                 WESLEY
                        And I suppose you think you’re the 
                        one who fucked me up?  You are so 
                        fucking arrogant.  For your 
                        information, I was fucked up long 
                        before we ever met.  

           Huck pulls over.  Wesley looks up -- they’re in front of a 
           building.  The sign reads “Equalizers Scuba Center.”   

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        I told you, I don’t need a 
                        hyperbaric chamber.
                                 HUCK
                        You do.  Sorry.

                                 WESLEY
                        Sorry doesn’t sound like sorry when 
                        you say it.

                                 HUCK
                        What does it sound like?

                                 WESLEY
                        Judgment.

           INT. HYPERBARIC CHAMBER - FIVE MINUTES LATER

           Wesley HYPERVENTILATES.  The chamber is tiny and cramped.  
           She KNOCKS on the window of the chamber... then SCREAMS.   

           HYPERBARIC CHAMBER SEQUENCE:

           Wesley’s bored.  Huck does dance moves for her.  She laughs.

           Wesley and Huck play hangman through the chamber.

           Wesley hyperventilates again.  Huck shakes his head.

           They both sit with their feet up, reading the same book.

           Wesley sleeps.  Huck watches her.  

           EXT. CASA DE JOSE DE DEUS - AFTERNOON

           Outside, a heap of discarded crutches and walking sticks.  

           INT. CASA DE JOSE DE DEUS - AFTERNOON

           An unremarkable room.  Brooke reads a pamphlet, bored. A 
           knock on the door.  JOSE DE DEUS, 30s, enters.  He’s in 
           khakis and a white shirt, looking normal.  Brooke’s thrown. 

                                 JOSE DE DEUS
                        Hey there.  I’m John of God.

                                 BROOKE
                        And I’m Princess Alopecia of the 
                        Goobledy Gobbledy tribe.  Sorry 
                        pal, not buying it.  

           Jose de Deus cracks up.  

                                 JOSE DE DEUS
                        That’s hilarious!    

           Jose tries to take Brooke’s pulse.  She wriggles away.
                                 BROOKE
                        Hey, no no no.  They just put me in 
                        here to wait for my friend. 

                                 JOSE DE DEUS
                        Oh yeah?  What’s wrong with her?

                                 BROOKE
                        Ummm, she’s a dumbass who believes 
                        in faith healers?

           Jose laughs.  Brooke smiles, strangely pleased.  He puts a 
           hand on her head.  She doesn’t stop him.

                                 JOSE DE DEUS
                        You should do stand-up.  Has anyone 
                        ever told you that? 

                                 BROOKE
                        My ex-husband.  Before the 
                        unpleasantness.  

           Jose raises a questioning eyebrow.  Brooke sighs.

                                 BROOKE (CONT’D)
                        I requested that he have adult 
                        circumcision and he was so moved by 
                        the experience that he eventually 
                        became an Orthodox Jew.  

                                 JOSE DE DEUS
                        Sounds like a real shmendrick.

           Brooke giggles.  Jose presses down on Brooke’s abdomen.

                                 JOSE DE DEUS (CONT’D)
                        It looks like your lymphatic system 
                        isn’t draining properly.  

                                 BROOKE
                        What does that mean?

                                 JOSE DE DEUS
                        You have a blockage.  

                                 BROOKE
                        Where?

                        (touching her ribcage)
                        In your heart.  

           Brooke sighs.  Of course.  Jose breaks into a smile.
                                 JOSE DE DEUS (CONT’D)
                        Kidding!  It’s in your spleen.  Ha!  
                        You should have seen your face.    

           Brooke is charmed...  and attracted?  Jose rubs his eyes and 
           removes his glasses with his other hand, revealing HORRIBLE 
           CROSS-EYES.  Brooke’s takes Jose’s hand, moves it downward.  

                                 BROOKE
                        I think my blockage is... lower.

           INT. HYPERBARIC CHAMBER - LATER

           Huck opens the door.  Wesley wakes up, sees him.  She sits 
           up, straightens out her hair, flustered.  Checks her breath.

                                 WESLEY
                        What?  Was I drooling?  

                                 HUCK
                        No, you’re a good sleeper.  I kinda 
                        like you that way.

                                 WESLEY
                        Peaceful?

                                 HUCK
                        Unconscious.

           EXT. TACO STAND - NIGHT

           Wesley and Huck sit on colorful picnic benches, eating.  Huck 
           reads Wesley’s email to Jared on her Blackberry.  

                                 HUCK
                        It’s...

                                 WESLEY
                        Obnoxious? 

                                 HUCK
                        No, it’s...

                                 WESLEY
                        Juvenile.  I know. 

                                 HUCK
                        If you’d let me finish...

                                 WESLEY
                        It’s crazy.  I’m crazy.  I know, 
                        okay?  I don’t need to hear it....
                                 HUCK
                        It’s...  art. 

           She looks at him.  He rereads a line and laughs. 

                                 WESLEY
                        It doesn’t make me seem... mad?

                                 HUCK
                        Sanity’s overrated.  And the 
                        craftsmanship is impeccable.  This 
                        could easily go viral.

                                 WESLEY
                        Yeah?  Is it better than “Bill 
                        Gates is sharing his fortune?” 

                                 HUCK
                        Better than “Chung-is-King!”

                                 WESLEY
                        Come on!  Better than the creepy 
                        Tom Cruise Scientology video?

                                 HUCK
                        Hands down.  Though the way they 
                        looped the Mission Impossible music 
                        throughout was very effective.

           Wesley laughs.  Huck opens a bottle of Coke and takes a sip.

                                 WESLEY
                        Okay, your turn.  

                                 HUCK
                        My turn what?

                                 WESLEY
                        I want the crazy ex-girlfriend 
                        story...  and I want ugly details. 

           Huck smiles, looking a little uncomfortable.  

                                 HUCK
                        Okay.  But promise me something.  

                                 WESLEY
                        What?

                                 HUCK
                        I think you’re gonna feel bad about 
                        some things you’ve said when I tell 
                        you, and I don’t want you to.
                                 WESLEY
                        I’m constitutionally incapable of 
                        regret.  Spill.    

                                 HUCK
                        I had a wife.  Kate.  She died 
                        almost two years ago.  

                                 WESLEY
                        What?  Oh my god.    

                                 HUCK
                        She had an aneurysm while she was 
                        jogging.  It was over instantly, 
                        so, you know, bright side.  

                                 WESLEY
                        I’m so sorry, Huck.  Jesus.  That 
                        must have been so awful.

                                 HUCK
                        It was.  But I’m okay.  Sort of.  
                        We don’t have to talk about it.  

                                 WESLEY
                        We can talk about it.  

                                 HUCK
                        No.  I just.... I’m glad you know.    

           A sad, awkward moment.  Wesley tries to normalize.  

                                 WESLEY
                        So...  you’re starting to date?

                                 HUCK
                        I thought I was...  then I realized 
                        it might be a little more 
                        complicated than anticipated.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh no...  Please tell me I wasn’t 
                        your first date back.  

           Huck smiles and nods.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Dude.  I can’t believe Amy didn’t 
                        tell me.  

                                 HUCK
                        I told her not to.  If you’re a 
                        young widower, you tend to attract 
                        a very specific kind of women.  
                                 (MORE)

                        Have you heard the term Malach ha-
                        Mavet? It means The Angel of Death.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Like a foul-weather friend?  Only 
                        interested in your suffering? 

                                 HUCK
                        More like... disturbingly turned on 
                        by your suffering.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Was there a lot of “You poor thing, 
                        let me touch your penis and help 
                        you heal?”

           Huck smiles.  Wesley cringes at her lame attempt at humor.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, I don’t mean to joke.  

                                 HUCK
                        Please joke.  Everyone tiptoes 
                        around me like I’m some sort of 
                        time bomb.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Lucky for you, I’m missing that 
                        third eye that tells someone when 
                        they’re acting like an asshole.  

           They both laugh.  

                                 HUCK
                        That’s what I miss most.  

                                 WESLEY
                        She was funny?

                                 HUCK
                        Funny like you?  No.  But she was 
                        in on the joke, which is equally 
                        important.  One of the best parts 
                        of marriage is having someone to 
                        turn to and say, “Do you see what 
                        that moron is doing?”

                                 WESLEY
                        I just realized something awful.  

                                 HUCK
                        What?
                                 WESLEY
                        I think I’m that moron.

           Huck laughs.  Wesley smiles.  

                                 HUCK
                        Thanks.  

                                 WESLEY
                        For what?

                                 HUCK
                        You’re a great girl, Wes.  I hope 
                        this guy knows that.

                                 WESLEY
                        He does.  I think.  

                                 HUCK
                        So... tell me about him.

           She starts talking. GERMAN TOURISTS at the next picnic table 
           over look down at a newspaper, confer, then tap Wesley.

                                 TOURIST
                        Excuse me.  This is you, ya?

           THE NEWSPAPER: A picture of Wesley, Kaylie and Brooke from 
           the press conference. The headline reads: ¡BANDITO CAPTURADO!

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh.  My.  God.  Yes!  Shit!

           One of the Germans groans and hands the other fifty pesos. 

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Jared’s gonna see this!  And he’ll 
                        know I’m here.  Do you know how 
                        crazy this makes me look?!  

                                 HUCK
                        I highly doubt he’ll see it.  

                                 WESLEY
                        You don’t think he’ll pass by one 
                        person reading the newspaper in the 
                        hospital tomorrow morning?  See a 
                        single newsstand?

                                 HUCK
                        Eh.  Most people see foreign 
                        writing and just block it out.  
                                 WESLEY
                        Hmmm... like how I zone when they 
                        do Indian weddings on Bridezillas.  
                        But Jared’s very interested in 
                        other cultures.  He even subscribes 
                        to Der Spiegel.  

                                 HUCK
                        You realize that’s German Hustler?  

           Wesley smacks him with the newspaper.

                                 WESLEY
                        Focus!  Do you think we have time 
                        to buy all the newspapers in town?

                                 HUCK
                        We?

                                 WESLEY
                        You’re deep in this now, pal. Don’t 
                        even think about trying to bail.  

           INT. EL RING ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

           Ranchera music, sawdust on the floor.  Kaylie and Brooke sit 
           at the bar, surrounded by a MEN IN COWBOY ATTIRE.  Kaylie, 
           already loaded, does tequila shots.  Brooke tries to listen a 
           message from Wesley on her voice mail.  It goes in and out.

                                 BROOKE
                        All I heard was airport, Jared, 
                        disaster.  Your usual Wes message.

           Kaylie clinks shot glasses with a MEXICAN COWBOY.

           She does her shot.  Several men clap.  She pours another.

                        Take is easy, drinky.  What

                        John of God came in, looked at me, 
                        and said “automatic out.”  Then he 
                        left.  I didn’t know that was, 
                        like, an international thing. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Oh...  Well, I think I might have 
                        mentioned that story to him.  
                                 KAYLIE
                        What do you mean?  You saw him?

                        They put me in a room to wait for 
                        you and he showed up.

                                 KAYLIE
                        So, wait.  Did he... heal you?

                                 BROOKE
                        I guess you could put it that way. 

                                 KAYLIE
                        Did he do invisible surgery?  Or 
                        that thing where he jabs a crystal 
                        up your nostril?

                                 BROOKE
                        He jabbed something up me, but it 
                        wasn’t a crystal.  

           Brooke winks.  Kaylie gasps, growing incensed.

                                 KAYLIE
                        You fucked my faith healer?!

                        He’s the “people’s faith healer.”  
                        It says so right on the brochure.  

                                 KAYLIE
                        But he’s celibate!  All faith

           Brooke YELPS.  The crowd CHEERS!  A BAR BRAWL BREAKS OUT.  

           EXT. TOWN OF ZIHUATANEJO - SAME

           Wesley and Huck gather newspapers, empty out vending 
           machines, plead with newsstand owners.
           INT. DR. AURELIO VALDIVIESO GENERAL HOSPITAL - SAME

           Wearing scrubs and footies, Wesley and Huck skulk through the 
           halls to GATHER UP NEWSPAPERS.  Wesley notices Jared’s name 
           on a chart outside a room.  She can’t help but peek in. 

           Inside, Jared and Pilar watch a telenovela.  Pilar changes 
           the television to a soccer game.  

                                 PILAR
                        I find telenovelas to be very dull.  
                        Give me futbol any day.

           Wesley gasps -- Pilar’s manufacturing “Great Girl Moments” of 
           her own!  She doesn’t like how cozy they look - AT ALL. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Huck and Wesley walk toward a bodega.  Wesley’s PHONE RINGS.  
           A private number.  She debates picking it up.  Hears the 
           sounds of men arguing in Spanish around her.  Hits IGNORE.  
           Waits.  A muffled message comes up.   

                                 JARED (ON VOICE MAIL)
                        Me again.  This is getting absurd.  
                        I got into another car accident.  
                        Flying out at nine tomorrow.  If 
                        you can’t pick me up, don’t sweat 
                        it, because Pilar’s on my flight.  

           The phone cuts out.  She tries to call again.  No signal.  
           Turns to Huck.

                                 WESLEY
                        Do you think Jared’s having sex 
                        with the slutty nurse?

                                 HUCK
                        What makes you say that?

                        If that girl was giving you a 
                        sponge-bath every day... Reaching 
                        her hands up underneath your cast, 
                        washing your undercarriage...

                                 HUCK
                        My undercarriage?  Oh.  Yeah.  He’s 
                        definitely having sex with her.

                                 WESLEY
                        Really?!
                                 HUCK
                        No.  I'm kidding.  Sorta.

           Wesley tries voicemail again.  Nothing.  She’s bummed.  Huck 
           reaches over and kisses her.  She pushes him away.

                                 WESLEY
                        What the hell?

                                 HUCK
                        Now you’re even.  

                                 WESLEY
                        We don’t know that he cheated.  
                        That could be my craziness talking.  

                                 HUCK
                        Oh, are you crazy?  I hadn’t 
                        noticed.

           Wesley attempts a dirty look, then laughs.  

           INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Emilio and Raul, still in their new outfits, lead Kaylie and 
           Brooke, both bruised and battered, into a holding cell.  

                                 BROOKE
                        I’m an American.  I have rights!  

                                 EMILIO
                        Not in Mexico.  

                                 BROOKE
                        But she started it!  

                                 KAYLIE
                        It’s true.  She had nothing to do 
                        with it.  

           Brooke stares at Kaylie in surprise.  Emilio turns to Kaylie.

                                 EMILIO
                        You accept responsibility for all 
                        the damage to the premises?

           Kaylie nods.  Raul removes Brooke from the cell.  Brooke 
           stares at Kaylie as she walks off. Kaylie avoids eye contact.

           INT. BODEGA - NIGHT

           Wesley checks her voicemail again.  Huck carries a PILE OF 
           NEWSPAPERS toward the counter.  
                                 HUCK
                        You know, you seem a little trapped 
                        in your own head.  It might be good 
                        to have something other than your 
                        love life to focus on.  A hobby.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Like... scrapbooking?

                                 HUCK
                        I was thinking more like a 
                        volunteer-mentor-type situation.  

                                 WESLEY
                        So I could teach people to fire-
                        bomb their love lives?

                                 HUCK
                        You have a lot of good traits.  
                        You’re very tenacious.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Like a dog with a bone?

                                 HUCK
                        Okay.  Be offended.

                                 WESLEY
                        I’m not offended... it’s just not 
                        true.  If Jared and I don’t work 
                        out, I’m calling it a day and 
                        hitting the sperm bank.  

           They reach the counter.  The CLERK shakes his head.

                                 CLERK
                        Too many.  Need for customers.

                                 WESLEY
                        Señor, if I want to buy these, you 
                        have to sell them.  That’s how 
                        capitalism works.

                                 HUCK
                        Let’s go.  I highly doubt these 
                        particular newspapers are the ones--

           A crowd gathers behind her, grumbling. CLERK waves her aside.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Señor, imagine I was your daughter 
                        and I desperately needed all these 
                        newspapers...  or I would die.
                                 CLERK
                        My daughter home with her babies. 
                        You should have baby too and stop 
                        running around like crazy person.

                                 WESLEY
                        Maybe I already have a baby.

                                 CLERK
                        Look at the shape of your breasts.  
                        They have never fed a child.

                                 WESLEY
                        Thank you!
                        (to Huck)
                        Leave the money on the counter.

                                 HUCK
                        What?  Why?

           Wesley makes a “putting down the newspapers” motion...  then 
           runs out of the bodega with the papers in her hand. The clerk 
           reaches under the cash register and PULLS OUT AN AIR GUN.  

                                 HUCK (CONT’D)
                        Oh fuck.

           Huck runs after Wesley.  The clerk races after them, shooting 
           the gun in the air.  Huck yanks her down an alley, around a 
           corner.  They duck through the streets, finally coming to--

           EXT. SIDE STREET - SAME

           Huck and Wesley slow down.  They look back.  All clear.  They 
           can breathe.  They look at each other.  Huck begins to laugh.  

                                 HUCK
                        How do you get through a day 
                        without harming yourself or others?

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh please, it was an air gun.  

                                 HUCK
                        Is that why you screamed?

                                 WESLEY
                        Trust me.  That thing couldn’t 
                        shoot through the crap you put in 
                        your hair.  

           She messes up his hair.  He grabs her hands and holds them.  
           Time slows down...  She’s ready for him to kiss her.  
           But he turns his head slightly at the distant sound of MUSIC - 
           percussion, guitar - soft and melodic.

                                 HUCK
                        Do you hear that?  

                                 WESLEY
                        Hear what? 

           EXT. OUTDOOR GARDEN - NIGHT

           The source of the music.  Twinkling lights and pink balloons 
           hang from a orchard of orange trees, framing a makeshift 
           dance floor and folding tables full of traditional food.  

           On the dance floor, a BEAUTIFUL GIRL dances to salsa music in 
           a full-length white lace dress. She’s flanked by TEN MAIDS OF 
           HONOR and TEN CHAMBELANES, all in white satin tuxedos. 

                                 WESLEY
                        What’s with the child bride?  No 
                        wonder everyone in this country 
                        thinks I’m some shriveled crone.

                                 HUCK
                        It’s a Quinceanera.  Like a sweet 
                        sixteen?  Try to blend.  

           He stashes the newspapers and leads her to the dance floor.  
           They join the swarm of people.  

                                 HUCK (CONT’D)
                        Tango? 

                                 WESLEY
                        I think this is a salsa.

                                 HUCK
                        You’re a salsa. 

           He starts to lead her in time to the music.

                                 WESLEY
                        How do you know how to do this?

                                 HUCK
                        It’s easier to follow if you shut 
                        the fuck up.

                                 WESLEY
                        I like when you talk dirty. 

           They dance.  Seeing how good Huck is, something starts to 
           shift for Wesley.  The music ends.  
           Everyone on the dance floor applauds the band -- and they go 
           into a slower cumbia.  Wesley looks at Huck...  are they 
           having a moment?  She gives him a “meaningful eye stare/kiss 
           me” look, leans in, shuts her eyes...

                                 HUCK
                        What are you doing?

                                 WESLEY
                        What?

                                 HUCK
                        Oh, so now you want me to kiss you?

                                 WESLEY
                        No!

                                 HUCK
                        Liar.

           He kisses her.  

           INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Kaylie plays cards with a TRANNY HOOKER.  A DRUNK MEXICAN 
           GRANDMOTHER curses to herself.  Brooke enters.  

                                 BROOKE
                        I came to bail you out.  

                                 KAYLIE
                        Excuse me, but I’m in the middle of 
                        a card game with Mercedes.  

           Kaylie smiles at the tranny hooker, who waves at Brooke.

                                 BROOKE
                        Look, I’m sorry.  I’m an asshole. 
                        It’s just...  I’m so lonely and 
                        miserable without Alan.

                                 KAYLIE
                        How is that my fault?

                                 BROOKE
                        It’s not.  It’s more...  every time 
                        I look at you, I realize I could 
                        have saved my marriage if I’d made 
                        some compromises.  Like you did 
                        when you forgave Tad for cheating.  
                        I really admire you, Kaylie.

           Kaylie starts to sniffle.  Her lower lip trembles.  
                                 KAYLIE
                        I’m a fraud!  

                                 BROOKE
                        What do you mean?

                                 KAYLIE
                        I didn’t forgive Tad.  He forgave 
                        me.  

                                 BROOKE
                        You cheated?  

                                 KAYLIE
                        We were going through a rough time 
                        and I made a terrible mistake.  I’m 
                        sorry I lied.  I was so ashamed.

           Kaylie bursts into tears.  Brooke gives her a hug.  

                                 KAYLIE (CONT’D)
                        I think I’m being punished.  That’s 
                        why I can’t get pregnant.

                                 BROOKE
                        You’ll get pregnant as soon as you 
                        forgive yourself.  And as soon as 
                        your husband fixes his crazy nuts.

           Kaylie wavers between crying and laughing.  Finally laughs.  
           They hug.

           INT. HUCK’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Huck and Wesley rip off each others’ clothes.  She positions 
           her thighs under the sheets and sucks in her stomach.  

                                 HUCK
                        Would you cut that shit out?

                                 WESLEY
                        What?

                                 HUCK
                        Sucking in your stomach like a 
                        famine baby.  Exhale.

           Wesley tries to be outraged, but can’t help but laugh.  

           INT. HUCK’S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           Wesley wakes up to find Huck typing on his laptop.  
                                 HUCK
                        Hey you.  Sleep okay?

                                 WESLEY
                        Yeah.  Great.  You?

                                 HUCK
                        Perfect.

                                 WESLEY
                        What are you doing?

                                 HUCK
                        Getting directions to Angangueo, 
                        this little mining town.  It has 
                        the largest monarch butterfly 
                        sanctuary in Mexico.  They migrate 
                        here during the winter. 

                                 WESLEY
                        That sounds amazing. 

           Wesley’s Blackberry VIBRATES.  She misses the call.  Calls 
           Voice Mail.  Jared’s message is still there.  

                                 JARED (VOICE MAIL)
                        Me again.  This is getting absurd.  
                        I got into another car accident.  
                        Flying out at nine tomorrow.  If 
                        you can’t pick me up, don’t sweat 
                        it, because Pilar’s on my flight.   
                        I bought her a ticket to LA, so she 
                        could visit her girlfriend Zoila.  
                        They can give me a ride home, if 
                        you can’t make it.  But if you can, 
                        I’d love to see you.  

           Wesley hangs up, feeling like shit.  What has she done??

                                 HUCK
                        Do you want to come to Angangueo?

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh, I wasn’t asking to come.

                                 HUCK
                        I know.  I was asking you.

                                 WESLEY
                        You don’t have to do this whole 
                        awkward morning after make-the-girl-
                        feel-slightly-less-slutty-by-asking-
                        her-for-plans-thing.
                                 HUCK
                        Why is no one allowed to be nice to 
                        you without you feeling 
                        condescended to?

                                 WESLEY
                        Why are you picking a fight?

                                 HUCK
                        I’m not, you are.  I’m sorry that 
                        you feel guilty about last night.  
                        I had a nice time.  

                                 WESLEY
                        I do not feel guilty.

           Wesley gets out of bed and starts putting her clothes on.

                                 HUCK
                        You didn’t do anything wrong.  
                        You’re not in an exclusive 
                        relationship.  Truth is, you guys 
                        don’t really know each other.   

                                 WESLEY
                        Of course we do.  

                                 HUCK
                        What’s his favorite thing about 
                        you?

                                 WESLEY
                        I don’t know.  Everything.

                                 HUCK
                        At some point, he must have said, 
                        “Hey, you know what I love about 
                        you?  You’re...”  

                                 WESLEY
                        I can’t remember.

                                 HUCK
                        Come on.  You’re...  

                                 WESLEY
                        ... “the last normal girl in 
                        Southern California.”

                                 HUCK
                        Wesley...  You are a lot of things.  
                        You are fun and funny and 
                        outrageous and smart.  But you are 
                        definitely not normal.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HUCK (CONT'D)
                        And if you want my opinion, you 
                        should be with someone who loves 
                        that about you.  

           A beat.  Wesley turns to him, summoning up all her courage.

                                 WESLEY
                        Someone like you?

           Huck’s thrown, not sure what to say.  

                                 HUCK
                        What are you asking me?

                                 WESLEY
                        I think... what I’m saying is... if 
                        there were a chance... of something 
                        that extends past going to see 
                        butterflies...  I would stay.  

                                 HUCK
                        As in, where is this going?  

                                 WESLEY
                        I mean, you said you were planning 
                        to start dating?  So does that mean 
                        lots of people... or just me? 

                                 HUCK
                        I don’t plan on anything anymore.  

           Wesley nods, trying to hide how upset she is.  

                                 HUCK (CONT’D)
                        It’s not you.

                                 WESLEY
                        Please don’t--

                                 HUCK
                        Wes, my wedding picture is still 
                        up.  I’m still living in the house 
                        Kate and I bought together.  And 
                        you... you’re just so ready.  You 
                        want someone to come along and 
                        sweep you off your feet.  You want 
                        someone to give you the world.  

                                 WESLEY
                        What’s wrong with that?
                                 HUCK
                        Absolutely nothing.  But I already 
                        did it once.  And I’m not sure I 
                        have it in me to do it again. 

                                 WESLEY
                        You don’t think you could fall for 
                        someone?

                                 HUCK
                        Maybe I could.  But...  I guess I 
                        don’t want to.     

           Wesley turns away from him, hurt.  Finishes dressing.  

                                 HUCK (CONT’D)
                        Why do you have to be in such a 
                        hurry?  

                                 WESLEY
                        Because I want to get there 
                        already, okay?  

                                 HUCK
                        Get where?  There’s no race.  
                        There’s no finish line.

                                 WESLEY
                        Yes there is.

                                 HUCK
                        See, this is your whole problem.  

                                 WESLEY
                        No, my problem is men like you.  
                        You know what my life is?  A gym 
                        class where everyone gets picked 
                        for baseball teams.  You and other 
                        waffly, indecisive, terrified guys 
                        get to be captain.  And I get to 
                        wait on the sidelines, hoping for 
                        one of you to notice me, pick me 
                        out of the crowd.  But you don’t.  
                        And let me tell you -- if you’d 
                        never been chosen to play?  You’d 
                        be in a hurry too.

           Wesley exits the room.  A hungover Brooke and Kaylie drag 
           their suitcases down the hallway.  They spot her and gasp.

           INT. IXTAPA AIRPORT - DAY

           As they run up to their gate, the AIRPLANE DOOR SLAMS SHUT.  
                                 WESLEY
                        We are so fucking fucked!

                                 KAYLIE
                        There were seats on the 9 am.

                                 WESLEY
                        We can’t.  That’s Jared’s flight.  

                                 BROOKE
                        I don’t think we have much choice.

                                 KAYLIE
                        We need disguises! 

                                 BROOKE
                        Disguises?  Like big sunglasses? 

                                 KAYLIE
                        Sombreros and ponchos? 

           Wesley notices three MUSLIM WOMEN IN TRADITIONAL BURKHAS.  

           INT. SECOND GATE - TWO MINUTES LATER

           The girls rock burkhas; the Muslim woman wear their 
           sundresses, twirling around and doing “I feel pretty” poses 
           for each other.

           INT. PLANE - LATER

           Jared and Pilar sit in the bulkhead seats, Jared’s casted 
           legs stretched out in front of him.  

           Wesley, clad in her burkha, walks up the aisle toward the 
           bathroom. She wears big sunglasses to hide her face, though 
           Jared doesn’t even notice her as she walks by and steals a 
           glance. 

           A FEW ROWS BACK, two more burkha-ed ladies - Brooke and 
           Kaylie - toast their success with COCKTAILS.  The passengers 
           across the aisle stare as they toss back their drinks. 

           EXT./INT. LAX - DAY

           The plane lands with a thump.  Wesley shakes the girls awake.

           ARRIVAL GATE -- The girls sprint off the plane, nearly 
           knocking Jared over.  A wheelchair is waiting for him.  

           BATHROOM --Kaylie and Brooke, still in their burkha, strip 
           Wesley down and dress her while she redoes her makeup.  
           TERMINAL -- Pilar wheels Jared toward an elevator.  Wesley, 
           Kaylie and Brooke tear past them and down the escalator.

           BAGGAGE CLAIM -- The elevator opens.  Pilar wheels Jared out.  
           He sees Wesley “walking in from outside” as if she just 
           arrived.  She’s backlit and gorgeous.  

                                 JARED
                        A sight for sore eyes... and bones.  
                        You look beautiful.

                                 WESLEY
                        You look... like shit.

                                 JARED
                        This is Pilar, my nurse.

           Wesley shakes Pilar’s hand and speaks under her breath.

                                 WESLEY
                        You don’t fool me, Nurse Pilar.

                                 PILAR
                        No comprendo.

                                 WESLEY
                        I think you comprendo just fine.

           INT. WESLEY’S CAR - DAY

           Jared shifts around, getting comfortable with all his casts.  

                                 WESLEY
                        So do you want to stop for food?  
                        Or go straight to sleep?  

                                 JARED
                        All I’ve thought about since I 
                        gained consciousness was that night 
                        we had.  
                        And all I want is to have another 
                        one just like it. 

           He puts his hand between her legs.  She giggles.  Jared moves 
           his hand higher.  She clamps her legs closed.

                                 WESLEY
                        Jared!  I’m driving!

                                 JARED
                        Tell me something.  What ran 
                        through your mind on, say, day four 
                        when you hadn’t heard from me? 
                                 WESLEY
                        Something like, hmmm, I wonder when 
                        Ali Lohan’s new CD is gonna drop.  

           INT. JARED’S HOUSE, FOYERS - DAY

           Wesley helps Jared up the stairs.  He squeezes her ass.

                                 JARED
                        You weren’t suspicious?  Concerned?

                                 WESLEY
                        I was very concerned for Ali.  Her 
                        recording career is riding on this.  

           INT. JARED’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Jared and Wesley enter, making out.  He hobbles to the bed.  
           She climbs on top of him.

                                 JARED
                        So I think you’re going to have to 
                        do most of the work here. 

                                 WESLEY
                        I can manage.

                                 JARED 
                        I’ll try to pop in from time to 
                        time.

           Wesley laughs and tries to pull his pants off, over his 
           casts.  It’s a challenge, but she gets it done.

                                 WESLEY
                        That was harder than it looked.

                                 JARED
                        It’s exactly as hard as it looks.  

                                 WESLEY
                        You have... condoms?

                                 JARED
                        Check our drawer.  

           He winks.  She has no idea what he’s talking about.  Wesley 
           makes an educated guess and opens the drawer on his side.  
           It’s full of remote controls and batteries.

                                 JARED (CONT’D)
                        Don’t tell me you don’t remember.
                                 WESLEY
                        Uh...  not really.

                                 JARED
                        It’s on the other side of the bed. 
                        You’re probably thinking of your 
                        other boyfriend’s bedroom.  

                                 WESLEY
                        So... you’re my boyfriend now?

                                 JARED
                        Is that okay?

           Wesley pauses, trying to hide how conflicted she is.  She 
           kisses Jared, avoiding the question.  

           She reaches into the drawer on her side, not looking, and 
           pulls out the same FLESHY, VEINED DILDO that spilled out of 
           her suitcase.  

                                 JARED (CONT’D)
                        Nice!  She goes for the big guns.  

                                 WESLEY
                        How did you--  Where---  Why do you 
                        have this?

                                 JARED
                        Ummm...  what’s wrong? 

                                 WESLEY
                        Did Quintano put you up to this?  

                                 JARED
                        Who’s Quintano?  

           A furious Wesley gets up, grabs the dildo, and throws it back 
           in the drawer.  Only then does she see the drawer’s contents.  
           IT IS FULL OF EVERY SEX TOY IMAGINABLE.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Wait a minute...  this is yours?

                                 JARED
                        Well.  Now it’s ours.

                                 WESLEY
                        What the hell is going on here?!

                                 JARED
                        Why are you being weird?  We talked 
                        about this the night we made love.  
                                 WESLEY
                        No we didn’t!

                                 JARED
                        You said it was natural.

                                 WESLEY
                        I did not!  Are you crazy?!

                                 JARED
                        Have you lost your mind?  How can 
                        you forget two hours of sex?

                                 WESLEY
                        Huh?  It took twenty minutes.

                                 JARED
                        Sure, the first time.  That was 
                        just to get warmed up.

                                 WESLEY
                        Wait... we had sex more than once?!

           Jared indicates the TWO CONDOM WRAPPERS ON THE NIGHT-STAND.  

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god!  It was the Ambien!  

                                 JARED
                        What Ambien?

                                 WESLEY
                        I took three extra Ambien so I 
                        could fall asleep!  I don’t 
                        remember anything!  I was probably 
                        hallucinating the whole time!

                                 JARED
                        Why didn’t you tell me you were 
                        taking three sleeping pills?

                                 WESLEY
                        I didn’t want you to think I was a 
                        drug addict!

                                 JARED
                        So basically I fucked a corpse?!

                                 WESLEY
                        For all I know, you’re into that 
                        too!

           Wesley dumps the contents of the drawer on the bed.
                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        I want you to tell me exactly what 
                        happened and which of these 
                        implements we used.  

                                 JARED
                        I mean...  where do I start?  

                                 WESLEY
                        In chronological order.

           Jared pushes himself up on his elbows.  He picks up a scarf.

                                 JARED
                        Well...  first, I used this to tie 
                        you to the bed. You don’t remember? 

           She shakes her head.  He holds up a long gold chain, like a 
           necklace, but NOT.  She looks at it, puzzled and horrified.

                                 JARED (CONT’D)
                        Nipple clamps.  You don’t remember 
                        that either?

                                 WESLEY
                        No, Jared.  I don’t remember having 
                        MY NIPPLES CLAMPED!  No wonder I’ve 
                        been chafing all week.

                                 JARED
                        You seemed to like it.

                                 WESLEY
                        I was HALLUCINATING!

                                 JARED
                        Okay!  Calm down!

           She picks up more objects from the bed.

                                 WESLEY
                        What about this?  And this?  And 
                        what the hell is this thing?!  Is 
                        this a strap-on?! 

           She picks up a SMALL PLASTIC SEX TOY WITH A STRAP.

                                 JARED
                        It’s just another toy.

                                 WESLEY
                        Why is it so small?
                                 JARED
                        They come in all sizes.

                                 WESLEY
                        But it’s weird.  Why does it have 
                        this blunted shape?

                                 JARED
                        No reason.

                                 WESLEY
                        Jared!  For fuck’s sake!!!  WHAT IS 
                        IT?!

                                 JARED
                        It’s for butts!  Okay?! 

                                 WESLEY
                        WHAT?!

                                 JARED
                        It’s a butt plug.  So what? 

                                 WESLEY
                        SO WHAT?!  SO?!?!  WHAT?!?!?!

                                 JARED
                        Hey!  Don’t say that like I’m some 
                        kind of pervert!  There’s a whole 
                        world of very normal people out 
                        there who are turned on by butt 
                        play!

                                 WESLEY
                        DO NOT say butt play!  Ever!

                                 JARED
                        It’s a healthy part of sexuality!

                                 WESLEY
                        Did we use this thing?!

                                 JARED
                        I don’t remember.

                                 WESLEY
                        Don’t lie to me!  Did you put that 
                        inside me?!  Did you put that...  
                        in my butt, you fucking freak?!

                                 JARED
                        No!
                                 WESLEY
                        What the fuck happened?!  What did 
                        you do with that thing?!

                                 JARED
                        I didn’t do anything!  

                                 WESLEY
                        What did you do to me?! 

                                 JARED
                        NOTHING!  YOU!  DID IT!  TO ME!

           A beat.  Wesley SCREAMS!  

                                 WESLEY
                        EWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!

                                 JARED
                        I’m sorry.  Really.  I thought we 
                        were on the same page.

                                 WESLEY
                        Of what?  The big book of ass-
                        fucking?  

                                 JARED
                        Have you considered that you might 
                        be over-reacting a tiny bit?  I’m 
                        still me.

                                 WESLEY
                        I don’t know who that is!  I’ve 
                        been calling you my boyfriend and I 
                        don’t know the first thing about 
                        you! 

                                 JARED
                        You know me.

                                 WESLEY
                        No, I just know the fantasy of you 
                        that I’ve built up in my head.  You 
                        could be a compulsive gambler or a 
                        meth addict or a Scientologist and 
                        I wouldn’t have a clue!

                                 JARED
                        Okay....  Who told you?

                                 WESLEY
                        Told me what?
                                 JARED
                        It was just some classes at the 
                        Celebrity Centre.

                                 WESLEY
                        Just some...  WHAT?!

                                 JARED
                        I was experimenting.  It was years 
                        ago.  I never even went clear. 

           OUT ON Wesley’s horrified expression.

           WESLEY-GETTING-HER-LIFE-TOGETHER/HUCK-BEING-MISERABLE MONTAGE

           INT. WESLEY’S APARTMENT - DAY 

           Wesley tosses dating books and post-its with phone numbers in 
           a trash bag, catches a glimpse of her hot neighbors massaging 
           each other with oil.  She pointedly shuts the blinds.  

           INT. HUCK’S NEW APARMENT - NIGHT

           Half-unpacked.  Nothing on the walls yet.  Huck sits on his 
           couch, laptop open to an email program.  He types Wesley’s 
           name in the TO: line.  Stares.  Shuts the computer.  

           INT. HOMELESS SHELTER - DAY

           Wesley works with Sister Beasley, leading a Computer Skills 
           workshop.  She demonstrates how to email.  

           EXT. AHMANSON THEATER - NIGHT

           Huck and LAUREN, 22, exit.  The BILLBOARD READS:  “MARLEE 
           MATLIN in THE MIRACLE WORKER.” 

                                 LAUREN
                        Where’s the car?  This 
                        neighborhood’s sketcharama.

                                 HUCK
                        Around the corner.  What’d you 
                        think of the play?

                                 LAUREN
                        It was okay...  it was weird what 
                        she kept doing with her hands...

                                 HUCK
                        You mean ASL?  Sign language?

                                 LAUREN
                        What’s that?
                                 HUCK
                        It’s how deaf people communicate.  
                        We just sat through a whole play 
                        about Helen Keller and you didn’t 
                        pick that up?

                                 LAUREN
                        Well excuse me!  I guess I’m 
                        supposed to be a mind reader or 
                        something.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Wesley sits at dinner alone, happily reading a book.  A guy 
           sends over drinks and his business card.  She drinks the 
           drink, smiles at him, then sends his business card back.

           INT. FOUR SEASONS - NIGHT

           Huck sits with a MARRIED COUPLE, nursing a drink.  He zones 
           out on a CHEESY GUY sporting a v-neck sweater and copious

                                 CHEESY GUY
                        That shirt is very becoming on 
                        you... but if I was on you I’d be 
                        cumming too.  

           Huck laughs, turns to his friends to see if they heard this 
           idiot.  They’re wrapped up in conversation and don’t notice 
           him.  Huck watches this private interchange, feeling wistful. 

           INT./EXT. CARDIO BARRE CLASS - DAY

           Wesley works out with Kaylie, pregnant and Brooke, who wears 
           a skirt over her yoga pants and a wig.  She scratches at it.

                                 BROOKE
                        Cheapass fucking wig.  I’m probably 
                        wearing the pubic hair of a mink.

                                 KAYLIE
                        If you’re an Orthodox Jew now, I 
                        think you have to stop swearing.

                                 BROOKE
                        I’m not an Orthodox anything, okay?  
                        I’m just trying this out until Alan  
                        snaps back to reality.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Uh huh.  So how’s the sheet-sex?
                                 BROOKE
                        Surprisingly erotic!  

                                 KAYLIE
                        So is pregnant sex.  The vaginal 
                        fluid becomes so much more viscous!  

           Brooke gags.  Just then, JARED WALKS INTO THE CLASS. 

                                 WESLEY
                        You guys.  That’s Jared!

                                 KAYLIE
                        What’s he doing here?

                                 WESLEY
                        He’s the one who told me about this 
                        class.  

           Jared catches Wesley’s eye.  She waves tentatively.  He 
           gathers up his stuff and leaves.  She rushes after him.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Are you leaving because of me?

                                 JARED
                        Well...  yeah.  Obviously.

                                 WESLEY
                        I owe you a huge apology.  I made 
                        you feel stupid for your sexual 
                        preferences, and that wasn’t cool.  
                        We’re born with our bodies and they 
                        respond to what they respond to.  I 
                        should be more open minded.   

                                 JARED
                        You think I’m some kind of a freak.

                                 WESLEY
                        Jared, you don’t know from freak.  

                                 JARED
                        You’re kidding, right?

           A beat.  Wesley takes a deep breath.

                                 WESLEY
                        When you didn’t call after we slept 
                        together, I thought you were 
                        blowing me off, and I sent you a 
                        psychotic email.

                                 WESLEY (CONT'D)
                        When I found out you hadn’t called 
                        me because you were hospitalized, I 
                        tried to break into your email to 
                        erase it. I went to your elementary 
                        school to get the name of your 
                        second grade teacher, so I could 
                        answer the security question.  And 
                        when that didn’t work, I got on a 
                        plane and flew to Mexico and broke 
                        into your hotel room and erased the 
                        email from your computer. 

                                 JARED
                        I’m speechless.  Wesley, we’d been 
                        out maybe five times.

                                 WESLEY
                        Six.  Point is, I might not like 
                        “butt play,” but I’m obviously no 
                        saint.  I’m neurotic and obsessive 
                        and way too desperate to be loved.

                                 JARED
                        The ironic thing?  I would have 
                        found that email hilarious.  

                                 WESLEY
                        I thought you didn’t like it when 
                        girls questioned your character.

                                 JARED
                        Sure, under normal circumstances.  
                        But a little skepticism’s healthy.  
                        Truthfully, I found your reaction 
                        kinda strange.  

           Just then, Pilar pokes her head out of the Cardio Barre room.  

                                 PILAR
                        You’re missing the whole class!

           She sees Wesley, hurries back in.  Jared’s red-faced.

                                 JARED
                        It started when we got back.  Ish.

                                 WESLEY
                        You know what?  It’s fine.  I’m 
                        just glad you got a girlfriend out 
                        of this debacle.  

                                 JARED
                        Let’s call it even.  Friends?
           She nods.  They hug.  Jared squirms, uncomfortable.

                                 JARED (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.  I’m wearing a cod piece.

           INT. HUCK’S WAITING ROOM/OFFICE - DAY

           A waiting room packed with SCREAMING CHILDREN.  Huck sneaks 
           past them, and into his office, where he checks his email.  
           Nothing.  He frowns.  Hits refresh.  Nothing.  

           His cell phone RINGS.  He immediately answers.

                                 HUCK
                        Hello?

           EXT. LAS PLAYAS RESORT, POOL - SAME

           Quintano gets a cabana pedicure and talks on the phone.

                                 QUINTANO
                        She write you back yet?

           INTERCUT AS NEEDED

                                 HUCK
                        Radio silence.  

                                 QUINTANO
                        Drats.  Well, onto the next.  

                                 HUCK
                        It just seems weird is all.  I’m 
                        wondering if she didn’t get it.   

                                 QUINTANO
                        You should hack into her email.  
                        See if it’s in spam.  I’m sure she 
                        of all people would understand.

           Huck sighs.  On his end, Quintano rolls his eyes.  

                                 QUINTANO (CONT’D)
                        It defies my better judgment to 
                        tell you this, but...  go to the 
                        Verizon website.  

           Huck pulls it up and reads.

                                 HUCK
                        Dear Verizon customer, we are sorry 
                        and embarrassed to be writing this 
                        letter.  Last week was the worst 
                        operational week in our history.

                        breakdown... resulting in the loss 
                        of four million emails.  
                        (looking up, queasy)
                        Fuck me.

                                 QUINTANO
                        What’s the problem?  Your email’s 
                        gonna be restored within the hour.  

                                 HUCK
                        It was more than one email.  Read 
                        all at once, they might make me 
                        seem... desperate.

                                 QUINTANO
                        What?  How many?

                                 HUCK
                        Seven.  In my defense, I was a 
                        little drunk for the last three.

                                 QUINTANO
                        You two really are perfect for each 
                        other.

           Steven shows off his wedding invitation to Huck -- a picture 
           of he and BRENDAN in matching seersucker suits and bowties.

                                 STEVEN
                        Nice, right?  I’m a sucker for 
                        seer.  So...  what exactly are your 
                        intentions with Wesley?

                                 HUCK
                        Where’d you say she was again?  

                                 STEVEN
                        I didn’t.  

           Steven smiles pleasantly.  Huck paces, impatient.   

                                 HUCK
                        I’m not gonna screw her over, okay?  
                        Tell me when she’s coming back.  

                                 STEVEN
                        Not for a few hours.  There was a 
                        problem with the insemination.   
                                 HUCK
                        What?  She’s getting inseminated?  
                        Like, as in, to have a baby?

                                 STEVEN

           Wesley hurries up to the building.  Hears her phone ring in

           Huck, growing more and more frustrated, keeps re-dialing.  

           INT. NONDESCRIPT BUILDING - DAY

           Wesley signs in.  Her phone rings again.  She picks it up.

           Huck calls again.  Wesley answers, now sounding annoyed.

                        Okay.  Getting off the phone now.

           Wesley tries to hang up, but accidentally presses the speaker 
           button on the phone without realizing.  It BEEPS.  Her 
           muffled voice comes over the speaker of Huck’s car.  

                                 WESLEY (OVER PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Look, there’s a lot of reasons.  
                        Loneliness.  Anger.  And all that 
                        meaningless sex?  It gets toxic.   

                                 HUCK

                        you’re getting older and all your

           Wesley’s phone is on speaker.  The mare we saw in the opening 
           scene flails about, injured.  The horse’s owner, BYRON, 50s, 
           talks to a VET.  Wesley’s colleagues are there as well. 

                                 WESLEY (ON PHONE)
                        You’re an idiot. 

                                 HUCK (OVER PHONE)
                        What are you doing there?!
                                 WESLEY
                        Figuring out why a mare who’s been 
                        bred repeatedly would freak out one 
                        day and jam her hoof into a stud’s 
                        testicles when he tries to mount 
                        her.  Quite a conundrum.

           Huck BURSTS INTO THE ROOM, out of breath.  

                                 HUCK
                        Well.  This is...  humiliating.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Yeah, more for me. 
                        (to Byron, pointedly)
                        Anyway.  I think your mare will be 
                        fine.  She’s probably accepted that 
                        she doesn’t have some great big 
                        romantic story coming her way.  And 
                        for the first time in her life, I 
                        bet she’s okay with it.

                                 BYRON
                        We were more wondering about our 
                        liability if the stud can’t breed.

           Wesley glares at him, then turns to Huck.  

                                 WESLEY
                        I’m obviously not having a turkey 
                        baster baby, Huck.  You can go now.  

                                 HUCK
                        I’m not leaving til you talk to me.

           Wesley crosses her arms.  Waits.  

                                 HUCK (CONT’D)
                        When I first met you, I thought you 
                        were crazy.  And the more I got to 
                        know you, the more I realized...  
                        you are crazy.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Wow.  What a nice insult.

                                 HUCK
                        Well, let’s face it.  You’re always 
                        gonna be that person who installs 
                        keystroke monitoring software on 
                        her husband’s computer and sneaks 
                        through his wallet when he’s in the 
                        shower.  You’re impulsive and 
                        excessive and willful.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HUCK (CONT'D)
                        Not to mention dangerous to 
                        yourself and others.  It’s just a 
                        matter of time before I have to 
                        bail you out again.  

                                 WESLEY
                        So what, you came here to save me?

                                 HUCK
                        I came here because I know exactly 
                        who you are.  And that is exactly 
                        who I want to be with.  

           Wesley thinks about this, her face impassive.  Then...

                                 WESLEY
                        Yes.

                                 HUCK
                        Yes what?

                                 WESLEY
                        Just yes.  Think of it as... your 
                        automatic in.  

           She grins.  He grabs her.  THEY KISS.  

           END CRAWL OVER CREDITS:

           EXT. LAS PLAYAS RESORT, BEACH - ONE YEAR LATER

           Steven and Brendan’s wedding reception.  They kiss.  A 
           TRAINER releases DOVES into the air.  They SWOOP over the 
           wedding guests, who shriek and cover their hair.  

           Kaylie and Tad play with their newborn, happy and in love.  

           Brooke, wearing a long-sleeved, floor-length dress, nestles 
           in a corner with Alan.  She stands up and trips.  Swears.  He 
           helps her up.  She smiles, surprisingly happy.  

           Wesley and Huck tango on the dance floor.  Wesley waves to 
           Quintano, who reluctantly brings over a tray of champagne 
           glasses.  She reaches for a drink.  

           Quintano notices a SPARKLING ENGAGEMENT RING on Wesley’s 
           finger at the same time we do.  He glares at her, then turns 
           on his heel and leaves.  Wesley and Huck laugh and tango 
           away.  

                                                   FADE OUT.
