                    THE HUNGRY RABBIT JUMPS 

                                By Robert Tannen 
           FADE IN:

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA - SKYLINE - DAY 

           Summer heat and haze give the city a dream-like feel.

           EXT. BROWNSTONE DUPLEX - BACKYARD - DAY 

           A Labor Day barbecue in a middle class neighborhood.

           TWENTY-FIVE FOLKS (mid 20’s to 50’s, all races) mingle, 
           eat, chat, sweat. THREE KIDS (5, 8, 10) run back and forth 
           through a sprinkler in the small yard and play in a kiddie 
           pool.

           Manning the grill is NICK GERARD, solid physique, sharp 
           mind, a high school chemistry teacher. He wears a chef’s 
           apron, works the grill. Smoke billows over him, rivers of 
           sweat course down his face.

           LAURA GERARD approaches her husband with a cold beer. 
           She’s an attractive woman with a playful, intelligent 
           twinkle in her eyes. There’s a vitality to her.

           She holds the beer to Nick’s cheek. They look out over the 
           party, some of their closest friends in the world.

                                 LAURA
                        I’m glad we did this.

                                 NICK
                        Me, too. Annabel’s kids soaked the 
                        Franklins’ cat so expect a call.

                                 LAURA
                        Maybe the monster will stop leaving us 
                        dead birds now.

           Laura kisses Nick’s neck, tastes his sweat.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Yum. I’m going to do my duty and mingle.

           Laura moves off, turns and winks at her husband. Nick 
           winks back, mouths, “Love you.” This is a couple in love.

           Nick watches Laura join her best friend TRUDY (20’s, 
           white), Trudy’s husband, MAX (30’s, white), and several 
           other FRIENDS.

           Nick turns his attention back to the grill. He prods a 
           burger. Blood oozes.
                                 NICK
                        Jimmy, rare, blue cheese, with your name 
                        on it!

           JIMMY (40’s), an ex-Philly cop, approaches.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Is that too bloody?

                                 JIMMY
                        I call it flavorful, Nicky. That’s 
                        perfect.

           Nick plops the burger on Jimmy’s plate/bun.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, brother. So how are you 
                        feeling about tomorrow?

                                 NICK
                        I’m in denial. I’ve got a few more hours 
                        of summer left.

                                 JIMMY
                        I don’t know how you do it year after 
                        year. It’s people like you, Nick, who 
                        give us all hope.

                                 NICK
                        You did your part, too, officer. Here’s 
                        to you.

                                 JIMMY
                        Here’s to both of us.

           The men toast with their beers, drink.

           A spray of water hits Nick and Jimmy. The older boy has 
           taken the hose off the sprinkler and holds it with a sly 
           grin.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        On three, Nick. You take the left flank, 
                        I got the right. Three.

           Jimmy and Nick race into the yard, chase the kids, tussle 
           with the hose.

           The five year old child grabs Nick by the leg, “tackles” 
           him. Nick mock-falls into the kiddie pool. Nick lies on 
           his back in the water, puts his arms behind his head. The 
           water feels like heaven.
           He stares up at the leafy trees and the cumulus clouds 
           which billow across the sky.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. ATTIC BEDROOM - NIGHT

           An air conditioner HUMS in the window. Beyond, there’s a 
           flash of heat lightning.

           Nick and Laura make love on their bed, sweating, grunting. 
           There’s a CLAP OF THUNDER (O.S.)--the couple flinches, 
           startled, their rhythm interrupted. They roll off each 
           other, LAUGHING.

           Laura smiles giddily.

                                 LAURA
                        Aren’t Annabel’s kids great?

                                 NICK
                        Monsters.

                                 LAURA
                        I can’t wait until we have one, you know 
                        that?

                                 NICK
                        I do.

           Laura nestles into his arm. The couple cuddle. Happy and 
           at peace.

           INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Nick drives a mid-90’s Honda Civic through the streets of 
           southwest Philly, one of the rougher areas of the city. He 
           stops at a red light. He’s the only white face to be seen.

                                 JUNKIE (O.S.)
                        Hat for the heat, hat for the sunshine! 
                        Five dollars, five dollars!

           A JUNKIE (30’s, black) works the interchange, selling 
           “vintage” (read: used), Phillies baseball hats. He 
           balances a half-dozen on his head, sweats heavily as the 
           heat wave continues.
                                 JUNKIE (CONT’D)
                        Hat for the heat, hat for the sunshine! 
                        Hey, officer, I know you a Philly fan. 
                        These here are classics.

                                 NICK
                        No, thanks, and I’m not a cop.

                                 JUNKIE
                        Alrighty, officer, how about a ferret 
                        then?

           The man opens his trench coat. A ferret sticks its head 
           out of an inner pocket.

                                 JUNKIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll give you the early bird special. Ten 
                        dollars for this cutie.

                                 NICK
                        No, thanks.

           The light turns green and Nick drives off as the junkie 
           works the cross traffic:

                                 JUNKIE (O.S) 
                        Hat for the heat, hat for the sunshine!

           Nick eyes the man in the rear view mirror. Absurd, a man 
           selling a ferret on a street corner. Welcome to 
           Philadelphia.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CHEMISTRY LAB - DAY

           The room is filled with basic chemistry equipment and 
           THIRTY NINTH GRADE STUDENTS (wearing black and white 
           “uniforms.”) All the students are black or Latino, poor, 
           and “at risk.”

           Nick (wearing safety goggles and gloves) paces in front of 
           his class, holding a vial in each hand. He’s animated--a 
           man who loves teaching.

           He focuses on one of his students who slumps on the desk, 
           head down, hands and fingers palming his head.

                                 NICK
                        Edwin, kind sir.

           EDWIN (14, Latino) maneuvers his fingers on his head into 
           giving Nick the finger.
                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Head up, please.

           Edwin raises his head. Ferocious eyes. It’s as if somebody 
           has sucked the humanity out of him.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Potassium chlorate. Sugar.

           Nick pours the two together in a beaker.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Nothing. No reaction. But now I add one 
                        drop of sulfuric acid.

           Nick squeezes in a drop of sulfuric acid. The reaction of 
           the chemicals creates an intense, white flame.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        How beautiful is that, people? A simple, 
                        chemical reaction.

           Soaring past the lights of downtown’s skyscrapers. On the 
           horizon, there’s the flickering of heat lightning.

           Among the downtown buildings, is an illuminated half dome. 
           This is the Kimmel Center, home of the Philadelphia 
           Orchestra.

           INT. KIMMEL CENTER - NIGHT 

           The Philadelphia Orchestra slugs their way through 
           Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring.”

           Among the orchestra is Trudy (violin) and Max (cello).

           LAURA, looking striking in a tux, works the violin, 
           sitting amongst the second violins.

           INT. ICE RINK - NIGHT 

           A men’s hockey league. The level of play leaves much to be 
           desired.
           Nick skates down the rink, working the puck. He winds up, 
           shoots, sends the shot high up over the boards. His shot 
           is met with ribbing from his teammates.

                                 JIMMY
                        Look out for Gretzky!

           Nick smiles big (showing his mouthguard), glides back of 
           to the spot where he whiffed.

                                 NICK
                        Wet spot! Right there! Zamboni!

           His teammates GUFFAW at his weak excuse.

                        We only lost by one. And I didn’t get 
                        injured. So it was a good night.

           EXT. KIMMEL CENTER - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 

           Laura’s on her cell, in a dressing room shared with other 
           performers.

                        survived another first day.

           Laura gathers her stuff, moves out of the room and through 
           the backstage area, still talking on her cell.

                                 NICK

           LATER

           Outside, Laura, Trudy and Max hug goodbye. The wind has 
           kicked up, the storm on the way, fat raindrops PEPPER the

           head the opposite way.

           INT. ELEVATOR - MOVING - NIGHT

           The elevator ascends. Laura glances at the inspection 
           report. The glass covering the report has been graffitied 
           over and the report can’t be seen.

           The doors open. Laura exits and makes her way toward her 
           car.

           A METALLIC CLICK (O.S.)--

           Laura freezes, glances behind her as the elevator doors 
           close. She scans the parking garage...

           She sees nobody, just a few parked vehicles under the weak 
           lighting.

           Laura continues to her Suburu Outback. She enters the car, 
           quickly shuts the door. She locks the doors.

           Laura’s visibly relieved, safe in her car--

           A SHARP TAP TAP on the window--the muzzle of a gun--a 
           stocking-headed man--Laura SCREAMS--glimpse of a lizard 
           tattoo on the man’s neck--she reaches for the ignition 
           button--

           GLASS SHATTERS, rains down upon her.

           entrance.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           Nick, shell-shocked, dripping from the rain, hurries down 
           a long, anonymous hallway.

           INT. ICU UNIT - NIGHT 

           A NURSE leads Nick to a patient room. She knocks once on 
           the door, opens it.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Nick is led in by the NURSE. There’s A DOCTOR, A SECOND 
           NURSE (working a feed line), and A DETECTIVE in the room.

                                 NURSE
                              (to the men)
                        Husband.

           Nick freezes as he sees Laura. She’s asleep and sedated. 
           There are bright red scratch marks across her neck. One 
           eye is swollen shut, the size of an apple. She’s hooked up 
           to an IV and an EKG machine. Her heartbeat BEEPS.

           Nick slowly approaches. Crouches beside his wife.

                                 NICK
                        Is she going to be okay?

                                 DOCTOR BURDETTE
                        Mr. Gerard, I’m Doctor Burdette.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        I’m Detective Douglas, Mr. Gerard.
                                 DOCTOR BURDETTE 
                        Her eye socket’s broken. She has several 
                        deep lacerations. We’re also concerned 
                        that she might have internal bleeding.

           Nick fights tears.

                                 NICK
                        Jesus.

                                 DOCTOR BURDETTE 
                        We’re keeping a close watch. Internal 
                        bleeding is very dangerous.

           Nick shakes his head in dismay.

           He eyes the detective.

                                 NICK 
                        You know who did it?

                                 DETECTIVE
                              (matter of fact)
                        Not yet. But your wife gave us a 
                        description. He’s got a distinctive 
                        tattoo. Here...

           The detective runs a finger down the side of his neck.

                                 DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
                        ...a lizard.

                                 NICK
                        That’s all you have?

                                 DETECTIVE
                        We have the rapist’s semen. We’ll run the 
                        DNA. If we get a match in our database, 
                        then we know who we’re looking for.

           NICK’S CONCERN FOR HIS WIFE IS TURNING TO ANGER: WHY THE 
              HELL DID THIS HAPPEN TO US?

                                 NICK
                              (pause)
                        I’d like a moment alone with my wife.

           The men and nurse exit the room.

           Nick turns back to Laura. He’s still trying to wrap his 
           head around the reality of this. It’s like a nightmare 
           come to life.
           He watches Laura breathe, listens to the medical machinery 
           working. It’s horrible. He leans in close to her.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to be okay, sweetie. 
                        Everything’s going to be okay. You hear 
                        me?

           Nick kisses his wife’s cheek. His lips linger.

           He feels devastated.

           And powerless.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. ICU - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT 

           Nick fills out admitting forms.

                                 JIMMY (O.S.)
                        Nicky.

           Jimmy enters, trailed by Trudy (tears) and Max. They take 
           turns hugging Nick.

           There’s an awkward silence. Nothing to say.

           INT. HOSPITAL - LOBBY - NIGHT

           Nick and his friends sit, drinking coffees out of 
           Styrofoam cups. In the b.g., the rainstorm continues 
           through the front windows/doors.

                                 TRUDY
                        That’s absurd, Nick.

                                 NICK
                        I go for the drink, this doesn’t happen.

                                 JIMMY
                        Stop it.

                                 NICK
                        It’s true.

                                 JIMMY
                        Just fucking stop it.

           Nick, angry, moves to the windows. Jimmy joins him. He 
           hands him a paper bag with a fifth of Maker’s Mark. 
                                 NICK 
                        They’ll never get the asshole who did 
                        this.

           Jimmy’s silent.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        They won’t, will they, Jimmy?

                                 JIMMY
                        It’s Philly, Nick. You know.

           Jimmy cracks open the fifth.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Here, have a taste.

           The men take swigs.

           They rejoin Trudy and Max, share the bottle.

                                 NICK 
                        I’m going to stay with her tonight. Go 
                        home, guys, get some rest.

           There are unsure glances among the friends.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I’m fine. Get out of here.

                                 JIMMY
                        We’ll be back first thing. You call if 
                        you need something before then, my cell’s 
                        on all night.

           Nick nods. Everyone hugs goodbye.

           Nick watches his friends exit, disappear into the rainy 
           night.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 

           Nick sits in a chair, feeling a raging mix of anger, guilt 
           and sorrow. He’s alone in the room with Laura, watching 
           her sleeping, listening to the cold beeps of the medical 
           instruments and the rain pelting the window.

           He takes a hit from the fifth. He gets up and exits the 
           room.

                                                            CUT TO:
           INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

           Mounted in an upper corner, a TV (with the sound muted) 
           shows a travel show about the Fjords of Norway.

           Nick, the only one in the waiting room, stares numbly up 
           at the screen.

           A MAN (40’s, white, a focused energy) enters the room. He 
           wears a generic, grey suit. This is SIMON. 

           Simon takes a seat two rows behind Nick, who looks blankly 
           up to the television.

                                 SIMON
                              (re: infomercial)
                        Where is this?

                                 NICK
                        Norway.

                                 SIMON 
                        Beautiful.

           The men watch the show.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        I went to Iceland couple years back. 
                        Stunning place. It’s always good to get 
                        out of your space, get out of your head.
                              (pause)
                        Who do you have in here?

                                 NICK
                        My wife. You?

                                 SIMON
                        Nobody.

           Nick eyes Simon. Simon has the calm, slightly unsettling 
           demeanor of a funeral home director.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        What happened to Laura, it shouldn’t have 
                        happened.

                                 NICK
                              (pause)
                        You’re a detective?

                                 SIMON
                        No. My name’s Simon. A friend told me  
                        about tonight. How are you holding up?
           Simon doesn’t wait for an answer.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        That was a stupid question, wasn’t it? 
                        You’re a wreck. Who the hell wouldn’t be?

           Simon moves to a seat closer to Nick, lowers his voice.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        The man who did this to your wife was 
                        paroled three weeks ago. He’s done it 
                        before, he’ll do it again.

           Simon glances out the hallway. He’s making sure nobody is 
           there, nobody listening.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        I know what you’re feeling. Years ago, I 
                        experienced it myself.

           Simon studies Nick, sizing him up.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Nick, I represent an organization that 
                        deals with people, terrible people, 
                        people like the man who raped your wife.
                              (pause)
                        We can take care of him. It would need to 
                        happen tonight.

                                 NICK
                        What the hell are you talking about?

                                 SIMON
                        You understand what I’m saying, don’t 
                        you?

           The two men lock eyes.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        If you want this to happen, you need to 
                        understand one thing about the way we 
                        work: we might ask something in return.
                              (pause)
                        We might ask you to watch somebody for a 
                        few hours, or break a security camera, 
                        little things like this. Or maybe 
                        something bigger.
                              (pause)
                        But most likely, Mr. Gerard, you’ll never 
                        hear anything from us for the rest of 
                        your life.
                                 NICK
                        Who’s “we”?

           Simon ignores Nick’s question.

                                 SIMON
                        We could tell the authorities. Of course, 
                        police in this city...no guarantees 
                        there.
                              (pause)
                        If he’s caught, there will be a trial. 
                        Your wife, assuming she didn’t drop the 
                        charges, would be forced to re-live the 
                        night over and over. The lawyers will 
                        question her, bring up her sexual 
                        history, they’ll manufacture lies. All 
                        they need is the smallest hint of doubt. 
                        It will be a terrible experience for her. 
                        And you.
                              (pause)
                        This is your decision.

                                 NICK
                        You know where he is?

                                 SIMON
                        Yes. I need an answer--there’s a time 
                        issue.

                                 NICK
                        Where is he?

                                 SIMON
                        It can’t work like that.

                                 NICK
                        This is a joke, right? A sick joke.

                                 SIMON
                        The farthest thing.

                              (pause)
                        No. No.

           Nick rises, heads toward the door. Simon follows.

                                 SIMON 
                        There’s a row of vending machines in the 
                        Oncology Department lobby. If you want 
                        this to happen, select the Eternity Bar. 
                        Buy two of them. Do it in the next hour.
                              (pause)

                        And, Mr. Gerard, we never talked, you 
                        never met me.

           Simon slips past Nick and exits.

           Nick steps into the hallway in time to see Simon boarding 
           an elevator. A last glance between the men--a slight nod 
           (do it) from Simon--and then Simon’s gone.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 

           Nick stares down at the battered face of his wife. He puts 
           a hand on her forehead, brushes back her hair--Laura 
           violently swats his hand away, turns away from him with an 
           ANIMAL-LIKE YELP. Then she’s immediately back asleep, 
           having never really awoken under her sedation.

           Nick paces the small room like a caged animal.

           He stops at the end of her bed, stares down at Laura.

           He heads out of the room.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Nick approaches the Oncology Building. He stares across 
           the street and into the

           EXT/INT. HOSPITAL - ONCOLOGY LOBBY  - NIGHT

           Through the rain and floor-to-ceiling windows, three 
           people can be seen inside:

           (1) A NIGHT GUARD (60’s, black) mans a security desk.

           (2) A DOCTOR (30’s, Indian, doctor’s coat) eats a bag of 
           peanuts, talks on his cell.

           (3) A CANCER PATIENT (30’s, gaunt, shaved head, white, 
           earring, hospital gown,) stands by the windows staring 
           out.

           The entrance doors glide open and Nick enters, shakes out 
           his umbrella. He receives a nod from the security guard.
           MUZAK plays from ceiling speakers. There’s a security 
           camera trained on the entrance. The doctor CHATS IN HINDI 
           on his cell.

           Nick makes his way to the vending machines. He eyes the 
           selections, spots the Eternity Bars. He feeds a dollar 
           into the machine.

           Nick debates.

           He presses the button for the Eternity Bar. The bar CLANGS 
           down to the retainer. He buys a second one.

           Nick takes the bars. The wrapper says, “Eat Smart, Do 
              Great Things.”

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                              (slight Jamaican accent)
                        You sure you want the healthy one?

                                 NICK
                        Excuse me?

                                 GUARD
                        The way I see it, if you’re going to have 
                        a treat, you might as well have something 
                        worth it. I get myself the jalapeno chips 
                        and a Mountain Dew and I’m happy.

           The guard grins. Nick doesn’t know what the hell is going 
           on. Is this man just making conversation, or is he 
           involved with Simon?

                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Me, I got high blood pressure so those 
                        chips are not on my approved diet, but 
                        you know what I figure? I have a heart 
                        attack, I’m in the right place.

           Nick glances at the doctor, still babbling in Hindi, then 
           at the cancer patient who stares out the window. Nick 
           realizes the man is watching Nick in the reflection of the 
           window. Or not. It’s impossible to tell.

           Nick moves to the exit.

                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Stay dry.

           Nick nods, snaps open his umbrella. He glances at Cancer 
           again. Cancer stares at him with a creepy, menacing look. 
           Nick is rattled and exits.
           OUTSIDE

           Under his umbrella, Nick glances back at the Oncology 
           lobby. Cancer moves through the lobby and out the exit. He 
           disappears around the corner.

           Nick wonders what the hell he’s set in motion. He heads 
           back up the street to the ICU and his wife’s room.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. THAI RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The place is a joint, nothing fancy, filled with downtown  
           artists, third shift workers, and night owls.

           A MAN (40’s, mixed race) sits by the windows. He wears a 
           zip-up Ecko sweatshirt, jeans, and high-end work boots.

           He slurps his soup. Focused. Calm.

           Feeling the heat of the soup, starting to sweat, he unzips 
           his sweatshirt. 

           Sprouting out of his collar, on the side of his neck, is 
           the LIZARD TATTOO with a flicking tongue.

           This is the man who raped Laura.

           He glances out the window as he feels eyes upon him.

           A JEEP slowly passes. HIP HOP THUMPS from inside. The 
           DRIVER (black, 30’s, sideburns, with a semi-
           hipster/gangster look that could blend into any area of 
           the city) locks eyes with Lizard. And then the Jeep and 
           the man disappear into the night, the thumping music 
           lingering...then gone.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Lizard enters the run-down apartment house where he lives.

           INT. APARTMENT HOUSE - STAIRWELL - NIGHT 

           Lizard climbs the stairs toward his floor. His boots CLOMP 
           on the linoleum.

           He stops. Listens. He heard something. He peers up. Then 
           down below. Sees nothing. He continues up--
                                 SIDEBURNS
                        Mr. Hodge?

           Lizard freezes. Two men stand behind him.  “SIDEBURNS,” 
           from the Jeep and “CANCER,” the man from the Oncology 
           lobby. Cancer flashes some sort of badge, shows his gun in 
           his waistband.

                                 SIDEBURNS (CONT’D)
                        Keep going, Mr. Hodge.

                                 LIZARD
                        What the fuck?

                                 SIDEBURNS
                        Keep walking up.

                                 LIZARD
                        What the hell is this bullshit?

                                 SIDEBURNS
                        Up. Now.

           The men climb up the stairs.

           EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT 

           The rain has ceased--mist swirls off the rooftop. Cancer 
           leads Lizard to the edge of the roof.

                                 LIZARD
                        This is wrong, man.

           They reach the edge of the roof. Lizard glances down: five 
           stories below is an empty lot. Sideburns puts a gun to 
           Lizard’s forehead.

                                 SIDEBURNS
                        Did you rape a woman tonight, Frank? 
                        Public garage over on Filbert.

           Sideburns pushes the barrel of the gun against Lizard’s 
           skin.

                                 LIZARD
                        I don’t know what you’re talking about.

                                 SIDEBURNS
                        What were you doing at eleven-fifteen 
                        tonight?

                                 LIZARD
                        I was in my place. Watching TV.
                                 SIDEBURNS
                        What were you watching?

                                 LIZARD
                        The news.

                                 SIDEBURNS
                        What was the lead story?

                                 LIZARD
                        I don’t remember...it was a crash. A 
                        plane crash.

           Sideburns pockets his gun.

           Then, in an instant, he expertly kicks out one of Lizard’s 
           legs, shoves Lizard over the side.

           Lizard lets out a SHOUT then falls. He hits the mud with a 
           DULL THUD. Sideburns and Cancer eye the motionless body 
           below.

           Sideburns takes out his cell, speed-dials.

                                 SIDEBURNS 
                        It’s done.

           He shuts his cell. The men leave the roof.

           The lights of the Philly skyline flicker in the rain.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. ICU WAITING ROOM - DAY 

           Daylight streams through the windows, the storm over.

           A few RANDOM RELATIVES of ICU patients are scattered 
           about. The TV is set to a morning news show.

           Nick pours a cup of coffee from the coffee machine in the 
           corner. He looks terrible, barely slept.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Gerard?

           Nick turns and faces a MAN (30’s, dress shirt and tie), 
           some sort of hospital administrator.

                                 NICK
                        Yes.
                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        We need you to fill out a few more 
                        insurance forms, sir.

           The administrator hands Nick a sealed envelope.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR (CONT’D)
                        If you could get to it right away, that 
                        would be great. Thank you.

           The administrator turns and leaves the room.

           Nick sits, sips his coffee. He opens the envelope--A 
           POLAROID photo falls to the floor.

           It’s a photo of the dead rapist. The photo is a tight shot 
           of the guy’s face, the lizard tattoo on his neck is 
           clearly visible.

           Nick pockets the photo, glances about the room nervously. 
           Nobody’s looking at him.

           He moves to the

           HALLWAY

           Glances up and down. There’s no sign of the 
           “administrator.”

           Nick approaches his wife’s room. Through the door he sees 
           a nurse drawing blood. Laura looks terrible: pale, purple 
           and black bruises, rings under her eyes.

           Nick takes a deep breath and enters the room.

                                 NICK
                        Hi.

           Laura tries a small smile but it comes out very weak.

           LATER

           Nick and Laura are alone. Laura stares out the window, the 
           sunlight streaming in.

           Nick rises, shuts the door.

           He sits beside his wife.
                                 NICK
                        I talked to the police this morning.
                              (pause)
                        They found the rapist.

           Laura looks to Nick, wanting more details.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        He’s dead. Committed suicide.

           Beat.

           Laura tears up. Then cries hard, emotion flooding over 
           her. Nick puts his arms around her, trying to comfort her.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Everything’s going to be okay.

           Nick says it as much to convince himself as he does for 
           Laura.

                                                    FADE THROUGH TO:

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA SKYLINE - DAY 

           A claustrophobic grey sky of early November.

           SUPER: “FIFTEEN MONTHS LATER.”

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA - PARK - DAWN 

           Nick jogs through a downtown park.

           He runs out of the park, across a thoroughfare and into an 
           above-ground

           PARKING STRUCTURE

           He runs across the lower level and enters the

           STAIRWELL

           He runs up the stairs, taking them two at a time. Pushing 
           himself to the fifth floor--the top floor--and out through 
           the door.
           ROOFTOP PARKING LEVEL

           Nick sprints to the end of his workout. He puts his hands 
           over his head, feeling the good pain of the workout. A 
           small, satisfied smile forms.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DOWNTOWN LOFT - DAY

           THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS. They turn one by one.

           REVEAL: high ceilings, sealed cement floors, brick walls, 
           an open floor plan. The large windows reveal a slice of 
           the Philly skyline.

           Nick enters with two cappuccinos and the paper. The loft 
           is Nick and Laura’s home now.

                                 NICK
                        I’m back!

           Laura heads down, still in her bathrobe.

                                 LAURA
                        Morning.

           The couple peck hello, she takes the coffee.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.

           Laura takes her coffee, a section of the paper, and sits 
           on the couch.

                                 NICK
                        You’re not going to Pilates?

                                 LAURA
                        I don’t think so.

                                 NICK
                        You should go. It’ll make you feel good.

                                 LAURA
                        I feel fine.

           Nick moves behind her, massages her shoulders. Then kisses 
           her neck.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Nick...not now.
           Nick backs off.

                                 NICK
                        No problem. I’m taking a shower.

           Nick makes his way up the stairs to the bedroom area.

           At the top of the stairs, he glances back to Laura. Their 
           eyes meet. He tries a smile. She doesn’t return it, looks 
           back down at the paper. A tenseness is evident in their 
           relationship.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 

           Nick (goggles and gloves) stands before THIS YEAR’S 
           STUDENTS. He holds a rose above a beaker of liquid 
           nitrogen. He blows the rose, the petals flutter.

           Nick drops the rose in the beaker. Removes the rose with 
           tweezers. The rose glitters. He drops the rose on the 
           floor. It shatters.

                                 NICK
                        Liquid nitrogen.

           Nick eyes his class. And there’s Edwin. His problem 
           student from the previous year, repeating his class. Edwin 
           has grown a weak moustache. He’s blowing a bubble, bigger 
           and bigger...POP.

           Nick gestures for Edwin to join him in the hall.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                              (to the class)
                        Think about everyday uses of liquid 
                        nitrogen.

           IN THE HALLWAY

           Nick and Edwin.

                                 NICK 
                        Our second year together. Now as much as 
                        I do like you, Edwin, I also know that 
                        you are probably getting tired of me.  
                        Right? You’ve heard all my bad jokes, and 
                        you know all my tricks.

           Edwin raises his head, chomps his gum, stares daggers at 
           Nick.
                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Let me tell you a secret, just between 
                        you and me. When I was your age, I hated 
                        the world, too.

           Edwin scowls, not wanting to be lectured by Nick.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        But here’s the thing that I know now: it 
                        gets better. It’s never perfect. No. But 
                        it gets better.

           Edwin shuffles uncomfortably.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        You’re smart. Science, math, whatever you 
                        wanted to do, if you applied yourself, 
                        you’d be outstanding.

           Edwin is silent. Nick might be getting through to him.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Go back in there and let’s get to work.

           Edwin chews his gum, doesn’t move.

                                 EDWIN
                        Fuck you.

                                 NICK
                              (frustrated)
                        Your choice. You know where to go.

           Edwin shuffles like a tough guy down the hall towards the 
           administration offices.

                                 EDWIN
                        Fuck you, pussy!

           Nick takes a moment. Composes himself.

           He’s not going to let one kid get to him. He re-enters his 
           class.

                                 NICK (O.S.) 
                        Uses of Liquid Nitrogen! Tell me, people!

           EXT. RITTENHOUSE SQUARE - DAY

           A beautiful, small public park in the heart of the city. A 
           small placard indicates this is:
           “RITTENHOUSE SQUARE -- EST. 1683” 

           The park is surrounded by upscale town homes, restaurants, 
           and a large, Episcopal church.

           LAURA sits on a bench, watching the water dance in a 
           fountain. It’s peaceful, even meditative.

           She takes out her cell and speed-dials.

           End of the school day and Nick’s packing up. His cell 
           RINGS. ID shows, “LAURA.”

                                 NICK
                        Hi.

                                 LAURA (PHONE)
                        I’m sorry about this morning.

           INTERCUT

                                 NICK
                        There’s nothing to be sorry about.

                                 LAURA
                        Sometimes I just...I can’t shake it.

                                 NICK
                        I know.

                                 LAURA
                        I wish it had never happened.

                                 NICK
                        Me, too. But it did...and we’re doing 
                        fine. Right?

                                 LAURA
                              (pause)
                        How was your day?

                                 NICK
                        Looking forward to tonight.

           Nick’s at the windows of his classroom, looking out over 
           the schoolyard. Beyond the yard, is an inner city 
           commercial strip.
                                 LAURA
                        Don’t forget your tux.

                                 NICK
                        I’m picking it up as soon as I leave 
                        school.

           Suddenly, Nick grows very still. He eyes a SUV parked at 
           the curb. There’s a man in the driver’s seat whose profile 
           is familiar.

              Cancer. The man from the Oncology lab.

              But is it him? The sun reflecting off the car window makes 
           it impossible to be certain.

                                 LAURA
                        See you soon. I love you, Nick.

                                 NICK
                        Me, too, honey.

           Nick hangs up. He squints at the SUV.

           He can’t be sure if it’s Cancer or not.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. TEACHER’S PARKING LOT - DAY

           Nick exits the school, cautiously heads across the lot 
           toward his car.

           He looks out to the commercial strip.

           The SUV is gone.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. FORMAL WEAR SHOP - DAY

           Nick waits for his tux. A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER shop for a 
           wedding dress.

           Nick feels eyes upon him. He turns, looks out to the 
           street. The sidewalks are crowded with PEDESTRIANS. He 
           doesn’t see anyone watching him, doesn’t recognize any 
           faces.

           Then he sees the SUV across the street, the same one that 
           was outside his school. The driver, Cancer, staring 
           directly at Nick.
           Cancer puts the SUV in gear and starts off.

           Nick moves quickly out the door, spots the rear of the 
           SUV. No plates.

           The SUV disappears into traffic.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. KIMMEL CENTER - NIGHT 

           PATRONS arrive, dressed in tuxes and formal gowns.

           INT. KIMMEL CENTER - NIGHT 

           The theater fills for the performance. There’s the BUZZ OF 
           THE AUDIENCE and the DISCORDANT SOUND of the orchestra 
           tuning up.

           Nick (tux) moves down an aisle, finds his seat beside 
           Jimmy near the front of the theater.

                                 JIMMY
                        Thanks for the invite--I could be 
                        watching the Flyers, you know?

           Nick glances out over the audience. Hundreds of anonymous 
           faces. He’s wary after spotting Cancer earlier.

           Nick eyes Laura, tuning her violin. She’s a sight. 
           Beautiful.

           She looks up. She and Nick share small, loving smiles.

                                 NICK 
                              (mouthing)
                        Kick ass.

           Laura winks, then focuses.

           The CONDUCTOR enters to APPLAUSE. The center grows very 
           quiet. The baton is raised and Haydn’s Symphony No. 103 
           begins.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 

           It’s the post-performance opening night party. The high-
           ceilinged space is filled with performers and supporters. 
           A JAZZ TRIO PLAYS. The mood is festive.
           Nick, Laura, Trudy, Jimmy, and Max stand at a table, 
           drinking and socializing.

                                 JIMMY
                        ...five years I dated Gong Wu, this is 
                        when I lived in China.

                                 TRUDY
                        You never lived in China.

                                 JIMMY
                        Trudy, please. Gong Wu was the love of my 
                        life.

                                 LAURA
                        What about your ex?

                                 JIMMY
                        People, can I tell a joke here?

           Jimmy takes a piece of folded paper out of his pocket.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        When Gong Wu broke up with me, she wrote 
                        me this long letter. Now you all don’t 
                        mind if I read to you what she said?

                                 MAX
                        Tell us.

           Jimmy unfolds the paper.

                                 JIMMY
                        When Gong Wu broke my heart into a 
                        million tiny pieces, this is what she 
                        wrote...

           Jimmy “reads” from the sheet of paper. He speaks CHINESE 
           GIBBERISH. It’s the punch line. Everybody LAUGHS.

           Jimmy jiggles his glass, empty, only ice cubes left.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Nicky, your turn.

                                 NICK
                        Who else is thirsty?

           AT THE BAR

           Nick orders from the bartender.
                                 NICK
                        ...a Kir Royale, and a Johnnie Walker 
                        Black neat.

           The bartender moves off to make the drinks. Nick glances 
           about the crowded room: the people, the music, the buzz of 
           conversation and laughter. It’s all so civilized and 
           wonderful.

           Nick’s cell BUZZES. ID shows, “RESTRICTED.”

                        Bring them the drinks, tell them you have 
                        to make a call, come outside.

                                 NICK
                        Who is this?

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        It’s Simon. We need to talk.

           Nick is frozen. It’s the moment he had almost convinced 
           himself would never come.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Do it now.

           Simon hangs up. Nick scans the room, peers out the windows 
           to the street. He doesn’t see any sign of Simon.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 

           Nick exits, scans the street. There are a few pedestrians. 
           Nick’s cell BUZZES. ID shows, “RESTRICTED.”

                                 NICK
                        Hello?

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        See the liquor store on the corner?

           Nick eyes the store.

                                 NICK
                        Yes.

                                 SIMON (PHONE) 
                        Meet me in there.
           Simon hangs up. Nick crosses the street, walks to the 
           liquor store and enters.

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT 

           Nick enters, passes through a metal detector. It BEEPS.

                                 CLERK (O.S.)
                        Take out your keys and cell phone, go 
                        through again.

           Nick puts his keys and cell into the empty Cool Whip 
           container. He passes through the metal detector again with 
           no problem. He collects his personals, moves down an 
           aisle.

           He stares up at a bubble mirror which shows every aisle in 
           the store. There’s nobody here but him and the clerk.

           Nick’s cell BUZZES.

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        Buy a pack of gum, come back outside. 

           Nick buys a pack of gum, exits. An SUV (Mercedes, tinted 
           windows, temp plates) turns the corner, approaches, stops 
           before him and idles.

           The back door opens. Simon’s inside.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Come on in, Nick.

                                 NICK
                        What do you want?

           Nick glances at the driver: Sideburns, the man who killed 
           the rapist. But Nick has never seen him before.

                                 SIMON
                        Relax. A quick talk. Come in and shut the 
                        door.

                                 NICK
                        What’s this about?

                                 SIMON
                        What do you think?

           Beat.

           Nick enters the SUV, closes the door. The SUV idles.
           Simon hands Nick a sealed envelope. It’s addressed to, 
           “SANTA CLAUS. NORTH POLE.” A stamp is already affixed.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        There’s a mailbox at Girard and 34th. Go 
                        there after work tomorrow. I want you to 
                        mail that letter at exactly 3:30.

                                 NICK
                        What is it?

                                 SIMON
                        It’s a letter to Santa Claus. We’d like 
                        you to mail it for us.

                                 NICK
                              (pause)
                        And then I’m even?

                                 SIMON
                        It’s not up to me.

                                 NICK
                        Who’s it up to?

                                 SIMON
                        All I know is you need to mail the letter 
                        at 3:30 tomorrow.

           Nick hesitates.

           Then he pockets the letter and exits the SUV. The SUV 
           drives down the street, turns the corner, and is gone.

           Nick heads back to the restaurant. He’s rattled.

           He takes a breath, calming himself. He eyes the restaurant 
           across the street.

           He spots Laura inside with their friends. She’s buzzed. 
           Laughing. Beautiful. Vivacious.

           For this moment, she’s how he remembers her before the 
           fateful night.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Nick weaves his way back to his wife and friends. Laura 
           whispers in his ear.

                                 LAURA
                        I missed you, handsome.
           She kisses his neck. Then instinctively senses something’s 
           bothering him.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Everything okay?

                                 NICK
                        All good.

           Laura wants to believe him.

                                 LAURA
                        Who was on the phone?

                                 NICK
                        Colleague. School stuff.

                                 LAURA
                        Boring.

           Laura kisses her husband again, presses up against him 
           suggestively.

           INT. LOFT - NIGHT 

           Laura climbs up to the bedroom area. She glances back down 
           at Nick, throwing him an exaggerated, sexy smile.

                                 LAURA
                        You coming?

                                 NICK
                        Three minutes.

           Laura disappears above.

           Nick takes the envelope out of his tux jacket pocket. He 
           holds it up to the kitchen light. Can’t make out what’s 
           written on the sheets of paper inside.

           He eyes the seal closely, debates whether to open it. 
           Decides against it.

           Nick hides the envelope in his shoulder bag between 
           teaching folders.

           Nick climbs the stairs. Laura steps out of the bathroom, 
           in lingerie. She moves to Nick, presses up against him.

           They kiss. Laura runs her hands over Nick’s back.
                                 LAURA
                        You’re all tense.

                                 NICK
                        I’m fine.

           Laura leads him to the bed. She pushes him down, straddles 
           him, starts to unbutton his tux shirt.

           INT. NICK’S CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Nick drives through Philly.

           He pulls up to 34th and Girard. He finds himself in front 
           of the Philadelphia Zoo.

           He scans the area. Doesn’t see any mailbox. He checks the 
           dashboard time, “3:27.” His cell BUZZES in his pocket. ID 
           shows: “RESTRICTED.”

                                 NICK

                        I don’t see any mailbox.

                        Open the letter.

           Nick opens the envelope. There’s a sheet of legal paper 
           folded in thirds. Inside is another folded sheet of paper. 
           There’s a phone number (703 555-8905) and three xeroxed 
           photos on the sheet: 

           (1) A WOMAN (40’s, white).

           (2) A MAN (40’s, white, glasses, mop of hair, intense 
           eyes).

           (3) TWO GIRLS (6 & 8, white).

                        Enter the zoo. You’ll see a gift shop. 
                        Buy a paperback. Sit at one of the 
                        benches and watch the entrance. If they 
                        show up, follow them. If that man 
                        appears, you call the number immediately. 
                        Understand?
                                 NICK
                        Yes.

                                 SIMON (PHONE) 
                        Now tear up the sheet until it’s 
                        confetti. Remember what the man looks 
                        like.

           Simon hangs up. Nick takes a last glance at the paper, 
           committing the PHONE NUMBER to memory.

           He rips the sheet into tiny pieces, flutters the pieces 
           into a trash bin.

           INT. ZOO - DAY 

           Nick sits at a bench, holding a paperback, eyeing the 
           entrance.

           He spots the woman and the two girls enter. He follows 
           them.

           To Nick, they just look like a young, happy family, the 
           girls racing excitedly from exhibit to exhibit.

           LATER

           Nick follows the woman and girls as they exit the zoo. 
           They make their way to a Volvo, get in and drive away.

           Nick is left standing alone at the edge of the parking 
           lot. The sun is setting and his cell is silent.

           Nick’s face clouds, he’s not sure what exactly he did, 
           what any of this means.

                                                            CUT TO:

           Nick grades papers. He’s alone. Laura’s at work.

           His cell RINGS. ID shows, “RESTRICTED.”

                                 NICK 
                        Hello?

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        We need you to do one more thing for us.
           Nick tenses at the sound of Simon’s voice.

                                 SIMON (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Behind your refrigerator, you’ll find 
                        instructions.

           He gets up and eyes the refrigerator, covered with 
           scrambled letter magnets.

           Nick glances around his loft nervously. Was somebody in 
              here?

                                 NICK
                        What are you talking about?

                        Your alibi is you witnessed a suicide.

           Simon lets the sentence sink in.

                        After it’s over, make sure you get rid of 
                        the instructions, shred them.

           Nick is silent.

                        I don’t understand what you’re asking me 
                        to do.

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        It’s all in the instructions.

           Simon hangs up. Nick slowly shuts his cell. He nervously 
           eyes the fridge. Approaches.

           He spots a scuff mark in front of the fridge.

              Someone was in here.

           He maneuvers the fridge away from its wall space.

           Laura STOPS PLAYING (O.S.)--Nick freezes...hears the 
           BATHROOM DOOR CLOSE above. Then the SINK RUNNING.

           Nick removes an envelope from the slot on the back of the 
           fridge.

           AT THE KITCHEN COUNTER

           Nick tears open the envelope. He pulls out four sheets of 
           paper. He looks through them:

           SHEET 1: A photo of one LEON WALCZAK. It’s the same man 
           who was on the sheet at the zoo.

           SHEET 2: A two paragraph bio on Walczak describing him as 
           a child pornographer who hides behind the job of a network 
           administrator.

           SHEET 3: A collage of pictures of GIRLS between the ages 
           of five and eight. Walczak’s victims.

           SHEET 4: A page of extremely specific instructions on how 
           to murder Walczak, although the words “murder” and “kill” 
           are never mentioned.

           Nick’s appalled. This is wrong. It’s wrong and very messed 
              up.

           Nick moves to the balcony and steps outside. He closes the 
           door behind him. He punches in numbers on his cell as he 
           repeats the numbers (memorized from the slip of paper at 
           the zoo) to himself:

                                 NICK
                        703 555-8905.

           There’s one RING, then:
                                 RECORDING (PHONE)
                        The number you have dialed has been

                        disconnected or is no longer in service.

           Nick hangs up. He stares out over the city, the WHITE 
           NOISE of the metropolis drifting up over him.

                        Early meeting.

           Nick glances at the clock. He slowly and carefully folds 
           his section of the paper, as if delaying the terrible 
           chore ahead of him.

           Nick rises, pecks his wife goodbye. She senses something’s 
           off.

                                 LAURA
                        You okay?

           Nick grabs his jacket and shoulder bag and exits.

           Nick approaches his car.

           INT. CAR - DAY 

           Nick turns the ignition. Car doesn’t start.

           He takes a moment then tries again. The battery’s dead.
           Nick is a bundle of nerves, realizing this is really 
           happening.

           He takes out the instructions and studies them one last 
           time...

                                 NICK (V.O.)

                                 NICK (V.O.)
                        “If he’s not on the 7:12, wait for the

                        7:55 train, go to work.”

           The train slows to the next stop. Nick makes his way out 
           onto the

           SUBWAY PLATFORM

           Nick eyes the waiting COMMUTERS, searching for Walczak.

                                 NICK (V.O.) 
                        “There are two security cameras, one 
                        behind you, one in front across the 
                        tracks. Neither camera will work.”

           Nick glances up at two security cameras.

           He turns his attention back to the crowd...

           He spots Walczak (baseball hat, scarf, rough beard) 
           standing in front of the tracks. Nick makes his way 
           through the waiting commuters and up behind Walczak.

           Nick stares at the back of Walczak’s head, his unshaven 
           neck.

           A LOW RUMBLING (O.S.). Heads turn at the sound of the 
           approaching train. The train’s headlight appears in the 
           tunnel.

           The crowd moves nearer to the tracks. Nick shuffles closer 
           to Walczak.
           BRAKES SQUEAL (O.S.) as the train enters the station.

           NICK stands very still.

           Here comes the train...

           The lights...

           WHAM!--THE TRAIN powers past, comes to a SCREECHING stop.

           THE DOORS of the train open.

           In steps Walczak. Nick hasn’t done it--hasn’t killed him--
           wasn’t able to do it.

           Nick watches the subway car move off through the station 
           and disappear into a tunnel.

           THE HARSH PERIOD BELL sounds and the class is over.

           Nick crosses the street, heading back to school. He

                                 SIMON
                        You owe us.

           Nick glances at the time on his cell.

                                 NICK
                        I need to get to class.

                                 SIMON 
                        There was a man, five months ago. He went 
                        back on his agreement. He was a 
                        commercial pilot, South America route. He 
                        has a two day layover in Buenos Aires. 
                        Walking back from dinner one night to his 
                        hotel, he’s killed. Over what? The 
                        hundred bucks in his pocket? His wedding 
                        ring?

           Nick clearly understands the not-so-veiled threat.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        You come from a working class family in 
                        Pittsburgh. Your father died of 
                        emphysema. He was a mechanic, the most he 
                        ever made was ten dollars an hour. Your 
                        mother lives with your sister in 
                        Pittsburgh. Your sister drinks too much. 
                        You help them out, send them some cash 
                        every month. Do you want me to continue?

           Nick stares bullets, freaked out and furious.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        You made it out of there, Nick. You got 
                        yourself a degree from Penn. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        You could be making a hell of a lot of 
                        money, right, degree in chemistry? But 
                        you’re not. You’re in that terrible 
                        school. Why?

           Nick doesn’t answer. Simon rises.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Because you give a damn, don’t you? And I 
                        don’t want to see anything happen to you, 
                        or anybody close to you.

           Simon glances down at the river. Then back at Nick.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        When the justice system allows the scum, 
                        these animals, to continue doing what 
                        they do, our Organization steps in.

           Nick hesitates.

                                 NICK
                        I can’t do it.

                                 SIMON
                        You gave your word--

           Mercifully, the SCHOOL BELL RINGS (O.S.).

                                 NICK
                        I have to go.

           Nick turns and walks onto the school grounds.

                                 SIMON
                        Nick!

           Nick keeps walking, not looking back.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. KIMMEL CENTER - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 

           Nick makes his way through the space.

           He finds Laura in the orchestra dressing room.

                                 LAURA
                        What are you doing here?

           Nick kisses his wife.
                                 NICK
                        Just missed you.

           LATER

           From offstage, Nick watches Laura play with the orchestra.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DINER - NIGHT 

           Nick and Laura sit in a booth, eating, post-performance. 
           Nick picks at his food, no appetite.

                                 LAURA
                        We should have a dinner party.

           Nick nods, distant.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        We haven’t had one since...since 
                        before...

                                 NICK
                        You know, why does everything have to be 
                        a reference to that night?

                                 LAURA
                              (pause)
                        That’s not true.

                                 NICK
                        It is. It’s like an elephant in the room. 
                        Always.

           The couple grow silent.

                                 LAURA
                        Are we supposed to pretend it never 
                        happened?

                                 NICK
                        Did I say that? All I said was...forget 
                        it.

                                 LAURA
                              (pause)
                        I wish I could. Every single day I wish I 
                        could forget it.

           A painful beat.
                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Nick, is that you?

           Nick glances behind him. Simon stands before their table, 
           wearing a smile.

                                 SIMON
                        Nick Gerard.

           Simon puts out his hand. Nick has no choice but to shake.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Simon Adams. We taught over at Bartram. 
                        It was your rookie year. My last.

           Nick has no choice but to play along.

                                 NICK
                        Right.

           Simon sticks his hand out to Laura. They shake.

                                 SIMON
                        Simon.

                                 LAURA
                        Laura. Nick’s wife.

                                 SIMON
                        A pleasure.
                              (pause)
                        You still fighting the good fight, Nick?

           Nick nods yes.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        I got out. Moved to Seattle. I’m back 
                        here to visit a friend. His wife was 
                        murdered.

                                 LAURA
                        Oh, God, that’s horrible.

           Simon stares at Nick.

                                 SIMON
                        Should never have happened.

           Nick understands the doublespeak here. He’s powerless to 
           do anything.

           An awkward beat of silence.
                                 LAURA
                        Do you want to join us, Simon? Have a 
                        bite or something?

                                 SIMON
                        That’s very sweet of you, but no, I have 
                        to get going. Meeting a friend over at 
                        Rittenhouse Square, one of my old haunts.

                                 LAURA
                        I love that park.

                                 SIMON
                        Great space, isn’t it.

           Nick, barely able to contain his anger, knowing that the 
           Organization has been watching Laura.

           Simon glances at his watch.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Time’s flying. Nick, be well. Laura, you 
                        too. And if you folks are ever in 
                        Seattle, give me a ring.

           Simon hands Nick his card.

                                 LAURA
                        So sorry about your loss.

                                 SIMON
                        Tragic. It should never have happened.

           Simon heads out through the restaurant. Nick and Laura 
           watch him exit. He passes a man at the counter who rises 
           and exits behind him. It’s Cancer.

                                 LAURA
                        Did you really remember him?

                                 NICK
                        He was a complete asshole.

                                 LAURA
                        He seemed like a nice guy.

                                 NICK
                        He’s not.

           Nick glances at the card Simon handed him. All it has is a 
           number.

                                                            CUT TO:
           INT. LOFT - NIGHT 

           The couple enter. Laura heads upstairs. Nick places his 
           keys, wallet and cell on the counter. He’s rattled.

           He freezes--eyes the refrigerator. The magnets have been 
           arranged to say, “YOUR CHOICE.”

           Nick’s furious, freaked out. He glances around the loft, 
           worried someone might still be in here.

           He hurries upstairs where Laura has begun to undress. Nick 
           eyes the closet. It’s closed.

           He moves to the closet. Flings open the door. Empty.

           Nick moves to the bathroom. Enters. Pulls back the shower 
           curtain. It’s also empty.

                                 LAURA (O.S.)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 NICK
                              (thinking fast)
                        Did you see my work bag?

                                 LAURA
                        It’s right there.

           Laura points to his shoulder bag beside the bed. Nick 
           grabs the bag and heads back downstairs.

           Nick moves to the refrigerator. He scrambles the magnet 
           letters.

           He hears the SHOWER (O.S.) start above.

           Nick takes out the card Simon gave him. He dials the 
           number.

                                 MALE VOICE (PHONE)
                        Kirksey Funeral Home.

                              (pause)
                        I want to talk to Simon.

                        Is this Mr. Gerard?

                              (pause)
                        Yes.

                                 MALE VOICE (PHONE)
                        Mr. Gerard, I’ve been expecting your 
                        call. He explained the unfortunate 
                        situation your wife is in. I’m truly 
                        sorry to hear about it.

                                 NICK
                        Put Simon on the phone.

                                 MALE VOICE (PHONE)
                        Mr. Gerard, I know this is a very tough 
                        time for you but we at Kirksey Funeral 
                        Home want to make things easy on you. 
                        Whatever your budget, we have a funeral 
                        package that will work for you. For 
                        instance, there are--

                                 NICK
                        Tell Simon to leave my wife the fuck 
                        alone.

           Nick hangs up. Shook up.

              There’s no way out.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DOWNTOWN PARK - EARLY MORNING

           It’s still dark out as Nick powers through his morning 
           run.

           INT. BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY

           Nick stands still under the shower faucet, letting the 
           water pound him, rubbing his face mechanically with his 
           fingers.

           INT. LOFT - DAY

           Nick pecks Laura goodbye.

                                 NICK
                        Be careful today.
                                 LAURA
                        I’m always careful, Nick.

           Nick moves to the kitchen counter, glances in Laura’s 
           handbag.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 NICK
                        Making sure you have your gun.

           Nick exits. Laura puts down her paper, sensing, knowing, 
           something’s wrong with her husband.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - DAY 

           Nick stands among COMMUTERS, jerked about by the motion of 
           the subway car.

           The subway car slows to a stop. The doors open and Nick 
           steps out.

           Nick sits on a bench, eyes the crowded platform. He 
           glances at his watch. He turns his attention to the 
           escalator.

           LATER

           Nick eyes each commuter as they descend on the escalator. 
           He glances at his watch again. Where is Walczak? He checks 
           his cell. No messages. For a brief moment, he lets himself 
           believe he won’t have to do it.

           But then there he is. Walczak. Riding the escalator down.

           Nick watches as Walczak steps off the escalator and makes 
           his way to the edge of the tracks.

           Nick doesn’t move. Doesn’t want to do this. Can’t.

           But he has to.

           He rises, weaves his way through waiting commuters and up 
           behind Walczak.

           Walczak, feeling Nick’s presence, glances back at Nick, 
           vaguely recognizing him from the previous day.
           A moment as their eyes connect. Nick sees fear and 
           paranoia in Walczak’s eyes. Nick glances down at his 
           watch.

           IN THE TUNNEL there’s the light of the approaching train.

           WALCZAK turns back and faces the tracks.

           The crowd presses forward, jostling for position, bodies 
           against each other...

           Nick stands poised, his face blank, ready...

           Here’s the train--deafening--BRAKES SQUEAL as it hurtles 
           past.

           There’s a SCREAM (O.S.) which is drowned out by the 
           SQUEALING BRAKES.

           IN THE TRAIN’S SIDE WINDOWS

           The image of Nick flashes past in each window, again and 
           again, like frames of a film.

           ON THE CONDUCTOR’S WINDOW

           A splattering of blood over the glass. The CONDUCTOR hits 
           the emergency button and an EAR SHATTERING, PULSING ALARM 
           sounds in the station.

           ON THE PLATFORM

           Nick weaves his way through the waiting commuters and back 
           to the escalator. He steps aboard, stares up into the 
           blown-out morning light. A transit cop races down  past 
           him.

           EXT. METRO STATION - PUBLIC SQUARE - DAY 

           Nick crosses the square. He hurries to a public bathroom.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Nick bends over the toilet, retches, sick with what he’s 
           just done.

           INT. CAB - MOVING - DAY 

           Nick. Sweating. Breathing deeply as if he can’t get enough 
           air.

           He lowers a backseat window. Cold air streams in. The 
           DRIVER (40’s, black) eyes Nick in the rear view mirror.

           Nick glances at the driver, locks eyes for a moment.

                                 NICK
                              (threatening)
                        What?

           The driver turns his attention back to the road. Nick 
           breaths in the frigid air, fighting off nausea.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - REC YARD - DAY 

           Kids play basketball, gossip in groups, flirt with one 
           another.

           Nick looks out over the yard, on PE duty, chewing gum 
           vigorously, trying to keep it together. Haunted by what 
           he’s done.

           Nick stretches his neck, looks up to the sun, closes his 
           eyes, and feels the heat on his face. Trying to forget the 
           morning, trying to put it behind him forever.

           SHOUTS (O.S.). Nick’s eyes shoot open. A fight has broken 
           out and Nick races to it. A SCHOOL GUARD grabs one of the 
           fighters while Nick yanks the arms back of Edwin, his 
           class troublemaker.

                                 NICK 
                        Stop it. Stop it, Edwin.

           Edwin flails his arms--an elbow catches Nick’s nose.

           Blood flows--Nick releases Edwin. There’s THE MURMUR of 
           testosterone-saturated adolescents.

                                 EDWIN
                        Keep your hands off me, faggot.

           Nick locks eyes with Edwin. And Edwin sees a change in 
           Nick’s eyes, something’s off.
           Nick lashes out--throws a single, vicious punch into 
           Edwin’s face.

           slides over paperwork.

                                 NICK
                        Will do.

                                 ANNABEL

                        It was stupid and it was wrong. I’m 
                        embarrassed.

           Nick shrugs.

           Nick sits in the parking lot of his school. He’s perfectly 
           still. He’s feeling the crushing psychological weight of 
           his deed.

           Nick drives. 

           He fiddles with the tuner, trying to find a station to 
           take his mind off what he’s done that day. He finds a rock 
           station and BLASTS the song.

           He bobs his head to the music.

           And then he smiles to himself. It’s a warped, little 
           smile. His mood is shifting from sullen and depressed to a 
           strange frantic energy--an emotional overcompensation for 
           having killed a man.

           He speed-dials Laura.

                                 NICK

                        It doesn’t hurt?

                        You promised me next time you got injured 
                        playing hockey, you’d give it up.

                                 NICK 
                        I love you.

           Laura eyes him. She hasn’t seem him with this kind of 
           energy in...she can’t remember when.

                        You, too.

           AT A TABLE

           Nick and Laura eat cheese fries and drink milkshakes. Nick 
           drums the table.

                                 LAURA
                        Thank you. This is great.

                        Me, too.

           They kiss across the table. Laura wipes sweat off his 
           forehead with a napkin.

                        Alright, I’ve not been exactly honest 
                        about breaking my nose. But it’s 
                        embarrassing and I’m not sure how you’ll 
                        take it.

           Laura reaches out, takes his hand, and squeezes.
                                 LAURA
                        Tell me.

                        I didn’t break my nose playing hockey.

                        A kid hit me, broke it. Then I lost my 
                        temper and I hit him back.

           Laura is shocked, at a loss for words. She pulls back her 
           hand.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I broke his, too. The whole thing was 
                        unfortunate.

           Nick tries a smile but it comes out weak. Laura studies

           A moment.

           An opportunity for Nick to come clean.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I’m fine. Really. Sometimes stuff like 
                        this happens. I don’t know what else you 
                        want me to say?

           The couple eye each other.

           Laura shakes her head, doesn’t believe him. 

                                 LAURA 
                        I want to go.

           She gets up and walks toward the exit. Nick catches up to 
           her.

                                 NICK
                        Hey.

           Laura’s fighting.

                        Hey, don’t do that.

           Nick reaches out to console her--she pushes away his arm.

                                 LAURA
                        You’re lying to me. You’re not telling me 
                        everything.

           Nick says nothing, doesn’t deny it.

           Laura turns and exits the building.

           INT. LOFT - NIGHT 

           Nick composes a To-Do list. The manic energy he was

           Laura doesn’t say a word. She heads to the door, 
           hesitates, glancing back at Nick with a look of hurt and 
           disappointment.

           Then she’s gone.

                        Shit.

           Nick crumples up his To-do list and throws it across the

           with A PRIMAL SHOUT.

           Nick gets another ball, tosses, swings hard and whiffs. He 
           slams the bat on the rooftop--the bat flies out of his 
           hand and bounces about the roof.

           He stares out over a slice of the city, the sounds 
           drifting up. He takes out his cell and speed-dials Jimmy.

                                 JIMMY
                        Sometimes this. Sometimes chasing tail. 
                        Mostly just getting up each morning and 
                        keeping on, you know?
                              (pause)
                        You hit a kid. There are a lot worse 
                        things.

           Nick glances about the room. Nobody is near enough to hear 
           their conversation.

                                 NICK
                        It’s more than hitting the kid...

           Jimmy gestures, “Tell me.”

           Nick hesitates.

                                 JIMMY
                        Come on, brother. What the hell’s eating 
                        you? You fall in love with someone else?

                                 NICK
                              (pause)
                        Nah. It’s nothing. Just one of those 
                        days.

                                 JIMMY
                        We all have ‘em.

           Nick downs his drink.

                                 NICK 
                        Baño.

                                 JIMMY
                        Another?

                                 NICK
                        Please.

           Nick heads to the restroom. He passes a TV mounted at the 
           far end of the bar. It’s the local news. A REPORTER 
           (female, 20’s) stands in front of subway tracks.

           Nick freezes in front of the TV.
                                 REPORTER
                        ...who was Alan Marsh? He was a husband, 
                        a father, and an investigative 
                        journalist. He was a long time employee 
                        of the Philadelphia Inquirer. Marsh had 
                        been fired from his job five weeks ago.

           A PHOTO of Marsh/Walczak appears on the screen. Marsh and 
           Walczak are the same man.

                                 REPORTER (O.S) (CONT’D)
                        Earlier today, during the height of the 
                        morning commute, Marsh jumped to his 
                        death.

           Nick is numb, paralyzed.

           And then he gets angry--he realizes that he killed an 
           innocent man.

           He returns to the bar, throws down a twenty.

                                 NICK
                        Gotta go.

                                 JIMMY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 NICK
                        Had enough. Thanks for the company.

                                 JIMMY
                        Anytime.

           Nick heads out of the bar. Jimmy eyes him closely.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL - ONCOLOGY LOBBY - NIGHT 

           The lobby doors slide open. Nick enters, enraged. A FEW 
           PEOPLE, none Nick recognize, are scattered about the seats 
           inside.

           THE GUARD (40’s, white) eyes him. Nick moves to the 
           vending machines. He feeds in a five dollar bill. He 
           selects an Eternity Bar. And then a second. Three dollar 
           coins CLANG loudly to the change retainer.
           Nick glances about the lobby, eyes each person. Nothing 
           happens. Nobody arrives. He’s set nothing in motion as far 
           as he can tell.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 

           Nick cruises the streets of Philadelphia. Nick doesn’t 
           know where he’s going, what exactly he’s looking for. He’s 
           an emotional mess: racked with guilt for killing an 
           innocent man, and furious that he was lied to by Simon.

           He looks out, passing the DENIZENS of late night 
           Philadelphia. There’s an anguish in their faces. Struggle. 
           Pain. Hints of madness.

           Nick pulls over to the side of the road. A breeze kicks up 
           a dusting of snow. The snow swirls. It dances as if it’s 
           alive. It’s beautiful. And it’s gone in an instant.

           Nick glances in his rear view mirror just in time to see 
           the headlights go out on a Lexus sedan several blocks 
           back. The Lexus pulls to the side of the road. Nick can’t 
           see who’s driving.

           Nick U-turns. He speeds back toward the Lexus. The Lexus 
           pulls out from the spot and passes Nick, headed the 
           opposite direction. Scar’s at the wheel.

           Nick makes another U-turn, speeds after the Lexus. Now 
           several blocks ahead, the Lexus turns down a street.

           Nick floors it, takes the corner...

           ...the street’s empty. No car. Nobody. The Lexus has 
           seemingly disappeared.

           Nick continues to the next cross street. He looks up and 
           down it. No sign of the Lexus. He’s lost him.

           Nick’s cell RINGS. ID shows, “RESTRICTED.”

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        What are you doing, Nick?

                                 NICK
                        He didn’t do what you told me he did.

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        There was a very good reason he was 
                        targeted.
                                 NICK
                        Yeah, what’s that?

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        Trust me when I say the less you know the 
                        better.

                                 NICK
                        I want to know what he did.

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        Leave it alone and have a great life.

           CLICK (PHONE). Simon is gone.

           Nick drives off, still searching for the Lexus, scanning 
           the Philly streets.

                                                    FADE THROUGH TO:

           INT. LOFT - DAY 

           Nick unlocks the door, enters, carrying the paper and two 
           coffees. His “raccoon eyes” from his broken nose have 
           bloomed.

           Sitting in the living area are Laura and TWO MEN (30’s, 
           one white, one black, wearing suits). The men have the 
           cocky swagger of Philly detectives. They rise.

                                 NICK
                              (wary)
                        What’s going on?

                                 DETECTIVE RUDESKI
                        I’m Detective Rudeski, Mr. Gerard, and 
                        this is Detective Green. Philadelphia 
                        police.

           The men flash badges.

           Nick can’t hide his nerves. He glances at Laura, who’s 
           seeing him for the first time with his “raccoon eyes.” 
           She’s also wondering where he’s been all night.

                                 DETECTIVE RUDESKI (CONT’D)
                        Do you know why we’re here, sir?

                                 NICK
                              (pause)
                        It’s about yesterday.
                                 DETECTIVE RUDESKI
                        What happened yesterday?

                                 NICK 
                        I saw a man jump in the subway. I was 
                        going to report it today but I haven’t 
                        been thinking straight.

           The detectives take hard looks at Nick. Laura is stunned.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I should have stayed at the scene. Right?

                                 RUDESKI
                        We’re going to need you to come with us, 
                        sir.

                                 NICK
                        Where?

                                 RUDESKI
                        Down to the station. Just a few 
                        questions.

                                 NICK
                        Absolutely. I’ll take a quick shower.

                                 RUDESKI
                        We need you to come now, sir.

           Nick glances at Laura.

                                 NICK
                              (to the detectives)
                        Whatever you need.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. POLICE STATION HOUSE - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Nick, trying to keep his nerves under control, sits before 
           a laptop. The two detectives hover behind him, 
           intimidating presences.

           The COMPUTER SCREEN shows an angle from the Metro camera 
           mounted over the platform. The image is paused on the 
           commuters waiting for the train.

                                 RUDESKI
                        That’s the back of you there, right?

                                 NICK
                        I think so.
                                 RUDESKI
                        You think, or is that you?

                                 NICK
                        It’s me.

                                 RUDESKI
                        Who’s in front of you?

                                 NICK
                        That’s the man who jumped.

                                 RUDESKI
                        How do you know him?

                                 NICK
                        I don’t know him.

                        Where were you headed, Mr. Gerard?

                                 NICK
                        To school. I’m a teacher.

                                 RUDESKI
                        Why didn’t you drive?

                                 NICK
                        My battery was dead.

                                 RUDESKI
                        Why didn’t you get a jump?

                                 GREEN
                        Your wife have a car?

                                 NICK
                        It was easier to take the train. I like 
                        the train.

           It comes out sounding ridiculous.

                                 GREEN
                        How did you know Alan Marsh?

                                 NICK
                        I didn’t know him. I already told you 
                        that.

           Nick stares hard at Green.

                                 RUDESKI
                        Okay, watch closely. You can hear the 
                        train coming.
           Rudeski presses a key on the computer. The image on the 
           screen moves in SUPER SLOW-MOTION.

                                 RUDESKI (CONT’D)
                        Your shoulder, your arm--see the movement 
                        there? When you push him.

           The movement of Nick’s arm is indeterminate.

                                 NICK
                        I didn’t push him. I was reaching out to 
                        try and grab him.

                                 GREEN
                        You pushed him.

                                 NICK
                        I didn’t.

                                 RUDESKI
                        Are you saying you tried to save him? 
                        That’s what you’re saying?

                                 NICK
                        Yes. That’s exactly what I’m saying.

                                 GREEN

                                 RUDESKI
                        You turn, walk out of the station? 
                        Where’d you go, Mr. Gerard?

                                 NICK
                        To work. School.

                                 RUDESKI
                        How’d you get there?

                                 NICK
                        I took a cab.

                                 RUDESKI
                        How long did that take you?

                                 NICK
                        About fifteen, twenty minutes.
                                 RUDESKI
                        So when we check the security cameras at 
                        your school, you should arrive at around, 
                        what: 8:00?

                                 NICK
                        I’m not sure the exact time. I had just 
                        witnessed a man killing himself so I 
                        wasn’t exactly thinking straight.

           Rudeski stops the tape. He sits across from Nick, 
           scrutinizes him. Says nothing.

           Finally:

                                 RUDESKI
                        How’d you break your nose?

                        One of my students hit me.

                                 RUDESKI
                        What’d you do?

                                 NICK
                        I hit him back.

           Rudeski nods as if he approves of Nick’s actions.

                                 RUDESKI 
                        I’m on your side. You and me, cop and a 
                        teacher, we try to do something 
                        worthwhile, and people fuck with us, try 
                        to stir up shit. I mean, all we do is put 
                        our lives on the line every fucking day 
                        and we get what? These prick journalists 
                        think we’re all a bunch of corrupt 
                        assholes. Well, fuck ‘em. What was it 
                        with this asshole, Marsh? He was an 
                        asshole, right? He looks like an asshole. 
                        What did he do to you? Here you are a 
                        teacher, trying to do good, and what did 
                        this prick Marsh do to you?

           Nick leans back in his chair, gaining confidence.

                                 NICK
                        You don’t think I know what you’re doing?
                              (pause)
                        I’ve never met him. I want a lawyer.
                                 RUDESKI
                        Mr. Gerard. Here’s the thing. You tell us 
                        the truth, we help each other. If you 
                        don’t...

           Rudeski shrugs.

                                 NICK
                        I want a lawyer.

           There’s a TAP TAP at the one way window. Rudeski and Green 
           share a glance.

                                 GREEN
                        Don’t go anywhere.

                                 NICK
                              (sarcastic)
                        I’ll be waiting at the bar.

           The two detectives exit the room.

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

           Rudeski, Green, and their superior, LIEUTENANT DURGAN 
           (40’s, black, slim, tired face from a long career) stare 
           in at Nick.

                                 RUDESKI
                        Nick Gerard, no priors, teaches high 
                        school chemistry. Married, no kids. Only 
                        perhaps semi-interesting thing is his 
                        wife, Laura Gerard, was raped September 
                        last year.

                                 DURGAN
                        Victim?

                                 RUDESKI
                        Alan Marsh. Journalist for the Philly 
                        Inquirer. Separated. Two daughters, six 
                        and eight.
                              (re: Nick)
                        This is our guy.

                                 DURGAN
                        Is that an opinion or a fact, detective?

                                 GREEN
                        It’s on the tape.
                                 DURGAN
                        I saw the tape. It’s inconclusive. What 
                        about a motive?

                                 RUDESKI
                        We’re getting there.

                                 DURGAN
                        Connection between him and the victim?

           Rudeski and Green are silent, not having any connection, 
           either.

                                 DURGAN (CONT’D)
                        You guys are off. I’m working it.

                                 RUDESKI
                        Lieutenant, what the fuck?

                                 DURGAN
                        What the fuck, Rudeski? I’m working it. 
                        Because your time could be better spent 
                        working a real case, like the sixteen up 
                        on the board that you have jackshit on.

           Rudeski and Green smirk.

                                 DURGAN (CONT’D)
                        Go solve a case, detectives. Thank you 
                        very much.

           Rudeski and Green exit. Durgan stares in at Nick.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 

           Nick.

           He glances up at the one way mirror. A KNOCK at the door 
           and Durgan enters.

                                 DURGAN
                        Mr. Gerard, I’m Lieutenant Durgan.

           Durgan sits across from Nick.

                                 DURGAN (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to ask you a few simple 
                        questions. It’s just procedure, nothing 
                        to be worried about.

                                 NICK
                        I want a lawyer.
           Durgan ignores Nick’s request. He opens his folder. He 
           reads off a standardized test, jots down Nick’s answers in 
           the appropriate spaces.

                                 DURGAN
                        “The day after Monday is...”

                                 NICK
                        I want a lawyer.

                                 DURGAN
                        You haven’t been charged with anything, 
                        Mr. Gerard.
                              (pause)
                        “The day after Monday is...”

           Nick sees no harm in answering the question.

                                 NICK
                        Tuesday.

                                 DURGAN
                        “My favorite color is...”

                                 NICK
                        Green.

                                 DURGAN
                        “If a baby is unhappy, he...”

                                 NICK
                        Cries.

                                 DURGAN
                        The hungry rabbit...

           Nick eyes the detective. The detective meets Nick’s gaze.

                                 NICK
                        Jumps.

           Durgan writes down Nick’s answer.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        The hungry rabbit jumps.

                                 DURGAN
                        Got it. “The cow jumped over the...”

                                 NICK
                        Moon.

                                 DURGAN
                        “Ashes to ashes, dust to...”
                                 NICK
                        Dust.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. POLICE STATION HOUSE - BULLPEN - DAY 

           Durgan leads Nick through the station.

                                 DURGAN
                        Thank you for your time, Mr. Gerard.

           They reach the door to the lobby. Through a small 
           bulletproof window they see Laura waiting in the lobby 
           with several other random people.

                                 DURGAN (CONT’D)
                        Your wife will drive you home?

                                 NICK
                        He wasn’t who you said he was.

                                 DURGAN
                        I have no idea what you’re talking about.

           Durgan opens the door, smiles at Laura.

                                 DURGAN (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Gerard, you can have your husband 
                        back now. Is that what you wanted or do 
                        you want us to keep him for a few days?

           Nick and Laura lock eyes.

           Then Nick sees an odd thing. There’s an OLDER MAN (60’s, 
           white) sitting near Laura. He looks like a businessman 
           nearing retirement. He has a briefcase.

           There’s the slightest moment, eyes meeting, some hidden 
           communication, between the older man and Durgan.

                                 DURGAN (CONT’D)
                              (to Nick)
                        Thank you, once again, for your help.

           Nick takes a last look at Durgan. He glances at the 
           Mystery Man as he and Laura exit.

                                                            CUT TO:
           INT. LAURA’S CAR - MOVING - DAY 

           Nick drives, Laura in the passenger seat. They drive in 
           tense silence. Finally:

                                 NICK
                        I should have told you.

                                 LAURA
                        Why wouldn’t you talk to me about 
                        something like that?

           They stop at a red light. A HOMELESS MAN (50’s, beard, 
           wild hair and eyes) approaches. He carries a bucket of 
           water and a squeegee. Nick taps the window and shakes his 
           head no.

           The homeless man throws the bucket of dirty water over the 
           windshield.

                                 NICK 
                        No!

           The homeless man runs his squeegee over the windshield. 
           Nick pops the trunk, exits the car.

           He grabs a lug wrench from the trunk. Approaches the 
           homeless man.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I said no.

                                 LAURA (O.S.)
                        Nick!

           The man MUMBLES GIBBERISH, takes a rag and rubs a trouble 
           spot.

                                 NICK 
                        Get away from my car.

           Nick shoves the guy. The man stumbles backward.

           Laura gets out of the car.

                                 LAURA
                        Nick!

                                 NICK
                        Get back in the car!

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        The man on the moon ate all the 
                        motherfuckin’ cheese.
                                 LAURA
                        Put that down, Nick!!

                                 NICK
                              (to the homeless man)
                        What’d you say?

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        Every three thousand miles, every three 
                        thousand miles. That’s right. Tune it up 
                        sharp and keep her rolling.

           The guy’s mentally ill. Or is he? Could he be linked to 
           the Organization? Is he talking in some warped code? 
           Nick’s not sure.

                                 NICK
                              (to Laura)
                        Let’s get out of here.

           Nick throws the lug wrench back in the trunk and slams it 
           closed.

           He and Laura get back in his car and Nick speeds off.

                                 LAURA
                        Jesus, Nick!

                                 NICK
                        We should get the hell out of this city--
                        it’s a disaster.

                                 LAURA
                        What the hell was that back there?!

                                 NICK
                        And moving downtown was ridiculous. I 
                        don’t know why I let you talk me into it. 
                        Look at this fucking place.

           Nick gestures outside to the barren, inner city landscape.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        A goddamn joke.

           Laura stares at her husband, the man she no longer 
           recognizes.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        A joke.

           They drive in silence, both fuming. They approach their 
           loft, pull into the
           UNDERGROUND GARAGE

           Nick parks, turns off the car, tries to calm himself.

                                 NICK 
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry about what happened 
                        back there.

           Laura eyes Nick with a look of disappointment and 
           confusion.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I just lost it.

           Laura gets out the car, SLAMS the door shut. Nick stares 
           after her, frustrated.

           He exits the car and hurries after her.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. LOFT - DAY

           Nick enters, makes his way to the stairs and up to the

           BEDROOM AREA

           Where he finds Laura lighting a cigarette.

                                 NICK
                        I’m sorry.

           Laura takes a puff, exhales, upset.

                                 LAURA
                        You want to tell me what’s going on or 
                        should we keep playing this game?

                                 NICK
                        There’s nothing else.

                                 LAURA
                        Stop lying to me.

                                 NICK
                        Laura...

           Nick tries a different tact. He approaches her, tries to 
           take her in his arms. She pushes him away, wants no part 
           of it.
                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        There’s nothing to say.

           Laura, pissed, stubs out her cigarette.

                                 LAURA 
                        I’m going to work.

                                 NICK
                        I’ll drive you.

                                 LAURA
                        No. I’d prefer you didn’t.

           Laura enters the bathroom, SLAMS the door. Nick GROWLS in 
           frustration.

           LATER

           Nick stands at the living room windows watching Laura 
           drive off for a performance.

           He skulks around the room.

           He grabs one of his hockey sticks, swings it against a 
           wall, SMASHES it.

           Beat.

           He moves to his laptop. He Googles, “Alan Marsh.”

           Scans the results.

                                                    FADE THROUGH TO:

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER HDQTS - DAY

           Nick enters the historic building.

           INT. PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER HDQTS. - DAY 

           Nick exits an elevator and finds himself on the main floor 
           of the paper. It’s oddly subdued, just a few people at 
           work.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Can I help you?

                                 NICK
                        I was wondering if there was someone I 
                        could talk to about Alan Marsh?
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Everyone’s already at the wake.

                                 NICK 
                        Right. Where’s that again?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Kelliann’s. Over on Spring Garden and 
                        16th.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. KELLIANN’S IRISH PUB - DAY 

           Nick enters the pub and is met by a raucous scene. The 
           MUSIC BLASTS, the bar is crowded with plastered 
           JOURNALISTS.

           Nick passes an altar of sorts with a large, blown up photo 
           of Marsh, cigarette dangling out of his mouth, giving the 
           person behind the camera the finger.

           In front of the photo, there’s an array of personal items: 
           pack of American Spirit cigarettes, bottle of tequila, 
           Captain’s hat, etc.. Nick is drawn to a photo of two young 
           girls and a woman. Marsh’s daughters and wife. It’s the 
           same woman and two girls Nick was following at the zoo.

           LATER

           A JOURNALIST stands on a pool table and toasts Marsh.

                                 JOURNALIST
                        ...that piece was beautiful, better than 
                        any of you underpaid hacks could ever 
                        write! And not only that, that piece had 
                        LEGS. Beautiful. Long. Long legs.

           NICK watches from the bar, sipping a whiskey.

           THE JOURNALIST looks to the altar, the photo of Marsh, and 
           holds up his drink.

                                 JOURNALIST (CONT’D)
                        Marshy, here’s to you. You were the real 
                        deal, you asshole.

           The whole room “Here, Here’s” in agreement.

                                 JOURNALIST (CONT’D)
                              (to the bartender)
                        Augie! 
           The BARTENDER puts on one of Marsh’s favorite songs, Pearl 
           Jam’s, “Last Kiss.” All the journalists sing along with 
           the song. Nick semi-mouths the words, trying to fit in and 
           not bring attention to himself.

           LATER

           Nick moves through the bar and approaches THREE 
           JOURNALISTS who are well on the way to drunk. One of them 
           wears the Captain’s hat that was at Marsh’s altar.

                                 JOURNALIST 1
                        I wanted the Captain’s hat!

           Journalist 1 yanks the hat off Journalist 2’s head. 

                                 JOURNALIST 2
                        You get the hat, then I get the boat.

                                 JOURNALIST 1
                        You can have the damn boat. This hat is 
                        the bomb.

                                 NICK
                              (to Journalist 1)
                        Great toast.

                                 JOURNALIST 1
                        All lies.

                                 NICK 
                        Nick Gerard.

                                 JOURNALIST 1
                        Nick meet Hack One, Hack Two, and I’m 
                        Hack Three.

                                 NICK
                        Can I buy you a round?

                                 JOURNALIST 2
                        Does a pig fart?

           LATER

           Shots of Tequila with beer chasers are lined up on the 
           bar. The four men throw down their shots.

                                 JOURNALIST 1
                        To Marshy!

           The men cry out Marsh’s name.
                                 JOURNALIST 2
                        Thank you, Nick. Here’s to Nick the 
                        chemistry teacher!

                                 JOURNALISTS
                        To Nick!

           The men drink their beers.

                                 NICK 
                        Marsh was a great guy, huh?

                                 JOURNALIST 1
                        Prick.

                                 JOURNALIST 2 
                        Essential traits of any decent 
                        journalist.

                                 JOURNALIST 3 
                        He was a hell of a journalist.

           The journalists nod, drink.

                                 NICK 
                        After he spoke to my class, I buy him a 
                        coffee in the cafeteria. He gets quiet, 
                        then starts telling me about this secret 
                        organization, handing out justice when 
                        the justice system fails. I found it very 
                        odd.

           The men stare coldly at Nick.

                                 JOURNALIST 1
                        He told you that?

           Nick nods.

                                 JOURNALIST 2
                        It’s true.

                                 JOURNALIST 1
                        They killed him and made it look like a 
                        suicide.

                                 JOURNALIST 2
                        Watch your back, Nick. Because anyone who 
                        associated with Marsh is a marked man.

           Nick eyes the men. They’re all business.

                                 NICK
                        Why did they want him dead?
                                 JOURNALIST 1
                        Because...Joe, you tell him.

                                 JOURNALIST 3
                        Because Alan Marsh, Nick...was an alien. 
                        Sent here as a scout to prepare for the 
                        invasion of the earth.

           The journalists burst out LAUGHING.

                                 JOURNALIST 3 (CONT’D)
                        And the eventual enslavement of the 
                        entire human race.

           The journalists are tearing up with laughter.

                                 JOURNALIST 1 
                        Nick, you are one gullible motherfucker.

                                 JOURNALIST 2
                        Oh, shit, dude, if you had seen your 
                        face. You are now obligated to buy us 
                        another round, my friend.

           Nick forces a small smile. He gestures to the bartender 
           for another round.

                                 JOURNALIST 1 
                        He told everybody that crazy story, Nick. 
                        The mysterious organization formed in the 
                        70’s, stepping in when crime was rampant 
                        and law enforcement was impotent.
                              (pause)
                        No name, no leader. Each cell could be 
                        cut off or activated at a moment’s 
                        notice.

                                 JOURNALIST 2
                        Crazy shit.

           IN A BOOTH

           Sideburns watches Nick and the journalists.

           AT THE BAR

           The bartender lines up the shots. The men clink shot 
           glasses and throw them down.

                                 JOURNALIST 1 
                        Goddamn pity.
                                 JOURNALIST 2
                        You know what: we didn’t do enough. What 
                        we should have done is gone down to his 
                        boat and dragged his ass to a hospital. 
                        That’s what we should have done.

           The journalists grow silent, feeling a drunken guilt.

                                 NICK
                        What boat?

                                 JOURNALIST 2
                        Where he lived after Jane kicked him out 
                        of the house.

                                 NICK
                        Where did he keep his boat?

                                 JOURNALIST 1
                        Over in Camden. Cesspool of a marina.

                                 NICK
                        What was the name of the boat?

                                 JOURNALIST 2
                        What are you, Nick? A journalist?

                                 JOURNALIST 3
                        He named it after his daughters. The 
                        April Rose.

           LATER

           Nick heads to the exit, pushes out into the night.

           IN A BOOTH

           Sideburns watches Nick leave. Then he gets out of the 
           booth and weaves his way towards the journalists to whom 
           Nick was talking.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. BEN FRANKLIN BRIDGE - NIGHT

           Cars stream across the bridge from Philadelphia to New 
           Jersey. Among the cars is Nick’s.

                                                            CUT TO:
           INT. NICK’S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Nick reaches the other side of the bridge, enters Camden. 
           He turns down a road which parallels the Delaware River. 
           Heavy industry lines both sides of the road.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. LOFT - NIGHT 

           Laura, suspicious, trying to figure out what the hell is 
           going on with Nick, looks through his shoulder bag. She 
           pulls out a folder with lesson plans and leafs through it.

           A folded sheet of paper falls to the floor.

           She picks it up and unfolds it...

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. CAMDEN - NIGHT

           Nick drives, passing warehouses, a refinery, a demolition 
           yard, empty, weed-infested loading docks.

           He spots a small sign indicating, “SUNSHINE MARINA.” An 
           arrow points down a gravel road. He studies the desolate 
           area.

           He U-turns and drives back up the road. He turns into the 
           demolition yard. He parks his car behind a stack of 
           crushed cars. He grabs a flashlight out of the dash, and 
           exits the car.

           He makes his way back to the marina. It’s decrepit, 
           garbage strewn about. A few boats are up on stilts. 
           There’s a dock where a handful of boats are covered with 
           winter tarps.

           It’s quiet. The only sound is the distant drone of cars 
           over the bridge and a dog barking far off somewhere.

           He approaches the dock. There’s a locked security gate. 
           Nick climbs over it.

           He walks down the dock and stops before a 34 foot 
           sailboat, The April Rose.

           Nick pulls back the cover, steps aboard. The hatch is 
           locked.
           Nick moves back to the shore and finds a cement block. He  
           returns to the boat and CRACKS the block against the lock. 
           The lock doesn’t open.

           Nick glances to shore, seeing if the noise has attracted 
           any attention. There doesn’t seem to be anybody else here. 
           Nick CRACKS the block against the lock again. It doesn’t 
           open.

           BACK AT HIS CAR

           Nick pops the trunk, finds a screwdriver and a hammer in 
           his tool kit.

           AT THE BOAT

           Nick hammers the screwdriver under the latch, slowly 
           prying the latch from the boat. He yanks it off.

           He opens the hatch and lowers himself into the boat.

           INT. APRIL ROSE - CABIN - NIGHT

           Nick switches on a light. Nothing happens--there’s no 
           power.

           He shines his flashlight over the cabin. It’s empty. He 
           opens cabinets and storage spaces. There’s nothing, no 
           sign that anyone was living in here.

           He studies the space. This place is TOO clean. Odd.

           He moves throughout the cabin again, double checking any 
           place where something might be hidden, scouring hidden 
           spaces and prying up a few floor boards with his 
           screwdriver.

           He finds nothing but a coil of rope, flares, life vests 
           and blankets.

           A LIGHT flashes from up on the road--headlights. They 
           momentarily pass the small window. Then they’re gone.

           Nick flicks off his flashlight and moves to the hatch. He 
           looks to the shore. It’s very dark.

           He spots headlights...catches glimpses of an SUV moving 
           down the access road...passing the marina...continuing 
           down the road.
           Nick lifts himself out of the boat. He shines his 
           flashlight over the April Rose...

           He spots something on the gunwale. He moves closer. Carved 
           into the gunwale are the words:

              HUMANITY REASON JUSTICE

              What the hell is that?

           He moves down the dock, illuminating a few more moored 
           boats.

           He climbs back over the security gate and onto shore. He 
           eyes the marina...the boats on stilts, running his 
           flashlight over them, walking around and beneath the 
           boats.

           He shines his flashlight on the ground, over dirt and 
           gravel...

           His light catches a GLINT on the ground at the far side of 
           the marina. He approaches.

           Half buried in the dirt and gravel is a crumpled pack of 
           cigarettes, the glint coming from the lining. It’s 
           American Spirit, Marsh’s brand (glimpsed at the wake.)

           The pack is beside a fence. Beyond is a field littered 
           with tires, scrap metal, stripped and rusting vehicles.

           Nick spots a tear in the fence. Moves into the field.

           He eyes a rusted VW van up on blocks. Wood boards cover 
           the windows.

           He approaches the van. All the doors are locked. He tries 
           to see inside. Can’t.

           He takes his screwdriver and punches a hole in one the 
           boards--steps back--worried what, or who, might be inside.

           Silence.

           He works the screwdriver in the wood until the hole’s the 
           diameter of a soda can.

           He shines his flashlight through the hole, trying to see 
           what’s inside. All he can see is a pair of boots and a 
           rain jacket.

           He looks around the field. No movement. Seemingly no one 
           else here.
           Beat.

           Then he puts his hand tentatively through the hole. He 
           reaches down, feeling about, trying to find the inside 
           door handle...

           ...he grasps it and yanks. The door clicks open.

           Nick slides the door open further. He shines his 
           flashlight around the van: there’s a sleeping bag, 
           clothing, power bars, small radio, vial of Valium, space 
           heater.

           Nick climbs in, closes the door behind him.

           He finds:

           --a laptop.

           --a book, “A Vindication Of Natural Society: A View Of The 
           Miseries And Evil Arising To Mankind” by Edmund Burke.

           --a pile of investment brochures for a company called C & 
           K INVESTMENT SECURITIES.

           Nick turns on the laptop. While the computer boots up, 
           Nick thumbs through the Burke book...

           One of the quotes on the back cover is by Burke, “It is 
           not what a lawyer tells me I may do; but what humanity, 
           reason, and justice tell me I ought to do.”

              HUMANITY REASON JUSTICE. The words on the gunwale.

           The computer is up. Nick eyes the desktop, the files. He 
           double-clicks on a file marked, “PONZI.” A graph fills the 
           screen filled with numbers and names. At the top of the 
           chart is the company name, “C & K Investments.”

           He double-clicks on another file, “PONZI NOTES/STORY.” 
           Nick scans the document, certain phrases jumping out at 
           him: 

           “...25 million offshore...”, “...154 known victims...”, 
           “...4 aliases...” “...ruthless...”

           Nick’s cell BUZZES. ID shows, “LAURA.”

                                 NICK 
                        Hi.

           There’s seemingly nobody there.
                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Laura?

                                 LAURA (PHONE)
                              (shaky)
                        I found the instructions in your 
                        bag...you told me he committed suicide.

           Nick’s mind races, frantic, trying to figure a way to not 
           reveal the truth.

                                 LAURA  (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        What is this, Nick?

                                 NICK
                              (pause)
                        It’s not what you think.

                                 LAURA (PHONE)
                        I don’t believe you.

                                 NICK 
                        Laura...I’m coming home right now and 
                        I’ll explain everything. Okay? I’ll be 
                        there in --

           A DIAL TONE. Laura’s gone, hung up--

           THE SOUND OF TIRES ON GRAVEL (O.S.).

              Fuck. Nick turns off his flashlight. Stays still.

           He hears CAR DOORS OPENING (O.S.). Then SHUTTING (O.S.).

           Nick glances out the door, across the field and to the 
           marina...

           Simon and Cancer approach the dock. Both men hold guns.

           Nick needs to get the hell out of there. He takes a last 
           glance around the van. He grabs the laptop and exits.

           He eyes the men. They’re on the dock, approaching The 
              April Rose. 

           He crouches, moves through the field--CLANG--his foot hits 
           a rusted oil can.

           Nick freezes and eyes the marina. Cancer is squinting in 
           the dark directly at him. Cancer WHISTLES SHARPLY ONCE--a 
           signal to Simon.

           Nick runs...
           ...through the field...

           ...scrambling up a small hill, through bushes--scraping 
           his face--hitting A FENCE.

           Six feet high. Scalable. He climbs over the fence, falling 
           awkwardly on the other side.

           He runs up the access road, toward the demolition yard and 
           his car.

           AT HIS CAR

           Nick, breathing hard, listens for voices in the night. 
           Doesn’t hear anything.

           He gets in the car, closes his door quietly. He slides the 
           laptop under his seat. He starts the car--doesn’t turn on 
           the headlights--drives quickly out of the demolition yard 
           and up onto the access road.

           Nick speeds back towards the bridge. He eyes the rear view 
           mirror. Nobody’s coming after him.

           Not yet.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. NICK’S CAR - MOVING- NIGHT

           Nick speeds over the bridge and back into Philly.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT 

           Nick pulls his car to a quick stop in front of his loft 
           complex and hurries into the building. He carries Marsh’s 
           laptop. 

           INT. LOFT - NIGHT

           Nick enters.

                                 NICK
                        Laura!

           No answer. He calls up above to the bedroom area:
                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Laura?!

           Nothing. He puts Marsh’s laptop on the kitchen counter and 
           spots the Walczak/Marsh instructions.

           Nick speed-dials Laura’s cell. He gets her VOICEMAIL and 
           leaves a message:

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        It’s me. Where are you? Call me as soon 
                        as you get this.

           Nick glances at the clock: 7:30. If she went to work, 
           Laura would be warming up for an evening performance.

           A LOUD POP outside.

           A gunshot.

           Nick hurries to the windows and scans the street. He spots 
           a parked Lexus sedan (the same one he saw the night he 
           killed Marsh) with the driver’s door open.

           There’s a man slumped against the steering wheel. It’s 
           Scar, a single bullet wound to the temple, blood 
           splattered over the interior of the car.

              Jesus.

           Nick hurries out of the loft, grabbing Marsh’s computer.

           EXT. LOFT COMPLEX - NIGHT 

           Nick races outside to find all four tires of his car 
           slashed.

           He nervously scans the street...

           Suddenly, Simon’s SUV speeds around the corner towards 
           him.

           Nick races back into the

           LOBBY

           He moves past the elevators and down a service hallway. He 
           pushes through an Emergency Exit and out into an
           ALLEY

           Nick runs down the alley--the laptop slips out of his arm 
           and falls on the cement.

           Nick grabs the computer and--knowing he won’t be able to 
           run with it--slips the laptop between a rack of loading 
           pallets.

           He sprints out of the alley and into the

           STREET

           He heads away from his loft complex, running. He glances 
           behind him and sees:

           SIMON’S SUV taking the corner fast.

           NICK dodges pedestrians and races towards the park where 
           he runs every morning.

           THE SUV gains, bears down upon him.

           NICK crosses a thoroughfare and sprints into the park.

           CANCER jumps out of the SUV and runs after Nick.

           NICK powers through the park, suddenly stumbles and falls 
           hard. He scrambles to his feet, glances behind him and 
           sees Cancer sprinting toward him.

           THE SUV drives the periphery of the park, trying to cut 
           off Nick.

           NICK angles to avoid the SUV. He reaches the edge of the 
           park, sprints across the thoroughfare, dodging traffic, 
           and into the

           PARKING STRUCTURE

           Nick sprints across the ground level and flings open the 
           door to the stairwell.

           CANCER is at the edge of the park, waiting for an opening 
           in the traffic.

           NICK powers up the stairwell.

           THE SUV flies into the parking garage and screeches to a 
           stop. The door opens.

           It’s Simon. He scans the area, searching for Nick.
           NICK reaches the rooftop level. He runs to the edge of the 
           structure and looks down. He sees Cancer entering the 
           parking garage. Nick hears TIRES SQUEALING (O.S.). He 
           realizes the SUV is speeding up the garage ramp.

           Nick glances over the side again--five stories--he’d break 
           his leg or worse if he jumped.

           He runs to the stairwell--yanks open the door--he hears 
           Cancer running up towards him.

           He’s trapped on the roof.

           THE SUV bursts out of the ramp. Nick sprints across the 
           rooftop and into the exit ramp.

           NICK runs down the ramp as the SUV hurtles down after him, 
           scraping and sparking the sides of the winding ramp.

           Round and round they go.

           NICK exits, sprints across the second level. He reaches 
           the edge of the level, climbs up, and jumps...

           ...hitting, rolling into an alley. He gets to his feet and 
           runs to the street and across to the park.

           IN THE PARK

           Nick scrambles behind a cluster of trees. He glances back 
           to the parking structure. It’s very dark.

           He spots Cancer crossing the street, hesitating at the 
           edge of the park, trying to figure out where Nick’s gone.

           Suddenly, Nick sees a FIGURE in a hooded sweatshirt walk 
           past Cancer--POP--a flash of orange light--Cancer crumples 
           to the ground as the pedestrian continues walking.

           Nick’s baffled. He doesn’t understand what just happened. 
           Who killed Cancer?

           Then Simon’s SUV exits the parking garage and speeds down 
           the street.

           SIMON steps out of the SUV, crouches beside Cancer’s body. 
           He glances up into the park, knowing Nick is out there, 
           assuming Nick just killed Cancer.

           Then Simon hurries back to the SUV and speeds off.
           NICK eyes the scene. Cancer lies still. Cars stream past, 
           nobody paying the slightest attention to a body lying on 
           the sidewalk.

           Nick’s call BUZZES. ID shows, “JIMMY.” Nick doesn’t 
           answer.

           He moves off through the park.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. KIMMEL CENTER - NIGHT 

           Nick hurries to the performers’ entrance.

           INT. KIMMEL CENTER - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Nick moves quickly through the backstage area. From 
           offstage, he eyes the orchestra--Laura’s seat is empty.

           Nick hurries to the performers’ dressing room. He unlocks 
           the combination lock of Laura’s locker. Her locker is 
           empty. Nick SLAMS closed the locker.

           He moves out of the room, back to offstage. He eyes Trudy 
           playing.

                                 NICK
                              (under his breath)
                        Trudy.

           Trudy doesn’t hear him.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Trudy!

           Trudy glances over. Nick gestures vigorously for her to 
           join him. She gives him a look that says, “Are you crazy?”

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Now!

           Trudy rises, moves off the stage.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Laura?

                                 TRUDY
                              (looking him over)
                        What happened to you?
                                 NICK
                        Where is she?!

           Trudy eyes Nick as if he’s a madman.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Do you know where she is, Trudy?

                                 TRUDY
                        She’s upset, Nick.

                                 NICK
                        I know that...I...Trudy you know I would 
                        never do anything to hurt Laura. You know 
                        me and if I tell you I need to find her, 
                        there’s a very good reason.
                              (pause)
                        Please. Do you know where she is?

                                 TRUDY 
                              (relenting)
                        At my place.

                                 NICK
                        Thank you.
                              (pause)
                        I need your car keys.

           Beat.

           Trudy hands over her keys and Nick hurries off.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. TRUDY’S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 

           Nick pulls the car over before a brownstone. He hurries 
           out of the car and up to the brownstone. He unlocks the 
           door with Trudy’s keys. He enters.

           Laura’s there. Nick shuts the door and locks it. He moves 
           to the living room and draws shut the curtains. He turns 
           off the lights.

           Laura studies him. A mess. Crazed.

           Nick grabs Laura and holds her tight.

                                 LAURA 
                        Those instructions were for you.

           Nick lets her go.
                                 NICK
                        Forget you ever saw them.

           Nick catches a glimpse of himself in a hallway mirror. He 
           looks like a madman with his raccoon eyes, mud peppered 
           over his face, his pants ripped and stained.

                                 LAURA 
                        You killed that man.

           Nick moves to the curtains, pulls a corner back and 
           glances out to the street.

                                 NICK 
                        We can’t stay here. You didn’t say 
                        anything to Trudy, did you?

                                 LAURA
                        No...I talked to Jimmy.

           Nick slowly turns, eyes his wife.

                                 NICK
                        Why did you do that?

                                 LAURA
                        Because I don’t know what the hell’s 
                        going on! And I’m worried about you, 
                        okay! And...

                                 NICK
                        Damn it!

                                 LAURA
                        Jimmy can help. He was a cop.

           Nick paces, trying to think this through. He flips open 
           his cell and speed-dials Jimmy.

                                 NICK 
                        Jimmy, it’s me...I’m with her, 
                        yeah...we’re coming to you.

           Nick shuts his cell.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. LAURA’S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Nick drives, Laura in the passenger seat.
                                 LAURA
                        You need to tell me what’s going on.

                                 NICK
                        I can’t. Just trust me.

           Laura opens her door.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        What the hell are you doing?!

                                 LAURA
                        Pull over, let me out, enough of this 
                        bullshit!

           Laura unbuckles, shifts sideways as if she’s going to jump 
           out.

                                 NICK 
                        Close the door!!

           Laura shifts her body closer to the edge of her seat.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Close the door and I’ll tell you!

           Laura slams her door closed, eyes Nick.

           Nick takes a moment, gathers his thoughts, then dives in:

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        The night of the rape, a man came to me. 
                        He told me he represented a group that 
                        could kill the guy who did it. But then I 
                        might have to do something for them.
                              (pause)
                        I said yes. 
                              (pause)
                        Five days ago, the guy shows up...

                                 LAURA
                        And?

                                 NICK
                        They wanted me to kill a child 
                        pornographer.

           Laura stares back in utter disbelief.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        They threatened me. They said if I didn’t 
                        do it they would hurt you. Us.

           Beat.
                                 LAURA 
                        Oh, God.

                                 NICK
                        I pushed him.
                              (pause)
                        But he wasn’t guilty of anything. He was 
                        just a journalist. They lied to me. They 
                        set me up.

           Laura shell-shocked, can’t find words. She stares straight 
           ahead, their car stopped in traffic in the tourist area of 
           South Street.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Laura.

           Laura won’t look at Nick. She eyes the traffic, the 
           tourists.

           She spots TWO COPS patrolling on foot.

           She throws open her door, grabs her handbag, and runs out 
           of the car.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        LAURA!

           LAURA weaves her way through the traffic.

           NICK pulls the car to the curb. He flings open his door 
           and exits, hurrying after Laura.

           He scans the sidewalk across the street. Can’t spot her.

           Nick dodges the traffic and reaches the sidewalk. There 
           are pedestrians everywhere. He eyes the area--spots the 
           cops--they’re eyeing him suspiciously, having seen Laura 
           run past.

           He takes a last look for her, but she’s gone.

           He hurries back to his car.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. LAURA’S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 

           Nick drives, cell to his ear, scanning the South Street 
           neighborhood. There’s no sign of Laura. He gets Laura’s 
           voicemail, leaves a message.
                                 NICK
                        You don’t know what you’re doing, you’re 
                        in real danger, Laura. Call me.

           Nick snaps closed his cell.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        FUCK!!

           Things are spiraling out of control. Nick steps on the 
           gas, speeds down the street and out of the neighborhood.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX - NIGHT 

           Nick pulls up to the curb, hurries into the complex.

           INT. ELEVATOR - MOVING - NIGHT 

           Nick rides the elevator up to Jimmy’s floor. He’s 
           sweating, anxious. He exits into the

           HALLWAY

           And makes his way quickly to Jimmy’s door. He POUNDS on 
           the door. The door swings open. It’s Jimmy. Nick pushes 
           past him and enters.

                                 NICK
                        Close the door and lock it.

           INT. CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT

           Nick, pacing, intense, has just told Jimmy everything.

                                 NICK
                        She could be anywhere--she’s not 
                        answering her phone.

                                 JIMMY 
                        They have a name, this group?

                                 NICK
                        I don’t know.

                                 JIMMY
                        Okay. Here’s the thing. After Laura 
                        called me, I got in touch with a friend. 
                        He’s a detective, still on the Force. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)
                        He’s cool--anything you tell him is on 
                        the down low, understand?

           Nick eyes his friend.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        He’s headed over here to talk to you, to 
                        help.

           Nick takes a hard look at Jimmy, suddenly wondering if 
           Jimmy is connected to the Organization.

                                 NICK
                              (weakly)
                        What’s his name, your friend?

                                 JIMMY
                        Elliot. We’ll figure this out, Nick. 
                        Laura’s going to be fine.

                                 NICK
                              (cracking)
                        Right.

           Nick moves to the window. He eyes his good friend in the 
           reflection.

           Nick opens his cell.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Weak signal. I’m going to try Laura again 
                        up on the roof.

                                 JIMMY
                        Just use my landline.

           Nick thinks fast:

                                 NICK
                        Need some air, too. Be right back.

           Nick moves through the apartment and out to the 

           HALLWAY

           He moves quickly to the

           STAIRWELL

           Instead of walking up, Nick hurries down the stairs.
           He reaches the lowest level, the lobby. He’s about to push 
           through the door when (through the small window in the 
           door) he spots a man at the elevators. It’s Sideburns. 

           Beat.

           Then Sideburns steps into an elevator. Nick waits a moment 
           then enters the lobby. He hurries through and out into the 
           night.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA STREET - NIGHT

           Nick hurries to Laura’s car, glancing nervously back to 
           the condo complex. No sign of anybody.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. LAURA’S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Nick drives, tries Laura again on her cell. Gets her 
           VOICEMAIL again.

           He snaps closed his cell, frustrated.

           Thinking.

           He has an awful realization.

           He speed-dials Jimmy.

                                 JIMMY (PHONE)
                        Where the hell’d you disappear to?

                                 NICK
                        Where’s Laura?

                                 JIMMY (PHONE)
                        I don’t know. Where are you, brother? My 
                        buddy Elliot’s here.

           INT. JIMMY’S CONDO - NIGHT

           TIGHT ON JIMMY on his phone.

                                 NICK (PHONE)
                        Don’t play games. You’re with them and I 
                        want to know where the hell Laura is.
                                 JIMMY
                        Calm down, Nick--

           A KNOCK (O.S.) at Jimmy’s door.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Get that, will you, Elliot.

           REVEAL: We see Jimmy’s friend, Elliot. Elliot is 
           Sideburns. He moves to answer the door.

           INT. LAURA’S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 

           Nick drives, on his cell.

           He hears MALE VOICES (PHONE), strange SNIPPETS of 
           conversation. Nick’s confused. What’s going on, what’s 
              being said?

           The voices grow HEATED.

                                 JIMMY (PHONE) 
                        What the hell?!

           GRUNTING AND SOUNDS OF A STRUGGLE (PHONE).

           A SHOT (PHONE)--Nick flinches at the sound.

           Then he hears the JIMMY’S PHONE FALLING ON THE FLOOR.

              What the fuck?

           Nick worries, no he’s certain, that it was Jimmy who was 
           just shot.

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        What did I make very clear?

           Nick freezes at the sound of Simon’s voice.

                                 SIMON (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Not to say a word to anybody? Christ, 
                        Nick, who else did you say something to?

           Nick is silent, still rocked by the killing of his friend.

                                 SIMON (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Nick.

           Nick gathers his wits. He channels his rage into action:

                                 NICK 
                        I have Marsh’s laptop.
                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                              (with a slight chuckle)
                        And?

                                 NICK
                        If you want it, you leave me and my wife 
                        alone. Or everything on that computer 
                        will be made public.

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        It’s worthless, Nick. Everything on 
                        there.

                                 NICK
                              (pause)
                        If it was worthless, you wouldn’t have 
                        killed Marsh.

                                 SIMON (PHONE) 
                        I didn’t kill him, remember? You did.
                              (pause)
                        And one more thing. What happened to your 
                        wife that night...it’d be a travesty if 
                        something similar, or worse, were to 
                        occur.

           A terrible beat.

              CLICK. Simon is gone.

           Nick shuts his cell. He’s trembling, shaken to his core.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. RITTENHOUSE SQUARE - NIGHT

           Laura sits on a bench eyeing the water dancing in a 
           fountain. She’s trying to make sense of everything, trying 
           to process what Nick’s told her.

           She looks beyond the fountain. A man on a bench also 
           watching the fountain. He looks familiar. She’s seen him 
           before, but can’t place him.

           Beat.

           Then realizes she saw him at the diner. He’s the man who 
           was sitting at the counter and followed Simon out.

           Cancer.

           Laura is suddenly worried. It can’t be a coincidence. He’s 
           not watching the fountain. He’s watching her.
           Laura rises. She does her best to casually walk out of the 
           park.

           She glances behind her. Cancer’s still eyeing the 
           fountain. He’s now on his cell. There’s no indication he’s 
           paying the slightest attention to her.

           She exits the park, crosses the street, and heads toward 
           the adjacent church.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT 

           Several blocks from Nick’s loft.

           Nick pulls his car to the curb. He gets out and heads 
           toward his home.

           He reaches the alley behind his loft. He moves cautiously 
           down the alley.

           He grabs the laptop from between the pallets and hurries 
           out of the alley.

           He moves warily down to his street. There’s a half dozen 
           PEDESTRIANS going about their business. There’s a tow 
           truck beside a car. The TOW TRUCK DRIVER (Bluetooth in his 
           ear) is changing a flat tire.

           Up the street, Scar’s body and car are gone. There’s no 
           sign of a murder ever taking place.

           From across and down the street he looks to the windows of 
           his loft, thinking Laura could be in there.

           He sees no movement inside.

           He approaches, passes the tow truck driver, continues 
           toward his loft.

           He enters his lobby. His cell BUZZES. A text message. From 
           Laura:

              CHURCH RITTENHOUSE

           Nick tries to make sense of it. The text seems to be cut 
           off.

              Rittenhouse. He turns and hurries back out of the lobby.

                                                            CUT TO:
           INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

           A soaring, Cathedral-like space. Dim light. It’s empty 
           save for an older couple praying in a pew.

           LAURA stands behind a column, hiding. At her side, she 
           holds her gun.

           She hears THE DOOR CREAK OPEN (O.S.).

           CANCER enters. He lets his eyes adjust and scans the 
           interior of the church.

           LAURA

           Pressed against the back of the column. Breathing fast. 
           Gripping the gun.

           She hears the DOOR OPEN (O.S.) again.

           She waits a moment...

           ...glances out from behind the column.

           No sign of him. Gone--

           She turns--a figure rushes her from behind.

           SHE FIRES A SHOT--it misses--HITS the stone wall. Cancer 
           is upon her, grabbing her wrist with the gun--yanking her 
           arm and forcing the gun from her grip.

           Laura SCREAMS. They struggle. Fall to the ground. Cancer’s 
           got something in his hand he’s trying to stab Laura with.

           Laura’s no match for Cancer. He uses his weight, his leg 
           and forearm to pin her down.

           He stabs Laura with a syringe. Laura YELLS in pain, 
           manages to bite Cancer’s hand--

                                 CANCER
                        Fuck!

           Cancer backs off her, gets to his feet.

           Laura tries to rise...stumbles...falls back to the ground. 
           Unconscious.

                                                            CUT TO:
           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Nick hurries away from his loft, back up the street toward 
           his car.

           He passes the tow truck driver. He continues to the end of 
           the street, and turns the corner--

           He feels a presence behind him--glances back--the tow 
           truck driver’s upon him--STABS him with a syringe in the 
           thigh--Nick SHOUTS in pain.

           Nick stumbles away from the man. The driver makes no 
           effort to come after him.

           Nick runs up the street. Ahead, he sees a SECOND MAN 
           getting out of a car. The man eyes Nick, makes no move to 
           approach or engage him.

           Nick scrambles across the street to avoid both men.

           He suddenly becomes dizzy and limp. The laptop slides out 
           of his grip, falls to the pavement. He tries to keep 
           moving but he can’t. The injection (Sodium Thiopental) is 
           working its magic.

           NICK’S POV: everything gets fuzzy--

                                                 SMASH CUT TO BLACK.

           FADE IN:

           INT. DARK SPACE - NIGHT 

           BREATHING.

           Movement within the dark space.

           A person in here.

           Feeling his or her way, touching the walls, realizing 
           they’re in a small, claustrophobic space.

           A STRANGE, AUTOMATED VOICE MUMBLES (O.S.) in the distance.

           Light from a cellphone. It’s Nick in here. He uses the 
           light of his cell to examine the space. He’s in some sort 
           of storage closet. He’s wearing an overcoat he doesn’t 
           recognize.

           A BLAST (O.S.) and RUMBLING. The force of the blast seems 
           to shake the whole room. Nick instinctively crouches.
           Then the rumbling is gone and all is quiet.

           Nick finds a door handle and opens the door. He steps out 
           onto a narrow walkway beside underground tracks. Far down 
           the tracks he sees the red lights of the disappearing 
           train.

           Nick moves along the walkway which parallels the tracks. 
           Somewhere to his left he hears the SQUEAKING of rats.

           He reaches a wider loading platform and continues along it 
           to a set of stairs. He takes the stairs up and emerges 
           into

           30TH STREET STATION - MAIN CONCOURSE

           A large space with a soaring ceiling. It’s crowded with 
           hundreds of commuters. A BUSKER plays a bucket drum in a 
           corner, the sound echoing around the space.

           Nick moves through the space. He stops in the middle of 
           the concourse. He scans the area, all the anonymous faces.

              What the hell is going on?

              And why is he alive? Why wasn’t he killed?

           Nick feels his pockets--touches metal. He glances inside 
           to see a handgun with a silencer. The other pocket has his 
           car keys, his cellphone, and an envelope.

           He rips open the envelope. Inside there’s a card key, and 
           two lines of cryptic instructions:

           THE CAR IS OUTSIDE

           FINISH R.L. WASHINGTON

           Nick’s baffled.

           Nick looks around him, trying to see if he’s being 
           watched. He can’t tell.

           He checks his cell phone. One missed call from 
           “RESTRICTED.”

           He speed-dials Laura’s cell, gets her VOICEMAIL.

                                 NICK
                        It’s me...call me...

           Nick shuts his cell. Thinking the worst has happened to 
           Laura.
           Then banishing the thought from his head.

           EXT. 30TH STREET STATION - NIGHT 

           Nick exits the station, studies the area and the people. 
           He’s confused and paranoid.

           He spots Laura’s car across the street parked in a 
           handicapped zone.

           Nick’s cell suddenly BUZZES. ID shows, “RESTRICTED.”

                                 NICK
                        Hello.

           There’s no answer.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        Why couldn’t you just do what I fucking 
                        told you, go live your life and forget it 
                        all?

                                 NICK
                        Where’s my wife?

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        I’m sending you an address. You’ll be 
                        told your final target when you get 
                        there.

                                 NICK
                              (pause)
                        I’m not doing it.

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        You need to.

           Nick hears strain in Simon’s voice.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        You want this to end, Nick, you want to 
                        be done forever? Then do what we ask.

           Simon hangs up. Nick shuts his cell.

           His cell BUZZES as a text arrives. An address.

           Nick moves to his car. Enters. He sits still. At a loss, 
           doesn’t know what to do. 
           He tries Laura’s cell again--gets her VOICEMAIL--hangs up.

           Thinking.

           Glancing around the area outside, crowded with people...

           There. The man who stabbed him--the tow truck driver (now 
           in dress clothes) watching him from near the entrance to 
           the station, Blue Tooth blinking in his ear.

           Nick hurries out of the car, walks directly towards the 
           man. The driver turns back in the station.

           Nick runs after him, up the steps and into the

           STATION

           Crowded. Nick scans the area. Spots the man. Hurries after 
           him. The man turns down a tunnel which leads to a train 
           track.

           Nick runs after him.

           Turns down the tunnel. Reaches the train track. A waiting 
           commuter train, people boarding, sounds echoing.

           Nick scans the area. Can’t find the man. Steps aboard the 
           train.

           INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - NIGHT 

           Nick moves up the aisle, pushing past people, searching 
           for the driver.

           He moves through several cars--then steps back out onto 
           the

           PLATFORM

           He’s halfway down the length of the train. He looks up and 
           down the platform.

           No sign of the guy. The doors to the train shut behind 
           him.

           The train starts out of the station. Nick eyes the faces 
           in the passing windows... 

           The Driver--staring out at Nick from a window...then gone.
           Nick moves back up the platform towards the heart of the 
           station.

           EXT. 30TH STREET STATION - NIGHT 

           Nick exits the station, warily eyes the area. He’s 
           guessing there must be someone else here watching him.

           But he can’t tell. Doesn’t recognize any of the faces.

           He approaches Laura’s car. Gets in.

           INT. LAURA’S CAR - NIGHT

           Nick takes another long look around the area. Still 
           doesn’t see anybody he recognizes.

           Thinking about Laura. Remembering her last text. 
              Rittenhouse.

           He starts the car and drives off.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. RITTENHOUSE SQUARE - NIGHT

           Nick pulls up beside the park. There are pockets of 
           people: couples, homeless, a group of taxi drivers smoking 
           and waiting for fares.

           He sees nothing suspicious, no sign of Laura.

           He eyes the other side of the street. A church.

           He gets out of the car and climbs the steps to the church. 
           Tries the door. Locked.

           He turns, looks out over the area, searching for a clue... 

           A Town Car pulls up behind his car. Idles.

           Then Durgan (the Lieutenant from the police station) steps 
           out of the driver’s side. He crosses the street to Nick.

                                 NICK
                        What did you do with my wife?

           Durgan doesn’t answer. He’s all business.
           Nick eyes the Town Car. The Mystery Man (glimpsed in the 
           police station lobby earlier) sits in the passenger seat, 
           staring intensely at Nick.

                                 DURGAN
                        The target is moving.

           Durgan approaches, hands Nick a sheet of folded paper with 
           the new address.

                                 DURGAN (CONT’D)
                        Here’s where you need to go.

           Nick tosses the paper to the ground.

                                 DURGAN (CONT’D)
                        Pick it up.

                                 NICK
                        Tell me where my wife is.

           Durgan picks up the paper with the address, hands it to 
           Nick.

                                 DURGAN
                        I’m trying to help you here.

           Durgan, frustrated, glances back to the car and the 
           Mystery Man. The man exits the car, approaches.

           He offers a forced smile. It’s the farthest thing from 
           comforting.

                                 MYSTERY MAN
                        We have a window of opportunity. If it 
                        closes, everything will get more 
                        complicated. For all of us.
                              (pause)
                        Go kill the bad rabbit.

                                 NICK
                        What the hell are you talking about?

                                 MYSTERY MAN
                        You have no options here, Mr. Gerard. If 
                        you don’t kill the target, you put 
                        yourself in jeopardy.

           The mystery man’s meaning is clear: Nick will die.

                                 NICK
                              (pause)
                        Why me? Why do I have to do it?
                                 MYSTERY MAN
                        Because you’re perfect--the bad rabbit 
                        knows you, and won’t be expecting you.

                                 NICK
                              (re: target)
                        Who is it?

                                 MYSTERY MAN
                        Go. It needs to happen now.

           Nick tries to think this through.

           But he can’t figure a way out.

           Nick enters his car. He drives off, glancing at the men in 
           his rear view mirror.

           Nick unfolds the sheet. Reads the handwritten address and 
           directions. Punches the address into the GPS.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. LAURA’S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Nick speeds down the highway, following the directions. He 
           leaves the skyline of Philly behind.

           LATER

           Nick takes an exit and drives into a Philly suburb. 

           He follows the directions to a generic business park. The 
           park consists of three, 5 story, identical office 
           buildings surrounded by parking lots.

           Nick slows, turns off the headlights, pulls the car to a 
           stop in the parking lot before building number 3.

           He scans the area. There’s no movement, no people, a few 
           cars scattered about the area.

           Nick glances at the instructions and pockets them. He 
           exits the car and skulks across the parking lot toward 
           building 3.

           Nick keeps to the wall as he makes his way to the entrance 
           door. He slides the card key--the reader shows green--and 
           the door unlocks.
           Nick enters the lobby area. It’s professional with marble 
           floors, tropical plants, and a sculpture fountain. There’s 
           no one manning the lobby desk.

           Nick moves through the lobby and into one of the 
           elevators.

           INT. ELEVATOR - MOVING - NIGHT 

           The elevator reaches the top floor and the doors open. 
           Nick warily steps out into the

           HALLWAY

           He eyes a set of double doors far down the hall.

           Nick pull his gun, glances up and down the long hallway. 
           Still and quiet.

           Nick moves past closed office doors. He’s tense. A few 
           beads of sweat on his forehead.

           A MECHANICAL NOISE (O.S.) behind him. He wheels. It’s just 
           the elevator door shutting.

           He takes a breath, focuses on the set of double doors at 
           the end of the hallway. Heads toward them.

           He reaches the doors.

           He steels himself. He pushes through, gun at the ready.

           INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

           A reception desk and a waiting area. Several framed avant-
           garde paintings on the walls.

           There are two doors, one on either side of the reception 
           desk.

           He listens...

           Thinks he hears something from behind the right door.

           He slowly approaches. Puts his ear to the door. He doesn’t 
           hear anything. 

           He throws open the door (a copy/supply room), gun at the 
           ready, and sees:
           LAURA. She’s tied to a chair, industrial tape over her 
           mouth. Her eyes show terror.

           Nick is frozen. No no no no. This is all wrong. Laura is 
              the bad rabbit.

           Nick takes a step closer to Laura. His face clouds with 
           dread.

           He glances down at his gun...

           ...back up at Laura.

           Laura makes a MUFFLED SOUND. She directs Nick with her 
           eyes back out to the lobby.

           Nick glances behind him. Nobody there.

           He turns to Laura--

           CLICK (O.S.). Nick wheels. Across the lobby, the opposite 
           door opens.

           SIMON steps out.

           Nick levels his gun, steps toward him. Simon freezes. The 
           men are both stunned to see each other.

                                 SIMON
                        What are you...

           Beat.

           Then Nick sees a glimmer of recognition in Simon’s face--
           Simon realizes why Nick is there. Simon makes a quick move 
           for his gun--

           A SHOT--the shot is muffled by the silencer--it hits Simon 
           in the arm and Simon recoils, thrown off balance, back to 
           Nick.

           Nick can’t tell if Simon’s reaching for his gun or not. 
           Simon turns--

           Nick SHOOTS AGAIN--hits Simon in the shoulder.

           Simon’s got his gun--trying to raise it--A THIRD SHOT. 
           Hits Simon in the chest.

           Simon crumples to the floor. Nick stands over him ready to 
           shoot again if necessary.

           Simon takes his last breaths.
           Then he’s gone.

           Nick’s breathing fast, adrenaline coursing. He’s still 
           wary, eyeing the door from which Simon emerged.

           He slowly pushes open the door, gun leveled. He enters a 
           large

           OFFICE

           It appears to be empty. He flings open a closet door. 
           Nobody in there.

           He glances about the room, noticing various items.

           He heads back towards the lobby. But he freezes at the 
           door.

           Thinking.

           He turns back and looks over the items in the office 
           again. He eyes:

           --C & K financial literature on the desk.

           --Several photos of Simon shaking hands with political 
           dignitaries.

           --A nameplate on the desk which reads, “R.L. WASHINGTON.”

           An ever-so-slight, warped smile of relief forms on Nick’s 
           lips as he realizes that Simon’s real name is R.L. 
           Washington. SIMON IS THE BAD RABBIT.

           Nick hurries out of the office and back to Laura. He 
           crouches beside her. She’s shell shocked. Nick peels the 
           tape off her mouth, unties her hands.

           He holds her. They hold each other.

           Nick’s still not sure if this is over or not, and if 
           they’re still in danger.

                                 NICK
                        We need to get out of here.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. LAURA’S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 

           Nick and Laura. Neither saying a word. They drive out of 
           the parking lot and through the suburb.
           They drive in silence.

           Finally:

                                 NICK 
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t...I’m so sorry, 
                        Laura.

           Laura won’t look at him. She stares straight ahead.

           Nick takes a ramp onto a highway. They drive through the 
           night.

           Laura reaches out and takes Nick’s hand.

                                 LAURA
                        I would have done the same thing.
                              (pause)
                        If they had come to me that night, I 
                        would have done the same thing.

           A moment between the two.

                                                    FADE THROUGH TO:

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA SKYLINE - DAY 

           A morning sky, the sun rising over Philly.

           INT. DINER - DAY 

           Nick and Laura sit across from each other in a booth. 
           They’re trying to regain a semblance of normalcy, reading 
           sections of the paper, sipping coffee.

                                 LAURA
                        Be right back.

                                 NICK
                        I’ll be here.

           Laura gets up, kisses Nick on her way to the restroom.

           Nick turns his attention back to the paper, the sports 
           section--

           The Mystery Man slips into the booth across from him.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        What do you want?
                                 MYSTERY MAN
                        We wanted to thank you.

                                 NICK 
                              (pause)
                        Simon was the bad rabbit.

                                 MYSTERY MAN
                        He went rogue. His actions compromised 
                        the Organization, compromised our ability 
                        to act swiftly, to cover up, to operate.
                              (pause)
                        Men get a taste of power, occasionally 
                        they feel the need to operate 
                        independently. Obviously, that can’t 
                        happen.
                              (pause)
                        There’s a very rigid protocol when we 
                        choose targets. We would never target 
                        innocent people like you, or your wife, 
                        or your friend Jimmy.

                                 NICK 
                        Why me? Why did I have to do it?

                                 MYSTERY MAN
                        Because our most important rule is that a 
                        member can’t kill another member. So we 
                        needed you to do it.
                              (pause)
                        I want to reassure you the Organization 
                        made certain there’s nothing that ties 
                        you to any of this.

           The Mystery Man takes a hard look at Nick.

                                 MYSTERY MAN (CONT’D)
                        Would you like to help us again? We think 
                        you’d be an asset.

                                 NICK
                        No.

                                 MYSTERY MAN
                        Things can get complicated. But that 
                        doesn’t make it any less worthy.

                                 NICK
                        I’m done.

                                 MYSTERY MAN
                              (pause)
                        Are you?
           Nick doesn’t answer. He’s not sure if the man’s question 
           is a threat or just a question.

           The Mystery Man rises. He moves through the diner and 
           exits.

           Nick follows. At the front windows of the diner, he eyes 
           the busy street, the pedestrians, searching for the man.

              There. Standing at the opposite curb beside an idling Town 
           Car. He stares back at Nick. He raises his cell to his 
           ear.

           Nick’s cell BUZZES. ID shows the number, “215-555-3876.”

                                 NICK 
                        Hello?

                                 MYSTERY MAN (PHONE)
                        In case you ever want to get in touch.

           The man hangs up. He enters the car. The car enters 
           traffic and disappears into the night.

           A HAND on Nick’s arm--it’s Laura.

                                 LAURA
                        What are you doing?

                                 NICK
                        I thought I saw a friend. Wasn’t him.

           Laura kisses Nick’s cheek, takes his hand. The couple head 
           back to their table. They sit, sip their coffees, read the 
           paper like any normal couple.

           They glance up at each other and share small smiles.

                                                          FADE OUT.
