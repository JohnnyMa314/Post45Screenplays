           EXT. ARRIVING INTO MANHATTAN - AERIALS - DUSK

           Stunning AERIAL SHOTS of Manhattan in the summer just as the 
           SUN IS SETTING. We eventually arrive at...

           EXT. DELACOURTE OUTDOOR THEATER - CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS

           WE JUMP CUT THROUGH key moments of a production of Romeo and 
           Juliet. Until the final scene where ROMEO is dying while 
           holding JULIET.

           WE JUMP CUT to the actors taking their final curtain call.

           EXT. DELACOURTE OUTDOOR THEATER - LATER

           The SUMMER CROWD files out. Amongst them are TWO VERY PRETTY 
           GIRLS in their early 20's, talking about the play. They are 
           approached by JAMIE, a super chic, gay Black guy.

                                 JAMIE
                             (charmingly effeminate)
                        Hey beautifuls, I'm so sorry to 
                        bother you, but I'm doing a feature 
                        for Time Out New York about what 
                        it's like to be young and fun and 
                        sexy in the summer. And I was 
                        wondering if I could write about a 
                        night out with you guys.

           The girls look at each other quizzically and LAUGH; clearly 
           flattered.

                                 GIRL #1
                        What? Why us?

                                 JAMIE
                        Because you ladies are all those 
                        things, you're sexy, cultured; just 
                        caught a lil' double suicide in 
                        Verona; probably need a few 
                        martinis.

                                 GIRL #2
                        Actually, that's exactly what we 
                        were gonna do.

                                 JAMIE
                        Deliciousness. Mind if I tag along?

                                 GIRL #1
                        Sure.
                                 JAMIE
                        Perfect. Oh, and here are the two 
                        guys I'm writing about.

           The CAMERA WHIPS 180 degrees and PUSHES IN ON: MAX and 
           NATHAN. Early 30's. Both cuter than hot, sitting in the 
           PERFECT LIGHT of a nearby lamppost.

           T'sup.
                                              What a play.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        All right, Posse. Let's see how 
                        y'all like to party in New York.

           EXT. THE BEATRICE INN - LATER - 4:00 AM

           Max, Nathan, Jaime and the Two Girls spill out of The 
           Beatrice Inn, pretty wasted.

                                 GIRL #1
                        This has been one of the most fun 
                        nights I've ever had in the city.

                                 GIRL #2
                        I know! I don't want it to be over!

                                 JAMIE
                        Well I have to head home, ya'll. I 
                        have to turn in this story by 
                        tomorrow night. But know where you 
                        guys should go?

                                 NATHAN
                        Where?

                                 JAMIE
                        There's a new super late night spot 
                        on Roosevelt Island called "The 
                        Mannequin Party".

                                 MAX
                        I know that place. Great idea. 
                        Thanks.

           Nathan hails a cab and the girls file in.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        We'll be right there.
           Max closes the door to the cab.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Thanks, bro. You're amazing.

           Jamie's ENTIRE DEMEANOR CHANGES. Suddenly he is VERY STRAIGHT 
           and VERY PISSED.

                                 JAMIE
                        Look you motherfuckers. Do I look 
                        like Heidi motherfucking Fleiss to 
                        you? I went to Julliard; I am an 
                        actor. I agreed to do the 
                        introduction thing, not to an all 
                        night Minstrel show. The next time 
                        I play a homo for six hours it'd 
                        better be in a production of 
                        "Angels in America" or some shit, 
                        okay? Y'all owe me! 

                                 NATHAN
                        Oh come on, Jamie, you had fun.

                                 JAMIE
                        I will suffocate you with my balls, 
                        Nathan. Peace. Good luck. Wrap your 
                        Jimmies. Wrap'em good.

           And with that he struts off angrily down the street. Max and 
           Nathan smile at each other and join the girls in the car.

           A beautiful, yet serious woman, JESSICA KEELER, 34, sits 
           amongst a room of really depressed looking people. 

                                 NURSE
                        Ms. Keeler... please come in.

           Jessica enters to find DR. MURPHY, 45, balding.

                                 DR. MURPHY
                        There's the hottest girl in anti-
                        depressants.

                                 JESSICA
                        Hello, Dr. Murphy. I won't take 
                        much of your time, but last time we 
                        spoke I thought you had mentioned 
                        increasing your prescriptions of 
                        Plomox in place of some of the 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JESSICA (CONT'D)
                        other SSRI's you've been writing 
                        for years.

                                 DR. MURPHY
                        And I thought you were gonna let me 
                        take you to dinner. Someplace hip, 
                        that'll be difficult to find.

                                 JESSICA
                        Dr. Murphy, I'm flattered, but as I 
                        told you before, I don't mix 
                        business and pleasure.

                                 DR. MURPHY
                        I wish you would. I'm way better at 
                        pleasure than I am at business. 

                                 JESSICA
                        What I can tell you is that SSRI's 
                        have come a long way in the last 
                        few years...

                                 DR. MURPHY
                        I don't wanna hear the pitch again, 
                        sweetheart. If you don't have 
                        anything new to say, I've got a lot 
                        of sad people to see.

                                 JESSICA
                        Well, thank you for your time.

           INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NURSE'S COUNTER - CONTINUOUS

           A DOWDY NURSE stops Jessica.

                                 DOWDY NURSE
                        You know, you'd sell a lot more 
                        pills if you'd just sleep with him. 
                        Or at least bring us a little 
                        payola. Last week a rep brought me 
                        this Obama Chia Head.

           She gestures to a President Obama Chia Head (a real thing) 
           with dead plants coming out of its head. A small sunlamp sits 
           blasting him from above.

                                 DOWDY NURSE (CONT’D)
                        His afro got burned. I had the 
                        sunlamp too high.

           OFF JESSICA'S REACTION WE CUT TO:
           EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS - UPTOWN - LATER

           Jessica strides down the street and answers her PHONE.

                                 JESSICA
                        I can't talk now, Soph.

                                 SOPHIE (O.S.)
                        Meet me at Rose Bar after work.

                                 JESSICA
                        No, please don't make me go out 
                        tonight. I'm having a horrible day.

                                 SOPHIE (O.S.)
                        I'm not asking, I'm telling.  It's 
                        my birthday.

                                 JESSICA
                        Your birthday's in six months!

                                 SOPHIE (O.S.)
                        I know, it's my half-birthday. If 
                        you want, you can only get half-
                        drunk, but either way I'm gonna get 
                        you laid.

                                 JESSICA
                        Okay, okay, fine; I'll come. I mean 
                        I'll come, not "cum". Unless I 
                        do... but that's gonna happen. I'm 
                        rambling; I gotta go. 

           A BURLY CONSTRUCTION WORKER ogles her amongst his friends.

                        Now that's a piece of ass.

                                 JESSICA
                        Excuse me?

                                 CONSTRUCTION WORKER
                        I said you got a nice ass. Don't 
                        act like you don't know.

                                 JESSICA
                        Awesome, thanks. So is it my turn 
                        to comment on your body now?

                        You are greasy and vile and so fat 
                        that I would need that giant crane 
                        over there to lift all of your many 
                        bellies just to begin to search for 
                        your smelly, grey dick. Personally, 
                        I would rather pour acid in my eyes

           Jessica and SOPHIE, 32, brunette, the cuter side of sexy, sit 
           at the bar, martinis in front of them.  

                                 JESSICA
                        The men we meet in here aren't any 
                        better. They're just willing to 
                        spend twenty bucks on a shot of 
                        vodka. At least Oliver was a 
                        gentleman.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Ugh, enough about Oliver. You've 
                        really gotta stop obsessing. 

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm not obsessing. I'm just stating 
                        a fact that he was a really good 
                        guy. And I deserve that, and I'm 
                        not gonna settle for mediocrity.

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh. Uh... last week. I boned 
                        like... a hundred dudes. 

           They LAUGH.
                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Seriously. I gang-banged the entire 
                        west side of Manhattan. It was 
                        exhausting. My vagina's still 
                        yawning.

           They LAUGH. Jessica lowers her head, beaten, vulnerable. THE 
           CAMERA SPEED RAMPS TO: the other end of the club, where Max 
           and Nathan chat up two HOT GIRLS, mid-20's.

                                 NATHAN
                        ...and I'm writing a feature for 
                        Time Out New York on Manhattan 
                        nightlife.

                                 HOT GIRL #1
                        There's a Black guy at the end of 
                        the bar using the same line. What 
                        did you guys take a workshop or 
                        something?

           Max and Nathan look down the bar where Jamie smiles and gives 
           them THE FINGER. Nathan pulls Max aside.

                                 NATHAN
                        He stole our bit. 

                                 MAX
                        He's gone rogue...

                                 NATHAN
                        That was horrible...  

                                 MAX
                        Oh c'mon, relax. That girl had 
                        horse teeth. Feel bad for her; 
                        Daddy lost her braces money on 
                        blackjack.

           Nathan nods, gets his bearings, and looks across the bar, 
           spotting Jessica and Sophie.

                                 NATHAN
                        What about them?

                                 MAX
                        Who, the Golden Girls?

                                 NATHAN
                        They're our age.

                                 MAX
                        Exactly. When was the last time you 
                        hooked up with a girl our age? I 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        know for me it was in a coat room 
                        at Alan Rosenberg's Bar Mitzvah. I 
                        squeezed his sister's ass during 
                        that weird chair-lifting dance.

           QUICK PUSH TO: Jessica and Sophie, same spot at the bar.  

                                 SOPHIE
                        Too bad we're not meth addicts, 
                        Katie just met an awesome guy at 
                        Narcotics Anonymous.

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh yeah, I'm super jealous of Katie 
                        and her ex-meth addict boyfriend. 
                        "Mom, this is Jerry, I'm sorry he's 
                        so itchy."

                                 SOPHIE
                        He's probably great in the kitchen.

           Jessica notices Max cruising over with a grin.

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh, Jesus... Here we go.

                                 MAX
                        Whatever happened to those little 
                        tiny umbrellas they used to put in 
                        drinks?

                                 JESSICA
                        Please don't bother.  Really...

                                 MAX
                        They were so great, you could use 
                        them to stir your drink, and then 
                        if it started to rain, you had 
                        something to keep yourself dry for 
                        the walk home.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I don't get it.

                                 NATHAN
                        I don't even get that.

                                 JESSICA
                        It's not even a line; it's just 
                        nonsense.
                                 MAX
                        Sorry, just sharing an observation. 
                        If I was Seinfeld, you'd be 
                        cackling right now. I'm Max.  

                                 JESSICA
                        I really don't care.

                                 MAX
                        Awesome. And this is Prince Nathan 
                        Spector of Canada.

                                 NATHAN
                        Hi.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Hi. I didn't know Canada was a 
                        monarchy.

                                 NATHAN
                        Oh, it is.

                                 MAX
                        It's mostly ceremonial stuff.

                                 NATHAN
                        I do lots of waving.

                                 MAX
                        Parades, kissing Mounties, that 
                        kind of thing. But he's in line for 
                        the throne. 

                                 NATHAN
                        When I'm king, Canada will finally 
                        conquer Mexico.

                                 JESSICA
                        I really don't mean to be rude, but 
                        we're so not interested. 

                                 MAX
                        Not interested in what?

                                 JESSICA
                        In what it is that you're offering.

                                 MAX
                        And what is it that I'm offering?

                                 JESSICA
                        To get us drunk enough to fuck you.  
                        It's not gonna be that kind of 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JESSICA (CONT'D)
                        night. Frankly, there isn't enough 
                        booze in the bar.

                                 MAX
                        Wow, you're charming.

           Max gives Nathan a look.  Nathan suddenly acts upset.

                                 NATHAN
                        Sorry, pal. My heart's just not in 
                        this tonight.

           A bummed-out Nathan mopes out of frame.  

                                 MAX
                        You know what? Fine. My best friend 
                        there just got dumped by his fiance 
                        a week before the wedding and all I 
                        wanted to do was cheer him up 
                        tonight.  I'm sorry that we're not 
                        cool enough to talk to you guys. I 
                        guess we'll just head around back 
                        and try to blow a busboy.

                                 SOPHIE 
                        Wait!

           Sophie raises her fresh martini.  Jessica rolls her eyes.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        Come back.

           EXT. ROSEBAR - LATER

           Jessica and Sophie huddle up as Max and Nathan try to hail a 
           cab in the background.

                                 JESSICA
                        You were just blowing them off when 
                        you said we'd go to Riker's Island, 
                        right?

                                 SOPHIE
                        It's Roosevelt Island, the one with 
                        the cable car. Riker's Island's the 
                        one with the prison.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'd rather go there.

                                 SOPHIE
                        C'mon. I know they're a little 
                        cheesy, but Nathan's kinda cute. Be 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        a good wingman... It's my half-
                        birthday.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm gonna half kill you.

           Max opens a cab door. The girls climb in.  Max grabs Nathan. 

                                 NATHAN
                        You realize we can't do this 
                        forever.  It has to end at some 
                        point, right?  

                                 MAX
                        Not tonight!

           On that, they both dart for the back door at the same time.

           INT. MAX & NATHAN'S LOFT - LATER

           The foursome enters an OLD MANNEQUIN WAREHOUSE turned into a 
           makeshift loft.  There are MANNEQUINS of every shape, size 
           and color in varying stages of completion hanging out 
           everywhere. It looks like a giant cocktail party. 

           Several of them have been set up next to a red velvet rope to 
           appear as though they are waiting to get in. Nathan hits the 
           MUSIC, while Max grabs a clipboard.

                                 MAX
                        Welcome to "The Mannequin Party", 
                        ladies. Are you on the list?

           Sophie LAUGHS. Jessica stares.

                                 JESSICA
                        You've got to be fucking kidding 
                        me.

                                 MAX
                        I see a Sophie on the list, but 
                        there's nothing on here about her 
                        bringing a "fun-assassin". 

                                 JESSICA
                        You've got about four seconds.

                                 MAX
                        I think we can probably squeeze you 
                        in. Please call ahead next time.

           Max leads them to a couch and sits them between two female 
           mannequins, one Black with no arms, one White with no legs.
                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                             (re: the mannequins)
                        This is Tootie and Blaire. They're 
                        in boarding school.

                                 JESSICA
                        Does this actually work on girls?

                                 MAX
                        You're here aren't you?

                                 JESSICA
                        We're not girls, we're women. 
                        Something tells me it doesn't work 
                        on women.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What happened to Tootie's arms?

                                 NATHAN
                        Roller-skating accident.
                             (to Sophie)
                        Would you care to get stoned and 
                        play Guitar Hero?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Yes, please.

           They move off to the TV area. Max and Jessica sit awkwardly 
           between Tootie and Blaire.

                                 MAX
                        Would you care to get drunk and 
                        play "hide my balls"?

           Jessica stares at him.

           INT. MAX & NATHAN'S LOFT - A LITTLE LATER

           Nathan and Sophie play Guitar Hero while sharing a joint.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I'm kinda stoned, but I think I'm 
                        doing really well.

                                 NATHAN
                        No, that's me. You haven't been 
                        playing for twenty minutes; I 
                        unplugged your controller cause you 
                        kept hitting start.

           THEY CRACK UP.
           ANGLE ON THE BAR: where Max stares at Jessica, typing an 
           email on her phone. Mannequins stand around holding drinks.

                                 MAX
                        While you're on there, throw in an

                        about her. She should suck it up;

                        Suit yourself. I'm heading back.

                        The musical on roller skates? What 
                        is there to adapt?

                                 NATHAN
                        They took all the music out. 
                        They're still on roller skates, but 
                        it's a straight drama now.

                                 MAX
                        The only thing I can imagine that's 
                        worse than a musical on roller 
                        skates is a drama on roller skates.

                                 NATHAN
                        Thanks. I've also been hanging out 
                        a lot with Sophie.

                                 MAX
                        Ah, enough with Sophie, dude! We 
                        haven't been out in for-never. We 
                        need to find some companionship. 

                                 NATHAN
                        I've already found some 
                        companionship.

                                 MAX
                        You sound so gay right now I wanna 
                        adopt you a baby and name it Adam 
                        Lambert. 

                                 NATHAN
                        Hilarious.

                                 MAX
                        We still on for Friday night?

                                 NATHAN 
                        Shit, I forgot.  I gotta go to 
                        Sophie's parent's house in Jersey.

                                 MAX
                        Oh, I'm sure that won't be boring 
                        at all. Does her father know you 
                        love cock?

                                 NATHAN
                        I'm gonna hang up now. 
                                 MAX
                        Are you gonna blow her dad? Be 
                        honest.

                                 NATHAN
                        Good-bye.

                                 MAX
                        Take pictures.

           Suddenly GERALD, 40's, Black, (Tracy Morgan-esque), is 
           standing in front of Max's cubicle holding a photograph.

                                 GERALD
                        What the fuck am I supposed to do 
                        with this?

                                 MAX
                        What do you mean? That's the photo 
                        from the Johnson accident you asked 
                        for.

                                 GERALD
                        This is the last time I'm gonna 
                        tell you this. I cannot use this 
                        artsy shit. It serves no purpose. I 
                        need some perspective, I need to 
                        see where the impact occurred. I 
                        wouldn't let my bird shit on this.

                                 MAX
                        C'mon you have to admit it's an 
                        amazing shot though, Gerry. Check 
                        out how the airbag's bursting 
                        through the windshield like it's 
                        bubbling out or something. Isn't 
                        that cool?

                                 GERALD
                        If you wanna keep this job, you 
                        better go get me some real pictures 
                        of this fucking car. Save the artsy 
                        shit for your mother's 
                        refrigerator. 

           Gerald walks off. Max is clearly BUMMED.  

           INT. ANGELICA MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

           Jessica sits alone watching a DANISH FILM. The theater is 
           empty except for a couple making out in front of her. THEY 
           MOAN as they kiss.
                                 JESSICA
                        Excuse me? I'm sorry, but could you 
                        please stop moaning?

                                 LADY
                        Mind your own business. We're not 
                        bothering you.

                                 JESSICA
                        Well, you are a little. I'm trying 
                        to watch the movie and you're both 
                        moaning. It's a little distracting. 

                                 GUY
                        It's subtitled! You don't need to 
                        hear it. Just read the fucking 
                        thing!

                                 JESSICA
                        Can't you moan at home? This is a 
                        Danish movie about an orphanage. 
                        Have some respect for Danish 
                        orphans.

                                 LADY
                        Don't be a bitch just cause you're 
                        alone.

           This stings Jessica. After a beat, she stands and POURS HER 
           ENTIRE GIANT SODA ON TOP OF THEM.

           EXT. ROOSEVELT ISLAND CABLE-CAR - NIGHT

           Max is on the phone in a packed CABLE-CAR.

                                 MAX
                        Tim! What's up, player? There's an 
                        awesome band at Joe's Pub tonight. 
                        Put your snorkel on, we're going 
                        muff diving... You're dad's in the 
                        ICU? Oh, that sucks. Well do they 
                        have any idea what time he might 
                        wake-up? They don't go on till ten.

           Max turns to an OLDER INDIAN MAN next to him in a turban.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        He hung up. Sorry I said, "muff-
                        diving". What are you doing later?

           EXT. 79TH STREET BOAT BASIN CAFE - A FEW EVENINGS LATER 

           Max sits alone and talks on the phone.
                                 MAX
                        Dave! It's Thursday night!  Time to 
                        cheat on that whore wife of 
                        yours...
                             (smile fades)
                        Oh, sorry, little man, is your 
                        Daddy home?

           INT. JOE'S PUB - LATER

           AN AWESOME BAND PLAYS. Max sits at the bar with the Indian 
           Man from the elevator. 

                                 MAX
                        Can I get you another vermouth?

                                 INDIAN MAN
                        Please. With olives.

           Max watches as a YOUNG GUY AND HIS WING approach TWO VERY HOT 
           GIRLS and have them LAUGHING in no time.  CLOSE ON MAX.

           INT. MAX AND NATHAN'S LOFT - LATER

           Max enters his pad, looking weary, until...  He HEARS MUSIC 
           from upstairs. He laughs and dashes up the stairs.

           INT. MAX & NATHAN'S LOFT - UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

           Max emerges from the spiral staircase, excited.

                                 MAX
                        Where's my boy?! I knew you'd be 
                        back.  Just let me shower and...

           Max sees Nathan's room and his jaw drops... Boxes everywhere, 
           walls stripped, computer equipment packed up.  Nathan 
           appears; he clicks off the MUSIC. 

           Before he can say a word, AVI, a short 35 year old Israeli, 
           wearing a New Jersey Nets Jersey comes out of the bathroom.

                                 AVI
                             (Israeli accent)
                        Do you have brush for the toilet? I 
                        just dropped my kids off at the 
                        pool and your bowl has many shit 
                        stripes.

                                 MAX
                        Who the hell are you? 
                                 AVI
                             (big smile)
                        I'm your new roommate. I just moved 
                        here from Israel. I'm studying to 
                        be a famous DJ. I like hookers.

                                 NATHAN
                        Whoa, Avi, slow down for a second. 

           Avi starts to unpack his suitcase in the background.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        I'm moving in with Sophie.

                                 MAX
                        What!? No!  Nathan, no!  Are you 
                        crazy?  You just met this girl!

                                 NATHAN
                        I know it's a little premature but 
                        her roommate's moving out and I'm 
                        there every night anyway, so...

                                 MAX
                        Well then who the fuck is this guy?

                                 AVI
                        My name is Avi, I'm studying to be 
                        a famous DJ. I like hookers.

                                 MAX
                        That's the only thing I already 
                        know about you!

                                 NATHAN
                        Look I know you can't afford the 
                        rent here alone, so I found you a 
                        subletter on Craig's list. 

           Avi holds up a bag of pills from his suitcase.

                                 AVI
                        Do you like Ecstacy?

                                 MAX
                        Can you shut the fuck up please for 
                        a second? And stop unpacking!
                             (to Nathan)
                        Do you have any idea what you're 
                        doing?  You just met her. You're 
                        not ready for this.
                                 NATHAN
                        Maybe you're not ready for this, 
                        but I am. I'm in love with this 
                        girl.

                                 MAX
                        Oh Jesus! I need to sit down.

                                 NATHAN
                        Max, I gotta be honest with you...  
                        I'm 34 years old. I'm over it; this 
                        lifestyle... going out non-stop. 
                        Searching all night for a girl I 
                        know I'm never gonna wanna see 
                        again in the morning. I just...  I 
                        feel like I kinda lost track of 
                        what I was really looking for. And 
                        then I met this girl and it just 
                        became so clear. She's what I've 
                        been looking for my whole life.

           A beat of silence.

                                 AVI
                             (just as sentimental)
                        That was very beautiful what you 
                        said. Sometimes... while I am 
                        inside of a hooker, I don't want 
                        her to leave because I know I will 
                        be left alone and feel sadness. But 
                        then I unload my man-seeds, and all 
                        I want is for her to leave quickly 
                        and hopefully without stealing any 
                        of my things.

           They stare at him. Who is this freak?

                                 MAX
                        You'll be back in a week.  

                                 NATHAN
                        I hope not.

           EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY

           Jessica and Sophie walk through the park.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm so happy for you. He seems like 
                        such a sweet guy. I have to admit, 
                        I've been a little lonesome not 
                        having you all to myself, but I 
                        really am happy for you.
                                 SOPHIE
                        Thanks, Jess. Ok now listen. We're 
                        gonna have a little house warming 
                        dinner and I'm gonna set you up 
                        with the doctor I've been telling 
                        you about.

                                 JESSICA
                        The dermatologist? No. He's gonna 
                        wanna talk about skin all night. I 
                        can't think of anything more boring 
                        than skin.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Oh no he won't. He's an amazing 
                        guy. I'm sure he has plenty of 
                        other things to talk about besides 
                        skin.

           INT. SOPHIE AND NATHAN'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jessica sits on a couch uncomfortably close to DR. ROBERTS. A 
           45 year old man with perfect skin.

                                 DR. ROBERTS
                        Am I boring you with all this talk 
                        about skin?

                                 JESSICA
                        No, I love it. There's just so much 
                        to learn. I wanna be careful not to 
                        learn it all tonight, though, 
                        'cause... I wanna savor it. Gotta 
                        leave some info for next time.

           He smiles. Then stares at her hair.

                                 DR. ROBERTS
                        Do you know you have dandruff?

           THE CAMERA SPEEDS ACROSS THE COCKTAIL PARTY TO:

           Max stands with KIM, a 22 year old hottie in a short skirt. 
           They are looking through Nathan's record collection. 

                                 KIM
                        I can't believe you used to have to 
                        download music onto these giant 
                        discs.

           Max stares at her.
                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        I'm kidding; c'mon. I'm not an 
                        idiot.

           He smiles; relieved.

                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        My dad has an old Simon and 
                        Garfunkel record where they sang 
                        "Bridge Over Troubled Water" with 
                        no instruments at all. The whole 
                        song: entirely Acapulco. 

           Max's smile fades again.

                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        Do you think there's any blow here?

           REVEAL: it's a total yuppy/intellectual gathering. People 
           sipping red wine, women playing with a newborn.

                                 MAX
                        You know it's not really that kind 
                        of party, Kim. But I'll check with 
                        the newborn, he's usually got 
                        Colombia's finest.

                                 KIM
                        That baby does coke?

           OFF MAX'S LOOK.

                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        I'm kidding. Babies can't do blow; 
                        I'm not an idiot. I mean they can, 
                        but they shouldn't. My niece got 
                        into some coke in my purse once 
                        while I was baby-sitting; I walked 
                        in and it was all over her face. 
                        Look at this picture, it's my 
                        wallpaper. 

           INSERT PHONE: her wallpaper is a picture of an adorable 
           toddler whose FACE is covered in cocaine.

                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        She looked like a mime.

           MAX'S FACE. CLINK-CLINK-CLINK. Nathan taps a champagne glass. 

                                 NATHAN
                        Hello. Thank you all so much for 
                        coming here tonight to welcome us 
                        into our new home. We chose each of 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NATHAN (CONT'D)
                        you, because you're very important 
                        in our lives and... we love you 
                        very much... and... we wanted you 
                        to be the first to know that...

                                 SOPHIE
                        I'm pregnant.

           The entire room is shocked.

                                 JESSICA
                        What?!

                                 MAX
                        What?!

                                 NATHAN
                        We realize this is going to shock 
                        most- if not all of you...

                                 SOPHIE
                        But we're in love. And this 
                        happened. And... when we found 
                        out... we looked each other in the 
                        eyes, and there wasn't even a split 
                        second where we considered doing 
                        anything other than welcoming it 
                        into our lives.

                                 NATHAN
                        Okay, somebody say something...

                                 JESSICA
                        Congrats?!

           With that the entire room erupts with APPLAUSE and moves in 
           to hug and talk to them.

                                 KIM
                        She shoulda taken the morning after 
                        pill. I pop those babies like 
                        they're Flinstones.

                                 MAX
                        Excuse me for a sec.

           He weaves through the crowd to Nathan, just as Jessica 
           arrives at Sophie.

                          JESSICA
                                                           MAX
           Why didn't you tell me?!
                                              Have you lost your fucking 
                                              mind?!
                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I mean seriously, both of you. What 
                        is going on here? You're only in 
                        your early thirties; it is way too 
                        early to start having kids!

                                 JESSICA
                        What are you talking about? It's 
                        the perfect time.

                                 MAX
                        Well for her, yeah. There's the 
                        ticking... bomb thing.

                                 JESSICA
                        Clock.

                                 MAX
                        What?

                                 JESSICA
                        It's a ticking clock not a bomb, 
                        jackass. 

                                 MAX
                        Whatever; her uterus is ticking.

                                 SOPHIE
                        My uterus is fine.

                                 MAX
                        Well now it is, it got what it 
                        wanted.

                          NATHAN
                                                         SOPHIE
           Hey!
                                              Hey!

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.

                                 JESSICA
                        Look, this is fucking crazy! And 
                        completely out of the blue... but 
                        they're in love and it's beautiful. 
                        And I'm happy for you both.

           She moves in to hug Sophie, leaving Max and Nathan alone.

                                 MAX
                        Buddy, buddy, buddy.

                                 NATHAN
                        I know you can't see this right 
                        now...
                                 MAX
                        No, I cannot.

                                 NATHAN
                        But please be happy for me. I've 
                        never been more sure I'm doing the 
                        right thing.

                                 MAX
                        I gotta go get a drink.

           He walks off, passing Kim (Max's date) talking to Sophie...

                                 KIM
                        If you ever need a baby-sitter, I'm 
                        amazing with kids.

           EXT. SOPHIE AND NATHAN'S APARTMENT, SOHO - LATER

           It's POURING RAIN. Max attempts to look for a cab as Jessica 
           strides out with a giant umbrella.

                                 JESSICA
                        You're never gonna find a cab here 
                        genius, you gotta walk to the 
                        avenue.

                                 MAX
                        Really? It's my first day in 
                        Manhattan, will you help me find my 
                        way? Where's the line to bang      
                        A-Rod?

           She heads off. He follows behind her.

                                 JESSICA
                        What happened to your twelve year 
                        old?

                                 MAX
                        She had far too many strikes 
                        against her already before she 
                        brought up astrology. I left her 
                        upstairs talking to your date about 
                        why Capricorns can't cum.

                                 JESSICA
                        What were her strikes? Thinking? 
                        Doing her homework on the bar?

                                 MAX
                        You may think I'm shallow, but even 
                        I will walk away from a hot girl if 
                        she's that vapid.
                                 JESSICA
                        Yeah, right. You're just upset 
                        about losing your wingman. If you 
                        had her in your "mannequin lair" 
                        right now you two'd be ass to ass.

                                 MAX
                        Ass to ass; something you 
                        recommend?

           They reach the restaurant, Balthazar.

                                 JESSICA
                        Look, I don't have the energy for 
                        you right now. I have to go home 
                        and process this very bizarre news 
                        under my covers where I can think. 
                        You'll be able to find a cab here.

                                 MAX
                        How do you know?

                                 JESSICA
                        Because this is my favorite 
                        restaurant and every time I...

           She turns and sees inside the window. Her face drops.

                        I loved him in American Psycho.

                        Black ones.

                                 MAX
                        Wow, you did fuck up; he's a catch.

                                 JESSICA
                             (almost to herself)
                        He's alone, right?  Should I go say 
                        hi?  Shit, I'm in flats. I wish 
                        Sophie was here...

                                 MAX
                        Sophie would be no help for this real-
                        life sitch, trust me.

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh, and I'm sure you'd know exactly 
                        what to do? Lemme guess? Race in 
                        there and make a dick joke. You 
                        have no idea how a man like that 
                        thinks. You're a little boy; you 
                        hit on girls.

                                 MAX
                        Please. You want that guy back?

                                 JESSICA
                        Yes.

                                 MAX
                        Easy. Here's what we're gonna do. 
                        For starters, relax a little.  
                        Maybe undo your top two buttons 
                        there and let those little fellas 
                        peak out. What're those things, B 
                        pluses?

           Jessica looks at Max with fire in her eyes.
                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Okay, doesn't matter. We're gonna 
                        go in there and get a table. You 
                        act like you're gonna head to the 
                        bathroom, recognize him as you pass 
                        by and ask him to join us for a 
                        drink. He will; no one eats alone 
                        when people they know are watching.  
                        I'll play the handsome doctor who's 
                        clearly trying to get at your 
                        vertical smile.  Nothing fancy; I'm 
                        a chiropractor or something; I 
                        can't have him droppin' 
                        cardiologist lingo on me...
                             (beat)
                        Just as I order oysters and a 
                        bottle of champagne, I'm gonna get 
                        an emergency call: somebody's 
                        dying.

                                 JESSICA
                        I thought you were a chiropractor.

                                 MAX
                        Somebody's spine has popped out of 
                        their back and they can't move him 
                        cause he's on the subway tracks. 
                        And I'm a fucking hero, they're 
                        always callin' me for these kinds 
                        of things... 

                                 JESSICA
                        Continue!

                                 MAX
                        Sorry. I apologize for abandoning 
                        you and then you and him will be 
                        alone, tipsy, and calling each 
                        other "doodlebug" by dessert.

                                 JESSICA
                        Why does that not sound horrible? 

                                 MAX
                        Men come in many styles, but when 
                        it comes to women we're all working 
                        from the exact same playbook.

           Jessica takes a deep breath and undoes her top buttons.

                                 JESSICA
                        Alright...  Let's do this.

           She heads to the restaurant door.  Max stops her.
                                 MAX
                        Hold on; flag on the play.

           An EXQUISITE BLONDE is escorted to Oliver's table. JESSICA'S 
           POV:  Oliver stands and greets her.  They kiss.  

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit. I gotta become a 
                        cardiologist. That my friends, is 
                        what we call a Ten. Don't feel bad; 
                        you can't compete with that. Not in 
                        your present state.

           Max shrugs and checks the time on his phone.  

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Ok, well, that sucks, sorry. I'm 
                        gonna grab this cab. Don't stand 
                        there for their whole dinner; it's 
                        a little depressing. 

           JESSICA'S POV: Couples everywhere, nibbling, whispering, 
           laughing. She turns around to see Max watching her from the 
           cab. He rolls down the window and YELLS OVER THE RAIN.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        You look like a stalker. Do you 
                        want a ride?

           OFF JESSICA: standing alone in the rain.

           INT. WEST VILLAGE CAFE - LATER 

           The rain has stopped. Only Max, Jessica and a few others 
           linger in this cozy cafe. AWESOME MUSIC PLAYS softly.

                                 JESSICA
                        We were ring shopping. Then out of 
                        nowhere he said he needed time to 
                        get his head straight before he 
                        could take our relationship to the 
                        next level.

           Max nods knowingly.

                                 MAX
                        That excuse is like government 
                        issued to every born male. They 
                        should just staple it to our birth 
                        certificates.

                                 JESSICA
                        I just wish I knew what happened.
                                 MAX
                        Everybody that gets dumped says 
                        that.  "What happened" is that he 
                        didn't want to date you anymore. 
                             (beat)
                        No offense... In his eyes, you were 
                        "get-over-able".

                                 JESSICA
                        Ouch.

                                 MAX
                        But what can you do? I look at it 
                        like this; you remember those 
                        pictures they used to sell in malls 
                        when we were in high school. It was 
                        like some trippy collage, but if 
                        you zoned your eyes out just right, 
                        all of a sudden a 3D image of 
                        like... a unicorn or a skull would 
                        suddenly pop out at you?

                                 JESSICA
                             (a faint smile)
                        We had one in my dorm room of a 
                        dolphin.

                                 MAX
                        Right. So when you're dating and 
                        you're meeting all these people, 
                        most of them are just gonna see the 
                        trippy collage that is you. They'll 
                        see it, maybe appreciate it for a 
                        little while, but if they move on, 
                        you can't take it too personally. 
                        They just never got to see what was 
                        really there. 

                                 JESSICA
                        He never saw my dolphin. 

                                 MAX
                        Exactly. If he saw your dolphin he 
                        wouldn't have gone anywhere.

           Jessica softens slightly at this.

                                 JESSICA
                        So you really think I can't compete 
                        with girls like that blonde?  
                                 MAX
                        You can compete on an aesthetic 
                        level. I mean, aside from a few easy 
                        fixes you're pretty hot.

                                 JESSICA
                        What do you mean fixes?

                                 MAX
                        Getting dumped has made you lose 
                        all your confidence. You're 
                        rattled, insecure, your posture's 
                        fucked... You look like a figure 
                        skater who just wiped out at the 
                        Olympics. She's gotta finish the 
                        routine, but she knows she's gonna 
                        spend the rest of her life dressed 
                        like a snowman in the Ice Capades. 
                             (beat)
                        You need to loosen up a little, go 
                        on some dates, flirt a little. Have 
                        a little sex. Get your confidence 
                        back. Then you could compete with 
                        girls like that blonde. Although 
                        her ass was re-donkulous...

           A PRETTY WAITRESS arrives at their table.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Hey, what time do you shut this 
                        place down?  

                                 PRETTY WAITRESS
                        As soon as you guys leave. Why?

                                 MAX
                        Where's the best place around here 
                        for you and I to go and "bar-
                        snuggle"? 

                                 PRETTY WAITRESS
                        Excuse me?

                                 MAX
                        "Bar-snuggling"; don't worry, we're 
                        not gonna be the obnoxious couple 
                        making out in the corner, we're 
                        just gonna sip some Goldschläger 
                        and enjoy some light groping. If at 
                        any point I get more than a half 
                        chubby, we've both failed.

           The waitress stares at Max like he's from another planet. 
           Jessica shakes her head in disbelief. She can't resist: 
                                 JESSICA
                        Sorry...  He's just kidding. He's 
                        actually an amazing portrait 
                        photographer and I'm one of the 
                        curator's of the MOMA's photo 
                        collection. We're over here trying 
                        to find a really cool space in the 
                        village to have his latest show. 

                                 PRETTY WAITRESS
                        Oh. Awesome. I love photography. I 
                        tried to model for a second, but 
                        the other girls in this town were 
                        way too intense for me. 

                                 JESSICA
                        You should let Max shoot you; his 
                        work's amazing.

                                 PRETTY WAITRESS
                        No, no thanks. That's not really me 
                        anymore. But maybe I'll come to the 
                        show... Here's your check, have a 
                        good night.

           She walks off.

                                 JESSICA
                             (incredulous)
                        You are horrible at hitting on 
                        women. You're like a fucking 
                        caveman. How do you ever get laid?

                                 MAX
                        Well, what good did your stupid 
                        little story do?  She'd love to 
                        maybe attend a photography show I'm 
                        not even having. 

           The waitress bounces back with an excited smile.

                                 PRETTY WAITRESS
                        You know what? I changed my mind. 
                        I'm trying to be more spontaneous. 
                        I would love for you to shoot me.

           Max is shocked. Jessica smiles.

                                 MAX
                        Great.
                                 PRETTY WAITRESS
                        Here's my number. I guess just call 
                        me and let me know when and what 
                        you want me to wear.

                                 MAX
                        Okay.

           She gives him a flirty smile and walks off. Max is in awe.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Wow.

                                 JESSICA
                        You're welcome. It's been 
                        memorable...  At the very least 
                        I'll get my money's worth at my 
                        shrink tomorrow.

           Max nods his head, still stunned.  Jessica stands to leave.

                                 MAX
                        Wait.

                                 JESSICA
                        What?

                                 MAX
                        This is good.

                                 JESSICA
                        We're not gonna bar-snuggle.

                                 MAX
                        No, not us, ass-face. But us... as 
                        a team. We both lost our wing 
                        people. Maybe we could help each 
                        other out a little bit.

                                 JESSICA
                        Absolutely not.

                                 MAX
                        Look, you could obviously use a 
                        little coaching; and the Jedi mind 
                        trick you just did on this naughty 
                        waitress was genius.

                                 JESSICA
                        What exactly are you suggesting?

                                 MAX
                        Simple.  You just help me meet 
                        girls, and I'll help you find your 
                                 (MORE)

                        dream dude; an all new Oliver. 
                        Better than Oliver.

           Max puts his hand out.  A long beat as Jessica wrestles with 
           this.  Then... She clasps Max's hand.  They shake.  

                                 JESSICA
                        I'll think about it.

           INT. SOPHIE AND NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Nathan and Sophie roll around, making out on a bed amidst the 
           Sunday Times.  Nathan's CELL RINGS.

                                 SOPHIE
                        No.

                                 NATHAN
                        I have to; he just walked out last 
                        night.

           He picks up the phone.

                                 NATHAN (CONT'D)
                        Hey buddy. What happened to you 
                        last night?

           Nathan walks into the walk-in closet, away from Sophie.

           EXT. AVENUE A - CONTINUOUS

           Max walks through the eclectic Alphabet City.

                                 MAX
                        I admit I was a little taken aback 
                        about the level of your stupidity, 
                        but I'm over it now. You've been 
                        replaced.

                        By who?

                                 MAX
                        It's "Whom", dickhead. "By whom?" 
                        And you'll never guess... Jessica. 
                        We're joining forces.

                                 NATHAN
                        What?! Why? I mean... what?!
                                 MAX 
                        Dude, she's amazing. You shoulda 
                        seen the shit she pulled on this 
                        waitress for me last night. She's 
                        like the "Vagina Whisperer". 

                                 NATHAN
                        And she wants your help?

                                 MAX
                        She's desperate for it.  Dude, the 
                        girl is so fucked up by her Ex it's 
                        a miracle she even leaves her 
                        apartment. I'm gonna help her find 
                        some cheeseball doctor and she's 
                        gonna get me liz-naid.

                                 NATHAN
                        Okay... Well, good luck with that 
                        buddy...

                                 MAX 
                        And don't blab any of this to your 
                        little incubator over there, okay? 
                        Jessica wants to keep this top 
                        secret.

                                 NATHAN
                        Of course. I won't say a word.

           Max and Nathan hang up.  Nathan exits the walk-in closet.

           INT. SOPHIE AND NATHAN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Nathan enters the bedroom.  Sophie gives him a look.

           OFF NATHAN'S LOOK...

           Jessica walks pulling her roller bag of samples.  She answers 
           her RINGING BLACKBERRY.

                        Is this a cry for help?
                                 JESSICA
                        I never said yes, I said I'd think 
                        about it. And do you have any 
                        better ideas?  You've decided to 
                        have a baby with a stranger, so I 
                        figured I should start thinking 
                        outside the box as well. 

                                 SOPHIE 
                        It's just that you're in a very raw 
                        place right now. And he's a very 
                        raw person. And I just think that's 
                        too much raw. 

                                 JESSICA
                        What do you want me to do? Sit at

                        troll through my friends' friends

                        I have to call you back.

           Jessica clicks back to Sophie.

                        Okay, maybe you're right.  I'm 
                        acting desperate. He's disgusting.

           JANET, 37, also with a wheeled bag of samples, fixes her make-
           up. She has obviously been crying.

                                 JANET
                        Hey.

                                 JESSICA
                        Hey, Janet, how are you?

                             (fast and neurotic)
                        Uch, totally stressed. Dr. Cohen's 
                        the last single doctor on my call 
                        list. We've had two dates, and I 
                        thought they went amazingly, but 
                        Cynthia from Zoloft just told me 
                        she saw him at Blue Man Group with 
                        Allison from Xanax. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh... well I'm sure you'll find 
                        somebody, Janet. You just need to 
                        relax a little.

                                 JANET
                        I don't know what there is to be 
                        relaxed about; I'm 37 and I wanna 
                        be in love and have a family... I 
                        work non-stop; I'm running out of 
                        options. You know, I was engaged to 
                        Dr. Foster, the psychiatrist... 
                        until I caught him fucking Alexis 
                        from Colonopin. Those fucking anti-
                        anxiety girls are so fucking 
                        relaxed; I can't compete with them!
                             (beat)
                        Okay. How do I look?

           She has mascara running down her cheeks from tears.

                        Great.

                        Good luck.

           Max and Jessica descend into the SUPER TRENDY CLUB as AN 
           AWESOME HIP-HOP SONG PLAYS. The crowd is SUPER YOUNG and 
           SEXY. Everyone is texting on their phones; even the 
           bartenders. Jessica gets bumped as TWO TWENTY TWO YEAR-OLD 
           girls push by her.  Max's jaw drops at how HOT they are.

                                 JESSICA
                        So that's what you like? Kids? 
                        Aren't you guys supposed to 
                        register when you move into the 
                        neighborhood?

                                 MAX
                        Don't hate on them just cause 
                        they're young.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm not hating on them. I was them 
                        ten years ago; I had the time of my 
                        life. I'm just digesting the fact 
                        that you're 35 and that's what you 
                        like. I would have no interest in 
                        someone that young. 

                                 MAX
                        Really. Not even him?

           Max points to COLIN, a VERY ATTRACTIVE YOUNG MALE MODEL

                        "21 Jumpstreet" days. But what the 
                        hell would we talk about; 
                        skateboards?

                        Would you sleep with him?
                                 JESSICA
                        No!

                                 MAX
                        Lying to me is pointless.

                                 JESSICA
                        Of course I would, look at him; 
                        he's like Zac Efron, but legal.

                                 MAX
                        All right, so go say hi.

           He gives her a gentle push and she wanders over and sits next 
           to Colin who's TEXTING ON HIS PHONE. In fact, all five people 
           at the table are TEXTING ON THEIR PHONES.

                                 JESSICA
                        You guys all texting each other?

           Colin looks up.

                                 COLIN
                        Why would we be doing that?

                                 JESSICA
                        It's just so loud in here, I 
                        thought maybe that's how you talk 
                        to one another about your day.

                                 COLIN 
                        No. I'm Tweeting about how this 
                        place sucks tonight.

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh, does it? I just got here, so... 
                        I was kinda holding off on Tweeting 
                        until I took in the whole "vibe". I 
                        like to make sure all of my Tweets 
                        are well-informed and not just some 
                        meaningless drivel about what I'm 
                        doing that no one could possibly 
                        care about.

           Colin stares at her then goes back to his phone.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        What are you Tweeting now?

                                 COLIN
                        That a really hot girl just sat 
                        down.
                                 JESSICA
                             (totally charmed)
                        Oh, thank you.

                                 COLIN
                        No, not you. Her.

           He points to a 24 YEAR OLD MODEL that just sat down at the 
           other side of the table. She's TEXTING ON HER PHONE.

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh.

                                 COLIN
                        But no offense; you're hot too. I 
                        just didn't Tweet about it when you 
                        sat down.

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh, I see.

                                 COLIN
                        Do you want some coke?

                                 JESSICA
                        Sure, with a lil' Jackie Daniels if 
                        you got it.

                                 COLIN
                        No, coke-coke. Not Coca-Cola. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh, coke-coke; no, no thank you. 
                        It's been a very long time and I 
                        have to walk later. 

                                 COLIN
                        You can't walk on coke?

                                 JESSICA
                        No, no, not me. I can only run when 
                        I'm on coke and I'm wearing a very 
                        high heel tonight, so running is 
                        out of the question. 

                                 COLIN
                             (with a smile) 
                        You're kinda funny.

                                 JESSICA
                        Thank you. What year were you born?

                                 COLIN
                        Why?
                                 JESSICA
                        Humor me.

                                 COLIN

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh Jesus.  

           She stands abruptly.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        It was very nice meeting you all.

           No one looks up.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Please send my love to all your 
                        parents.

           She finds Max at the bar.

                                 MAX
                        What happened?

                                 JESSICA
                        What happened?! He's 20 years old 
                        is what happened! He's probably 
                        still got some after-birth on him. 
                        And what is it with this young 
                        generation and cocaine? Nancy 
                        Reagan needs to get her ass back 
                        out there; these kids cut more 
                        lines then fat people at 
                        Disneyland. This was a mistake.

           She heads for the door.

                                 MAX
                        Ok, wait, wait, wait. Where do you 
                        wanna go?

           OFF JESSICA'S FACE WE HARD CUT TO:

           INT. BOWERY HOTEL LOBBY - LATER

           A MELLOW SONG PLAYS SOFTLY as Jessica and Max sit on an 
           overstuffed couch next to the fireplace in the lobby. 

                                 MAX
                        Do they have afghans here? I might 
                        get a little chilly during my nap.
                                 JESSICA
                        I like it here. You can actually 
                        have a conversation; get to know 
                        someone.

                                 MAX
                        This isn't going out; it's like 
                        drinking in Liberace's bedroom. 
                        What time do they tuck us in?

                                 JESSICA
                        Don't you like to talk to people? 
                        Or does what she has to say not 
                        matter at all?

                                 MAX
                        I feel like this is a trick 
                        question.

                                 JESSICA
                        No I'm serious. Is your sole goal 
                        as a man just to bring home the 
                        hottest girl you can and have sex 
                        with her?

                                 MAX
                        Yes.

                                 JESSICA
                        Oliver isn't like that.

                                 MAX
                        Of course he is. You think the 
                        whole time he was at dinner with 
                        that blonde he wasn't counting the 
                        minutes till he could get her 
                        naked? Stop lying to yourself; it 
                        deserves better.

           A HOT ASIAN GIRL sits down on the couch across from them. 
           (She is far enough away that when the two of them whisper she 
           cannot hear them.)

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                             (loud so she can hear)
                        ...And that's why I love rice.

           Jessica looks at him like, "you've got to be kidding me".

                                 JESSICA
                             (tight whisper)
                        That's the best you've got; rice?
                                 MAX
                             (tight whisper)
                        I'm establishing a common interest. 
                        Have you ever met an Asian person 
                        that hates rice? 

                                 ASIAN GIRL
                        Do you guys mind if I sit here?

                                 MAX
                        No, please; join us.

                                 JESSICA
                             (tight whisper)
                        Everybody likes rice! Who the hell 
                        doesn't like rice?

                                 MAX
                             (a little too loud)
                        I fucking hate rice!

                                 ASIAN GIRL
                        I thought you just said you loved 
                        rice.

                                 MAX
                        I'm very mercurial when it comes to 
                        rice. My feelings about rice 
                        fluctuate from moment to moment.

           She smiles. He's a smidgen charming.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                             (tight whisper)
                        She smiled. It worked.

                                 JESSICA
                             (tight whisper)
                        She smiled cause you're an idiot. 
                        She's laughing at, not with.

                                 MAX
                        What's with the hostility?  What 
                        the hell did I do?

                                 JESSICA
                        Men are so shallow.  At the end of 
                        the day all it comes down to is 
                        feeding your egos by trying to fuck 
                        the hottest girl you can. You're 
                        probably drafting the story you're 
                        gonna tell your buddies while 
                        you're still inside the poor girl.
                                 MAX
                        To sleep with, yes. But if you're 
                        gonna commit, she's gotta have the 
                        complete package.

                                 JESSICA
                        Wait, are you implying I'm not the 
                        complete package?

                                 MAX
                        You inferred, I never implied. But 
                        obviously not. You're hot, but 
                        quite alone. Why is that? Take some 
                        responsibility.

                                 JESSICA
                        I choose to be alone. I'm not gonna 
                        waste my time with some "place-
                        holder" just so I don't feel 
                        lonesome. 

                                 MAX
                        Is that what you tell your shrink?

                                 JESSICA
                        You know you really are an asshole.

           Jessica grabs her purse and stands. She walks around to the 
           Asian Girl and whispers in her ear. After a beat, she walks 
           by Max, never making eye contact.

           Max looks at the Asian Girl who now wears a caring smile. 

                                 ASIAN GIRL
                        Come sit next to me.

           Max is confused. He moves over to her couch.

                                 ASIAN GIRL (CONT’D)
                        How long have you had ass cancer?

           Max goes wide-eyed. Sabotage! 

                                 MAX
                        ...Too long.

           EXT. CAFE GITANE, NOLITA - DAY

           Sophie and Jessica sit drinking iced beverages.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What did you expect was gonna 
                        happen?
                                 JESSICA
                        I don't know.  My therapist said I 
                        needed to take action. I thought he 
                        may have been a sign or something.

                                 SOPHIE
                        A sign of what.

                                 JESSICA
                        Desperation I guess. I don't know, 
                        between you and all my other 
                        friends I feel like I'm in this 
                        giant game of musical chairs and 
                        the music's just stopped and 
                        suddenly everyone's sitting down 
                        except for me. I miss Oliver. And 
                        then I get pissed off at myself 
                        because I'm a really fucking strong 
                        woman, and I don't wanna need 
                        anybody else. I wanna be fine 
                        alone.

           Jessica's eyes well.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I'm a strong woman too, Jess. But 
                        at the end of the day it's really 
                        nice to cuddle up with someone 
                        you're in love with and watch the 
                        worst reality show you can find on 
                        TV.

           They smile. 

                                 JESSICA
                        You know it's funny, but... out of 
                        everything, that's really what I 
                        miss the most: being held. I felt 
                        so safe when he held me. Like he 
                        could protect me from anything. I 
                        don't even know what I needed to be 
                        protected from, but I loved that 
                        feeling. I miss that.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Of course. It doesn't make you weak 
                        to want that... to need that.

           Jessica nods and shakes off her emotion.

                                 JESSICA
                        Max did say something that I can't 
                        get out of my head, though. He said 
                        that men like Oliver won't settle 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JESSICA (CONT'D)
                        for anything less than the complete 
                        package, and that I'm not that.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Max's a moron.

                                 JESSICA
                        I know.  But do you think there's 
                        any truth to that? I mean, the 
                        stuff Oliver said about having to 
                        get his head straight before he 
                        could take our relationship to the 
                        next level?  Max says that's all 
                        bullshit.

                                 SOPHIE
                        It is bullshit. He wanted to fuck 
                        other girls, let's be honest. People 
                        analyze shit too much; if he wanted 
                        to be with you, he'd be with you. 
                        What else is there to say?

                                 JESSICA
                        So you think Max is right. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        I think Oliver's not the man you 
                        hoped he was, Jess. And that you 
                        deserve better.  Onward...

           EXT. WEST VILLAGE EQUINOX - LATER

           Jessica's in a SPIN class amidst 40 SWEATY BODIES. AN AWESOME 
           UPBEAT TRACK PLAYS as the SPIN INSTRUCTOR BARKS OUT ORDERS.

           Max weaves his way through bikes and stares to find a sweaty, 
           sexy Jessica.

                                 MAX
                        Hey there.

                                 JESSICA
                        What are you doing here?! How did 
                        you find me?

                                 MAX
                        I have a man on the inside. This is 
                        weird. What do they call this, 
                        Jazzer-bike?

                                 JESSICA
                        Leave!
                                 MAX
                        Douche-ercise? 
                             (beat)
                        Aeroba-gay?

           She's getting furious.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Okay, real quick. I know you meant 
                        to sabotage me last night with the 
                        whole "ass cancer" thing...

           Everyone around them hears and turns to stare at Max.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        But it totally backfired on you. 
                        Pun intended, cause I had sympathy 
                        poop-shoot sex with that girl all 
                        night long. I'm telling you, anal's 
                        the new doggie. Women are opening 
                        up their balloon knots with a 
                        newfound verve. Do you think it's 
                        the economy?

           An OVERWEIGHT MAN spinning next to them has had enough.

                                 OVERWEIGHT SPINNER
                        Will you please shut-up? You're 
                        ruining my work-out.

                                 MAX
                        I'm not ruining anything, buddy. 
                        You just keep pedaling; where 
                        you're headed's far away.
                             (back to Jessica)
                        Maybe we should try it again 
                        tonight, cause it's a winner. I 
                        mean that girl was so turned on by 
                        the fact that my ass was literally 
                        killing me, she woulda let me fuck 
                        her ear if I asked.

                                 OVERWEIGHT SPINNER
                        You're disgusting.

                                 MAX
                        You on that little bike is what's 
                        disgusting. 

                                 JESSICA
                        There's not gonna be a tonight.
                                 SPIN INSTRUCTOR
                             (over headset mic)
                        Sir, will you please leave the 
                        class if you're not gonna join us?

                                 MAX
                        Just a few more seconds there, Tae-
                        Bo; having a quick word with the 
                        Mrs.

           Jessica can't help but LAUGH. (It might be the first time 
           we've ever noticed her laugh.) The whole class now stares. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        What do you mean "no tonight"?

                                 JESSICA
                        Look... Let's just forget this 
                        whole thing, okay?  Let's walk away 
                        with some of our dignity intact.

                                 MAX
                        Just give me one last shot, okay. 
                        I've been being selfish. I owe you 
                        much better wingmanning skills. 
                        Tonight you pick the place and it's 
                        all about you. I guarantee results.

           The Instructor grabs Max's arm and starts to escort him out.

                                 SPIN INSTRUCTOR
                             (over headset mic)
                        This class is for Spinners only.

           As they head towards the door.

                                 MAX
                        Wow, you are firm. What's your 
                        secret? Is it yelling? Or is it 
                        just the short shorts? What do you 
                        love more, the musical "Rent" or 
                        cock?

           He puts Max outside the glass door. Max searches for eye 
           contact with Jessica through a SEA OF SWEATY BODIES.

           After a beat, she turns to Max revealing a slightly softened 
           smile. He smiles back. He picks up his t-shirt to flash his 
           nipples. She SMILES and shakes her head.

           INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL BAR, 5757 - NIGHT

           Jessica and Max sit at this ultimate high brow bar.
                                 JESSICA
                        Sophie and I used to come here 
                        before I met Oliver.  This place is 
                        classy.

                                 MAX
                        So you like money? 

                                 JESSICA
                        No. I like men who have their shit 
                        together, who aren't out shopping 
                        for one night stands.

                                 MAX
                        You realize of course that this is 
                        the most famous place in the city 
                        to meet call-girls right?

                                 JESSICA
                        What?

           Suddenly Avi approaches with KANSAS, a sexy prostitute.

                                 AVI
                        Shalom, Max.

                                 MAX
                        Hey, Avi.

                                 AVI
                        This is Kansas.

                                 KANSAS
                        Hi.

                                 MAX
                        Hi.

                                 AVI
                             (checking out Jessica)
                        I see you like escorts too, huh? 
                        Not too shabby.

                                 MAX
                        Oh, no. This is Jessica; she's not 
                        an escort.

                                 AVI
                        It's alright, buddy. Don't be 
                        embarrassed. You picked a good one.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm not a hooker.
                                 AVI
                        Are you sure?

                                 JESSICA
                        I think I'd know if I was a hooker.

                                 KANSAS
                        We prefer escort.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm not an escort.

                                 KANSAS
                        Is there something wrong with being 
                        an escort?

                                 JESSICA
                        No.

                                 KANSAS
                        You should give it some thought; 
                        it's like turning your pussy into 
                        an ATM machine.

           Both Jessica and Max's eyes go wide on that one.

                                 AVI
                        Okay. Well nice to meet you, I 
                        spent all my money on her, so I 
                        can't afford the drinks in this 
                        place. We're gonna go fuck. 

                                 MAX
                        Alright, you kids have fun. 

                                 KANSAS
                        Nice meeting you.

           They leave. Jessica looks like she's gonna gag.

                                 JESSICA
                        I think that's the grossest 
                        encounter I've ever had.

                                 MAX
                        Try living with him. I wanna seal 
                        his room up with those plastic 
                        walls they put around E.T. when he 
                        got sick.
                             (beat)
                        But don't worry about it. Let me 
                        explore the space; there'll be 
                        something good here for you.
                                 JESSICA
                        Red tie there's kinda cute.

           Max sees a HANDSOME GUY at the end of the bar with a wireless 
           cellphone earpiece in his ear.

                                 MAX
                        The cyborg? No way. Trust me, any 
                        guy who leaves his wireless 
                        earpiece in while he's not on the 
                        phone, is a douche. Those things 
                        are like tool detectors. Ooh, and 
                        the blackberry clipped to the belt; 
                        you hate to see it. Plus he's a 
                        boozer.  

                                 JESSICA
                        How do you know?

                                 MAX
                        He's downing straight gin on a week 
                        night and he's still got a stamp on 
                        his wrist from last night's club.

           They watch as he stumbles toward the bathroom. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Yikes...  What about the wall-
                        flower over there?

           A guy in chic glasses sips a bottle of water in the corner.

                        What got you?  The pretentious 
                        glasses, the leather wristband, or 
                        the 'I Don't Need Booze To Have A

           Jessica has no answer.

                        First of all, never trust a 
                        straight guy who wears bracelets; 
                        that's just a fact. Something about 
                        him tells me he'd end up blogging 
                        about how you maintain your bush.

                                 JESSICA
                        Uch.  

                                 MAX
                        By the way, how do you maintain 
                        your bush? I should probably know.
                                 JESSICA
                        What? No!

                                 MAX
                        No bush? Mr. Clean?

                                 JESSICA
                        No! Just, "no", I'm not telling 
                        you.

                                 MAX
                        That you have a hairy bush? Are you 
                        celebrating the seventies? Kind of 
                        a Gabe Kaplan thing going on?

                                 JESSICA
                        New topic. How about... him?

           Jess points to a perfectly normal-looking guy.  Max squints.

                                 MAX
                        No way.  Total pervert.  Likes to 
                        beat-off while teenage boys watch.

                                 JESSICA
                        Gross... You're making all this up.

                                 MAX
                        No, that's Coach Purcell. He was my 
                        lacrosse coach in high school. It 
                        was nasty, but at least I learned  
                        how to pull on it backhanded. 

                                 JESSICA
                        This is pointless.

                        Hold on, I'm helping you. Allow me 
                        to browse.

           Max excuses himself and approaches the bar, pacing the length 
           of it.  He sniffs cologne, eavesdrops on conversations, 
           observes beverage preferences, etc.  He returns to Jessica.

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        Six o'clock.  That's your man.

           Skeptical, Jessica peeks over Max's shoulder.

                        Some kind of broker, but he's got a 
                        Mount Snow tag on his jacket so 
                        last season he couldn't afford 
                        Aspen. The market's humbled him a

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        little; not super cocky. He's 
                        drinking a bottled beer in a 
                        martini bar, so he's not afraid to 
                        swim against the tide. And no 
                        cologne, which is a giant plus.

                                 JESSICA
                        Why?

                                 MAX
                        Cologne and perfume mask your 
                        body's natural smell. You know how 
                        when you're really into someone you 
                        just love their smell; even their 
                        body odor?

                                 JESSICA
                        Yes.

                                 MAX
                        Yeah, cause you're no less an 
                        animal than a dog sniffing dog ass 
                        at the dog park. Your brain is 
                        subconsciously trying to lead you 
                        via your nose to your perfect mate.
                        That's hard to find if it's 
                        drenched in Drakkar Noir. 

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm impressed. You might be decent 
                        at this after all. So now what?

                                 MAX
                        Go over, order a Bud bottle - no 
                        glass - and smile like there's 
                        nothing you'd rather be doing.

                                 JESSICA
                        And then what?

                                 MAX
                        And then you wait. Any guy worth 
                        your time who receives a woman's 
                        smile will initiate contact within 
                        60 seconds or be kicking himself 
                        all night.
                             (beat)
                        Trust me.

           Jessica slinks her way down the bar. Max's guy, SEAN, glances 
           over as Jessica flags down the bartender with a smile.

                                 JESSICA
                        Bud, bottle.  No glass.  Thanks.
           Jessica catches Sean looking and gives him a polite smile.

                                 SEAN
                        King of Beers, huh?

                                 JESSICA
                        Uh, yeah. Old Reliable. I love it. 

                                 SEAN
                        I assume you're from out of town.

                                 JESSICA
                        Nope. I live in the West Village.

                                 SEAN
                        Yeah?  Me too.

                                 JESSICA
                        Just moved there, actually.

                                 SEAN
                        Well, you're a welcome addition to 
                        the neighborhood.  I'm Sean.

                                 JESSICA
                        Jessica.

                                 SEAN
                        What do you do?

                                 JESSICA
                        I work for Anther Pharmaceuticals 
                        in midtown.

                                 SEAN
                        Would I know any of their drugs?

                                 JESSICA
                        That depends, are you depressed?

                                 SEAN
                        Not anymore.

           They both smile. Max approaches, acting pissed off.

                                 MAX
                        Honey? Where have you been? I've 
                        been looking all over for you!

                                 JESSICA
                        Uhhh...

                        Don't uhhh me. I've seriously had 
                        enough of this. I'll be outside!

           Jessica has no idea what he's doing. Max storms out, leaving 
           Sean and Jessica in shock.

           EXT. FOUR SEASONS - A LITTLE LATER

           Max stuffs a hotdog into his mouth as Jessica appears.

                                 JESSICA
                        What the hell was that?!

                                 MAX
                        Did he give you his number?

                             (showing his card)
                        Yes, but we barely got to talk 
                        before you made a scene.

                                 MAX
                        That's all you needed. A little 
                        flirtation and then I came in as 
                        the dicky boyfriend. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Why do I have a dicky boyfriend?!

                                 MAX
                        All guys want what they can't have. 
                        You just became about 75% hotter to 
                        him because you're taken. And since 
                        your boyfriend's clearly a dick, he 
                        sees that there might be an 
                        opening.

                                 JESSICA
                        Really?

                                 MAX
                        Yes. Now give me his card.

           She hands it over. He reads it.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Broker. Man, I'm good.

           He rips the card to shreds.

                                 JESSICA
                        What are you doing?!
                                 MAX
                        You wouldn't be able to resist at 
                        least texting something cutesy 
                        before you went to bed tonight. 
                        Well that little "xoxo" would cost 
                        us about 20% of his desire to bang 
                        you. We can't afford that at this 
                        early stage. Let him call you.

                        He knows your name and where you 
                        work, right?  

                                 JESSICA
                        Yes.

                        He'll find you.

                                 JESSICA
                        But what if he can't?

                                 MAX
                        Do ya really want someone inside of 
                        you that doesn't know how to Google? 

           Max dashes across the street, hailing a cab.

                        You'll hear from our boy by end of 
                        day tomorrow!  Guaranteed!

           CLOSE ON Jessica, a reluctant smile.

           Jessica at her desk. She glances at her clock:  INSERT CLOCK: 
           6:00 PM.  She exhales, disappointed, muttering.

           Max sits at a table with his a copy of The Village Voice open 
           to a FULL PAGE COLOR AD of a GORGEOUS STRIPPER. CLARENCE, a

                        he has to say about this.

           In walks Gerald, feeding his INFANT a bottle. He shakes his 
           head, rattled from Daddy duty.

                                 GERALD
                        Ass and mouth, fellas. Only cum in

                        synagogue tonight. I gotta keep 
                        Yitzak alive till she gets home or 
                        I'd be right there with you.

           Max dials on his Phone.
                                 CLARENCE
                        Gerald, may I speak to you about 
                        something?

                                 GERALD
                        Can my baby take a dump in your 
                        salad?

                                 CLARENCE
                        No.

                                 GERALD
                        Then no.

           INT. JESSICA'S OFFICE - INTERCUT

           Jessica answers her phone.

                                 JESSICA
                        What?

                                 MAX
                        Did he call?

                                 JESSICA
                        No.

                                 MAX
                        Are you sure?

                                 JESSICA
                        I know what a phone call is, dipshit. 
                        I can now confidently sever our 
                        relationship.

           KNOCK, KNOCK. A RECEPTIONIST walks in with a huge bouquet of 
           flowers.  She sets them on Jessica's desk and walks out.  Max 
           BABBLES on in the background. She quickly opens the card.

           INSERT CARD: "Sorry you had to leave.  You deserve better.  
           Sean (917) 555-4532"  CLOSE ON Jessica.

                                 MAX (O.S.)
                        Then I guess you're not helping me 
                        tonight.  That sucks, I kinda 
                        figured it was my turn.  

                                 JESSICA
                        What time?

           INT. SCORES GENTLEMAN'S CLUB - NIGHT

           LOUD MUSIC BLARES at the infamous strip club. Jessica and Max 
           watch a SEXY STRIPPER DANCE. 
                                 JESSICA
                        You're such an idiot. Why would you 
                        choose the one place in the world 
                        where you don't need my help? 

                                 MAX 
                        Oh, but I do. We're here to see 
                        Wynter Storm. The hottest stripper 
                        in the universe. Well, at least on 
                        Earth, for all I know there's way 
                        hotter strippers on other planets. 
                        Alien strippers. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Continue.

                                 MAX
                        She's not even gonna dance tonight. 
                        She's here to promote the release 
                        of her new Pocket Pussy.

           He gestures to their right to REVEAL: At the end of a long 
           line of men, WYNTER STORM sits behind a table signing LATEX 
           MODELS OF HER VAGINA. Wynter is all natural and beautiful.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        She's gonna be signing those things 
                        for hours.

                                 JESSICA
                        So why are we here?

                                 MAX
                        I wanted you to help me get a lap 
                        dance from her.

                                 JESSICA
                        She's a stripper. She strips. Ask 
                        her to strip.

                                 MAX
                        Wynter Storm doesn't just give 
                        private dances to anyone. Who do 
                        you think I am, Tommy Lee? 

                                 JESSICA
                        You've got to be kidding me. This 
                        is really what you want? 

                                 MAX
                        Yup. Got any ideas?
                                 JESSICA
                        You're really wasting your 
                        resources on something far too 
                        easy. I'll be right back.

           Jessica heads down the long line of horny dudes until she 
           gets to Wynter. She whispers in Wynter's ear; she smiles and 
           then whispers back into Jessica's ear. Jessica returns.

                                 MAX
                        Well?

                                 JESSICA
                        Strippers love to dance for women. 
                        Why? Cause women don't spend the 
                        whole song trying to maneuver their 
                        dirty hands inside of them. Plus, 
                        most of them are at least bi. I 
                        told her it was for me.

                                 MAX
                        And?

                                 JESSICA
                        She said the dance is free if she 
                        can fuck me.

           Max's jaw drops in amazement.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        So I told her it was really a 
                        birthday present for my fiance.

                                 MAX
                        And?

                                 JESSICA
                        She said 500 bucks. 

                                 MAX
                        Done.

                                 JESSICA
                        But as soon as we get in there you 
                        have to steer her onto you. I don't 
                        want her anywhere near me!

                                 MAX
                        Okay.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm gonna have to get drunk.
                                 MAX
                        Fine.

                                                       HARD CUT TO:

           INT. SCORES GENTLEMAN'S CLUB, VIP ROOM - LATER

           Wynter dances in the VIP room for a drunk, smiling Jessica. 
           Neither of them could care less about Max who sits watching 
           with a GIANT DRUNKEN SMILE ON HIS FACE. 

                                 JESSICA
                             (drunk)
                        You smell like candy.
                             (smelling her)
                        Your earlobes are like baby 
                        Skittles.

           INT. DINER - LATE NIGHT

           Max and Jessica sit across from each other eating greasy food 
           holding "Wynter Storm Pocket Pussy's". They are drunk.

                                 MAX
                        I can't believe she threw these in 
                        for free. Can I have yours? I'm 
                        gonna have a lonely man's orgy.

                                 JESSICA
                        Hell, no. This thing's mine.

                                 MAX
                        What are you gonna do with it?

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm gonna use it as an oven mitt.

           They die LAUGHING.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Or a hand-puppet.
                             (she makes it talk in a 
                              deep voice)
                        Hello. I am Wynter's vagina.

                                 MAX
                        Why does Wynter's vagina sound like 
                        James Earl Jones?

                                 JESSICA
                             (still as vagina)
                        Luke. I am you father.

           They can't stop LAUGHING.
           EXT. SHEEP'S MEADOW - SATURDAY

           The meadow's packed with people lying out. Max and Nathan sit 
           drinking canned beers covered in paper bags.

                                 NATHAN
                        Sounds like you two are actually 
                        getting along.

                                 MAX
                        Well, she can be super uptight and 
                        condescending. But I have to admit, 
                        she's pretty funny.

                                 NATHAN
                        I don't understand why you don't 
                        just date her.

                                 MAX
                        Are you kidding me? This is the 
                        perfect arrangement; I would never 
                        jeopardize what I've got going on 
                        here. It's too good to be true. 

                                 NATHAN
                        Maybe it's time for you to give one 
                        of these girls a chance. Try to get 
                        to know one of them and see if 
                        something flourishes.

                                 MAX
                        Flourishes? How wide is your 
                        rectum? Seriously. Be honest.  A 
                        few months ago you were doing the 
                        exact same thing. 

                                 NATHAN
                        I don't know...  I don't feel like 
                        I'm missing out on anything when 
                        I'm with Sophie. Maybe that's how 
                        you know you're in love; when 
                        there's no place you'd rather be.

                                 MAX
                        Well you know what my father says?  
                        "Never marry. Just find a woman you 
                        don't like and buy her a house".

                                 NATHAN
                        That's because he pays alimony to 
                        three different women.
                                 MAX
                        I just can't imagine there being 
                        one girl I wanna spend the rest of 
                        my life with right now. But I hope 
                        one day I find her. 

           WE CRANE UP TO REVEAL THEM SITTING AMIDST A THOUSAND PEOPLE 
           LYING AROUND THE MEADOW.

           INT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM - NEXT MORNING

           WE CRANE DOWN TO FIND: Jessica sitting on a bench on the main 
           floor tapping her foot. Max arrives; flustered.

                                 JESSICA
                        Where the hell have you been? 
                        You're a half-hour late.

                                 MAX
                        I've been up and down this ramp 
                        like fifty times looking for you. I 
                        don't have cell service here. I'm 
                        light-headed. I may vomit.

                                 JESSICA
                        Perfect.

                                 MAX
                        Where's our target?

                                 JESSICA
                        She's not a target. She's a woman.

           He points. Max looks over to see a HEAVYSET WOMAN wearing a 
           Tazmanian Devil T-shirt and a fanny pack that articulates the 
           bulge of fat between her belly and groin. 

                                 MAX
                        The tourist with the Vagomach?   
                        (Vuh-juh-mick.)

                                 JESSICA
                        What the hell's a "Vagomach"?

                                 MAX
                        That weird fat roll some women have 
                        between their vaginas and their 
                        stomachs.

                                 JESSICA
                        You're disgusting. Not her, her.

           She points again to INGRID, 33, a pretty woman in 
           tortoiseshell glasses examining a large painting.
                                 MAX
                        Not bad. She looks smart. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Her name's Ingrid. Single, age 
                        appropriate, socially active... She 
                        teaches figure drawing at Barnard.

                        Do you think I could pose naked for 
                        her class like "Rerun" did in that 
                        episode of "What's Happening"?

                                 JESSICA
                        First of all, it was "Rog", not 
                        "Rerun". And I doubt she's gonna 
                        get a "What's Happening" reference. 
                        Let's start by seeing if you click. 
                        Come on. And when you have a 
                        thought, run it through your mind 
                        twice before you say it to make 
                        sure it's not stupid or offensive.

           INT. GUGGENHEIM - LATER

           Jessica, Ingrid and Max stand in front of a GIANT JACKSON 
           POLLACK PAINTING.

                                 JESSICA
                        Wow, this is beautiful.

                                 MAX
                        Are you sure this is art? They 
                        might just be repainting this wall. 

                                 INGRID
                        Of course it's art. It's Jackson 
                        Pollack.

                        It is done.

           Jessica eyes Max.

                                 MAX
                        I know. It's so... beautiful in 
                        its... chaos.
                                 INGRID
                        Isn't it? You're right, it's like  
                        organized chaos.

                             (really taking it in)
                        When you think about it, it's 
                        pretty hard for one person to 
                        generate chaos. Maybe that's why 
                        people like this; he found a way to 
                        articulate chaos on a canvas. 

                                 INGRID
                        I like that.

                                 MAX
                        Okay. I'll take it. How much is it?

           They all LAUGH.

           front of a series of famous works of art. MAX TAKING IN FINE

           INT. BLUE STAR INSURANCE, MAX'S CUBICLE - MONDAY MORNING

           Max, iPod BLARING AN AWESOME SONG, sits at his computer, 
           focused in a way we haven't seen before. INSERT:  MAX'S 
           SCREEN, where he is manipulating some of his PHOTOGRAPHY. 
           Portraits of New York City characters. Gerald arrives.

                                 GERALD
                        All right. Let me live vicariously 
                        through you. Tell me about all the 
                        banging you did this weekend.

                                 MAX
                        Sorry, nothing to report.

                                 ELI
                        What happened, you got Scabies and 
                        had to use that smelly lotion?

           Max stares at him a beat.

                                 MAX
                        No.  But it was actually a pretty 
                        good weekend.  I went to this 
                        museum and got kinda inspired about 
                        my photography. I think I might not 
                        be as mediocre as I thought I was. 
                        I know you're not a big fan of my 
                        accident photos, but this is what I 
                        really do.
           Max turns the monitor so Gerald can see. A series of STUNNING 
           FACES. Then a REALLY COOL SHOT OF GERALD pretending to throw 
           his BABY like a football.

                                 GERALD
                        Hey! That's me and Yitzak! That 
                        picture's hot. I look like I can 
                        actually throw.

                                 MAX
                        If you really like it I'll print 
                        one up for you.

                                 GERALD
                        Oh, hell yes. That bitch right 
                        there is gonna hang above my 
                        decline bench!

           Bright, beautiful afternoon, hundreds of fashionable

                        I know, but Jewish guys are a 
                        catch. Look at Nathan. You're not 
                        getting too many hits, though. 
                        Maybe I shouldn't have said you 
                        were Orthodox. Here's one...

                        shabbat. 

           Max arrives with a retro looking camera around his neck.

                        reservation at The Waverly Inn. My 
                        friend's a concierge at the Mercer 
                        and got us in. We'll have an after-
                        dinner drink on the roof of 60 
                        Thompson. Then we have the option 
                        to walk to The Rockwood for the ten-
                        thirty set, or...

                        You shouldn't leave room for 
                        spontaneity; the whole thing should 
                        feel spontaneous. Just let him pick 
                        everything tonight.  You act like 
                        you're happy doing whatever. Don't 
                        be a snob if he doesn't pick the 
                        latest hotspot out of Zagats. And I 
                        don't care if you find the oiliest 
                        pube ever grown in your Cobb salad, 
                        do not send your dinner back.

           Sophie spits out the salad she's eating, disgusted. Max 
           raises his camera and SHOOTS JESSICA'S FACE.

                        camera back.

                        slightly funnier since she's been 
                        hanging out with me?

                        her laughing.

                        She reads The New Yorker, not 
                        Maxim. You're taking her to 
                        L'Esquina.

                        Whoa, whoa. I asked her "out".  
                        Couple drinks, maybe split a Mr 
                        Softee. Who said anything about 
                        dinner?

                        After 30, "out" means dinner.  
                        She's not a model; she needs to 
                        eat.
           Jessica pulls a folder out of her bag, handing it to Max.

                        piece articles from this week's 
                        Times and The Atlantic Monthly. 

           Max tosses the folder behind him.

                        And at the end of the night, walk 
                        her to her door and if the vibe is 
                        there, lean in for a chaste kiss on 
                        the lips. That's plenty for a first 
                        date.

           INT. JESSICA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jessica GETS THROWN DOWN ONTO HER BED IN THE THROWS OF 
           PASSION with Sean. They are all over each other; drunk. She 
           pulls off her shirt, he's pulls off his.

                                 JESSICA
                        I really wanna fuck you.

                                 SEAN
                        Jess, there's something I have to 
                        tell you...

                                 JESSICA
                        I don't have condoms, it's been a 
                        really long time.

           She leans in to kiss his flawless chest.

                                 SEAN
                        No, I have a condom. It's just 
                        that... 

                                 JESSICA
                        Just say it so you can come back to 
                        kissing me.

                                 SEAN
                        I have a really small penis.
           Jessica stops. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Excuse me?

                                 SEAN
                        Like really small. I just don't 
                        want you to be shocked when you see 
                        it.

           He pulls down his underwear to show her. Jessica squints to 
           try and see it. All WE SEE is pubic hair.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Hold on, let me just part my bush.
                             (he does)
                        There he is. Don't worry, I know 
                        how to use it...

           He starts to play with it.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, you like that, don't you? You 
                        like this tiny dick. 

           Jessica is in shock; jaw dropped.

                                 JESSICA
                        You know Sean, I think we're moving 
                        a little too fast. We got a little 
                        drunk... We should probably call it 
                        a night.

                                 SEAN
                        Yeah. Don't worry, I know the 
                        drill. Will you at least touch it?

           She reluctantly reaches out with one finger with a grimace on 
           her face.

                                 JESSICA
                        It's very nice.

                                 SEAN
                        His name is Nemo.

           He starts to CRY.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        No one's ever gonna love me.

           OFF Jessica'S SHOCKED FACE...
           INT. COOL RESTAURANT - DAY

           Jessica and Max weave through a crowded brunch spot. 

                                 MAX
                        So you actually touched it?

                                 JESSICA
                        What was I suppose to do? It had a 
                        name! It looked like a hamster's 
                        tail. Then I had to rock him to 
                        sleep with his pubes all parted 
                        like the Dead Sea. 

           Max can't hold back his LAUGH.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, laugh it up. What about you?  
                        Did you mention the Maureen Dowd Op-
                        Ed and pay for dinner?

                                 MAX
                        Yep.

                                 JESSICA
                        You didn't ogle other women?

                                 MAX
                        Nope.

                                 JESSICA
                        So do you think she liked you?

                                 MAX
                        Let's just say anybody who gives 
                        that good of a blowjob has had lots 
                        of practice.

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh My God, really?  You didn't?

                                 MAX
                        Oh, we did. You thirty-somethings 
                        don't waste any time. 

           Just as they arrive at the table to find Nathan and Sophie.

                                 JESSICA
                        You're disgusting. 
                             (to Sophie and Nathan)
                        Hi.

                                 MAX
                        Why are you mad that she blew me?
                                 JESSICA
                        I'm not mad that she blew you.
                             (to waitress)
                        Can I have a bloody-mary please?

                                 MAX
                        And please put a big ass celery 
                        stalk in there or she's gonna go 
                        batshit and ask for the manager.

           Sophie and Nathan stare at them.

                                 SOPHIE
                        You realize you two are dating, 
                        right?

                                 JESSICA
                        What are you talking about?

                                 SOPHIE
                        You're bickering like a couple. 
                        We're currently on a double date.

                            MAX
           What, no. It's not like that. 
                                                         JESSICA
                                              Absolutely not. He repulses 
                                              me.

                                 NATHAN
                        You two are both so bad at dating 
                        that you don't even realize you're 
                        dating each other.

                                 MAX
                        We don't have sex. That's dating...

                                 JESSICA
                        It's irrelevant; I'm done with the 
                        whole thing.

                                 MAX
                        Oh c'mon...  You had one close 
                        encounter with a hamster tail and 
                        you wanna pull the ripcord? 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Wait, what?!

                          JESSICA
           Thanks to Cyrano over here, I 
           had one of the worst dates of 
           my life.
                                                           MAX
                                              Who care's about the actual 
                                              date? The point is, you were 
                                              back out there dating.
                                 JESSICA
                        Look, this thing seems to be 
                        working out great for you; it's 
                        perfect for one night stands. But 
                        it's clearly not intended for what 
                        I'm looking for. Let's just forget 
                        about it and have a cordial Last 
                        Supper.

                                 MAX
                        I'm gonna find you your dream guy. 
                        You just have to be patient.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I don't see how it's hurting. You 
                        don't have anything else going on.

                                 JESSICA
                        What about that Orthodox guy?

                                 SOPHIE
                        I had to tell him you weren't 
                        really religious. Your bikini shots 
                        were making him suspicious.

                                 JESSICA
                        Great.

                                 MAX
                        Seriously.  Past is prologue. It's 
                        time to go balls out Swingling.

                                 JESSICA
                        What are you talking about?

                                 MAX
                        Swingling. I made it up to describe 
                        what you and I are doing; this 
                        wonderful combination of 
                        wingmanning and being sexy, 
                        swinging singles.

                                 NATHAN
                        Swingling...  I like it. Very 70's.

                                 JESSICA
                        It makes it sound like a key party.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Well?

           A beat as they all wait for her answer.
                                 JESSICA
                        Fine.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Okay. Now that that's settled. 
                        Wanna see the pics from our latest 
                        ultrasound?

                            MAX
                                                         JESSICA
           Not at all.
                                              Later; I need my drink.

           OFF NATHAN and SOPHIE'S REACTION.

           MONTAGE: This sequence will SPEED RAMP through Max and 
           Jessica on many different dates. Where indicated, it will 
           SLOW DOWN for their dialogue and then SPEED UP again. 

           SPEEDING THROUGH MANY DIFFERENT DATES: doors opening to greet 
           people, getting drinks, awkward kisses, Max hooking up, 
           bowling, the movies, doors closing, doors opening.

           JESSICA DATE: Jessica on a date with a very handsome guy. 
           She's wearing a Yankee baseball hat.

                                 YANKEE GUY
                        I can't believe you're a fanatic 
                        like me. Who's your favorite 
                        player?

           She opens her palm to find smeared names she can no longer 
           read. She tries anyway.

                                 JESSICA
                        I like... Jeerz...ka...butz.

           The guy stares at her.

           SPEED RAMP THROUGH DATES, then:

           MAX DATE: Max sits across from a JAPPY GIRL.

                                 JAPPY GIRL
                        My jewelry line's called "Bulimi".      
                        This is one of my pieces.

           She pulls the chain on a PENDANT OF A GIRL WITH AN OPEN MOUTH 
           and pearls come pouring out of its mouth onto the table.

                                 JAPPY GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Shit. Can you grab the ones on the 
                        floor.

           THE PENDANT keeps throwing up pearls. They're going 
           everywhere.
                                 JAPPY GIRL (CONT’D)
                        I think it's broken.

           SPEED RAMP THROUGH DATES, then.

           At the Chelsea Piers driving range, Max chips a ball towards 
           a group of CUTE GOLF GUYS, who take cover. He quickly hands 
           the club to Jessica and hides. BEN, strides over, and 
           introduces himself to Jessica, and offers her some tips.

           Max and Jessica hanging out with each other and laughing; 
           sharing war stories. Scoping-out the opposite sex.

           At the Public Library, Jessica watches from afar as Max sits 
           across from a pretty girl who's studying. He appears to be 
           reading Ulysses. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to REVEAL he's playing 
           his handheld Playstation.

           JESSICA DATE: Jessica at dinner with a GUY who has a Valkor 
           from "Neverending Story" tattoo on his chest.

                                 JESSICA
                        Why do you have a tattoo of a dog-
                        bird?

                                 TATOO GUY
                        It's not a dog-bird? Its Valkor 
                        from Never-Ending Story.

                                 JESSICA
                        Can we get the check please?

                                 WAITRESS
                        But you haven't ordered anything.

                                 JESSICA
                        That's fine. He has a dog-bird on 
                        his chest.

           SPEED RAMP Faster and Faster until: WE HARD CUT TO BLACK

           INT. JESSICA'S CONDO BUILDING HALLWAY - MORNING

           In shorts carrying a CAMPING MAT, Max presses the doorbell 
           non-stop. A hung-over Jessica opens the door. She wears a 
           slinky t-shirt and underwear. She looks super sexy.

                                 JESSICA
                        Please stop ringing the doorbell.

                                 MAX
                        We're gonna be late.
                                 JESSICA
                        What is that?

                                 MAX
                        It's my mat for yoga.

                                 JESSICA
                        That's a camping mat, for the 
                        woods.

                                 MAX
                        I know. But today, it's my yoga 
                        mat. What's the difference?

           She starts LAUGHING.

                                 JESSICA
                        Come in; I'm way too hung-over for 
                        yoga.

           They cross to the couch and sit.

                                 MAX
                        I guess you had a good date with 
                        that golfer dude, huh?

                                 JESSICA
                        He was sweet; we kissed a little. 
                        But, I don't know... it wasn't 
                        anything too memorable.

                        But you still got wasted?

                                 JESSICA
                        Yeah, but not with him. He dropped 
                        me off at ten. I drank wine all 
                        night by myself and wrote a song on 
                        the piano.

                        I didn't know you played the piano.

                        I don't really. I mean I do, but I 
                        don't. I took lessons my whole life 
                        and in college I used to write 
                        songs all the time; I just haven't 
                        been inspired to do it in so long. 
                        But last night... there I was with 
                        this perfectly nice guy, who was 
                        sweet and handsome and charming... 
                        and I felt absolutely nothing for 
                        him. All I could see was all the

                        things he was pretending to be, but 
                        wasn't. There we were, like two of 
                        your mannequins; desperately trying 
                        to convince each other we were 
                        real, when all we really were was 
                        hollow. 
                             (beat)
                        So I opened up a bottle of wine, 
                        and all of a sudden there was this 
                        song. I just sat down at the piano 
                        and started playing it; like I'd 
                        written it years ago or something.

                                 MAX
                        Will you play it for me?

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh, no, no, no. I haven't played 
                        for anybody in a long time.

                        But there's nothing more sexy than 
                        talent. This is a part of yourself 
                        you shouldn't keep secret; guys 
                        would love this.

                                 JESSICA
                        Yeah... about that Max... I don't 
                        think I wanna keep trying to shape 
                        myself to be the ideal catch for 
                        some dude. Do you remember the 
                        first night we talked you told me 
                        that story about the 3D images 
                        jumping out of the picture?

                        Well last night I realized why this 
                        whole swingling thing has been 
                        bothering me so much. It's because 
                        it's impossible for me to do it and 
                        also be myself. Because it's not 
                        me. And since I have to make a 
                        choice, I'm gonna choose me. It's 
                        okay I think... It's okay to wait 
                        until someone sees my dolphin 
                        jumping out at them. I can wait.

                        But I thought we were gonna hang 
                        out today. You said that if I tried 
                        yoga and didn't giggle during the

           As she walks off, Max can't help but look at her AMAZING ASS 
           in sexy underwear. She turns around; catching him.

           INT. SOHO DEAN & DELUCA - - LATER

           Max and Jessica LAUGH about something as they pour sugar into 
           their lattes at the end of the coffee bar.

           A pretty, 30 year old, EMILY, enters frame.  Max is shocked.

                        No.  None of those things.  Just 
                        having fun, living in Tribeca.

                        using the word "great"? I must have 
                        said "great" 400 times.

                        you used to spend every waking 
                        second with? I felt more of a 
                        connection with the barista.

                        from now on, and in a little while 
                        we'll only have to wave.

                        really drunk while I was away and 
                        slept with my best friend. Before

                        guy friend I'd ever had. I remember

                        hair. I was like, 'you're

                        again and you know... eat.
                             (beat, a little smile)
                        So, no... you're right. I don't 
                        ever wanna feel like that again. I 
                        won't ever let that happen to me 
                        again.

                                 JESSICA
                        So you'll just keep sleeping with 
                        random girls and never get to know 
                        anyone again? You're never gonna 
                        trust anyone again?

                                 MAX
                        I don't know; I have this daydream 
                        that one day I'm gonna stumble into 
                        someone that'll make me feel the 
                        way I did when I was with her. 
                        There's this great line in the 
                        movie The Accidental Tourist where 
                        William Hurt says to Kathleen 
                        Turner, "I'm beginning to realize, 
                        it's not how much you love someone, 
                        what matters is who you are when 
                        you're with them." 
                             (beat)
                        Well I loved who I was when I was 
                        with Emily. And I'm just gonna wait 
                        until I feel that again.

                                 JESSICA
                        Okay, but in the meantime, why do 
                        you have to be so... This side of 
                        yourself, Max, is so much more 
                        appealing than the horny dude who 
                        likes to shock people with 
                        everything he says. I mean it's 
                        funny, but I'm starting to think 
                        it's not who you really are.

                                 MAX
                        Well what about you? You just 
                        revealed to me that you have this 
                        hidden passion for writing music. 
                        It's something that makes you so 
                        happy and you don't share it with 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        anyone. Did you ever even play for 
                        Oliver?

                                 JESSICA
                        No way. I mean I was terrified he'd 
                        hate it. I liked him so much; I 
                        guess at some point I started 
                        censoring parts of myself I thought 
                        he might reject. Plus we have very 
                        different taste in music. His 
                        favorite band is The Goo-Goo Dolls.

           Max smiles and shakes his head.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 MAX
                        It's just kinda funny after all 
                        this to see how similar we actually 
                        are. We're both cowering in our 
                        beds to keep from getting fucked 
                        over again; we just have very 
                        different ways of going about it.

                                 JESSICA
                        We're just cowering under different 
                        blankets...

                                 MAX
                        Yeah.

           They sit there; staring at each other like they're finally 
           meeting one another for the first time. 

                                 JESSICA
                             (breaking the intimacy)
                        Well, you gotta big date tonight 
                        with Library Girl. We should get 
                        your place ready.

                                 MAX
                             (reluctant to leave)
                        Yes.

           INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - LATER

           AWESOME MUSIC PLAYS as Max disassembles mannequins and hides 
           their body parts in the kitchen cabinets. Jessica smokes a 
           joint as she sifts through a pile of photos on a desk. 
                                 MAX
                        Well, it's gonna be tight, but I 
                        think I can get a lot of these 
                        fellas into the kitchen cabinets. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Who took these?

                                 MAX
                        I did.

           He comes over to her. She passes him the joint.

                                 JESSICA
                        These are amazing!

                                 MAX
                        Thanks. That's just my work stuff.

                                 JESSICA
                        These are all from car accidents?

                                 MAX
                        Yeah. From one person's tragedy 
                        comes another person's art. No one 
                        really likes these though.

                                 JESSICA
                        I do. These are beautiful. I've 
                        never seen anything like them. I 
                        love this one.

                                 MAX
                        Yeah, that was a bad wreck upstate.  
                        There's this windy road up there 
                        right near a strip of bars and 
                        drunk drivers keep driving their 
                        cars off the road into this lake. 
                        I'm up there a few times a year. 

                                 JESSICA
                        It's beautiful.

                                 MAX
                        Thank you. Here's some of my other 
                        stuff.

           He pulls a bunch of PHOTOS from a drawer. WE INTERCUT between 
           the PHOTOS and THEM. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Wow. I am... shocked. You are 
                        really talented. These should not 
                        be in a drawer.
                                 MAX
                        I'm not really sure what to do with 
                        them all.

                                 JESSICA
                        Well for starters we need to hang 
                        them on your walls. You're the one 
                        who just said there's nothing 
                        sexier than talent. Library Girl's 
                        gonna drop her pants.

           They LAUGH.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        But you should really have a show 
                        or something. People would buy 
                        these. I would.

                                 MAX
                        Oh you can't afford these. You'd 
                        have to deal a lot of drugs to 
                        afford these.

           They LAUGH again. SUDDENLY THE SONG CHANGES TO AN EVEN MORE 
           AMAZING SLOW, BUT VERY GROOVY ONE.

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh my God... I love this song.

           Now slightly high and buzzed, Jessica begins to SLOWLY DANCE 
           through the room; SINGING ALONG. DISASSEMBLED MANNEQUINS are 
           everywhere waiting to be hidden away. Max watches and then 
           joins her as they weave their way between them. THE CAMERA 
           RAMPS TO SLOW MOTION as they groove their way through the 
           most SURREAL of CROWDED DANCE FLOORS. Smiling. Happy.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. MAX'S LOFT - NIGHT

           In his transformed loft, Max and LIBRARY GIRL, (KATE) drink 
           wine and stand before an entire wall of Max's framed work. 

                                 KATE
                        I love this one. How did you get 
                        this crazy person to pose for all 
                        these?

                                 MAX
                        Oh, that's my boss. I don't really 
                        have to get him to do anything. 
                        That's who he is. 
                                 KATE
                        You clearly have a lot of talent. 
                        Who's influenced you? 

           Max isn't in the mood to swingle.

                                 MAX
                        I don't really know anything about 
                        famous photographers if that's what 
                        you mean. I just put on my ipod and 
                        walk around the city and music kind 
                        of inspires me to find moments. 

           Max checks the time on his phone.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Wow, it's late. Are you hungry? I 
                        know a great all-night Gay 
                        Vietnamese restaurant in Chelsea.

                                 KATE
                        Would you photograph me? 

                                 MAX
                        Sure.

                                 KATE
                        How would you want me?

                                 MAX
                        Well we'd come up with something.

                                 KATE
                        How about something like this?

           She takes off her top revealing perfect breasts.

                                 MAX
                             (acting cool)
                        That's one way. In fact a very good 
                        way. Just let me grab my camera.

           He spins around KNOCKING OVER A LAMP. Just as his PHONE 
           RINGS. INSERT CALLER ID: Jessica.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I'm sorry. I gotta take this.

                                 KATE
                        You've gotta be kidding me.

                                 MAX
                        It's my... psychic. This could be 
                        about my aura.
           He walks to the other side of the loft and answers the phone.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Hey.

           INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - INTERCUT

           Jessica lies in her bathtub.

                                 JESSICA
                        Hey, how'd it go?

                                 MAX
                        It's still going.

                                 JESSICA
                        She's still there? It's 2 in the 
                        morning.

                                 MAX
                        The pictures were a huge hit.

                             (bummed)
                        Oh... great. Well, I'll just call 
                        you tomorrow.

                                 MAX
                        No, what is it?

                                 JESSICA
                        Are you sure? I don't wanna bother 
                        you.

                                 MAX
                        You're not. We're playing Uno.
                             (yelling off)
                        Uno!

           A topless Kate stares at him.

                                 JESSICA
                        Okay... um. I'm a bridesmaid at 
                        this wedding next weekend for this 
                        couple I set up when I was with 
                        Oliver. They want me to give a 
                        speech and Oliver's gonna be there 
                        and it's this whole big thing and I 
                        was hoping I was gonna meet someone 
                        great that I could bring in time so 
                        I wouldn't look like a loser in 
                        front of Oliver, but I was just 
                        lying here in my bathtub and it

                        occurred to me that I could just 
                        bring a friend. I could ask you.

           Max is silent.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

                                 MAX
                        You just called me your friend.

                                 JESSICA
                        You are my friend, Max.

           Max smiles.

                                 MAX
                        Well then of course. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Great. Thank you. Well I should let 
                        you go.

           Max looks over as a topless Kate opens a kitchen cabinet and 
           MANNEQUIN BODY PARTS COME SPILLING OUT ALL OVER HER.

                                 KATE
                        What the fuck?!

                                 MAX
                        Uh... yes. I should go. Tootie's on 
                        the floor.

                                 JESSICA
                        Okay, one more thing, Max. It's 
                        black tie.

           CLOSE ON MAX.

           INT. TAVERN ON THE GREEN - NIGHT

           A FULL BIG-BAND PLAYS as Jessica and Max enter the decadent 
           ballroom dressed to the nines. Jessica is JAW-DROPPING. 

                                 MAX
                        Where is he?

                                 JESSICA
                        Who?

                                 MAX
                        Don't be coy; Oliver. The reason 
                        I'm wearing a man corset.
                                 JESSICA
                        He's over there with the blonde you 
                        love so much.

           They look over to see Oliver and the date he had at Balthazar 
           making small talk with another couple.

                                 MAX
                        You know, she's hot, but if someone 
                        told me she was a tranny I wouldn't 
                        be shocked. No one in this room 
                        looks anywhere near as great as you 
                        do tonight.

                                 JESSICA
                        Thank you, you don't have to say 
                        that.

                                 MAX
                        I mean it; as your friend. You've 
                        come a long way. You look amazing. 
                        Your confidence finally caught up 
                        with your beauty.

           She smiles. Are they flirting?

           INT. TAVERN ON THE GREEN - LATER

           JANE, a drunk Maid of Honor is giving a speech.

                                 JANE
                        I just love you guys so much! And 
                        Amy, I don't care that you're two-
                        faced and think you're better than 
                        everybody else. Even though most 
                        people hate you, you're still my 
                        best friend. 

           CUT TO AMY (the Bride's) expression as the party chuckles 
           uncomfortably. REVEAL Max with a giant smile on his face.

                                 JANE(CONT’D)
                        I love you like a sister, but 
                        you're not as hot as you think are. 
                        Everybody knows your tits are fake 
                        so you can just suck my balls. I 
                        don't have balls, but if I did, the 
                        first thing I would do would be to 
                        call you up and be like, "Hey Amy. 
                        I just got these balls in, and I 
                        need you to suck on them."
                                 MAX
                        This is the greatest speech I've 
                        ever heard.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm next. I'm really nervous.

                                 MAX
                        You're gonna be fine. You know what 
                        you're gonna say?

                                 JESSICA
                        I think so. Can you hand me your 
                        drink?

           He does. She downs it.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Can you hand me that guy's drink?

           Max grabs an OLD MAN'S drink. 

                                 OLD MAN
                        No, I'm thirsty.

                                 MAX
                        Oh, you'll be alright.

           She downs it.

                                 JANE
                        And make sure you get tested, cause 
                        you're not her first rodeo. Many a 
                        cowboy has ridden that horse.

           The BAND LEADER takes the mic away from Jane and escorts her 
           off stage to light APPLAUSE.

                                 BAND LEADER
                        Next, we're gonna have a few words 
                        from the young lady who set this 
                        beautiful couple up; Ms. Jessica 
                        Keeler.

           The CROWN APPLAUDS as Jessica makes her way to the mic.

                                 JESSICA
                             (into mic, nervous)
                        Hi. Umm... Look I've never been a 
                        very good public speaker. But I 
                        really love Kim and James together. 
                        It's always blown my mind that two 
                        people who are such a perfect match 
                        might have just passed by one 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JESSICA (CONT'D)
                        another on the street never knowing 
                        that they were meant to be 
                        together. So I feel so lucky to 
                        have been the one who brought these 
                        two passerbys together. 
                             (beat, she steels herself)
                        Most people don't know this about 
                        me, but I write music. 

           Max looks up.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        And I thought instead of rambling 
                        up here, I might be able to express 
                        what I feel a little better if I 
                        played you something I wrote.

           Reactions from the crowd. Max is smiling in shock. Oliver 
           can't believe what he's hearing. She sits down at the grand 
           piano and the Band Leader helps her adjust the mic.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Okay. I'm super nervous and I 
                        haven't done this in a long time, 
                        so if I'm horrible, just know it 
                        was the thought that counts.

           Everybody LAUGHS. She starts to play. (SONG IS ON CD.)

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        I am a passerby
                        Half-smile as you cut in line
                        Hold the door to be polite
                        You’re on your way and I’m on mine

           The song is sweet and melancholic; but no one in the room can 
           think of anything other than how beautiful and ANGELIC 
           Jessica's voice is. WE, the AUDIENCE, are witnessing THE REAL 
           JESSICA COME BACK TO LIFE. MAX AND OLIVER are MESMERIZED.

                        I don’t know where your head is at
                        You’re not a friend of mine

                        What if the things that tie us are 
                        stronger than we knew?
                        What if we'd shared a pint?  
                        What if we cheered the same team?

                        mean more than we could dream?

                        for me? 

                        Long days have made us numb
                        I don’t know where you’re coming

           The CROWD APPLAUDS. THE BRIDE wipes away tears as she and THE 
           GROOM cross to hug Jessica. Max stands to greet her, but 
           she's intercepted by Oliver.

                                 OLIVER

                        Hi, Oliver.

           They hug. The Band strikes up the Couple's first dance. 

                                 OLIVER
                        I'm speechless. That was the most 
                        beautiful thing I've ever heard.

                                 JESSICA
                        Thank you. I can't believe I just 
                        did that. I'm still shaking.

                                 OLIVER
                        How come you never played for me? 
                        That was unbelievable.

                        you'd hate it.

           Max arrives.

                        You too. That was incredible.

                                 OLIVER
                        I was just saying... I'm in shock.

                        some upper.

                        I wanna eat. Gotta get my carbs.

           Oliver smiles and leads Jessica onto the dance floor. Max

           INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT - INTERCUT

           Jessica sits on her kitchen floor.

                                 JESSICA
                        Really?

                                 MAX
                        Yeah. Nathan's stupid roller 
                        skating drama just closed and the 
                        producers have the lease on the 
                        theater for two more weeks. They 
                        said I could use their stage. Isn't 
                        that awesome?

                                 JESSICA
                        It's incredible. I'm proud of you.

                                 MAX
                        What's up? Wanna get coffee?

                                 JESSICA
                        You're not gonna believe this?

                                 MAX
                        What?

                                 JESSICA
                        He called.

                                 MAX 
                        Who called?   

                                 JESSICA
                        Oliver! He got a job offer from 
                        Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and he 
                        wants to meet up to get my advice.

           Max is speechless for the first time.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Did I lose you?

                                 MAX
                        No, sorry, I'm here. 

                                 JESSICA
                        I know I'm supposed to cancel at 
                        least once and then when we do meet 
                        up I need to be overly concerned 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JESSICA (CONT'D)
                        with checking my blackberry, but is 
                        dinner too much?

                                 MAX
                        Absolutely! Under no circumstances 
                        are you to meet him for dinner or a 
                        drink. No alcohol, understand? Meet 
                        for coffee. And not at one of those 
                        cozy local places with overstuffed 
                        couches. Go cold and corporate like 
                        Starbucks or... well I guess 
                        there's just Starbucks.  

                                 JESSICA
                        And what if he asks me when we can 
                        get together again?

                                 MAX
                        You give him a chaste kiss on the 
                        cheek and tell him you're seeing 
                        someone and its not appropriate.

           Jessica scribbles notes on a pad.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Just make sure you're out of there 
                        by 7:30 at the latest and call me 
                        right after.

                                 JESSICA
                        Got it.  Thanks again, Max.

           Jessica hangs up. Max notices Nathan staring at him.

                                 MAX
                        What?

                                 NATHAN
                        Why are you all pissed off?

                                 MAX
                        I'm not pissed off.

                                 NATHAN
                        You look a little pissed off to me.

                                 MAX
                        Well I'm not. I just like her as a 
                        person and I don't want her to get 
                        hurt again.

           Nathan can't help but LAUGH.
                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 NATHAN
                        Buddy. It's me. I love you. You're 
                        my best friend. Now look me in the 
                        eyes and tell me that you're not 
                        falling in love with Jessica.

           Max digests this. Nathan HITS A FEW BUTTONS on a lighting 
           board sitting backstage. The STAGE LIGHTS around them begin 
           to come to life until THE STAGE IS AWASH WITH BRIGHT LIGHT.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Be honest with yourself. My 
                        therapist always says...

                                 MAX
                        You see a therapist too?! How is it 
                        that everyone in this city has 
                        money for a shrink? I can't afford 
                        batteries!

                                 NATHAN
                        It's Sophie's dude. I'm just kind 
                        of piggybacking.

                                 MAX
                        Whatever. What does he say?

                                 NATHAN
                        "What are you pretending not to 
                        know?"

                                 MAX
                        How much did he charge you for 
                        that?

                                 NATHAN
                        He means, when you're really honest 
                        with yourself... what are you 
                        pretending that you don't know...?

           A beat. Max ROLLER SKATES AROUND as he speaks.

                                 MAX
                        When I'm really honest with 
                        myself... I'm pretending not to 
                        know that... I really like being 
                        with her. And when I'm not with 
                        her, I'm thinking about the next 
                        time I get to be with her. And all 
                        I really wanna do everyday is be 
                        near her so I can listen to her 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        amazing laugh. Oh and also I love 
                        the way she smells and that she 
                        gets my "What's Happening" 
                        references. 

                                 NATHAN
                        But you're not falling in love with 
                        her or anything...

           Max smiles wide; and then it fades. MUSIC CUE.

           INT. BLUE STAR INSURANCE - EVENING 

           Max sits at his desk METICULOUSLY CUTTING UP SOME OF HIS CAR 
           ACCIDENT PHOTOS into shapes. He glances at his watch: 7:00.  

           INT. CABLE CAR - MAGIC HOUR

           Max rides the Roosevelt Island Cable Car.

                                 MAX
                        Hey, it's ten o'clock.  Never heard 
                        from you. Just wanna make sure 
                        everything's cool. Give me a call.

           INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER

           Max paces his loft holding his phone.  

           INT. MAX'S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           Max lies in bed, holding his phone. He stares at the ceiling. 

                                                       FADE TO BLACK.

           INT.  JESSICA'S CONDO LOBBY - NEXT MORNING

           Max paces nervously in the lobby, two lattes in hand.  The 
           DOORMAN hangs the intercom phone up.

                                 DOORMAN
                        She's coming down.

           Max nods, exhaling deep, getting his footing.  CLOSE ON Max, 
           sort of talking to himself.  After a beat...

                                 JESSICA (O.S.)
                        Max...

           Jessica strides out of the elevator.  

                                 MAX
                        I need to tell you something...
                                 JESSICA
                        I need to tell you something.

                                 MAX
                        Why didn't you call me last night?

                                 JESSICA
                        I just... I had so much to tell you 
                        and I wanted to see you in person.

           Jessica guides Max to a couple of chairs in the lobby area.

                                 MAX
                        What's going on?  

                                 JESSICA
                        I've been thinking about what you 
                        said on your roof, about how I've 
                        just been cowering in my bed and 
                        being so terrified to be who I 
                        really am, and that's what inspired 
                        me to sing at the wedding. Because 
                        I'm 34 years old and I want so 
                        badly to finally have the courage 
                        to be myself.

                                 MAX
                        I'm really proud of you.

                                 JESSICA
                        You are such a special person, Max. 
                        It's so bizarre that it's you of 
                        all people, but you've made me 
                        realize that I've been living as 
                        about 20% of the person that I 
                        really am!

                                 MAX
                        I told you the first time we sat 
                        down that you were a ten in the 
                        making.

                                 JESSICA
                        You're so cute, thank you. I got so 
                        mad when you said that I wasn't the 
                        complete package, but the truth was 
                        that I wasn't the complete package 
                        because I was trying so hard to be 
                        what I thought Oliver wanted me to 
                        be, not who I really am. I thought 
                        when I started going out and 
                        swingling with you that it was the 
                        first time I was pretending to be 
                        someone else, but in reality I've

                                 JESSICA (CONT'D)
                        never been fully myself in any 
                        relationship I've ever had! And 
                        spending all this time with you has 
                        made me realize that I'm... 

                                 MAX
                        I'm in love with you.

                                 JESSICA
                        What?

           The elevator door opens.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        There you are...  

           Max and Jessica look up... Oliver, hair mussed, clearly 
           having spent the night, holding an overnight bag.

                                 OLIVER
                        Hey, Max. How are you, brother? 

                                 MAX
                        Fine.

                                 OLIVER
                        Cool. I'm just gonna grab the car, 
                        babe. I got your bag. See you Max.

           Max sits there, stunned. Oliver walks out.

                                 JESSICA
                        What did you say?

                                 MAX
                        You slept with him?

                                 JESSICA
                        Did you just say you're in love 
                        with me?

                                 MAX
                        Did you sleep with him?

                                 JESSICA
                        Of course I slept with him! I love 
                        him. 
                             (beat, trying to process)
                        Wait, I'm so confused. This was our 
                        deal. You promised me you were 
                        gonna help me find a new Oliver, 
                        but you're so good at this whole 
                        thing that you got me back my 
                        Oliver.
                                 MAX
                        So that was your plan the whole 
                        time?

                        What?

                                 MAX
                        This entire arrangement.  You 
                        really just wanted Oliver back?

           Jessica looks perplexed.  

                                 JESSICA
                        Of course I did.  

                                 MAX
                        And you knew he'd be at that wedding  
                        and that singing would show him a 
                        side of yourself that you'd never 
                        had the courage to show him before.

                                 JESSICA
                        I guess instead of pretending so 
                        hard to be something I'm not, I 
                        wanted to see what it would be like 
                        if I was unabashedly myself. And I 
                        loved it. And Oliver was just blown 
                        away. I mean we talked all night 
                        long and there was so many things 
                        we weren't being honest about with 
                        one another; so many 
                        misunderstandings and you're the 
                        inspiration for all of this. 

           Max stares out the window.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        How can you say you love me, Max? 
                        What are you talking about? You're 
                        an amazing person. But we want 
                        totally different things. 

                                 MAX
                        No we don't. We want the exact same 
                        thing everybody else wants.

                                 JESSICA
                        And what is that?

                                 MAX
                        Acceptance. 
                             (beat)
                        That's what your song's really 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        about isn't it? Having "grace" for 
                        someone. When you have grace for 
                        someone, you accept them for 
                        everything that they are and 
                        everything that they're not. And 
                        you allow yourself to fall in love 
                        with what's there, instead of what 
                        you wish was there. And if you can 
                        manage to do that, it leaves you so 
                        much room to celebrate the fact 
                        that somehow, amongst six billion 
                        people, you found each other. 
                        Somehow... you didn't just "pass 
                        each other by". 
                             (beat)
                        So yeah, you know everything about 
                        me. You know who I've been... But I 
                        also think you know who I'm ready 
                        to be. And I'm in love with you, 
                        Jessica. And I accept you. But most 
                        importantly... I have grace for 
                        you.

           Jessica has tears running down her face. A CAR HONKS. Oliver 
           has pulled up in a PORSCHE.

                                 JESSICA
                        Max, I have to go. We made plans. 
                        We're going to the Hamptons for the 
                        weekend.

                                 MAX
                        Of course you are.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm so sorry. I'm so confused. I... 
                        I would never, ever mean to hurt 
                        you. I just... I wasn't expecting 
                        this...

                                 MAX
                        Neither was I.

           A long silence. They stare at each other. Oliver HONKS AGAIN. 
           Jessica looks out at him and wipes her tears away.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm so sorry... I have to go.

           She rushes out, leaving him alone.
           EXT. SOPHIE AND NATHAN APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER

           Sophie opens the door revealing a clearly upset Max.  Nathan 
           sits on the couch in the background, playing X-Box.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Hey, Max.  Nathan was just about to 
                        call you to...

                                 MAX
                             (to Nate)
                        You made me look like a fucking 
                        idiot!

           Max walks into the apartment.  

                                 NATHAN
                        What are you talking about?

                                 MAX
                        You know exactly what I'm talking 
                        about.  You totally rallied me to 
                        tell her how I feel when Sophie 
                        could have easily told you she was 
                        back to fucking Oliver!

                                 SOPHIE
                        Max, I haven't spoken to her, I had 
                        no idea.

                                 MAX
                        Whatever! You guys are that 
                        horrible stereotypic couple that 
                        falls in love and wants everyone 
                        else around them to fall in love 
                        too, so we can all have picnics in 
                        wine country and trade fucking     
                        J-Crew catalogues! Well fuck you 
                        both very much, because I did what 
                        you told me to do and she walked 
                        away. Just like Emily.

                                 NATHAN
                        Max I never told you to do 
                        anything. I just helped you to be 
                        honest with yourself. You can't 
                        blame us for her reaction... What 
                        happened?

                                 MAX
                        I went over to her place this 
                        morning to tell her how I feel, and 
                        she was trying to tell me she has 
                        the same exact feelings, with the 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        unfortunate exception that they're 
                        for Oliver!

                                 NATHAN
                        Okay, look. For starters can you 
                        please just calm down a little bit?

                                 MAX
                        Once again, I'm alone. Everyone 
                        ditches me; even you. What is it 
                        about me that makes it so easy for 
                        people to just walk away? 

                                 NATHAN
                        I never fucking walked away from 
                        you! I fell in love. And I'm having 
                        a fucking baby! And I'm 35 years 
                        old and I decided I was done 
                        fucking 22 year-olds whose favorite 
                        book is US Weekly! And I'm not 
                        gonna fucking apologize to you or 
                        anyone else for choosing love over 
                        loneliness. 

           Nathan lets that sit. Takes a breath.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        I'm sorry Jessica doesn't love you, 
                        Max. But what did you expect? She 
                        knows everything about you; the 
                        kind of life you've been living; 
                        all the girls you've slept with; 
                        all the lies. She doesn't want 
                        that. Nobody does. In the end, any 
                        girl that's worth you falling in 
                        love with is gonna expect so much 
                        more from you, Max. You have to 
                        realize that by now. 

           Max stands there, stoic.  

                                 MAX
                        You're right; she deserves way 
                        better than me. I'm nothing. I'm 
                        just a con artist. I'm just a 
                        fucking chiropractor.

                                 NATHAN
                        What?

                                 MAX
                        Nothing.

           BEGIN MONTAGE CUT TO MUSIC:
           * Max cuts car accident photos in his cubicle.

           * Max shoots different people we've met throughout the film 
           in their environments: Gerald, Avi, Clarence, various girls.

           * Max in a darkroom printing photos. 

           * Max, Sophie and Nathan transform the stage into a GALLERY. 

           * Avi and Gerald (with his baby) hand out flyers. 

           * Max glues car accident photos onto a CANVAS. He stands 
           above it and takes it all in. We don't see his POV. 

           INT. OB/GYN OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Jessica sits with Sophie and Nathan during an ultrasound. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Is it weird that I'm here? I feel 
                        like it's weird that I'm here. 
                        You're not gonna take out your 
                        vagina are you?

                                 SOPHIE
                        No. It's an ultrasound. My vagina's 
                        not involved. 

           The SONOGRAM NURSE spreads the goo all over Sophie's belly.

                                 JESSICA
                        Why is she covering you with goo?

                                 SONOGRAM NURSE
                        It helps improve the image of the 
                        uterus.

                                 JESSICA
                             (to Nathan)
                        If you'd only done that with your 
                        jizz, we wouldn't be here right 
                        now.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Jessica!
                             (to Nurse)
                        I'm so sorry. She's going through a 
                        tough time. 
                             (back to Jess)
                        God, you sound like Max.

                                 JESSICA
                        He would have thought that was 
                        funny. Speaking of... how is he?
                                 NATHAN
                        Good. Getting ready for his show.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Are you gonna go?

                                 JESSICA
                        Of course I'm gonna go. It was my 
                        idea.

                                 NATHAN
                        Are you bringing Oliver?

                                 JESSICA
                        Of course. I have to. I think it's 
                        super weird if I don't. Don't you? 
                        Plus I'm sure Max has moved on to 
                        crushing on somebody else by now. 
                        She'll probably have to get out 
                        early from camp.

                                 NATHAN
                        Don't be so fucking cavalier. He 
                        really fell in love with you.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Nathan.

                                 NATHAN
                        I'm sorry. I just wish you could 
                        see what I've seen.

                                 JESSICA
                        What have you seen, Max?

                                 NATHAN
                        You've transformed him. The way he 
                        feels about you is so strong, that 
                        even without you in his life it 
                        continues to propel him. I know you  
                        think of him as a player, but he's 
                        a new man.

                                 JESSICA
                        Oliver got the job at Johns 
                        Hopkins. He wants me to move to 
                        Baltimore with him.

                                 SOPHIE
                        And what did you tell him?

                                 JESSICA
                        I told him yes.
                                 SOPHIE
                        Really? Why? I mean... really? 

                                 JESSICA
                        Yeah, I know it's kind of out of 
                        the blue and sudden, but it just 
                        feels like I'm long overdue to 
                        start a new chapter of my life and 
                        Oliver feels like the one.

                                 SOPHIE
                        He feels like the one? Sweetie, why 
                        are you so sure Max isn't the one?

                                 SONOGRAM NURSE
                        I'm sorry to interrupt you all, but 
                        you might wanna look at your baby.

           They all turn to the monitor.

                                 JESSICA
                        Ewww. Is that what he's gonna look 
                        like?! He looks like "Sloth" from 
                        The Goonies.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Shut-up! He's not done yet. He's 
                        only been in there for four months.

                                 JESSICA
                        Alright good, so he'll fill out and 
                        everything, right? Is that his head 
                        or his balls?

                                 SONOGRAM NURSE
                        It's a girl.

                                 JESSICA
                        Your girl has balls?
                             (off their stares)
                        Put some more of that jizz on 
                        there; maybe it'll hide them.
                             (as Sloth)

           INT. THEATER/GALLERY - NIGHT

           The stage has been transformed into a gorgeous art gallery. 
           The photos are printed very large and have been hung from the 
           pipes over the stage. People can walk around the photos as 
           some are hung back to back. About 50 people mill about 
           drinking champagne and admiring Max's work. 
           WE FIND Gerald showing his large family a GIANT PHOTO OF HIM 
           WORKING OUT IN HIS GYM. He is shirtless and not in shape.

                                 GERALD
                        I told Max my body wasn't ready to 
                        be photographed; but as an artist 
                        he was able to see my inner 
                        sexiness.

           WE FLOAT through the space to Avi, who's showing his latest 
           PROSTITUTE a PHOTOGRAPH OF HIM AND HIS PEERS IN HIS DJ CLASS. 

                                 AVI
                        I like this picture, because it 
                        hides my ipod, which is very 
                        important for today's DJ.

                                 HOOKER
                        You've only got about 45 minutes 
                        left, when do you wanna fuck?

                                 AVI
                        Right after the cake.

           WE FLOAT to Nathan and Sophie admiring a stunning PHOTO OF 
           THEM SNUGGLING IN CENTRAL PARK.

                                 NATHAN
                        How could you not like this 
                        picture?

                                 SOPHIE
                        I look fat.

                                 NATHAN
                        You are fat, you're growing a 
                        human, it's part of the deal.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I am not fat, you asshole!

           She playfully smacks his arm.

           WE FLOAT again across the stage to find A GROUP OF YOUNG 
           TWENTY SOMETHINGS flirting with Max. He couldn't care less; 
           clearly looking for Jessica.

           AND THERE SHE IS. Jessica enters with Oliver. Max and Jessica 
           make eye contact, they smile and nod. Nathan brings a 
           microphone over to Max.

                                 MAX
                             (into mic)
                        Hello there.
           People APPLAUD.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I just wanted to thank you all so 
                        much for coming. I'm really blown 
                        away by the turnout. I never 
                        dreamed in my whole life that I'd 
                        ever really get to show my stuff. I 
                        wanna thank my best friend Nathan 
                        for arranging for me to have this 
                        space, not to mention the amazing 
                        job he did lighting it all.

           APPLAUSE.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        And I also wanna thank Sophie, 
                        Nathan's... what are you? His baby-
                        mama?

           The CROWD LAUGHS.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Life-partner.

                                 MAX
                        Okay. I wanna thank Nathan's life-
                        partner, Sophie for helping me to 
                        hang everything.

                                 GERALD
                        What about your muse?

           THE CROWD LAUGHS.

                                 MAX
                        And of course, my boss, Gerald for 
                        giving me time off and for becoming 
                        one of my main muses for the show.

           APPLAUSE.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Most of my work as you can see is 
                        portraiture. But because this was 
                        such a special occasion, I really 
                        wanted to challenge myself to do 
                        something new. The final piece in 
                        this series is constructed from the 
                        many thousands of car accident 
                        images I've taken over the years 
                        for my employers at Blue Star 
                        Insurance. Nate...
           Nathan pulls the ropes of the giant theatrical curtain on the 
           back brick wall of the stage to REVEAL A GIGANTIC COLLAGE (8 
           feet by 10 feet) of THOUSANDS of CAR ACCIDENT IMAGES. BUT 
           MORE IMPORTANTLY, AS WE PULL BACK, WE REVEAL THAT THE IMAGES 
           COLLECTIVELY FORM A GIANT PORTRAIT OF JESSICA.

           The CROWD is in AWE. They APPLAUD and move in closer to 
           examine it. People look to Jessica who's in utter shock. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        All right, Avi... music.

           Avi, standing in front of an elaborate DJ setup COVERTLY HITS 
           PLAY ON HIS IPOD. AN AWESOME SONG STARTS, A LITTLE TOO LOUD. 
           It's now hard to overhear what they're saying.

           Max moves through the crowd as people pat him on the back and 
           whisper words of praise to him. Because WE can no longer hear 
           people over the MUSIC, WE see SUBTITLES of what they're 
           saying. Words float by on the bottom of the screen as the 
           people who've said them move past Max:

           Amazing... I can't believe the collage... Will you shoot 
           me?.. Where are the prices for everything?.. You never called 
           me... Your muse just grabbed my ass... 

           Finally Max has arrived at Jessica, but the MUSIC'S STILL TOO 
           LOUD. She leans in to speak intimately into his ear. 

                                 JESSICA
                             (subtitled)
                        I'm speechless. I feel so honored 
                        that you would create something so 
                        unique with me in mind. No one has 
                        ever done anything as beautiful and 
                        kind for me in my entire life.

                                 MAX
                             (subtitled)
                        I want you to have it.

                                 JESSICA
                             (subtitled))
                        I can't have it, Max. I'm moving to 
                        Baltimore with Oliver.

           Max closes his eyes in pain.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                             (subtitled)
                        But I will never forget that image 
                        or this moment. 
           She kisses his cheek and starts to back away. She comes back 
           in close for one more thing.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                             (subtitled)
                        I have grace for you, Max. 

           She swipes a tear and backs away. WE PULL OUT AND BACK on Max 
           amidst a sea of female admirers. Alone.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK.

           CHYRON: TWO MONTHS LATER.

                                 MAX (V.O.)
                        I've been thinking a lot about the 
                        production of Romeo and Juliet I 
                        saw a few months ago.

           INT. NONDESCRIPT ROOM - DAY

           Max speaks directly INTO THE LENS.

                                 MAX
                        Romeo would rather die than live in 
                        a world where there is no Juliet. 
                        Do you know why I think they've 
                        been doing that play for 400 years?

           WE REVEAL: Max is talking to his NEW THERAPIST. 

                                 THERAPIST
                        Why?

                                 MAX
                        Because everything anybody does; 
                        everything ultimately, is about 
                        looking for a love that's so 
                        powerful we couldn't live without 
                        it. Dating, trying to look good, 
                        trying to get laid... it's all 
                        filler. It's all just stalling 
                        while we wait to meet someone we'd 
                        die for. 

           EXT. DELACOURTE OUTDOOR THEATER - FLASHBACK

           WE are back where the whole film started right at the moment 
           where Romeo is holding Juliet about to die.

                           ROMEO
                                                       MAX (O.S.)
           Thus with a kiss I die.
                                              Thus with a kiss I die.
           INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY

           Max stares out the window.

                                 THERAPIST
                        We're gonna have to stop there 
                        today.

                                 MAX
                        Okay. By the way, I sold another 
                        picture so I can afford you for at 
                        least another month.

           INT. JESSICA AND OLIVER'S HOUSE, BALTIMORE - DAY

           Jessica plays a melancholy song on the piano. Oliver enters.

                                 OLIVER
                        How come you always write sad 
                        songs? You should try writing 
                        something uplifting. Like that Goo-
                        Goo Dolls song, Iris.

                                 JESSICA
                        The Goo-Goo Dolls aren't really my 
                        style. 

                                 OLIVER
                        Really? I think the Goo-Goo Dolls 
                        are everyone's style. They've 
                        gotten me through a lot of hard 
                        times.

                                 JESSICA
                        Yeah... but I don't think it would 
                        be any good if I tried to force 
                        something that wasn't me.

                                 OLIVER
                        You're probably right. There's an 
                        old Mandarin expression: (He says a 
                        LONG phrase in perfect Mandarin.)

           Jessica stares, waiting for the translation.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, I gotta head in for a bit. 
                        I shouldn't be too late.

                                 JESSICA
                        Okay.

           She plays a little more; and then stumbles into the Fiona 
           Apple melody she mentioned to Max. She SINGS:
                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Only kisses on the check from now 
                        on, and in a little while we'll 
                        only have to wave.

           EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK, AERIALS - MAGIC HOUR

           WE CHOPPER OVER the gorgeous forests of Upstate New York 
           until we arrive at a lake. A VINTAGE CONVERTIBLE sits in the 
           middle of the lake, having been driven off a nearby road.

           EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK, BANK OF THE LAKE - CONTINUOUS

           Max is on his cellphone.

                                 MAX
                        Gerald you sent me all the way up 
                        here to shoot this car. I can't 
                        shoot your headshots today.

           INT. JEWISH TEMPLE - INTERCUT

           Gerald is on his phone in the middle of saturday morning 
           services. He wears a tallis and yarmulka. His wife and kids 
           stare at him to get off the phone.

                                 GERALD 
                        Well what time you gonna be back? 
                        Your pictures are blowin' me up! I 
                        got an audition for a cereal 
                        commercial next week. I'm gonna be 
                        more famous than Cinnamon Life!

                                 MAX
                        Okay, I'll call you back.

           Max hangs up, rolls up his pants and starts to wade into the 
           pond with his camera.

                                 JESSICA (O.S.)
                        Don't get your old man camera wet.

           Max turns.

                                 MAX
                        Oh my God. You scared the shit out 
                        of me? What are you doing here?! Is 
                        this your car?!

                                 JESSICA
                        No, it's not my car. I've got a man 
                        on the inside. Can we talk for a 
                        minute?
                                 MAX
                        Uhh...sure. But you're gonna have 
                        to wade out here with me. I don't 
                        have much time before the sun sets.

           She wades towards the car as Max watches in disbelief.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing here? 

           She climbs into the passenger seat of the convertible.

                                 JESSICA
                        I wanted to talk to you and it's 
                        important, so I found you.

                                 MAX
                        Is Oliver waiting in a yellow 
                        Hummer somewhere?

                                 JESSICA
                        No, I'm here alone. 

           Max photographs the car.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Look something's really been 
                        missing in my life and yesterday I 
                        think I figured out what it was. 

                                 MAX
                        I'm bad at guessing. Is it lactose?

                                 JESSICA
                        It's laughing. Oliver is perfect in 
                        so many ways, and he's beyond 
                        everything I thought I wanted in a 
                        man, but we don't really laugh 
                        together. And I don't know if I 
                        could spend the rest of my life 
                        with someone so serious. 

                                 MAX
                        Oh, I'm laying off the swingling 
                        for now. I can't really help you. 
                        Maybe you should try hanging out 
                        outside of some comedy clubs or 
                        something.

                                 JESSICA
                        It's more than just laughing, Max. 
                        It's laughing with you. 
                                 MAX
                        Look I just spent 2 months trying 
                        to get over you... 

                                 JESSICA
                        Did you?

                                 MAX
                        Not at all. 

           She smiles.

                                 JESSICA
                        I chose Oliver because he always 
                        felt so safe and secure to me. But 
                        ultimately just feeling safe isn't 
                        enough. Maybe what I really need is 
                        to let myself be scared a little, 
                        and everything about dating you 
                        scares the hell out of me. But it 
                        isn't fair to Oliver for me to be 
                        lying next to him thinking about 
                        you. I like the person I am when 
                        I'm with him, but I love the person 
                        I am when I'm with you.
                             (beat)
                        Please say something.

                                 MAX
                        I don't know what to say, I'm kind 
                        of tripping right now. I feel like 
                        I may have accidentally dropped 
                        acid.

                                 JESSICA
                        And I know that I don't know you. I 
                        mean I know you, but I don't really 
                        know you. Could I even trust you? 
                        Are you really ready for something 
                        real? How do I know that I won't 
                        fall really hard for you and you'll 
                        just break my heart by fucking some 
                        girl you met at the post office.

                                 MAX
                        I never go to the post office.

                                 JESSICA
                        Seriously. Don't hurt me.

                                 MAX
                        If you give me a chance I won't 
                        ever hurt you.
                                 JESSICA
                        But how do I know?

                                 MAX
                        Because I'm in love with you and 
                        I'll prove that to you every second 
                        of my life if I have to. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Every second?

                                 MAX
                        Unless that proves to be too 
                        exhausting, then I'll probably 
                        scale back to every minute.

           They smile at one another.

                                 JESSICA
                        Well, maybe there's a way we could 
                        take it kinda slow at first and 
                        feel each other out a little bit...

                                 MAX
                        Okay. Or we could just leap in and 
                        be scared together.

                                 JESSICA
                        Okay. I wanna be scared with you.

                                 MAX
                        I wanna be scared with you too.

           They sit there a beat, smiling. So HAPPY.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        This is super weird; I'm not sure 
                        if I'm allowed to kiss you or not.

                                 JESSICA
                        I wish you would.

           They KISS. It's BEAUTIFUL and SWEET and it's LOVE. They pull 
           apart momentarily to stare into each other's eyes.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Good kisser. Thank God! That's a 
                        very good start. 

           They KISS again as the CAMERA CRANES UP over the pond, higher 
           and higher until Max and Jessica kissing in the wrecked car 
           are just one speck in a little pond, in the middle of an 
           endless forest.
