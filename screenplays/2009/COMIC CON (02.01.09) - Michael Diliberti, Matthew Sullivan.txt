           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Traffic rushes by.  We find one particular car.  A red 1981
           Renault Le Car.  A rusted out shitbox with a cloth sunroof
           and 45 French horses working overtime beneath the hood to
           reach highway speed. 

           The Le Car cuts across three lanes to make the exit for
           Burbank Airport.

           EXT. PARKING LOT, BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY

           The Le Car pulls into a space.

           INT. RENAULT LE CAR - DAY

           The mess that is the back seat is dominated by 

           COMIC BOOKS

           Batman, The Runaways, Kick-Ass, more Batman.  All in
           protective covers.    

           A hand flips down the driver's side visor and staring back
           at us in the vanity mirror we find

           PARKER EDMUNDS

           He's a 19-year-old slacker with a peculiar amount of
           confidence despite being on the wrong side of the average
           national height and not quite good looking.  A pair of Oakley
           Frogskins hang on a lanyard around his neck.  He checks his
           tangled mop of brown hair in the mirror and tidies it as
           best he can.  

           He sprays some vanilla scented air freshener, sniffs.  Sprays
           some under his arms, sniffs.  Satisfied, he shuts the car
           off and gets out.   

           INT. TERMINAL, BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY

           Parker sits waiting.  Beside him is a CUTE GIRL.  They both
           look anxiously over at the baggage claim exit.  The Girl
           undoes one of her shirt buttons, checks her breath. 

                                 PARKER
                        Where does he go to school? 

           The Girl looks over at him, caught.  

                                 CUTE GIRL
                        Boston College.  How about yours?
                                 PARKER
                        Tufts.  
                            (beat)
                        The long distance thing sucks, doesn't
                        it?

                                 CUTE GIRL
                        It's the worst.  You send emails,
                        video chat, but there are some things
                        you just need them there for.   

                                 PARKER
                        Tell me about it.  Thursday nights,
                        "Lost" starts...there's an empty
                        space on the couch and I feel like
                        I'm the one on the island.
                            (beat)
                        Or when you get a new pair of jeans
                        and there's no one to ask how your
                        ass looks.  
                            (beat)
                        That one was for you.  
                            (beat)
                        Or when you find something on the
                        internet, maybe it's kinda weird,
                        maybe it's really weird, but it turns
                        you on and you need a second opinion. 
                        'Cause if it turns them on, too,
                        then everything is okay.    

           The Cute Girl awkwardly nods.  She looks back over at the
           baggage claim exit.  ARRIVING PASSENGERS flood out.  Parker
           and the Cute Girl stand. 

                                 PARKER
                        Good luck.  If the bond is strong
                        enough, you can overcome any distance. 

                                 CUTE GIRL
                        Yeah...thanks.   

           Parker tentatively scans the sea of faces, from which emerges
           an ATTRACTIVE BLONDE GIRL in a sorority sweater.  He smiles. 
           She smiles back.  And steps out of the way, revealing

           LARRY WOLLARSKY

           He's a lanky 19-year-old that has begun to shed bits and
           pieces of high school nerdom.  He sports a Tufts ball cap,
           preppy clothes and some carefully groomed facial scruff.  He
           sees Parker, stops and gives a small wave.

           Parker waves back.  Larry continues toward him.  The guys
           meet up and look each other over.  After a beat -  
                                 PARKER
                        Is that a goatee?

                                 LARRY
                        It's actually considered a
                        "musketeer," since the mustache
                        doesn't connect to the chin.  

                                 PARKER
                        And get a load of those clothes,
                        what are they, J. Crew? 

                                 LARRY
                        The corduroys are.  I think the shirt
                        is Van Hueseen wrinkle free. 

                                 PARKER
                        Fancy.
                            (beat)
                        We might as well get this out of way -
                        I know I've gained some weight. 

                                 LARRY
                        You look about the same. 

                                 PARKER
                        I've gained weight.  But it's 90
                        percent muscle mass. 

                                 LARRY
                        You look exactly the same as the
                        last time I saw you.  I think you
                        were actually wearing that shirt.  

           Parker looks down at his vintage Batman t-shirt from the
           Michael Keaton era. 

                                 PARKER
                        This is my favorite shirt.  I wanted
                        to make sure you'd recognize me. 

                                 LARRY
                        On account of the muscle?

                                 PARKER
                        Yes.  On account of the muscle. 

           Parker very formally extends his hand. 

                                 PARKER
                        Welcome home. 

           Larry shakes Parker's hand.  Parker doesn't let go.  He slowly
           turns the shake into an awkward hug.    
                                 LARRY
                        You smell like vanilla. 

                                 PARKER
                        You smell like Calvin Klein Obsession. 

                                 LARRY
                        Maybe we should hit the road. 

                                 PARKER
                        Let's do it. 

           The guys carefully untangle themselves from the embrace.

           INT. PARKING LOT, BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY

           Parker and Larry cross the lot together.  Larry wheels a
           neat little piece of luggage. 

                                 PARKER
                        You should really carry a duffel bag
                        instead of wheeling that thing.  It
                        builds upper body strength.

                                 LARRY
                        What's with you and all the muscle
                        stuff? 

                                 PARKER
                        I live at home, man.  I jog like
                        nine times a day just to get out of
                        the house.  My endurance and strength
                        are through the roof.  I honestly
                        think once I find a girl to fuck her
                        vagina might implode.  

                                 LARRY
                        Like a star that goes supernova then
                        turns into a black hole. 

                                 PARKER
                        Exactly.  I might be able to climb
                        in there and go back in time for all
                        I know.  Invent the internet and
                        name it after myself.  

           Parker pulls a small journal from his back pocket and
           scribbles in it.

                                 PARKER
                        That might actually be an idea for a
                        comic book.  

           The guys reach Parker's car and load the luggage inside. 
           EXT. SIMI VALLEY - DAY

           Sprawling tracts of condo development lie on the outskirts
           of town.  The Le Car blows past a sign that proclaims, "Simi
           Valley: The Fastest Growing Community in Southern California!"

           INT. RENAULT LE CAR - DAY - MOVING

           Larry stares out the window as the guys pass their old high
           school.  

                                 LARRY
                        That's a sight I don't miss.

                                 PARKER
                            (shrugs)
                        We had some fun.  College can't be
                        much better.  Probably still a lot
                        of assholes and girls who won't fuck
                        you. 

                                 LARRY
                        I guess there are a few assholes. 

           After a beat - 

                                 PARKER
                        And girls who won't fuck you...right? 

           Larry says nothing. 

                                 PARKER
                        Holy shit!  Did you get laid?  Who
                        was she?

                                 LARRY
                        My lab partner, Yu Lee. 

                                 PARKER
                        You lost your virginity to an Asian? 
                        That's like getting a Porsche for
                        your first car.  

                                 LARRY
                        Technically, it's like getting a
                        Honda for your first car. 

                                 PARKER
                        I can't fucking believe you didn't
                        tell me any of this.  

                                 LARRY
                        I didn't think it was that big of a
                        deal.  You never call me to talk
                        about who you're sleeping with. 
                                 PARKER
                        "Sleeping with?"  What is this,
                        Melrose Place?  I'm not sleeping
                        with anyone, and I'm certainly not
                        sticking my dick in anything wet. 
                            (beat)
                        Any other secrets hiding behind that
                        goatee of yours?

           A beat passes.  Larry looks out the widow, guiltily. 

                                 LARRY
                        There is one thing.  I applied for
                        this summer internship at Raytheon
                        and got it. 

                                 PARKER
                        How are you gonna work two jobs? 

                                 LARRY
                        I'm not.

                                 PARKER
                        You told Raytheon to fuck off?  Don't
                        they make bombs? 

                                 LARRY
                        No, man.  I can't work at the shop.  

                                 PARKER
                        Are you kidding me?  We work at the
                        shop every summer. 

                                 LARRY
                        Yeah, in high school.  Now I need a
                        job that I can put on an actual
                        resume.  I'm really sorry, okay. 

           Parker sucks it up.  Puts on a brave face.  

                                 PARKER
                        Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do. 
                        We're still gonna have a great summer. 
                        And in a few weeks we got the biggest
                        party of year. 

                                 LARRY
                        Oh, right, Comic-Con. 

                                 PARKER
                        Not "oh right."  We're talking "fuck
                        yeah."  We're gonna rock the Con
                        harder than ever. 
           Parker extends his fist.  Larry delivers a lackluster bump.  

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. PARKER'S ROOM - DAY

           An explosion of dirty clothes and comic book paraphernalia. 
           Parker rolls out of bed.  He does three pushups, then gives
           up and throws on his Batman t-shirt. 

           He goes to a wall calendar and crosses out the previous day
           with a red marker.  We can see that there are now only a few
           days left until Comic-Con.  

           He picks up his cell phone and dials.  The line goes straight
           to Larry's voicemail.  Parker leaves a message.

                                 PARKER
                        Hey, buddy.  Been trying to get you
                        for a few days.  And before that for
                        like a week.  Just want to see if
                        you needed any help packing for the
                        Con.  Uh...this summer's gonna be
                        awesome.  Later.  

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Parker enters and goes straight for the cereal on top of the
           fridge.  His sexy/trashy sister, CHRISTINA (21), sits at the
           table eating a bowl of cereal.  She has very large very fake
           breasts that look amazing.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Are you really gonna wear that gross
                        t-shirt again?  

                                 PARKER
                        I don't know, Christina.  Are you
                        really gonna wear those stripper
                        tits again?

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Yes.  And again and again and again. 

                                 PARKER
                        Ok, but at the very least you should
                        change out of that dirty vagina. 

           Parker pours himself a bowl of Lucky Charms. 

                                 PARKER
                        What the hell?  There's no charms in
                        here. 

           Christina looks up from her charm filled bowl and grins.  
                                 PARKER
                        Thanks a lot.  It's bad luck to eat
                        a bowl of Lucky Charms with no charms. 
                        Now I have to waste all of this
                        magically delicious cereal.  

           Parker empties his bowl into the garbage.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        I honestly can't believe we traveled
                        down the same birth canal. 

                                 PARKER
                        That's incorrect.  You were actually
                        the product of an anal delivery.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Mom!

           Parker's mom, RENEE, storms in. 

                                 RENEE
                        What's the problem in here?

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Parker's being himself again.

                                 PARKER
                        Well, she picked all the charms out
                        of the box again.  Now I can't have
                        breakfast before I go to work. 

                                 RENEE
                        You don't work.  You hang out at a 
                        comic shop all day. 

                                 PARKER
                        I get paid to liaise with the
                        customers.   

                                 CHRISTINA
                        You make less than our gardener.  

                                 PARKER
                        He gets paid off the books!

                                 RENEE
                        You should have went to college like
                        your sister. 

                                 PARKER
                        She goes to community college.  That's
                        like tenth grade for regular people. 
                        Besides, she's got most of my college
                        fund crammed into her pushup bra. 
                                 RENEE
                        I told you, if you didn't apply last
                        year, your sister could use the money
                        for her surgery.  

           Christina perks up her fake tits and mouths "loser." 

                                 PARKER
                        Listen, mom, bankers work on Wall
                        Street, astronauts work in space,
                        Christina works at Hooters.  It's
                        the natural order of things.  Imagine
                        you put an astronaut on Wall Street.  
                        What good would his space suit and
                        zero gravity training do him?  Now
                        imagine Christina in space.  Her
                        tits would literally explode!  That's
                        like putting a comic book writer in
                        college.  So I'm gonna stay at the
                        shop and soak up the inspiration
                        until I sell one of my books.  And
                        Christina can use the rest of my
                        college fund to get ass implants for
                        all I care. 

           Renee shakes her head. 

                                 RENEE
                        I just wish you would grow up and
                        stop listening to that idiot who
                        owns the shop.  

                                 PARKER
                        I think you're seriously mistaken
                        about Duke.  He's a really smart guy
                        who can speak intelligently on a
                        wide range of topics. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           DUKE (30s) faces camera.  He's a one-time nerd who fell into
           good looks later in life but kept it real.  His sleeveless t-
           shirt shows off a tattoo of Wolverine clawing his way up his
           bicep.  He speaks with a slight Southern drawl and he might
           be high.  

                                 DUKE
                        So I cut this guy off on my moped
                        this morning and he calls me a
                        "douchebag."  You know, as far as
                        I'm concerned, douchebag is a
                        compliment.  The act of douching, in
                        itself, is a positive thing.  It has
                        a cleansing effect...on the vagina. 
           PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're in - 

           INT. DUKE'S COMICS - DAY

           A rambling shop packed full of comic books, memorabilia and
           assorted cool shit.  A life-size Predator statue dressed in
           a security guard uniform stands watch by the door.

           Duke sits on a stool before Parker and a motley bunch of
           LOCAL COMIC NERDS who hang off his every word.  

                                 DUKE
                        So I said, "yeah, man, I'm your
                        girlfriend's douchebag."  Shut the
                        motherfucker up.  Half the time people
                        call you shit without ever thinking
                        what it really means.  Just makes
                        them look dumb.    

                                 COMIC NERD
                        At school they call me "the jizz?" 
                        I think it's pretty clear what that
                        means.

                                 DUKE
                        Jizz is the blood of life.  That's
                        like saying you're the creator.  You
                        know who else they used to call the
                        jizz in high school?  Clark Kent. 

                                 COMIC NERD
                        Really?  What issue is that in?

                                 DUKE
                        It's not in the comics.  I heard it
                        at a panel.

           Duke stands up.

                                 DUKE
                        Okay, me and my man Parker gotta get
                        back to work, make sure this place
                        keeps running.  Go spend some dough. 

           The Comic Nerds disperse, high-fiving Duke on their way off.  

           Parker grabs a box and starts filing new comics onto the
           shelves.  Duke joins him. 

                                 DUKE
                        How's the writing going?

           Parker pulls out his journal and fans the pages.  It's almost
           entirely filled with tiny handwriting. 
                                 PARKER
                        What I have here is a lot of shit
                        thrown against the wall, and none of
                        it's sticking. 

           Duke takes the journal, flips through it, reads one of the
           more recent entries. 

                                 DUKE
                        A comic about a guy who time travels
                        by way of a vagina?  
                            (beat)
                        You can call it "Time Gap."

                                 PARKER
                        That's what I'm talking about.  Shit
                        against the wall. 

                                 DUKE
                        If you keep calling it shit, it's
                        gonna be shit.  Have some confidence
                        in your own ideas.  Maybe not this
                        particular idea, but some of the
                        others.  I believe in you. 

                                 PARKER
                        You're about the only one who does. 
                        My mom thinks I'm a loser and my
                        best friend won't hang out with me. 
                        I've seen him three times since he's
                        been back. 

                                 DUKE
                        Just get him on the phone and tell
                        him to get his ass here and take you
                        to lunch.  

                                 PARKER
                        He barely takes my calls anymore. 

           Duke whips out his cell phone. 

                                 DUKE
                        I'll tell you whose call he will
                        take. 

           INT. RAYTHEON OFFICE - DAY

           Larry works at a computer terminal beside some other INTERNS. 
           His SUPERVISOR approaches. 

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Larry, there's a call for you on
                        line three. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SUPERVISOR (CONT'D)
                            (lowers voice)
                        It's the Tufts University provost. 
                        He says it's an emergency. 

           The Interns trade looks. 

           Larry walks over to another desk and picks up the phone.  

                                 LARRY
                        Sir? 

                                                           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. DUKE'S COMICS - DAY

           Duke has his phone on speaker.  He takes his voice down a
           few octaves. 

                                 DUKE
                        Mr. Wollarsky, this is the provost
                        speaking.  This morning, I received
                        some very unsettling information
                        about you and a Miss Yu Lee. 

                                 LARRY (O.S.)
                        I, uh...she's my chem lab partner.  

                                 DUKE
                        Is that the only experimentation you
                        and Miss Lee have been engaged in?  

                                 LARRY (O.S.)
                        Sir, I don't see how this is -

                                 DUKE
                        Are you aware that Miss Lee is a 14-
                        year-old prodigy from Korea? 

           Larry freezes.  He backs into a corner and lowers his voice.   

                                 LARRY
                        She told me she was 19. 

                                 DUKE (O.S.)
                        Not according to her testimony.  
                            (beat)
                        I also have Mr. Shin from the Korean
                        Embassy on the line.  If you answer
                        his questions honestly, perhaps he
                        can help you avoid extradition to
                        Korea to stand trial.  

                                 LARRY
                        Korea?
                                 PARKER (O.S.)
                            (awful Korean accent)
                        Mr. Wollarsky, according to Miss
                        Lee, you ask her to put two finger
                        in your butt.  Is this true?

           Larry starts to sweat. 

                                 LARRY
                        I really had no idea she was 14.  

                                 PARKER (O.S.)
                        Just answer question!  You facing
                        serious charges!

                                 LARRY
                        I don't remember. 

                                 PARKER (O.S.)
                        Miss Lee remember!  She remember
                        forever!

                                 LARRY
                        Okay.  Yes.
                            (gulps)
                        It's true.  But it was her idea. 

           Duke and Parker fight back laughter.

                                 PARKER
                        You are very honest man.  You no
                        have to come to Korea.  But we need
                        embassy official to come to your
                        office and stick finger in your butt
                        hole for DNA evidence.  Would this
                        be all right with you?  

                                 LARRY (O.S.)
                        I mean...yeah, sure, if it gets me
                        off the hook.  

                                 PARKER
                        Yes, you get completely off hook. 
                        Also, we may need to film it for
                        legal purposes. 

                                 LARRY (O.S.)
                        Yeah, whatever. 

                                 PARKER
                        Okay, so on Tuesday, good looking
                        man will come to your work.  He will
                        stick finger in your butt while other
                        man films. 
                                 LARRY (O.S.)
                        Okay, sounds great.  I'm so sorry
                        for this.  I didn't know she was a
                        prodigy. 

                                 PARKER
                        Oh, she a prodigy...
                            (in regular voice)
                        ...at sucking dick!

           Parker and Duke crack up.

                                 LARRY (O.S.)
                        What the fuck?  Parker?  Duke?

                                 DUKE
                        That's right, buddy.  Surprised you
                        even recognize my voice anymore. 

                                 LARRY
                        What were you guys thinking?  I'm at
                        work.

                                 PARKER (O.S.)
                        What the fuck were you thinking?  You
                        let a girl stick two fingers in your
                        ass, then agreed to let a guy do the
                        same while another guy films it.   

                                 LARRY
                        I thought I was going to jail. 

                                 DUKE (O.S.)
                        No, 'cause luckily abandoning your
                        best friend isn't punishable by law. 
                        But it should be. 

                                 LARRY
                        I'm working seventy hour weeks!

                                 PARKER (O.S.)
                        Exactly.  So take a break, come by
                        the shop and let's get lunch. 

                                 LARRY
                        That's in twelve minutes.  I work
                        across town. 

                                 PARKER (O.S.)
                        Then let's hang out tonight. 

                                 LARRY
                        I have plans.  Maybe I can get out
                        for lunch tomorrow.  You guys are
                        assholes.  Goodbye.  
           Larry hangs up.  

           EXT. DUKE'S COMICS - DAY

           Parker locks up the shop.  A  Town Car pulls up and a well-
           dressed JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN gets out.

                                 JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
                        Excuse me, do you know where I can
                        find Mr. Bert "Duke" Dunlap. 

                                 PARKER
                        He took off, man.  Shop's closed for
                        the day. 

                                 JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
                        It's 3:30.

                                 PARKER
                            (shrugs)
                        Summer hours. 

           The Japanese Businessman hands Parker his card. 

                                 JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
                        My employer has something of urgency
                        to discuss with him.

           He turns and heads back to the car.  Parker checks out his
           card.  

                                 PARKER
                        "Watanabe Industries?"  

           He pockets the card, a slight look of concern on his face. 

           INT. PARKER'S ROOM - DAY

           Parker sits in bed, writing in his journal.  He suddenly
           rips out the page he was working on, crumples it and chucks
           it at the wall.  It bounces off. 

                                 PARKER
                        Shit off the wall. 

           He gets up to retrieve the page.  He hears something outside
           and goes to the window.  There is a house party going on
           across the street.  Parker's invitation was obviously lost
           in the mail.  He checks out the HOT GIRLS milling on the
           porch, drinking beers. 

           A car pulls up and a bunch of FRATTY GUYS get out, among
           them...Larry.  He says something that makes the group crack
           up.  They all head inside.  
           Parker is gut punched.  He throws his whole journal against
           the wall.  

           EXT. TACO STAND - DAY

           Larry and Parker eat at a table.  There's a tense silence. 
           Larry chews his taco.

                                 LARRY
                        I remember these tasting better. 

                                 PARKER
                        What, they're not as good as college
                        tacos?  Do they serve college tacos
                        with pussy and beer? 

                                 LARRY
                        What's your problem?

                                 PARKER
                        No problem.  I'm feeling great.  Had
                        a big night last night.  Went to
                        this house party...tons of jerkoffs. 
                        Wore my v-neck sweater.  It was
                        awesome. 

                                 LARRY
                        Cool. 

                                 PARKER
                        I didn't actually go to a party, and
                        I don't own a v-neck!  But you did,
                        and you do. 

                                 LARRY
                        So what?  I went to a party. 

                                 PARKER
                        You told me you had "plans."

                                 LARRY
                        Those were the plans. 

                                 PARKER
                        And you didn't invite me?  It was
                        across the street from my house. 

                                 LARRY
                        You hate parties.  

                                 PARKER
                        I'm a fucking party machine.  Turn
                        me on and I'll party all night long.   
                                 LARRY
                        Steven Wexler was there.

           Parker goes red. 

                                 PARKER
                        You partied with the guy who sat on
                        our faces in the shower junior year? 

                                 LARRY
                        He sat on your face. 

                                 PARKER
                        It was your face by association.  We
                        were a team!  
                            (beat)
                        And now we're nothing. 

                                 LARRY
                        You're taking this way too seriously. 

                                 PARKER
                        Whatever.  This is gonna make the
                        drive down to Comic-Con this week
                        pretty awkward. 

           Larry takes a long sip of water. 

                                 LARRY
                        There might be an issue with Comic-
                        Con. 

           Parker stops mid-bite.  Lowers his taco. 

                                 PARKER
                        Choose your words carefully, Larry. 

                                 LARRY
                        I can't get the days off.  One of
                        the other interns has a family
                        emergency and I need to cover for
                        him. 

                                 PARKER
                        Fuck his family and their emergency. 
                        Fake sick.  Tell them you got Edelmen-
                        Horberger.

                                 LARRY
                        I don't even know what that is. 

                                 PARKER
                        It's a rare blood disease.  I saw it
                        on "House." 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PARKER (CONT'D)
                        He cured it in like four days.  That
                        gives you enough time to get to the
                        Con and back. 

                                 LARRY
                        Parker, I can't do it.

                                 PARKER
                        I had the perfect summer planned,
                        but you had to fuck it in the throat. 

                                 LARRY
                        I did not fuck your summer in the
                        throat. 

                                 PARKER
                        Yes, you did!  It was a beautiful,
                        innocent summer.  My summer looked
                        like Taylor Swift.  
                            (stands up, gesturing)
                        And you grabbed the back of it's
                        head, and you - 
                            (thrusting)
                        Fucked.  It.  In.  The.  Throat! 

           Other DINERS look over. 

                                 LARRY
                        Dude...chill out.

                                 PARKER
                        Oh, I'm chill.  But I'll tell you
                        what, this is gonna break Duke's
                        heart.  And I'm not gonna tell him. 
                        You are.  

                                 LARRY
                        I haven't even seen Duke since I've
                        been back.

                                 PARKER
                        That's right, the guy who was there
                        when my dad passed away, when your
                        parents got divorced.  The guy who
                        told you it was okay when you were
                        jerking off twice a day to She-Hulk
                        comics.  The only guy who gave a
                        fuck about you, besides me, before
                        you grew that shitty goatee.  And
                        you haven't even stopped by to see
                        him. 

                                 LARRY
                        It's a musketeer.
                                 PARKER
                        Let's go. 

                                 LARRY
                        I'm not done eating.

                                 PARKER
                        I think you are. 

           Parker dumps Larry's tray in the trash.  

           EXT. DUKE'S COMICS - DAY

           Parker marches Larry toward the shop. 

                                 LARRY
                        Come on, man.  This is stupid. 

                                 PARKER
                        You brought it on yourself. 

           Parker slows as he notices a black corvette parked across
           the street from the shop.  He looks closer and realizes it
           is actually a corvette limo.  Sitting in the back is  

           A YOUNG JAPANESE-AMERICAN MAN

           He has long emo bangs and wears aviator shades.  We catch
           Parker's worried look reflected in his shades before the
           tinted back window rolls up.

                                 LARRY
                        Is that - 

                                 PARKER
                        I think it is.

           Parker hurries inside the shop. 

           INT. DUKE'S COMICS - DAY

           The guys enter and look around.  It's empty.  

                                 PARKER
                        Duke?  

           There's a loud commotion in the back office. 

                                 DUKE (O.S.)
                        Up yours, kimosabe!

           Two Japanese Businessmen hurry out of the back office,
           followed by Duke, wearing a pair of steel replica Wolverine
           claws and screaming -  
                                 DUKE
                        I'll slice your shit up all over
                        this place!  I'm not scared!  These
                        comics are all in protective covers!

           The Japanese Businessmen knock over a rack of comics as Duke
           chases them out of the shop.  He slams the door behind them
           and flips the sign to "closed."

           In a rage, Duke whirls around and punches the life-size
           Predator statue in the nuts with one of his clawed hands. 
           The claws are razor sharp and slide up to the hilt. 
           Predator's head rolls off.  

           Duke turns to the guys, standing there, wide-eyed.  He slowly
           retracts the claws from Predator's nuts.  

                                 DUKE
                        Oh, hey Parker.  Larry.  
                            (looks at claws, embarassed)
                        I only got these sharpened for
                        security purposes. 

           Duke removes the claws and sets them down, takes a calming
           breath.  

                                 DUKE
                        Sorry you had to see me go berserker. 

                                 PARKER
                        What the hell is going on?

                                 DUKE
                        I don't know if you've been reading
                        the Journal lately.  I sure as shit
                        haven't.  But the economy's fucked. 
                        The bank that had the mortgage on my
                        shop went down like Parker's sister
                        at a Nickelback concert. 
                            (beat)
                        No offense, buddy. 

                                 PARKER
                        Why can't you just get a new mortgage?

                                 DUKE
                        Doesn't work that way.  These Watanabe
                        Corporation assholes went and bought
                        my mortgage out.  I got like a week
                        to pay it off or they get the shop. 
                        But where the hell am I supposed to
                        get 200 grand?  Ain't like anyone is
                        gonna give me loan.  
                                 LARRY
                        Why the hell does a successful
                        Japanese comic shop chain want to
                        buy out this place?  

                                 DUKE
                        Maybe on your way back into town you
                        missed those condos sprouting up
                        like weeds.  It's called market share,
                        college boy.  Condos bring people. 
                        People get jobs.  Jobs pay money. 
                        Money buys comic books.  So Watanabe
                        shuts down my shop so they can put
                        up their sanitized corporate version
                        and cash in.  Ka-ching. 

           Duke tosses them a brochure the Businessmen left behind. 
           The cover reads, "The future is looking Watanabe."  Inside
           are digital images of a polished, soulless comic shop. 
           Computer generated teenagers that look like they were designed
           on a Nintendo Wii browse the aisles. 

                                 DUKE
                        It's creepy, man.  They got dead
                        eyes.  

                                 PARKER
                        This is bullshit.

                                 DUKE
                        It's what Watanabe does.  Happened
                        to my buddy in Orange County.  Now
                        he's cleaning pools...of semen, at
                        the local peep booth. 

           Duke shows the guys to the door. 

                                 DUKE
                        You can take the rest of the day
                        off, Parker.  Hell, take them all
                        off.  

           Duke stops at the door, takes a look around his shop. 

                                 DUKE
                        The only thing I ever wanted growing
                        up was to build my own little
                        sanctuary, where like minded dudes
                        could congregate and explore groovy
                        worlds that didn't suck as much as
                        the real one.  

           Duke breaks down and begins to cry. 
                                 DUKE
                        I guess the world can be pretty hard
                        on dreamers. 

           Duke ushers the stunned guys out and shuts the door behind
           them. 

           EXT. DUKE'S COMICS - DAY

           The guys look at each other.  They hear a primal scream from
           inside the shop.  Even Larry looks affected. 

                                 PARKER
                        I gotta do something.

           Parker storms off.  Larry is torn.  

                                 LARRY
                        Hey, come on, man.  Where are you
                        going? 

           Larry takes off after him.

           INT. PARKER'S ROOM - DAY

           Larry sits on a Spider-Man beanbag in the corner.  Parker
           paces. 

                                 PARKER
                        Okay, this is where my head's at: we
                        sell unnecessary body parts and use
                        the money to invest in a high risk,
                        quick return pyramid scheme. 

                                 LARRY
                        That's another viable idea. 

                                 PARKER
                        You're the one who ruled out murder
                        for hire.  It's not like we can set
                        up a lemonade stand.  It's gonna
                        take criminal mastermind shit to get
                        the kind of money Duke needs.  I'm
                        not afraid to get my hands dirty.   

           Larry looks at his watch. 

                                 LARRY
                        If you want to get your hands dirty,
                        why don't you start jerking guys off
                        for money.  I'll go back to work and
                        you give me a status report tonight. 
                                 PARKER
                        How many handjobs would we be talking,
                        all in? 

                                 LARRY
                        Assuming you can command 50 bucks a
                        squeeze...like four thousand.   

                                 PARKER
                        Four thousand?!  Okay, now who's
                        being unrealistic?  

                                 LARRY
                        Still you. 

           Frustrated, Parker flops down onto his bed. 

                                 LARRY
                        Face it, man.  You don't know shit
                        about shit.  Pretty much the only
                        thing you know anything about is
                        comic books. 

           Something grabs Parker's attention...a flier for this year's
           Comic-Con tacked to his wall.  

                                 LARRY
                        Maybe I can help Duke put together a
                        resume or something. 

           Parker ignores him.  He gets up and pulls the Comic-Con flier
           off his wall.  Advertised on the bottom of the flier is a 

           SPECIAL VIEWING OF TERRENCE WATANABE'S PRIVATE COLLECTION  

                                 PARKER
                        You're right, Larry.  The only thing
                        I know is comic books.

           EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Parker and Larry sit at a patio table.  A tiki torch provides
           the only light.

                                 LARRY
                        You wanna rob Terrence Watanabe!?

                                 PARKER
                        That's right.  T-Wat.  Who better
                        than the motherfucker who's trying
                        to put my shop out of business?  
                            (beat)
                        You saw him outside the shop today...
                        sitting there in his corvette limo,
                        gloating like a jackass. 
                                 LARRY
                        That guy's seriously unhinged.  I've
                        seen him at the Con before.  He's
                        got Yakuza bodyguards.  You mess
                        with him, they'll floss your teeth
                        with your own ass hair.  

                                 PARKER
                        I don't care if they floss my teeth
                        with some other guy's ass hair that
                        just took a steamy dump.  I'm doing
                        it.   

                                 LARRY
                        Parker, you're not doing anything. 
                        You couldn't steal office supplies. 

                                 PARKER
                        Oh, yeah?  I stole these pants. 

                                 LARRY
                        You stole those pants?

                                 PARKER
                        Yes.  They were overpriced and I
                        liked them.  So I stole them.  Because
                        I'm a short guy and it's difficult
                        to find pants that fit.  

                                 LARRY
                        Ok.  So you're a shoplifter.  That
                        doesn't qualify you to steal valuable
                        shit.  

                                 PARKER
                        I know the Con.  I know the players. 
                        I'll come up with a plan.  Heroes
                        rise to the challenge, Larry.  And
                        Gotham is burning. 

                                 LARRY
                        Don't quote "The Dark Knight" to me. 
                        I don't live in Gotham anymore.  

                                 PARKER
                        Is this you telling me you're out? 

                                 LARRY
                        I was never in.

                                 PARKER
                        'Cause if you're not in, you're out.

                                 LARRY
                        I'm out!
                                 PARKER
                        I thought you'd say that.  So I dug
                        up this. 

           Parker takes out his wallet.  He removes a worn piece of
           paper and slams it down on the table.  Larry looks down at
           it.  It's an "IOU," crayon on construction paper, dated
           2/03/98, signed: Larry Wollarsky. 

                                 LARRY
                        Are you kidding me?

                                 PARKER
                        Third grade.  You shit your gym pants. 
                        You asked me to switch pants with
                        you because Blair Fitzgerald was in
                        our gym period and you had a crush
                        on her.  Because I was your friend,
                        I did it.  In return, you granted me
                        this all purpose IOU.  

                                 LARRY
                        You're really gonna hold me to that?

                                 PARKER
                        To this day, some people still call
                        me skid mark.  Yes, I'm gonna hold
                        you to it.  
                            (beat)
                        I get it man, you don't want anything
                        to do with me.

                                 LARRY
                        Dude, I've been - 

                                 PARKER
                        Working, I know.  But you've been
                        spending just as much time avoiding
                        me.  So when this is all done, you
                        can go your own way and I won't bug
                        you anymore.  You go be whoever you
                        want to be.  I'm cool with it.  But
                        this...right now...you owe me this.  

           After a beat, Larry reluctantly nods.  

                                 LARRY
                        Ok.  I will accompany you to Comic-
                        Con.  If there happens to be an easy
                        and relatively low risk way to rip
                        the guy off...I'll consider helping
                        you. 

                                 PARKER

                        What'd you say that rare blood disease
                        was called again?

           EXT. LARRY'S HOUSE - DAY

           Two duffel bags are tossed in the trunk of the Le Car,
           followed by a length of rope. 

                                 LARRY
                        What's that for?

                                 PARKER
                        I don't know.  Repelling.  Hoisting. 
                        Maybe tying up security guards.  

           Parker loads a step ladder into the trunk. 

                                 LARRY
                        And you need that for...?

                                 PARKER
                        For reaching shit I can't reach. 

           Larry grabs another bag.  

                                 PARKER
                        Be careful with that.  There's a
                        machete inside. 

           Larry shakes his head, carefully adds it to the trunk. 

           Parker tosses Larry the keys. 

                                 PARKER
                        You're driving. 

           INT. RENAULT LE CAR - DAY - MOVING

           The car makes a horrible whirring sound as Larry presses his
           foot to the floor to keep up with traffic.  

           Parker unzips his backpack and pulls out a laptop with a wi-
           fi card.

                                 LARRY
                        What the hell?  Did you steal my
                        dad's wi-fi card?

                                 PARKER
                        No, I left a note.
                                 LARRY
                        What'd it say?

                                 PARKER
                        "Dad, I took your wi-fi card.  And
                        your rope.  Best wishes, Larry."
                            (off Larry's pissed off look)
                        Take it easy.  I needed a way to
                        reach out to the rest of the crew.  

                                 LARRY
                        What crew?

                                 PARKER
                        You thought we were gonna do this
                        alone?  

                                 LARRY
                        No.  I thought we were gonna get
                        down there and you'd realize how
                        dumb this was. 

                                 PARKER
                        I'll tell you what's dumb...trying
                        to pull a heist alone.  You always
                        hear about two guys getting caught,
                        but you never hear about a highly
                        trained team of experts getting
                        caught. 

           Parker hits a few keys on the laptop.

                                 PARKER
                        That's why we're gonna need to fill

           INT. MARCUS' ROOM - DAY

           The walls are plastered with posters of The Incredible Hulk. 
           Propped on the bed is a Hulk stuffed doll with a karate belt
           tied around the waist.  Fitness magazines are strewn
           everywhere, with covers proclaiming, "Bigger Delts, Smaller
           Belts!" and "Ten Days and Counting to Pec Blastoff!"  
           MARCUS (19), a chubby African-American stands shirtless before
           a mirror.  He pokes his flabby pecs and silver dollar nipples.    

                                 MARCUS
                        Ten days my ass. 

           He reaches out and scoops some green body paint out of a jar
           on his dresser.  He smears it across his face and grits his
           teeth, psyching himself up.  

                                 MARCUS
                        Hulk it out, baby...come on...HULK
                        THAT SHIT OUT!  

           He grabs an old school spring chest-expander, like Josh Brolin
           used in "The Goonies," and rips a few out.  

                                 MARCUS
                        That's right!  GREEN MACHINE!  AHH!

           Winded, he goes for a final rep -

                                 MARCUS
                        Slow burn!

           He loses his grip and the chest-expander snaps shut, catching
           him in the balls.   

                                 MARCUS
                        Ahh!  Hulk smash!

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Close on a locker.  After a beat, a hooked metal wire slides
           out through the vent.  The wire finds its way to the
           combination lock, hooks around the handle and turns the lock,
           slowly cracking the combination.  The hooked wire pulls the
           lock open.  

           The door opens, revealing EUGENE (15), a tiny freshman with
           severely parted hair, crammed inside.  He slips out of the
           locker, landing ninja quiet in his moccasins.  
           He wears an oversized Green Lantern t-shirt that fits like a
           dress and slim fit black jeans that could be confused for
           leggings. 

           He takes a hit off an asthma inhaler and coolly exhales. 

                                 EUGENE
                        60 seconds flat.  They haven't
                        invented a locker that can hold me. 

           As he rounds a corner, he finds THREE JOCKS hanging out. 
           They spot him.  He freezes.  

                                 EUGENE
                        I probably should have waited another
                        minute.  

                                 JOCKS
                        You probably should have never been
                        born, Kowalski. 

           The Jocks grab him and drag him toward the lockers.  Eugene
           screams.  One of the Jocks twists his nipples.  More screams. 
           They open a locker and shove him inside. 

           One of the Jocks drops his pants.  We see Eugene's eyes
           staring out through the locker's vent. 

                                 EUGENE (O.S.)
                        Not the gas chamber!

           The Jock presses his ass against the locker's vent and rips
           ass.  We hear Eugene's desperate gags from inside. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A 25-year-old with a curly mohawk stares into camera.  This
           is WALTER RAY BOSLEY.  His eyes are intense.  He wears no
           shirt and cut-off jean shorts.

                        that you go and sell your vintage
                        Captain America helmet to get her a
                        barbed wire tattoo for her birthday. 
                        Then you pass out at the lake, and
                        she gives a handjob to the pitcher
                        for the Lockhart Mud Hens.  They're
                        a single-A team.  It ain't like she's

           Camera follows Bosley as he scales a low fence and sneaks
           into a backyard.  There's an above ground pool.  Several
           ROWDY SOUTHERN GUYS splash in it.  An OVERWEIGHT GIRL with a
           barbed wire tattoo suns herself, topless, on a raft. 

           Bosley pulls out what looks like a RC car controller.  He
           presses a button and we hear a dull thud as  

           THE SIDE OF THE POOL EXPLODES

           Everyone come sliding out, on top of each other.   

           Bosley and the O.S. CAMERAMAN crack up.  The Overweight Girl
           notices him.

                                 OVERWEIGHT GIRL
                        Walter Ray, you son of a bitch!  I
                        don't love you no more!

                                 BOSLEY
                        You don't mean that!  I was good to
                        you!

                        Go on, fuck him up. 
           The Guys take off after Bosley.  He trips and the Guys are
           all over him.  He takes a fierce ass kicking.

           The camera is put on the ground.  We see the Cameraman's

           second later.

                                 LARRY (V.O.)
                        Does Lauren even have tits? 

                                 PARKER (V.O.)
                        She's a girl, Larry.  She's got tits. 
                        And she's loyal.  She actually returns
                        my emails. 

                                                               RETURN TO:

           INT. RENAULT LE CAR - DAY - MOVING

           On his laptop, Parker drafts a Facebook message to the group. 
           The subject line reads, "The Con."  The body reads, "Meet at
           the Best Western Bayside Inn.  Room 235.  9:00 PM.  I'll
           explain everything."  He hits send.  

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           The Le Car passes beneath an exit sign for downtown San Diego.

           INT. PARKING LOT, BEST WESTERN - DAY

           The Le Car pulls into a spot.  Larry hops out. 

           INT. LE CAR - DAY

           Parker flips down the visor mirror.  He slides on his Oakley
           Frogskins.  Black with reflective orange lenses.  The shit.  

                                 PARKER
                        You can do this. 

                                                            MATCH CUT TO:
           Parker, in Frogskins, faces camera. 

                                 PARKER
                        So, what do you think? 

           We're in -

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, BEST WESTERN - NIGHT

           The crew are spread across the room.  Parker has just finished
           laying it all out.  They stare back at him, not quite sure
           what to make of this.  After a long beat -   

                                 LAUREN
                        I think those sunglasses look
                        ridiculous.

                                 PARKER
                        So does your black lipstick, Hot
                        Topic.  I meant about the heist. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Oh, the "heist."  I think you've
                        read too many comics, played too
                        many video games, and might have
                        flipped your shit.   

           Bosley rises from his seat.  He has two black eyes and a
           bandaged nose.  

                                 BOSLEY
                        I hate T-Wat just as much as the
                        next guy.  Probably never even read
                        an issue his whole life, just in it
                        for the money.  But I don't see how
                        we can just walk off with an entire
                        collection of comics.  

                                 PARKER
                        We can't.  It's impossible.

                                 BOSLEY
                        That's what I'm saying. 

                                 PARKER
                        So we're only going after one of
                        them.  His Action Comics #1. 
                        Certified 9.2.  What do you think
                        that's worth, Eugene?

                                 EUGENE
                        A million bucks. 
                                 PARKER
                        I figure we can get rid of it quickly
                        for like half that.  I take 200 for
                        the shop, the rest of you guys get
                        50 grand a piece.  For a few days
                        work.  
                            (beat)
                        Does that change anybody's mind?

           The crew exchange looks. 

                                 PARKER
                        It's not like we're breaking into a
                        bank.  There's no vault, there's no
                        guns, no tunneling involved.  It's a
                        convention center, with mall cops. 
                        The comic will probably just be
                        sitting there.  We'll sneak in at
                        night and grab it.  I could probably
                        do it myself.  I just figured since
                        I know you guys I'd cut you in on
                        the action.  Make you part of the
                        "team."

                                 EUGENE
                        I've never been a part of a team
                        before.  Do we get jerseys?

                                 PARKER
                        No.  But I will buy you one when
                        it's all over. 

                                 EUGENE
                            (coolly hits inhaler)
                        I'm in. 

                                 BOSLEY
                        Fuck it.  I got nothing to live for. 
                        Sign me up.  

                                 MARCUS
                            (cracks knuckles)
                        Shit could get stormy.  You guys 
                        might need some black thunder.

           Parker looks to The Professor. 

                                 PARKER
                        How about it?  50 grand is more than
                        enough to buy you that Professor X
                        replica wheelchair you've had your
                        eye on.  Plus, there's the issue of
                        justice being served.  Today, they're
                        taking over my comic shop.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PARKER (CONT'D)
                        Tomorrow, it could be yours.  A guy
                        like you wouldn't stand by and let
                        that happen, would he?  

           The Professor stares hard at Parker. 

                                 PARKER
                        Did you just telepathically say "I'm
                        in?"

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        I did. 

                                 LAUREN
                        You guys are idiots.  Larry, are you
                        seriously gonna be a part of this?  

                                 LARRY
                        Long story. 

                                 PARKER
                        Larry's the wheelman.  

                                 LAUREN
                        Awesome.  I'm gonna go back to the
                        real world.  See you later. 

           Lauren grabs her stuff and walks out.   

                                 PARKER
                        I'll be back.  Larry, finish up here. 

           Parker hurries after Lauren. 

           Marcus looks to Larry.

                                 MARCUS
                        Can I get the key to the mini fridge? 

           Larry shrugs, hands it over. 

           INT. HALLWAY, BEST WESTERN - NIGHT

           Parker gets to the elevator just in time to stop it.  Lauren
           stares out at him.  He takes off his sunglasses. 

                                 LAUREN
                        You're gonna get yourself and the
                        rest of those guys in a lot of
                        trouble.   

                                 PARKER
                        This is why I need you on the team. 
                        You're the voice of reason. 
                                 LAUREN
                        The voice of reason says you're
                        wasting your time. 

           Lauren moves Parker's hand away from the door.  It closes. 

           Parker shakes his head, looks over at the stairwell. 

           INT. LOBBY, BEST WESTERN - NIGHT

           The elevator opens and Lauren steps out.  Parker is already
           waiting there, panting. 

                                 LAUREN
                        That was actually pretty quick. 

                                 PARKER
                        I've been jogging a lot.  

           Parker tries to speak, struggles to catch his breath. 

                                 PARKER
                        Just give me a second. 

           Parker takes a deep breath.

                                 PARKER
                        Okay.  Listen.  I get it.  It's very
                        possible that this is a horrible
                        idea.  But I'm doing it.  So maybe
                        just hanging around and make sure we
                        don't do anything too retarded.  

                                 LAUREN
                        That's all I have to do? 

                                 PARKER
                        Yes.  Basically.  I'm also gonna
                        need you to be "the tits."

                                 LAUREN
                        Excuse me?

                                 PARKER
                        Sorry, professional slang.  You're
                        the distraction.  The eye candy that
                        has Terrence looking one way, while
                        we sneak in the other.

                                 LAUREN
                            (caught off guard)
                        So you think I'm eye candy?

                                 PARKER
                        More so than the rest of us.  
                                 LAUREN
                        That's really charming.  Thanks. 

                                 PARKER
                        Besides Larry, you're the only person
                        I really trust.  

                                 LAUREN
                        We only hang out four days a year.  

                                 PARKER
                        Yeah, but we've been doing that for
                        like eight years.  We met at our
                        first Con.  That's gotta mean
                        something to you, too.   

           Lauren considers this. 

                                 PARKER
                        It's a simple yes or no. 

                                 LAUREN
                        The yes or no part is simple, the
                        rest isn't.  

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, BEST WESTERN - NIGHT

           Parker enters to find the guys hanging out. 

                                 PARKER
                        She's in. 

           Bosley looks over from the chair he's pulled directly in
           front of the television, playing hardcore porn.  

                                 BOSLEY
                        Yeah, so is this guy...I'd say about
                        eight inches in.  What do you guys
                        think? 

           Eugene just stares at the television, mouth wide open.

           Marcus polishes off the last of the snacks in the mini fridge.  

           The Professor sips from a small hotel bottle of whiskey. 

                                 PARKER
                        This is all coming out of your shares. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, BEST WESTERN - LATER

           The guys have cleared out.  Larry lies in the queen-size
           bed, with the covers pulled up.  After a beat, Parker slides
           in next to him and shuts the lights. 
                                 LARRY
                        I can't believe you didn't get us
                        twin beds.  

                                 PARKER
                        Duke was gonna borrow his uncle's
                        van.  We were supposed to sleep there. 
                        I booked the room last minute.  

                                 LARRY
                        I can't believe you waned to sleep
                        in a van. 

                                 PARKER
                        It had a water bed. 
                            (beat)
                        Which reminds me, try not to have
                        another one of your wet dreams.

                                 LARRY
                        That was four years ago.  And it was
                        your idea to watch the "Dark Angel"
                        marathon that night.  What'd you
                        think was gonna happen?  

                                 PARKER
                        I didn't think you were gonna have a
                        nocturnal emission all over my down
                        comforter.  I mean, I didn't.

                                 LARRY
                        That's cause you jerked off when you
                        said you were brushing your teeth.

                                 PARKER
                        What are you talking about?

                                 LARRY
                        No one brushes their teeth for twenty
                        minutes.  

                                 PARKER
                        Whatever.  Just don't have another
                        one.

                                 LARRY
                        Don't worry, I haven't had a wet
                        dream in over a year.  I don't need
                        to. 

                                 PARKER
                        You're just rubbing it in, aren't
                        you?  Goodnight, Larry.
           Larry shakes his head and rolls to the other side.  They
           both drift off to sleep. 

                                                               FADE OUT:

           TITLE OVER BLACK: Thursday

           EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           From high above, we see the sprawling glass structure,
           bordering the harbor in downtown San Diego.  People swarm
           toward it.  

           INT. MAIN ENTRANCEWAY, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Comic-Con, day one.  FANBOYS and FANGIRLS of every age, from
           comic shops and arcades and sexless basements across the
           world, have converged on their Mecca.  Many have come in
           costumes that range from makeshift to incredibly intricate. 
           Some of these costumes have little to do with comic books,
           like the two guys dressed as BEETLE JUICE, or the girl dressed
           as RICHARD NIXON IN A BIKINI.        

           A MIDDLE-AGED MAN in an ill-fitting Thor costume holds onto
           a foam hammer of Mjolnir with one hand and his 5-YEAR-OLD
           SON with the other.   

           Eight TEENS in robes and leather, clutching plastic weapons,
           exchange hugs...a World of Warcraft (WoW) guild meeting in
           person for the first time.  

           INT. CONVENTION FLOOR, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Packed to capacity.  A sensory overload as loud, bright and
           frenetic as a Vegas casino.  

           Booths of varied sizes are arranged into aisles.  Each booth
           represents a different comic brand, artist, upcoming superhero
           movie, vendor selling merchandise, etc.  

           We find our crew as they make their way through the madness,
           laminated Comic-Con 4-day passes hanging around their necks.  

           Bosley and Eugene are distracted as MODELS in skimpy vampire
           outfits lure them to a booth where JENNA JAMESON promotes
           her new direct-to-video Vampirella movie.  Parker motions to
           Marcus, who corals them back into the group. 

           INT. CONVENTION FLOOR, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           At the center of the floor, three 10-foot walls form an open-
           ceilinged viewing room, with a velvet rope blocking off the
           exposed side.  
           SECURITY GUARDS in black suits, looking more like Secret
           Service than the standard convention center rent-a-cops,
           stand by the rope.  One of the Guards tallies the people who
           exit on a hand counter, controlling capacity.  The other
           lifts the rope so our crew can enter -

           INT. VIEWING ROOM, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Their ratty sneakers trod upon the plush red carpet.  They 
           come to a stop as the gang finds themselves surrounded by      

           TERRENCE WATANABE'S PRIVATE COLLECTION  

           Operatic music swells as we push in on various rare and
           valuable issues: Incredible Hulk #181 (first appearance of
           Wolverine); All-American Comics #16 (first appearance of
           Green Lantern); All-Star Batman and Robin #10 (recalled issue
           that shows Batgirl dropping the F-bomb).

           Each of the comics is kept behind a plexiglass window set
           into wall. 

           Parker makes his way over to the back wall, where he finds
           Action Comics #1, dated June 1938.  On the cover, a man in
           blue tights and a red cape lifts a car above his head.  He
           would become the most popular superhero in the world.  

           The rest of the crew amass behind Parker. 

                                 LAUREN
                        A million bucks just for that?  The
                        old stuff has no style.  A ten-year-
                        old could draw that cover. 

                                 PARKER
                        It's the most sought after comic in
                        the world.  Of the original 200,000
                        printed there are less than a hundred
                        left.  This is one of three that are
                        in very good to mint condition. 
                        Number one is part of the Mile
                        High/Edgar Church collection, sitting
                        in a vault somewhere in Sarasota. 
                        They lost track of number two when
                        the owner fled for Cuba, and it may
                        or may not even exist.  Number three
                        is staring back at you.  

                                 LARRY
                        Yeah, staring back from behind a big
                        fucking case.  Remember when you
                        said that it would probably just be
                        sitting there?  And that we could
                        just take it?
                                 PARKER
                        It looks like there might be a change
                        of plans.  

                                 LARRY
                        You can't change plans you never
                        had.

                                 PARKER
                        That's enough negativity, Larry.  

           The Professor is focused on the case. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        That plexiglass looks pretty thick.  

                                 MARCUS
                        How do you know it's plexiglass?

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        I don't.  It just makes sense that
                        it's plexiglass.  Like at a bank. 

                                 PARKER
                        This is good.  I like this.  It's a
                        challenge.  The creative juices are
                        flowing.  

           Parker looks to Eugene.

                                 PARKER
                        Think you pick the lock?

                                 EUGENE
                        What lock? 

                                 PARKER
                        I don't know, I'm assuming there's
                        some sort of lock.    

           EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Two Kawasaki Ninja crotch rockets screech to a halt in a
           loading zone right out front.  The riders wear leather racing
           jackets with dragons emblazoned on the back.  Attached to
           one of the bikes is

           A TRICKED OUT SIDECAR

           A third rider steps out of it.  He wears a leather sports
           jacket over a slim fit Magneto t-shirt.  He pulls off his
           helmet.  We recognize him as the guy we saw in the limo. 
           This is TERRENCE WATANABE (24).
           The other riders are Terrence's Yakuza bodyguards, KENJI and
           KIYOSHI.  They dismount and head for the door. 

           The crowd parts for the trio, murmurs of respect and fear
           passing through it.  

           An oblivious PARKING ATTENDANT intercepts Terrence.   

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        Hey, you can't park there. 

           Terrence glares at the Attendant.

                                 TERRENCE
                        Kenji, show him my parking pass. 

           Kenji strikes the attendant in the throat with a swift chop. 
           He gags to catch his breath.  

                                 TERRENCE
                        What's that?  I can keep my bikes
                        here? 

           The Attendant continues to gag.  Terrence gets in his face. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        Because if anything happens to them,
                        I'm coming after you. 

           The Attendant drops to the floor.  Terrence and the Yakuza
           walk over him. 

           INT. VIEWING ROOM, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           The crew is still debating - 

                                 PARKER
                        What are you talking about, Bosley? 
                        It's either a lock or not a lock.

                                 BOSLEY
                        I just think it could be something
                        else.

           Parker shakes his head.

                                 MARCUS
                        I could probably punch through the
                        lock.  Or if there isn't a lock, I
                        could punch through the not-lock.

                                 PARKER
                        Okay, that's insane.  No one can
                        punch through a lock.
                                 MARCUS
                        Are you calling me a pussy?

                                 PARKER
                        No, man.  Chill out. 

           Parker looks back at the case. 

                                 PARKER
                        We'll find out what it is, and
                        assuming it's a lock, Eugene, you
                        can pick it, right?

                                 EUGENE
                            (hits his inhaler)
                        You know it.

                                 PARKER
                        Perfect.  

           Larry spots a commotion outside the room. 

                                 LARRY
                        Looks like Terrence is on his way
                        over.  

                                 PARKER
                        All right, let's get out of here.   
                            (to crew)
                        Take the rest of the day to scope
                        out the Con.  Get a feel for the
                        layout and whatnot.  We'll meet back
                        at the hotel tonight.  

           They walk off in different directions.  Parker slips out
           through the velvet ropes just as Terrence enters with his
           Yakuza.  

           Terrence looks over his collection and the crowd waiting to
           get in.  He walks over to one of the Security Guards and
           leans in to him. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        Can you tell me something?  
                            (nods over shoulder)
                        You see that retard that's breathing
                        all over the display glass, did you
                        let him in? 

           The Security Guard looks over Terrence's shoulder.  

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Sir, I believe that young man is
                        actually retarded. 
                                 TERRENCE
                        Yeah and he's actually breathing all
                        over the glass.  Do your job, kick
                        his retarded ass out before he shits
                        on the floor or something.  And while
                        you're at it, can we round up some
                        pussy.  It's embarrassing.    

           The Security Guard goes to say something, but sees the Yakuza
           and thinks better of it. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I'll, uh, see what I can do, Mr.
                        Watanabe.

                                 TERRENCE
                        Don't see.  Do.

           EXT. CONVENTION FLOOR, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Parker sips from a large fountain soda as he heads to the
           back corner of the convention floor, where SHADY VENDORS
           hawk comics from makeshift tables.  If the rest of the
           convention floor is the Vegas strip, this is Fremont street,
           a glimpse of what Comic-Con was before it went corporate. 

           Parker approaches a table manned by a SEEDY DUDE (50s), with
           a greased comb over, a Members Only jacket and a gold watch. 

                                 PARKER
                        Excuse me, are you Pawnshop Jack?

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        Guilty as charged.  What are you in
                        the market for, kid?  Got it all for
                        a price.  Non-licensed action figures. 
                        Russian reprints of your favorite
                        stuff. 
                            (lowers voice)
                        Got nude illustrations.  I'm talking
                        Poison Ivy and Catwoman double teaming
                        Captain America.  Very patriotic.  I
                        also got a lot of Archie, that's all
                        legit though.  

                                 PARKER
                        Actually, I just came to ask you a
                        question.  

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        You got a question, go to a panel. 

                                 PARKER
                        I'm a friend of Duke's.  He told me
                        you guys went back.  
                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        The Duker?  No shit.  He helped me
                        get clean.  You might have a hard
                        time believing this, but I used to
                        be a man with a questionable moral
                        compass.   
                            (beat)
                        So what's on your mind?

                                 PARKER
                        Just a story Duke told me.  Comic-
                        Con '78.  Warner Brothers premiered
                        the Superman trailer.  That night,
                        an original Superman suit they had
                        on display went missing.  Never turned
                        up.

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        Yeah, sure, everyone knows that story. 

                                 PARKER
                        Duke also mentioned that you had
                        something to do with it.  

           Pawnshop gives a small smile, revealing a gold tooth. 

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        That's just a vicious rumor.

                                 PARKER
                        Let's say, hypothetically, you had
                        that suit right now.  Who would you
                        unload it to?

           Pawnshop looks around, warily.  

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        You some kinda 21 Jump Street?  You
                        know, if I ask you if you're an
                        undercover cop you gotta tell me,
                        right?  

                                 PARKER
                        I'm not a cop.  It's not like that. 
                        Duke's in trouble.  I'm just trying
                        to help him out. 

           Pawnshop considers this. 

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        Okay, well, seeing as how you're
                        helping out a mutual friend and all...  

           Pawnshop takes out a crappy Archie Comic and slides it across
           the table.  The price tag reads, "$100." 
                                 PARKER
                        This thing isn't worth a dollar. 

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        The information you want is built
                        into the price.  I'm still running a
                        business here. 

           Parker reluctantly hands over the cash. 

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        So there's this guy I know...got
                        deep pockets and a serious inclination
                        for black market Superman merch. 
                        Name's Valeri Bupkin.  Ukrainian mob
                        guy.  Hasn't missed a Con...not since
                        '78. 

                                 PARKER
                        Where do I find him?

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        Same place you'll find anyone else
                        worth finding tonight.  The opening
                        night party at the Hard Rock. 

                                 PARKER
                        Can you get me in? 

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        I can't get myself in.  

           Parker nods.  

                                 PARKER
                        Thanks for the help. 

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        Good luck.  A man who helps his
                        friends is all right in my book. 
                        Next time you come around I'll give
                        you the family discount on those
                        nudies.   

           Parker finishes his fountain soda, tosses it in the trash
           and walks off. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, BEST WESTERN - NIGHT

           The crew have reconvened.  Parker and The Professor look
           over Lauren's shoulder as she sketches out a very simplistic
           set of convention center blueprints.  
                                 PARKER
                        So if we go through the roof, can we
                        just drop in down one of those vents?  

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        Do you have climbing gear?  Harnesses?

                                 PARKER
                        I have some rope. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        You'd need a lot of rope. 

                                 PARKER
                        I can get some more rope. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        If you have enough rope, I don't see
                        why not.  I think I got a lead on
                        how to figure out the security specs. 
                        So we'll know more tomorrow.  

           Bosley approaches Parker.

                                 BOSLEY
                        Can I talk to you for a second?

                                 PARKER
                        Sure.

           Parker and Bosley step aside. 

                                 BOSLEY
                        You seem like a guy who knows about
                        a lot of stuff.  So here's what I'm
                        wondering.  You ever measure your
                        dick?

                                 PARKER
                        What does that have to do with
                        anything?

                                 BOSLEY
                        It has to do with how big your dick
                        is. 

                                 PARKER
                        I don't know if I feel comfortable
                        with the way this conversation is
                        going. 

                                 BOSLEY
                        Listen, my old lady said that my
                        dick was small.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOSLEY (CONT'D)
                        But I'm pretty sure it's average. 
                        So please, I need this.

           Parker shrugs

                                 PARKER
                        I guess it's average. 

                                 BOSLEY
                        Okay, cool.  So I'll put you down
                        for four inches. 

           Parker does a double take as Bosley jots something down then
           goes over to talk to Marcus. 

           Parker checks his watch, turns to the rest of the group.

                                 PARKER
                        The Hard Rock party starts in an
                        hour.  Where are we on how to get
                        in?

                                 LARRY
                        I came up with some ideas.  

                                 PARKER
                        Let's have it. 

                                 LARRY
                        You could blow the doorman, blow a
                        guy who knows the doorman really
                        well, or blow a guy who knows a guy
                        who knows the doorman.

                                 PARKER
                        Excellent contribution, Larry.

                                 EUGENE
                        Just bribe them.  Money talks.

                                 BOSLEY
                        Yeah, you just got to introduce them
                        to your friend George Washington. 

                                 PARKER
                        We don't know enough George
                        Washingtons.  Not for a party like
                        this. 

                                 MARCUS
                        To get up in the club, you gotta be
                        rich or famous.  Since we clearly
                        ain't rich - 
           Parker smiles. 

                                 PARKER
                        We gotta be famous. 

           INT. HARD ROCK HOTEL - NIGHT

           Mötley Crüe pumps from the hotel's sound system.  Marcus
           ushers people out of the way as Parker and Larry, in their
           best clothes, enter the lobby.  

                                 MARCUS
                        Move along, motherfuckers.  Nothing
                        to see here. 

           Marcus pushes a RANDOM GUY with his back to them. 

                                 MARCUS
                        I said nothing to see. 

           The group continue toward the Moonstone Lounge, where a swank
           party is underway.  A few PAPARAZZI and FANS hang around,
           waiting for celebrities.

           Parker slides on his Frogskins as they step up to a Suge
           Knight looking BOUNCER at the door.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Sunglasses at night kinda guy?

                                 MARCUS
                        Yo, my clients are on the list. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        I thought I saw "scrawny ass white
                        boy plus one" on there.  

                                 PARKER
                        What is this, open mic night?

           Before the Bouncer can get tough with the guys -

                                 LAUREN (O.S.)
                        Oh my god, it's them!

           The Bouncer turns to see Lauren waving a "Marry Me" sign at
           the guys like a crazed fan.  

           Marcus turns to the Bouncer.

                                 MARCUS
                        You might wanna call five-o.  We got
                        a restraining order on that one. 
                        Sent my man here a sandwich bag full
                        of pubic hair.  
           Suddenly, Bosley and Eugene jump out from the pack of
           Paparazzi and circle Parker and Larry, snapping pictures
           with their cheap digital cameras.   

                                 MARCUS
                        Goddamnit.  Shit's turning into Rome
                        all over again. 

           Marcus gets in Bosley and Eugene's faces. 

                                 MARCUS
                        I will break those cameras!

                                 EUGENE
                        You don't threaten the National
                        Scholastic Press!

                                 MARCUS
                        And you don't step to a brother with
                        a short fuse!  

           Marcus raises his fist.  Bosley and Eugene fall back, still
           snapping shots.

           Marcus turns to the Bouncer.

                                 MARCUS
                        Can we hurry this up? 

                                 BOUNCER
                        Who the hell are these guys? 

                                 MARCUS
                        You fucking with me?  They're internet
                        celebrities.
                            (gestures to Parker)
                        This here is the Star Wars Kid.  You
                        know, with the golf ball retriever
                        as a lightsaber.  Don't tell me you
                        ain't seen that shit on Youtube. 
                        Got a billion hits.  People in thatch
                        huts in Kenya were peeping it.   

           The Bouncer squints at Parker. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        That kid was fat with glasses. 

                                 PARKER
                        You never heard of puberty?  Contact
                        lenses? 

                                 BOUNCER
                        Well, who's this other guy?
                                 MARCUS
                        That's Nutshot Kid.  Shot his ball
                        off with a paintball gun.  The Youtube
                        video is gonna drop next week.  It's
                        gonna be viral like Ebola.  Probably
                        have his own reality TV show.   

                                 LAUREN (O.S.)
                        I want you inside me, Star Wars Kid!

           The Bouncer looks the guys over. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Come on, man.  Hercules is waiting
                        to get in.  

           Behind the guys, KEVIN SORBO waits impatiently with a HOT
           DATE.   

                                 BOUNCER
                        All right, you're in.  

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           A CONVENTION COP sits on a bar stool, a couple sheets to the
           wind.  He throws back a shot.  

           The bar door opens and The Professor rolls in.  He glides up
           next to the Convention Cop and signals to the BARTENDER.

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        Cuervo.  Make it a dos. 
                            (to Convention Cop)
                        Work hard, party hard.  

                                 CONVENTION COP
                        Amen to that.

           The Convention Cop takes another shot.  

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        Nice uniform.  I'm on the job myself. 

                                 CONVENTION COP
                        Where do you patrol?  

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        I just started at the Nordstroms
                        Rack, down at the mall.  

                                 CONVENTION COP
                        My old beat.  Still a pretty "dark
                        area."
                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        Uh, how do you mean?

                                 CONVENTION COP
                        You know, the "fast ones."  Swipe a
                        pair of Karl Kanis and make like the
                        breeze.  

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        Oh, yeah. 
                            (taps his wheelchair)
                        I'm pretty fast, too, though.

                                 CONVENTION COP
                        I bet you are, wheels.  How 'bout I
                        get you a beer?

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        Why not?  You get this round.  I'll
                        get the next.

           The Convention Cop orders a couple drinks.  The Professor
           adopts a tougher demeanor. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        So where you busting heads now? 

                                 CONVENTION COP
                        Down at the convention center.

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        Wow, the big show.  Days or nights?

                                 CONVENTION COP
                        Little bit of both.  

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        I bet the nights are a cakewalk. 
                        Lots of hanging out.  Playing cards. 
                        Putting cameras in the women's
                        bathroom.  Right?

           INT. MOONSTONE LOUNGE, HARD ROCK HOTEL - NIGHT

           Parker and Larry head into the sleek bar.  It's packed with
           Comic-Con elite: artists, comic industry executives, movie
           stars (heavily skewed toward the B- and C-lists).  

           At a booth, Terrence and his Yakuza sit with the two Japanese
           Businessmen.  

                                 TERRENCE
                        Any word on the shop in Oxnard?
                                 JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
                        They won't sell. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        What's the deal with their mortgage? 

                                 JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
                        Fully paid off. 

           A WAITRESS brings over a tray of three flaming shots. 
           Terrence grins. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        Do they have fire insurance?

           The Japanese Businessmen exchange a look.  Terrence throws
           back one of the flaming shots.  

           EXT. PATIO, MOONSTONE LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Parker and Larry wander outside, where plush couches are
           arranged around fire pits.  Parker spots -  

           VALERI BUPKIN (50s), a bull of a man, sitting in a prime
           location.  He is surrounded by UKRAINIAN MOB THUGS and a
           bevy of YOUNG GIRLS.  Lots of leather jackets, slicked hair,
           tits and vodka.

                                 PARKER
                        There he is. 

                                 LARRY
                        Are you sure? 

                                 PARKER
                        Yeah, I Googled him. 

                                 LARRY
                        You said he was a collector. 

                                 PARKER
                        What kind of collector did you think
                        was gonna buy a stolen comic?  Just
                        keep your mouth shut and try to look
                        crazy. 

           Parker and Larry walk toward Valeri's table.  One of the
           Thugs stops them.   

                                 UKRAINIAN THUG 1
                        What do you want? 

                                 PARKER
                        I want to talk to Mr. Bupkin.
                                 UKRAINIAN THUG 1
                        Talk about what?

                                 PARKER
                        Our mutual friend...
                            (loudly)
                        ...Superman. 

           Valeri hears this and slowly stands.  He waves Parker over. 
           The Thug steps aside and Parker approaches.  

           Nestled beneath the thick tangle of hair on Valeri's chest
           is a gold Superman medallion embossed with diamonds.  He
           notices Parker staring at it.   

                                 VALERI
                            (thick accent)
                        Do you like?  I took this from the
                        man they call the Shaq.  He thinks
                        he is "man of steel," but in my
                        country that is what they call me,
                        because when I was a boy my father's
                        enemies filled me with steel.  But I
                        lived to put every last one of them
                        in their grave.

                                 PARKER
                        They call me Parker.  I have several
                        nicknames but none of them are
                        flattering.   

                                 VALERI
                        Tell me, "Parker," what do we have
                        to discuss? 

                                 PARKER
                        Just a comic book.  A very rare
                        Superman comic book that I may have
                        my hands on in the next few days.  

                                 VALERI
                        How rare?

                                 PARKER
                        The rarest.

           Valeri's interest is piqued.

                                 VALERI
                        How are you going to get it?

                                 PARKER
                        The more pertinent question is, do
                        you want to buy it?
           Valeri looks over at Larry, who twitches nervously. 

                                 VALERI
                        Tell your friend to calm down, he
                        looks crazy. 

                                 PARKER
                        He is crazy.

                                 VALERI
                        How much do you want for the comic?

                                 PARKER

                                 VALERI
                        That's a good price.  We have a deal. 

           Valeri holds out his hand.  Before Parker can take it -

                                 VALERI
                        But you should know, when someone
                        enters into an arrangement with me,
                        they deliver...exactly what they
                        promised.  Or else. 

                                 PARKER
                            (tentative)
                        Or else?

                                 VALERI
                        Let's just leave it at "or else."
                        Why would we want to spoil the party
                        with threats of tearing off your
                        arms and beating you to death with
                        them?

                                 PARKER
                        Good point, it's a pretty nice party. 

           Parker looks to Larry, who is twitching wildly and clearly
           shaking his head "no."  Parker turns back to Valeri and shakes
           his hand. 

           EXT. HARD ROCK HOTEL - NIGHT

           Parker and Larry wait for their car by the valet stand.

                                 LARRY
                        I was signaling you "no!"  Didn't
                        you see my signal?

                                 PARKER
                        I must have missed it.  
                                 LARRY
                        Now if you mess up we're dead!  Both
                        of us!

                                 PARKER
                        I work better under pressure. 

                                 LARRY
                        You've never worked under pressure. 

                                 PARKER
                        But every time I've worked without
                        pressure, it hasn't been any good. 
                        So either I work good under pressure
                        or I don't work good.  

                                 LARRY
                        Jesus Christ.  I can't take this.

           Larry hunches over, hyperventilating.  Parker massages his
           shoulders.

                                 PARKER
                        Deep breaths, Larry.  Deep breaths. 
                        There's nothing to worry about. 
                        Saturday night we're gonna sneak in
                        there and we're gonna waltz out with
                        that comic.  

           Larry stands up.  Parker continues with the massage.

                                 LARRY
                        You can stop rubbing my shoulders.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, BEST WESTERN - NIGHT

           Larry and Parker lie in bed with the lights off, both of
           them wide awake.  After a beat -  

                                 PARKER
                        You gotta admit.  It was kinda fun
                        pulling one over on the bouncer at
                        the Hard Rock.

                                 LARRY
                        Yeah, we spent a lot of years not
                        getting into that party. 
                            (beat)
                        I saw Lucy Lawless.  She looked pretty
                        good. 

                                 PARKER
                        I saw Alyssa Milano. 
                                 LARRY
                        Nice.  

                                 PARKER
                        Man, I need to get laid. 

           Larry nods.  A beat passes. 

                                 LARRY
                        You know, I was looking at Lauren
                        when said she "wanted Star Wars Kid
                        inside her."  She was pretty
                        convincing.  It was almost like she
                        wasn't even acting.  

                                 PARKER
                        Maybe she's got a thing for that
                        Star Wars Kid. 

                                 LARRY
                        Or maybe she wants you to give her a
                        bone job.  
                            (off Parker's look)
                        I'm just saying.  

                                 PARKER
                        Lauren doesn't strike me as the type
                        of girl who thinks about bone jobs. 

                                 LARRY
                        They all think about bone jobs. 

           Larry grabs his phone, flips through the pictures and hands
           it to Parker.  

                                 PARKER
                        Who's that?  

                                 LARRY
                        Yu Lee.

                                 PARKER
                            (shocked)
                        Really?  She looks like a totally
                        normal looking Asian chick.  

           Larry takes his phone back.

                                 LARRY
                        Yeah, she is a totally normal looking
                        Asian chick. 

                                 PARKER
                        I was expecting Tera Patrick. 
                                 LARRY
                        I don't know what made you think
                        that.

                                 PARKER
                        Wishful thinking?

           Larry laughs.

                                 LARRY
                        Well, she's really cool and I like
                        her a lot.  

                                 PARKER
                        And she's a freak in the sack, right? 

                                 LARRY
                        Good night, Parker.

                                 PARKER
                        Good night, Larry. 

                                                               FADE OUT:

           TITLE OVER BLACK: Friday

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, BEST WESTERN - DAY

           Parker, in a Best Western embroidered bathrobe, sits in an
           armchair.  He picks up his cell phone and dials.   

                                                           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. DUKE'S COMICS - DAY

           Duke sleeps on the floor of the shop, which is partially in
           boxes.  His cell phone rings.  He wakes up with a start.  He
           looks awful.    

           Duke rummages around for the cordless phone, finally reaches
           into a bag of Funyuns and pulls it out. 

                                 DUKE
                        Hello...?  

                                 PARKER (O.S.)
                        Duke, man, it's me.  I was just
                        checking up on you. 

                                 DUKE
                        Oh, hey, Parker.  I'm cool.  It's no
                        big thing.  I was never really gonna
                        kill myself. 

           Parker jumps up from his chair. 
                                 PARKER
                        Wait, was suicide even on the table? 

                                 DUKE (O.S.)
                        No, I told you, I'm not gonna do it. 
                        I'm not gonna kill myself.  Even
                        though the only alternative is to
                        ride on back to El Paso and tell my
                        parents they were right.  That I was
                        just a loser all along.   

                                 PARKER
                        It's gonna be okay, Duke?  
                            (beat)
                        Duke, are you there?  

           Duke stares blankly ahead, totally in his own depressed world.  

                                 PARKER (O.S.)
                        Duke?

                                 DUKE
                        Sorry.  I've just been eating a bunch
                        of Funyuns lately and not getting
                        much sleep.  

                                 PARKER (O.S.)
                        It'll all be over soon.

                                 DUKE
                        I thought we already decided I'm not
                        killing myself. 

                                 PARKER (O.S.)
                        Listen, I'm working on a solution to
                        this whole thing.  So just hang tight,
                        buddy. 

                                 DUKE
                        Okay, "bro wonder."  Over and out. 

           Duke hangs up the phone and places it back in the bag on
           Funyuns. 

           INT. DINING ROOM, BEST WESTERN - DAY

           A premium continental breakfast spread.  Coffee, muffins,
           cereal, the works.  HOTEL GUESTS dig in. 

           Our crew are huddled at a back table, food and the blueprints
           Lauren drew spread out.    
                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        So, according to the guard I talked
                        to last night, there are few more
                        security precautions in place than
                        we might have initially thought. 

           The Professor places various pieces of cereal on the
           blueprints. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        The Cap'N Crunch are the guards. 
                        There are ten of them on the night
                        crew, and they run overlapping
                        rotations.  The Coco Puffs are motion
                        detectors, they're at every entrance,
                        including the ventilation shafts.     

           As he places pieces of Golden Grahams on the blueprints - 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        There are also security cameras here,
                        here...and here. 

                                 EUGENE
                        What are the Fruity Pebbles in that
                        corner?

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        The Fruity Pebbles are just Fruity
                        Pebbles. 

           Marcus looks up from a huge bowl of Fruity Pebbles.

                                 MARCUS
                        My bad. 

           He scoops up the cereal and puts it back in his bowl. 

           Parker takes in the cereal covered blueprints, then looks up
           at The Professor.

                                 PARKER
                        So you can, like, take out all these
                        security systems, right?

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        How exactly do you mean "take out?"

                                 PARKER
                        I mean hack in, take them off line. 
                        With like a computer virus.  Or a
                        worm.

           The Professor looks at him blankly. 
                                 LARRY
                        He's not a fucking cyber criminal,
                        Parker.

                                 PARKER
                        Thanks, Larry.  But The Professor is
                        actually supposed to be our technical
                        expert.  I think he can speak for
                        himself. 
                            (to Professor)
                        So can you do it?

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        I really want to say yes.  
                            (beat)
                        But that would be a gigantic lie.   

           Parker's face drops. 

                                 MARCUS
                        You're the one who said this was
                        gonna be a cakewalk.  This place is
                        like Fort Knox.  

                                 LAUREN
                        No, it's like a regular Bank of
                        America, but it's way more than we
                        can handle.  

           Parker glares at Lauren.  She shrugs.

                                 LAUREN
                        I'm just being the voice of reason. 

                                 PARKER
                        Thanks everybody.  My good friend
                        Duke is probably gonna swallow a
                        bullet sometime this afternoon, so I
                        think I'm gonna just go back to Simi
                        Valley and see if I can say goodbye
                        in time.  

           Parker stands up. 

                                 BOSLEY
                        What if we just blow up the power? 

           Parker stops. 

                                 PARKER
                        I'm into blowing up the power.

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        You guys mean "cut" the power, right?
                                 BOSLEY
                        I figured we'd just blow it up. 
                        But, yeah, can we cut it?

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        I can actually probably do that. 
                        But the backup generator comes on in
                        90 seconds.  The first thing it does
                        is send a signal to emergency
                        services.  Cops and fire department
                        show up two minutes later. 

           The crew all look to Parker.  He shrugs.

                                 PARKER
                        Okay.  It's something.  It's a start.
                        I gotta go back to the Con and take
                        another look.  Try to figure this
                        out. 

           INT. VIEWING ROOM, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           In sunglasses and a cap, Parker enters the viewing room.  
           He pulls his cap low as he passes -  

           Terrence, who locks in on a SPOKESMODEL from erotic comic
           label Eros Comix.  She's a tiny blonde with a rack, wearing
           a shirt she may fall out of at any second.  He approaches
           with a smile. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        So what do they call you, baby?

                                 SPOKESMODEL
                        Vageena Davis.

                                 TERRENCE
                        Clever.  Those titties are certainly
                        in a "league of their own."

                                 VAGEENA DAVIS
                        Hey, I'm not some skank.  I'm in
                        nursing school.

                                 TERRENCE
                        You're wearing double stick titty
                        tape.  You're a skank.  You just happen
                        to be in nursing school. 

           Vageena Davis goes to slap Terrence.  Kiyoshi appears, as if
           from nowhere, and grabs her hand before she connects. 
           Terrence grins at her.
                                 TERRENCE
                        You think I pay these guys a million
                        Yen a week to let me get slapped by
                        some dumb broad?  

           Terrence nods and Kiyoshi drags her away. 

                                 TERRENCE
                            (calling after)
                        Give her the room number in case she
                        changes her mind. 

           Terrence's attention shifts back to the viewing room.  He
           notices Parker, who, despite his efforts to appear "casual,"
           looks incredibly suspicious.  Terrence turns to Kenji. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        You see that nerd...everyone else is
                        looking at the comics.  He's looking
                        at the room.  I don't like that. 

           Parker takes in the details around him...the crowd, the
           Security Guard yawning, the JANITOR wheeling a garbage can. 
           He looks back at Action Comics #1, his eyes tracing the
           outline of the plexiglass safe. 

                                 TERRENCE (O.S.)
                        It can all be yours... 

           Parker turns to find Terrence standing behind him.

                                 TERRENCE
                        ...for a million and a half bucks.  
                            (takes a step toward Parker)
                        I paid 600.  It’s worth a million. 
                        I won’t sell it for under a million
                        and half.  That's how you create
                        your own price. 

                                 PARKER
                        I'm more of a Batman fan myself.

                                 TERRENCE
                        So you'd rather get your hands on a
                        Detective Comics 26?

                                 PARKER
                            (correcting)
                        Detective 27.

                                 TERRENCE
                        Whatever.
                                 (MORE)
                                 TERRENCE (CONT'D)
                            (beat)
                        You know my biggest beef with the
                        Caped Crusader?  It isn't that he’s
                        a rich, indulgent playboy.  I think
                        we share that in common.

                                 PARKER
                        Don't even say it's because he doesn’t
                        have powers.

                                 TERRENCE
                            (chuckles)
                        No.  
                            (suddenly serious)
                        Take off your 'Skins.  I like to
                        look people in the eyes.  

           Parker reluctantly slides off his Frogskins. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        My biggest problem with Batman is
                        that I had three perfect copies of
                        Detective Comics 66, first appearance
                        of - 

                                 PARKER
                        Two-Face. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        That's right.  So I held onto them
                        until after "The Dark Knight" came
                        out, hoping for a spike...nothing. 
                        I flipped them for a few grand more
                        than I paid.  Barely covered the
                        inflation.

                                 PARKER
                        Comic collecting isn't all about the
                        money. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        What's it about then?  Reading them
                        so you can escape your pathetic life? 
                        I don't need to.  My life is awesome. 
                        I ride a Segway around my living
                        room.  I own three kimono dragons. 
                        Dane Cook did stand up at my birthday
                        party...he gave me his home phone
                        number and Blackberry pin.  You see,
                        everything is about money.  You're
                        either making it, or you're putting
                        yours in someone else's pocket.  
                            (beat)
                        I bet you still own a lot of pogs. 
                                 PARKER
                        A few. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        I don't own any.  I sold all my pogs
                        right before the market crashed.  I
                        had a mint gold slammer, never used,
                        sold if for 200K.  Today, you couldn't
                        give it away.  Comics aren't as
                        volatile.  Which is good.  You can't
                        put your whole load in risky
                        investments.  You have to hedge your
                        bets.  I know a guy in lightsabers,
                        he's been getting killed since they
                        released that shitty "Clone Wars"
                        movie.  It's a blood bath.  That's
                        why I keep my hands in many pots. 
                        It's how I built my empire. 

                                 PARKER
                        I have a lot of things cooking myself. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        Busy man.  Well, I wouldn't want to
                        keep you any longer.    

           Terrence indicates that Parker is dismissed.  Parker throws
           on his sunglasses and heads off.  He glances back at Action
           Comics #1...smiles. 

           Terrence’s Yakuza appear by his side.

                                 TERRENCE
                        Kick up some dirt, see what you can
                        find out about the nerd.  

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, BEST WESTERN - DAY

           The crew is anxiously assembled around Parker. 

                                 PARKER
                        I figured out a way to bypass all of
                        the security and get us into position
                        to grab the comic...
                            (beat)
                        We're gonna pull the heist during
                        the day. 

           The crew exchange confused looks. 

                                 LARRY
                        Are you insane?  What about the 40
                        thousand eye witnesses?
                                 PARKER
                        Not eye witnesses...distractions.  

           As Parker lays out his plan, we -

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, BEST WESTERN - LATER

           The guys file out.    

                                 PARKER
                        See you tomorrow morning.  Have your
                        game faces on. 

           Parker shuts the door. 

           Larry drops an Alka Seltzer into a cup and watches it fizzle.   

                                 PARKER
                        You okay, man?

                                 LARRY
                        Yeah, I just get this way whenever
                        I'm planning to cause a mass hysteria
                        at a public event. 

                                 PARKER
                        You'll be okay.  You're the driver. 
                        Worst case scenario you just drive
                        away and I do a stint in juvie.

                                 LARRY
                        Dude, you're not a minor.  They'll
                        throw you in a real jail.  You'll
                        end up holding onto some hardened
                        con's pocket. 

                                 PARKER
                        What does that even mean?

                                 LARRY
                        In prison if you hold someone's
                        pocket, you're their bitch.  It's
                        not even sexual.  It's more of a
                        power thing.  I read about it on
                        Wikipedia.

           Parker looks at Larry for a long beat. 

                                 PARKER
                        I guess I always thought of myself
                        as a minor. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PARKER (CONT'D)
                            (thinking)
                        Huh?  So I could wind up going inside
                        without ever "knowing a woman?" 

                                 LARRY
                        It's looking more and more possible. 

                                 PARKER
                        Remember when you said that stuff
                        about Lauren? 

                                 LARRY
                        What stuff?

                                 PARKER
                        You know...bone jobs, and wanting me
                        inside her and stuff.

                                 LARRY
                        Yeah, what about it. 

                                 PARKER
                        Well, maybe I should ask her out. 

                                 LARRY
                        You probably should have asked her
                        out a long time ago.  She's a cool
                        chick.  She reads comics.  You read
                        comics.  

                                 PARKER
                        I see where you're going with this. 
                        Active imagination.  She probably
                        gets down like crazy.  

                                 LARRY
                        No, I'm saying you guys have a lot
                        in common.  And she only knows you
                        at the Con.  This is your home turf. 
                        You're not the guy who got his face
                        sat on in the showers.  It's like
                        when I went away to college, I got
                        to leave all that high school bullshit
                        behind.  

           Parker nods. 

                                 PARKER
                        I like this little pep talk.  Tell
                        me I'm looking good tonight. 

                                 LARRY
                        You are looking better than 90 percent
                        of the guys here. 
                                 PARKER
                        That's all I needed to hear. 

           INT. HALLWAY, HOTEL - NIGHT

           Parker knocks on a door at another hotel.  His hair is neatly
           parted and he has a nice shirt on.  Lauren answers.  She
           looks him over.  

                                 LAUREN
                        What's up?  Is everything okay. 

                                 PARKER
                        Everything is magical. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Why are you dressed like a date
                        rapist?

                                 PARKER
                        I actually dress like this quite
                        often.  You know, casual parties and
                        that sort of thing.  Drinks with
                        friends.  

                                 LAUREN
                        Oh, cool. 

                                 PARKER
                        I mean, you're a friend.  We could
                        have a drink sometime.  Like now.    

                                 LAUREN
                        I was about to go to sleep. 

                                 PARKER
                        Oh...okay.  

           Parker turns to leave. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Fuck it, I hear the bar downstairs
                        really sucks.  We should check it
                        out. 

           INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

           Parker and Lauren sit at a booth.  The bar is empty and, in
           fact, really sucks.  They are two or three Bud Lights deep.  

           Lauren sketches on a bar napkin with a small pencil.  She
           hands it over to Parker.  He looks over at the FRIENDLY OLD
           MAN tending bar, then at her sketch of the guy as a creepy,
           grinning villain, spiking drinks.   
                                 PARKER
                        This is pretty good.  Do they have
                        actual classes at art school where
                        they teach you how to make normal
                        shit look really creepy and
                        depressing?    

                                 LAUREN
                        I go to an art school in Baltimore. 
                        We're predisposed to making shit
                        depressing.  Our biggest export is
                        violent offenders.   

                                 PARKER
                        But you gotta have fun sometimes. 
                        Kick back.  Hang with friends.  Dudes. 
                        Attractive dudes.    

           Parker tries to give a confident smile.

                                 LAUREN
                        Are you into attractive dudes?

                                 PARKER
                        I, uh, just meant they're probably
                        trying to hang with you a lot.  You
                        know, because you're such a cool
                        chick.   

           Lauren is slightly taken back, fumbles awkwardly -   

                                 LAUREN
                        Thanks...I mean, yeah, that's pretty
                        much how it is.  All the time.  Hot
                        dudes.  
                            (beat)
                        But I bet you deal with the same
                        thing.  All those cute girls at the
                        shop.  You being in a position of
                        power.  Controlling the new issues.  

                                 PARKER
                        No.  Our female clientele is somewhere
                        around five percent, and that's only
                        because Duke started selling Hannah
                        Montana trading cards.  But I bet
                        some of those girls are gonna grow
                        up with a serious crush on me. 

           Lauren smiles. 

                                 LAUREN
                        I bet they will. 
                                 PARKER
                        That would be a safe bet to take. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Totally. 

                                 PARKER
                        You know it. 

           They both look down at their empty drinks, then at each
           other...brimming with sexual tension but both clueless how
           to make the next move. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, BEST WESTERN - NIGHT

           Parker and Larry lay in bed together. 

                                 LARRY
                        What do you mean you froze up?

                                 PARKER
                        I mean I fucking stared at her for
                        like five minutes.  At least five
                        minutes.  And I didn't say shit. 
                        Then this old bartender totally
                        cockblocked me and closed up. 

                                 LARRY
                        He closed up!?  That's the ultimate
                        in!  You should have given him
                        commission on your virginity.

                                 PARKER
                        I fucked up, man.  I fucked up.  She
                        probably thinks I'm a gigantic pussy. 

           Parker rolls over. 

                                 PARKER
                        It's just lame, because I've planned
                        out this whole perfect heist, but my
                        private life is in shambles.  Private
                        life, I got nothing.  Heist, I got a
                        full house. 

                                                               FADE OUT:

           TITLE OVER BLACK: Saturday...1:00 AM

           A BARE LIGHT BULB 

           It swings on a wire, illuminating the bruised and bloody
           face of Pawnshop Jack.  
           We're in - 

           INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           Pawnshop is tied to a metal chair that is bolted to the floor. 
           The blur of a roundhouse kick whips through the air and
           connects with his face, snapping his head back.  

           Kenji and Kiyoshi hover above him, yelling in Japanese.  He
           spits out a thick wad of blood and cracks a smile. 

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        My daddy was a Marine.  He hit me
                        harder than that when he was sober. 

           A door opens and Terrence enters, paces before him.  

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        You the guy that's gonna tell me
                        what this is about?

                                 TERRENCE
                        Information.  People tell me that if
                        something suspicious goes down at
                        Comic-Con, you're the man to talk
                        to.  And I believe something
                        suspicious is going down.  So tell
                        me about the nerd in the Frogskins. 

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        I don't know no nerds.  

                                 TERRENCE
                        The convention security cameras would
                        beg to differ. 

           Terrence bends down and picks something up off the floor...a
           gold tooth.  He puts it in Pawnshop's front pocket and pats
           it.  

                                 TERRENCE
                            (gestures to Yakuza)
                        These guys were Seagal's sparring
                        partners on "Urban Justice."  They
                        can go all night and they have no
                        conscience.  Or you can walk out of
                        here right now, go to KFC, get a
                        bucket of thighs, watch some scrambled
                        porn and cry yourself to sleep. 
                        Wouldn't that be swell?

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        But I'm having so much fun.  

           Kiyoshi says something to Terrence in Japanese.
                                 TERRENCE
                        Sure, cut off his balls.   

           The Yakuza unbuckle Pawnshop's pants and pull them off.  He
           screams.  

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        Are you really gonna cut my balls
                        off over a comic book!?

           Terrence shakes his head at Pawnshop, sitting there in his
           underwear, terrified.  

                                 TERRENCE
                        It's hardly a fair trade, considering
                        how worthless your balls are.  But
                        let me be clear, I'd kill you over a
                        comic book.  I'd rape you're mom
                        over a comic book.  I'd push "the
                        button" over a comic book. 

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        What button?

                                 TERRENCE
                        The nuclear button.  Because that's
                        the only way you win.  By doing fucked
                        up shit that other people are afraid
                        to do. 

           Terrence says something Japanese to Kenji.  He pulls out a
           butterfly knife, whips it around in a flourish, then swipes
           at Pawnshop's crotch -     

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        Wait!

           The blade stops an inch from impact.  

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                            (grudgingly)
                        I'll tell you what I know. 
                            (beat)
                        His name's Parker.  He came around
                        asking me how to unload some hot
                        Superman merch.  Something big.  I
                        gave him a name...Valeri Bupkin. 
                        That's it. 

           Terrence shakes his head.

                                 TERRENCE 
                        Superman?  That little shit thinks
                        he can steal my comic and unload it
                        to that fat Ukrainian fuck. 
                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        Apparently. 

           Terrence goes to leave, he stops, looks back at the Yakuza. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        He can keep his balls.  But kick the
                        shit out him.  

           As the Yakuza close in on Pawnshop - 

                                 PAWNSHOP JACK
                        You dirty, double-talking Chinaman!

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, BEST WESTERN - DAY

           Parker stands before the crew. 

                                 PARKER
                        We have a day until the heist. 
                        Everyone has their checklist.  You
                        all know what you have to do.  Don't
                        fuck anything up, and if you get
                        caught in the field disavow all
                        knowledge of the heist.  
                            (beat)
                        Any questions?

           Eugene raises his hand. 

                                 EUGENE
                        I need three hundred bucks for the
                        masks. 

           Parker rummages through his wallet. 

                                 PARKER
                        I've got a hundred.  Negotiate. 

           INT. HOME DEPOT - DAY

           Bosley navigates the aisles with a shopping cart.  He stops
           and dumps some fertilizer into his cart.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Bosley puts the fertilizer on checkout counter.  He smiles
           at the overweight REGISTER GIRL who bears a striking
           resemblance to his ex.   

                                 BOSLEY
                        You sorta look like someone I used
                        to know.  Actually, we dated for a
                        while.  It ended poorly. 
           The Register Girl looks at him for a beat, then at the
           suspicious items in the cart.  

                                 REGISTER GIRL
                        What are you, making some explosives
                        to blow up her house?

                                 BOSLEY
                        Can't a guy just be serious about
                        lawn care?

           The Register Girl starts ringing up the items. 

                                 BOSLEY
                        You guys don't sell diesel fuel, do
                        you?

           EXT. SHADY HOUSE - DAY

           Eugene knocks on the front door.  A twitchy ANARCHIST, in
           camo pants and no shirt, answers. 

                                 EUGENE
                        Are you The Goat?

                                 ANARCHIST
                        Are you ComicDude95?  

           Eugene nods, nervously. 

                                 ANARCHIST
                        Follow me, ComicDude95. 

           The Anarchist turns around, revealing a huge satanic goat
           tattoo on his muscled back. 

                                 EUGENE
                        Holy shit. 

           INT. SHADY HOUSE - DAY

           Eugene follows the guy.  The place is trashed.  Eugene stops
           suddenly.  Two naked GOTH GIRLS are passed out, intertwined
           on the ratty couch.  

                                 EUGENE
                        Holy shit. 

           The Anarchist turns around, finds Eugene staring.

                                 EUGENE
                        Is that a dildo?

                                 ANARCHIST
                        Yes.  That's a dildo.   
                                 EUGENE
                        Holy shit. 

                                 ANARCHIST
                        Let's go. 

           INT. KITCHEN, SHADY HOUSE - DAY

           Eugene and the Anarchist enter.  The Anarchist reaches into
           the fridge, takes out a nitrous cartridge and cracker.   

                                 ANARCHIST
                        Whippit?

                                 EUGENE
                        I'm trying to quit. 

           The Anarchist cracks the nitrous cartridge into a balloon
           and takes a huge pull off of it.  He exhales and stares at
           Eugene.  His face is crazily red. 

                                 EUGENE
                        About those goggles...? 

                                 ANARCHIST
                        All business.  I get it. 

           The Anarchist gets up and pulls two pairs of cheap night
           vision goggles from a cabinet.  Eugene looks them over.  One
           has what may be blood splattered on one of the lenses. 

                                 ANARCHIST
                        You got the cash? 

           Eugene reaches nervously into his pocket. 

                                 EUGENE
                        I was hoping there was some room
                        to...negotiate.  I only have a hundred
                        bucks. 

           The Anarchist suddenly gets right in Eugene's face and stares
           at him for a long, terrifying beat.

                                 ANARCHIST
                        I just looked into your soul.  You're
                        not lying.  You only have a hundred
                        bucks.  The goggles are yours.  Go. 

           Eugene hands over the cash and heads off with the goggles

                                 ANARCHIST
                        Wait.

           Eugene freezes. 
                                 ANARCHIST
                        Just so you know, I'm gonna have to
                        give you less than positive feedback
                        on your eBay account over this. 

                                 EUGENE
                        Uh...fair enough. 

           Eugene turns and books out of the room. 

           INT. GOLD'S GYM - DAY

           The Professor and Marcus enter, both decked out in tank tops,
           headbands and workout belts.  

           The Professor wheels over to the weight rack and does a few
           curls.  Marcus jumps rope.  

           After a beat, they make sure that no one is watching them,
           then head into the locker room.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM, GOLD'S GYM - DAY

           The Professor and Marcus make small talk, while a few
           WEIGHTLIFTERS change nearby.   

                                 MARCUS
                        I think I tore my pec maxing out. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        But you gotta lift through the pain,
                        right?

                                 MARCUS
                        Always. 

           The Weightlifters head out.  Marcus and The Professor
           immediately start opening various lockers and rummaging
           through them.  

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        I sort of feel bad doing this. 

                                 MARCUS
                        You know how many times motherfuckers
                        stole shit from me at the gym?  It's
                        karma. 

           Marcus finds a black suit. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Jackpot. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        I can't find anything. 
                                 MARCUS
                        The locker room is like a Marshall's. 
                        They got everything, but it's all
                        irregular.  And it may have some
                        dude's sweat on it.  

           The Professor finally pulls out a workman's uniform. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        Got it. 

           The guys dump the clothes into a gym bag and take off. 

           EXT. EMPTY PARKING LOT - DAY

           Larry looks out the driver side window of a rented cargo
           van. 

                                 LARRY
                        Is this even necessary?

           Parker stands nearby with a stopwatch.  There's a cone course
           laid out before the van. 

                                 PARKER
                        Yes.  You need to be prepared for
                        all situations.  Let's say they get
                        a chopper on us.  I'm not saying
                        it's gonna happen, but what the fuck
                        do I know. 
                            (clicks stopwatch)
                        Go!

           The cargo van peels out.  Larry runs over every cone.  He
           skids to a stop and looks back at Parker.  He actually has a
           smile on his face. 

                                 LARRY
                        That was kinda fun.

                                 PARKER
                        Of course it was fun.  You've been
                        sitting at a desk with a bunch of
                        engineers all summer.  
                            (beat)
                        But you also just put a slow moving
                        12-year-old in the hospital.  He was
                        gonna be a doctor, Larry.  Now he's
                        roadkill.  

           Larry shakes his head. 

                                 PARKER
                        I gotta run.  Try it in reverse,
                        then meet me at the Con.
           Larry proceeds to murder the course in reverse.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Parker knocks on the door to Lauren's hotel room.  She
           answers.  There's a charged beat between them.  Parker hands
           over a shopping bag. 

                                 PARKER
                        So are you still cool with this? 
                        'Cause I don't want to throw you in
                        there with that asshole if you're
                        not cool with it.

                                 LAUREN
                        Yeah, I mean, this thing is gonna be
                        a whole lot harder if Terrence and
                        those two psychopaths are hanging
                        around.  
                            (beat)
                        So I just go in there and, like,
                        talk it up with him? 

                                 PARKER
                        Nah, he'll find you.  He hits on
                        everything that crosses his path.  
                            (nods to bag)
                        Also, that should help. 

           Lauren opens the bag and peeks inside.  

                                 LAUREN
                        That is not the PG-13 version of
                        Wonder Woman. 

                                 PARKER
                        No it is not.

           Parker awkwardly checks his watch. 

                                 PARKER
                        I'll, uh, see you over there in a
                        few. 

           INT. CONVENTION FLOOR, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Parker and Larry walk through the crowd.  They stop at a
           comic vendor and each grab a comic, using them to conceal
           their faces as they scope out Terrence's viewing room. 

                                 LARRY
                        Where is she?

                                 PARKER
                        Give her a minute.  
           Parker scans the crowd.  After a beat, his eyes go wide -

                                 PARKER
                        I think I found her...

           Lauren emerges from the crowd in the Wonder Woman costume. 
           She fills out every inch of the outfit, to an almost
           pornographic degree.  Our guys were not expecting this.

                                 LARRY
                        I guess she is "the tits."

           The Fanboys around Lauren gawk and trip over each other as
           she crosses the convention floor.  

           We PUSH IN on Parker's stunned face as - 

           Warrant's strip club anthem "Cherry Pie" kicks in.  Lauren
           strikes a sexy pose, unfurls her Lasso of Truth and cracks
           it.  She executes a series of acrobatic dance moves involving
           the whip, culminating in her extending her tongue to lick
           it.  Before her tongue can connect -      

                                 LARRY (O.S.)
                        Parker.

           Larry shakes Parker out of his daydream.  Lauren passes a
           few feet from them and winks as she heads for the viewing
           room. 

           INT. VIEWING ROOM, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Lauren stands in front of one of the comics.  After a beat,
           we see Terrence's reflection in the plexiglass case.  He
           blatantly checks out her ass, most of which is on full
           display.

                                 TERRENCE
                        Wonder Woman, huh?

           Lauren turns around. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Can I help you?

                                 TERRENCE
                        You can.  See, I was "wondering"
                        what that costume would look like on
                        the floor of my Axl Rose suite at
                        the Hard Rock.    

           Lauren makes a slight move -

           Kenji suddenly appears and shoots a hand up to block a
           slap...that never comes.  
           Lauren just tucks her hair behind her ear.  Terrence slowly
           lowers Kenji's hand. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        She's cool.  This kitten doesn't
                        bite...unless you ask her to. 

           Lauren holds back a chuckle. 

                                 LAUREN
                        I don't know if I'm ready for the
                        Axl Rose suite.  Maybe you should
                        just take me to dinner. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           BINOCULAR POV 

           Lauren and Terrence eat dinner at an outdoor restaurant.  We
           see them chatting and laughing.  The POV lingers on Lauren's
           cleavage. 

           INT. CARGO VAN - NIGHT

           Bosley puts down the binoculars.  He takes a deep breath,
           then goes in for another quick look.  He drops the binoculars
           and turns back to the other guys.  

                                 BOSLEY
                        How come no one told me that Lauren
                        was from Kansas City? 

           The guys all chuckle, except for Parker, who looks a bit
           uncomfortable. 

                                 EUGENE
                        I think I saw her last year at the
                        Cannes film festival. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        Come on, guys, let's be serious here. 
                            (beat, grins)
                        It's not like she's curing cancer or
                        anything. 

           Parker jumps up. 

                                 PARKER
                        All right, you guys are breaking
                        every rule of surveillance right
                        now.  Can we just keep it down?  Act
                        like professionals? 
                                 LARRY
                        Yeah, sure, I'm a professional. 
                        I'll keep an eye on Lauren. 

           Larry goes for the binoculars.  Parker snatches them. 

                                 PARKER
                        You guys have all lost binocular
                        privileges.

           The guys groan.  Parker looks through the binoculars.  Lauren
           is still laughing with Terrence.  Parker looks slightly off
           put.  They get up to leave. 

           INT. HALLWAY, HOTEL - NIGHT

           The elevator doors open and Lauren steps out.  Parker is
           camped out on the floor by the elevator bay, surrounded by
           soda cans and junk food wrappers.  

                                 PARKER
                        You put on a pretty convincing
                        performance tonight with T-Wat.  The
                        laughter, the smiles...the hair
                        touching. 

                                 LAUREN
                        He made me check out his Axl Rose
                        suite.  Showed me the crucifix jacuzzi
                        and tried to "knock on heaven's door."   

           Parker swallows back his jealousy.

                                 PARKER
                        I'll assume you didn't, since this
                        is a serious operation we're running
                        here.

                                 LAUREN
                        Parker, don't be an idiot. 

                                 PARKER
                        Is everything cool for tomorrow? 

                                 LAUREN
                        He's taking me to lunch in Pacific
                        Beach. 

                                 PARKER
                            (grudgingly)
                        Good job. 

           Lauren turns to walk off, stops. 
                                 LAUREN
                        Thanks for waiting up for me. 

                                 PARKER
                            (flustered)
                        Well, uh...you know, like I said,
                        serious operation. 

           Lauren turns backs and heads to her room, a smile creeps
           across her face...Parker watches her go, a smile creeps across
           his. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, BEST WESTERN - NIGHT

           Parker and Larry lie in bed together.  They're both wide
           awake.  Silent.  Nervous. 

                                                               FADE OUT:

           TITLE OVER BLACK: Sunday

           EXT. DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO - DAY

           The cargo van cuts through early afternoon traffic as slick
           music plays. 

           INT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           In SLO-MO the crew enter, exchange subtle nods, then each
           break off in their own direction. 

           INT. CONVENTION FLOOR, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           From high above we find Lauren, making her way through the
           crowd and into Terrence's viewing room.  

           INT. OPERATIONS CONTROL ROOM, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           A row of flat-screen monitors display live feed from the
           security cameras around the convention center.  A lazy Guard
           keeps watch.

           There's a knock at the heavy security door.  The Guard opens
           it.  No one's there.  He hears someone loudly clear their
           throat and looks down to find The Professor in his wheelchair,
           dressed in the stolen workman's uniform and a "San Diego Gas
           & Electric" cap with a shaggy wig beneath it.

           "In character," The Professor speaks with an unconvincing
           Southern accent.

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        The boss man told me to swing by.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 THE PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
                        We've been noticing some spikes on
                        our end.  I think y'all might have
                        an overheated unit in Bay Two.

                                 GUARD
                        I didn't get a call about that.

           The phone rings in the background.  The Professor smiles.

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        Told ya.

           INT. VIEWING ROOM, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Terrence greets Lauren with an eager kiss on the cheek.  He
           shows her off to some Comic-Con VIPs that mill about.  

           Waiting near the front of the line for the viewing room is
           Bosley in a baggie hoodie and a backpack.  He speaks into a
           headset hidden beneath his hood. 

                                 BOSLEY
                        "Tits" have been deployed.  And they
                        are looking perky.   

           INT. MEN'S ROOM, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           In a stall, Parker zips up a pair of coveralls.  He talks
           into his headset.  

                                 PARKER
                        That was very unprofessional.  I'll
                        be in position in ten. 

           INT. CONVENTION FLOOR, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Eugene looks up from a issue of Spider-Man, as Terrence and
           Lauren leave the viewing room and head toward the exit.  The
           Yakuza forcibly part the crowd for them. 

                                 EUGENE
                            (into headset)
                        They're on the move. 

           Eugene twirls a lock pick in his fingers.  

           INT. VIEWING ROOM, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Marcus, in his stolen suit, casually approaches one of the
           Security Guards standing by the entrance.  

                                 MARCUS
                        Chief said you could take a break. 
                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Who the fuck is the chief? 

                                 MARCUS
                        The motherfucker in charge.  Now get
                        lost.  

           The Security Guard looks him over. 

                                 MARCUS
                        You don't wanna take a break, I'll
                        take you're break.  I'll take your
                        break all day long.  'Til the break
                        of dawn.  Motherfucker. 

           The Security Guard shakes his head. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I don't need this shit. 

           INT. CARGO VAN - DAY

           Larry is parked near the convention center.  He nervously
           drums his fingers on the steering wheel.  He turns on the
           radio.  The Clash's cover of "I Fought the Law" plays. 

                                 THE CLASH
                        "Breakin' rocks in the hot sun. 
                        I fought the law and the law won."

           He absentmindedly starts singing along, then realizes what
           he's saying and quickly kills the radio. 

                                 LARRY
                        Be cool, Larry.  Be cool. 

                                 PARKER (O.S.)
                            (from Larry's headset)
                        What's the status?

           Larry jumps.  He takes a moment to compose himself, then 
           looks out his window toward the convention center entrance. 
           He sees Lauren and Terrence hop into a limo and pull away,
           flanked by the Yakuza on their bikes.  

                                 LARRY
                            (into headset)
                        We have clear skies.  I repeat, we
                        have clear skies.  I'm heading to
                        the loading bay.   

           Larry pulls the van into gear. 
           INT. OPERATIONS HALLWAY, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           The Guard leads The Professor along.

                                 GUARD
                        I think Bay Two is right over here.

           They turn a corner.  The wheels of The Professor's chair
           butt up against a set of long narrow stairs, at the top of
           which is the door to Bay Two.  He looks up at the Guard.

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        Is this some kinda joke, pal?

                                 GUARD
                        I don't know.  I never been back
                        here.

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        Well, this sure as shit ain't up to
                        code.  You better get your boss,
                        'cause this stinks a' law suit to
                        me.
                            (off the Guard's dumb silence)
                        Well, git!  Ain't like I'm gonna
                        crawl up there!

           The Guard reluctantly heads off.  Once he's gone, The
           Professor quickly wheels down the hall to a door marked
           "Electrical Room."  

           INT. VIEWING ROOM, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Marcus stands on one side of the entrance.  He glances over
           at the Security Guard at the other end.  

                                 MARCUS
                            (into headset)
                        I'm in position.

           Bosley stands by Action Comics #1.  He looks up at it.  The
           light glints off its plexiglass case.  

                                 BOSLEY
                            (into headset)
                        Me, too.  

                                 EUGENE (O.S.)
                            (from headset)
                        I'm here. 

                                 PARKER (O.S.)
                            (from headset)
                        Professor, are we a go?
           INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           The Professor hurriedly sort through a confusing tangle of
           wires. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                            (into headset)
                        I'm gonna need a minute. 

           INT. VIEWING ROOM, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Bosley looks around to make sure no one is listening. 

                                 BOSLEY
                            (into headset)
                        While we're just waiting around,
                        shooting the breeze, I gotta ask you
                        all a question.  
                            (beat)
                        How big are your dicks?  

                                 PARKER (O.S.)
                            (through headset)
                        Jesus Christ, man.  Everyone's
                        average, okay. 

                                 BOSLEY
                        Fine.  I'm average myself.  I was
                        just checking.  

                                 EUGENE (O.S.)
                            (through headset)
                        I might be slightly below average
                        because I'm short...so like, seven.  

                                 BOSLEY
                            (into headset)
                        What!?  The average is four!

                                 LARRY (O.S.)
                            (through headset)
                        The average is six. 

                                 BOSLEY (O.S.)
                            (through headset)
                        That's bullshit.  I can't work with
                        a bunch of guys rolling around with
                        horse cocks. 

           INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           The Professor sorts out the wires.  He removes a pair of
           wire cutters.
                                 THE PROFESSOR
                            (into headset)
                        I hate to interrupt the pillow talk,
                        but we're ready in three...two...

           INT. VIEWING ROOM, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Marcus cracks his knuckles.

                                 THE PROFESSOR (O.S.)
                            (from headset)
                        One.  Lights out. 

           Marcus charges across the room and tackles the other Security
           Guard.  As they roll around on the ground, Marcus notices a
           crowd gathering around him.  

                                 MARCUS
                            (into headset)
                        What the hell!?  Lights are not out! 
                        Lights are not out! 

           The Guard shoves Marcus off of him.  

                                 PARKER (O.S.)
                            (from headset)
                        What's going on!?

           INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           The Professor frantically cuts any wire he can get his hands
           on. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                            (into headset)
                        I don't know.  Maybe I fucked up. 
                        Or maybe there's some sort of -

           INT. VIEWING ROOM, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           The Guard throws a right cross at Marcus. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR (O.S.)
                            (from headset)
                        - delay.

           As the Guard's fist connects with Marcus face -

           THE LIGHTS GO OUT

           The convention center is thrown into complete darkness. 
           People cry out in confusion.

           Bosley flicks on a flashlight and holds it in his teeth.  He
           whips a collapsible stepladder out of his bag, opens it and 
           quickly mounts it.  He takes out a drill and drills four
           holes in the wall.  He fills each hole with a homemade
           explosive cartridge and wires them together. 

           He jumps down off the stepladder and starts herding people
           away from the wall.  

                                 BOSLEY
                        Get back!  

           Bosley presses a small remote. 

                                 BOSLEY
                            (into headset)
                        Mayhem in three... 

           ...two...one...boom!  A terrific flash in the darkness.  The
           wall shudders.  

           Pandemonium breaks out from the explosion, people knocking
           into each other and screaming in the darkness.

           Bosley shines the flash light at the wall.  The plexiglass
           safe with the comic hangs loosely in the cracked wall.  Bosley
           shakes his head, then rushes the wall and slams it with his
           shoulder. 

           The safe shakes loose falls out the back side of the wall... 

           INT. CONVENTION FLOOR, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           ...and onto the floor.  A trash barrel is wheeled up next to
           it.  Parker, in janitorial coveralls and night vision goggles
           hoist the safe inside. 

           Eugene, also in goggles, hops inside the trash barrel and
           gets to work on the lock.  Parker checks his stopwatch. 

                                 PARKER
                        You got 60 seconds until the lights
                        come on.  

           Parker frenetically pilots the trash barrel through the
           panicked crowd.  We see his POV through the shitty night
           vision goggles as he dodges obstacles. 

           Inside the barrel, Eugene struggles to keep his hands steady
           as he is rocked back and forth. 

                                 PARKER
                        How are you doing in there?

                                 EUGENE
                        I think I'm gonna throw up. 
                                 PARKER
                        The safe!  How's the safe!?

                                 EUGENE
                        I've never even seen a lock like
                        this!

                                 PARKER
                        I thought you could pick any lock. 

                                 EUGENE
                        I've seen like five types of locks. 
                        I can pick all of those. 

                                 PARKER
                        Just figure it out!  In the next 45
                        seconds!  

                                 EUGENE
                        This is a bad heist.  This is a very
                        bad heist.  We should have dug a
                        tunnel.  We should have come in
                        through the roof. 

           Parker gets to the end of an aisle and skids to a stop.  A
           display has been knocked over, blocking the path.  It's
           impossible to move as everyone pushes for the doors. 

           Parker whips the barrel in another direction. 

                                 PARKER
                            (into headset)
                        The west exit isn't an option.  We
                        can't make it to the loading bay. 
                        We're headed out the front door. 

           INT. CARGO VAN - DAY

           Parked by the loading bay, Larry fumbles to put the van in
           gear. 

                                 LARRY
                            (into headset)
                        What?  No!  I'm in position. 

                                 PARKER (O.S.)
                            (from headset)
                        You gotta change your position! 

           Larry peels out.

           INT. CONVENTION FLOOR, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Marcus and Bosley book down an aisle.  They spot Parker and
           catch up beside him.  They hurry toward the light of an exit.
                                 PARKER
                        15 seconds. 

           Inside the barrel, Eugene just starts pounding on the lock. 

           As they close in on the exit - 

           EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           The van skids to a stop out front.  

           INT. CONVENTION FLOOR, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           The generator kicks in and the lights come on.  The panic
           subsides as people get their bearings.  

           By the exit, we find a trash barrel with a pair of coveralls
           and the open safe inside.  

           EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           The guys stroll to the cargo van.  They slide open the door
           and hop inside. 

           INT. CARGO VAN - DAY

           Larry pulls away from the convention center.  Sirens whir as
           emergency vehicles head for the convention center.  

           INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - DAY

           Lauren and Terrence dine at a private table.  Her phone
           vibrates.  She opens it to a text message, "We got it."  She
           smiles, discreetly. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        More zinfandel?

                                 LAUREN
                        Please. 

           Terrence tops off Lauren's glass. 

           A beat later, Terrence's phone vibrates.  He opens it to a
           text message, "They got it."  He grins.   

           Lauren sips her wine. 

                                 LAUREN
                        I have to use the bathroom. 

           Lauren gets up and crosses the restaurant.  She checks to
           make sure that Terrence is not watching, then passes the
           bathroom and turns into -
           INT. KITCHEN, FANCY RESTAURANT - DAY

           Lauren slips past the KITCHEN STAFF and out a back entrance. 

           EXT. BACK OF FANCY RESTAURANT - DAY

           The cargo van is parked in the alley.  Lauren hops in. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, BEST WESTERN - DAY

           The crew celebrate.  Bosley shakes up a bottle of champagne
           and sprays Eugene, who shrieks like a girl.  

           Marcus finds 50 Cent's "In Da Club" on the stereo and jacks
           up the volume.  He tries to dance with Lauren, who gamely
           goes along with it. 

                                 MARCUS
                            (rapping along with song)
                        "Go, go, go shawty.  It's your
                        birthday.  We gon' party like it's
                        yo birthday." 

           Parker leans back in his chair and smiles at the festivities. 
           The Professor wheels up next to him.  He holds the copy of
           Action Comics #1. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        It really is beautiful. 

                                 PARKER
                        I know.

           The Professor looks at the comic for a long moment, then,
           sadly - 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        It's the best fake I've ever seen. 

           Parker blanches. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        The ink gave it away.  It's
                        indistinguishable to the naked eye,
                        but I scanned in the cover and ran a
                        check.  It's definitely a fake. 

                                 PARKER
                        I don't get it. 

           The phone rings.  Parker looks over at it.  He warily picks
           it up.  

                                 TERRENCE (O.S.)
                        Hello, Parker.
                                 PARKER
                        Who is this?

                                 TERRENCE (O.S.)
                        I believe you know who this.  You
                        just don't want to know. 

           Parker signals for Larry to cut the music.  

                                                           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. AXL ROSE SUITE, HARD ROCK HOTEL - DAY

           Terrence lounges in his crucifix jacuzzi, talking on a
           speakerphone.  

                                 TERRENCE
                        How's my comic book? 

                                 PARKER (O.S.)
                        You tell me. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        Oh, that's right.  You didn't steal
                        my comic book.  You stole the forgery
                        I switched out.  Don't throw it away
                        or anything.  It's worth 100 bucks. 

           The crew are now gathered around the other phone, listening
           in on the conversation. 

                                 PARKER
                        What now?

                                 TERRENCE (O.S.)
                        Now I sell my comic to your buyer,
                        then collect the insurance on the
                        one you "stole."  I win twice.  You
                        just lose. 

           Terrence wildly air punches in victory. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        You go to the cops, you say a word
                        to anyone, and I show them the tapes
                        I made of you planning the heist.  I
                        was there the whole time, you idiot. 
                        I let you walk off with that comic.

           Parker drops his head, defeated. 

                                 TERRENCE (O.S.)
                        And if that skank is with you, tell
                        her I enjoyed making out with her
                        and feeling her left tit. 
                                 PARKER
                        Screw you, T-Wat!  

           Terrence climbs out of the jacuzzi.  He walks over to the
           floor-to-ceiling windows surrounding him and looks out on
           the city.  He has a tribal dragon tattoo on his ass. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        Right now I'm standing butt naked,
                        twelve stories above downtown San
                        Diego.  What are you doing? 

           Terrence presses a button and disconnects the call.  He grabs
           a remote and turns on the stereo.  50 Cent's "In Da Club"
           picks up where the our crew's party left off. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, BEST WESTERN - DAY

           Parker still clutches the phone, shell shocked.  Larry takes
           it from his hand and hangs it up. 

           Eugene looks guiltily at Parker.

                                 EUGENE
                        I didn't pick the lock. 

                                 PARKER
                        What do you mean? 

                                 EUGENE
                        It couldn't pick it.  And then I
                        realized...it was unlocked.
                            (beat)
                        I thought we were just lucky.

                                 PARKER
                        We weren't lucky.  We got conned. 

                                 BOSLEY
                        We were supposed to be the ones doing
                        the conning.     

                                 MARCUS
                        Everything we did was bullshit.  And
                        now Comic-Con is over.  We don't
                        even got the money.  I'm out of here. 

           Bosley, Euegene and Marcus head out.  The Professor slowly
           follows behind them.  At the door, he stops and looks back
           at Parker. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        I really thought we'd pulled it off. 
                                 PARKER
                        We almost had. 

           The Professor turns around and wheels off. 

           A somber Lauren and Larry remain. 

                                 PARKER
                        I don't know where I went wrong. I
                        was just trying to save the shop 

                                 LAUREN
                        You did the best you could.  No one
                        got hurt.  No one got arrested. 

                                 PARKER
                        And that's some kinda accomplishment? 

           Parker takes out his wallet, removes Larry's IOU.  He looks
           at it, then hands it to Larry. 

                                 PARKER
                        You're a free man.
                            (beat)
                        I gotta make a call. 

           Parker walks out. 

           INT. HALLWAY, BEST WESTERN - DAY

           Parker takes out his cell phone and dials as he paces in the
           hallway. 

                                                           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. DUKE'S COMICS - DAY

           The shop is completely packed up.  The phone rings and rings. 
           The answering machine picks up. 

                                 DUKE  (O.S.)
                            (on answering machine)
                        You've reached Duke's Comics.  We
                        are currently out of business.  At
                        the beep, please tell me what your
                        hopes and dreams are.  I will promptly
                        write them on a slip of paper, then
                        wipe my ass with them.  Because this
                        is a cruel and evil world.  BEEP.

           EXT. POOL, BEST WESTERN - NIGHT

           Parker sits on a lounge chair and stares out at the empty
           pool.  Lauren approaches. 
                                 LAUREN
                        So what now?

                                 PARKER
                        Nothing.  You were right, I guess. 
                        From the beginning.  This was just a
                        dumb idea. 

                                 LAUREN
                        You know what I think now?

                                 PARKER
                        What?

                                 LAUREN
                        I think you've probably got at least
                        a few hours before T-Wat sells that
                        comic. 

                                 PARKER
                        So what?  How am I supposed to get
                        it?  

           Lauren shrugs.  She hands Parker his Frogskins.  

                                 LAUREN
                        I'm just the voice of reason. 

           Parker looks down at the sunglasses. 

                                 PARKER
                        What if I mess it up again?  

                                 LAUREN
                        You won't.  

                                 PARKER
                        But I -

           Lauren leans in and kisses Parker.  They break apart. 

                                 LAUREN
                        You ever watch the old Batman TV
                        series?  

                                 PARKER
                        Yeah, sure. 

                                 LAUREN
                        In every episode with the Joker,
                        Batman would try to stop him, but
                        wound up tied to a chair wired to
                        some kinda bomb.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LAUREN (CONT'D)
                        He never got it right the first time,
                        but he always managed to escape and
                        get it right in the end.  

                                 PARKER
                        I guess the bomb is ticking, huh?

                                 LAUREN
                        Looks that way. 

           INT. ARCADE, BEST WESTERN - NIGHT

           A tiny arcade with a few games from the '90s.  Eugene, Bosley,
           Marcus and The Professor are crowded around a claw machine,
           watching Larry reel in a stuffed gorilla.  The claw hits the
           top and the gorilla shakes loose. 

                                 LARRY
                        Damn it. 

                                 MARCUS
                        You gotta finesse it.  You're not
                        finessing it. 

           Parker's Frogskin-wearing reflection appears in the claw
           machine's window.  The guys turn around.

                                 PARKER
                        I let you guys down before.  That
                        won't happen again this time.    

                                 EUGENE
                        Who says there's gonna be a "this
                        time?"

                                 PARKER
                        If you guys weren't already in, you
                        wouldn't be hanging around the Best
                        Western arcade watching Larry lose
                        at the claw machine. 

           The guys all look at each other, smile.   

                                 LARRY
                        I'm not driving this time.  

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, BEST WESTERN - DAY

           The crew is gathered around a printout of the Hard Rock
           Hotel's floor plans.

                                 LAUREN
                        The safe in Terrence's suite is in
                        the second floor bedroom.    
           Parker shoots her a look. 

                                 LAUREN
                            (shrugs)
                        He gave me a tour.  We wanted to
                        show off his manga collection. 
                            (to Eugene)
                        It looked like a pretty normal lock.

                                 EUGENE
                        That's my specialty. 

           Parker points to something on the plans.

                                 PARKER
                        Can we get in through that ventilation
                        shaft?

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        I think so. 

           The Professor spots something on the floor plans and looks
           concerned.  

                                 PARKER
                        What's wrong?

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        The only entrance to that ventilation
                        shaft is through the adjacent Vince
                        Neil suite.  But the hotel says it's
                        booked. 

                                 PARKER
                        Who's in it?

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        Someone important, I assume.  It's
                        two grand a night. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY, HARD ROCK HOTEL - DAY

           The door to the Vince Neil suite opens.  Jenna Jameson stands
           there, wearing a loosely knotted silk robe.  

           Staring back at her is Parker in the "San Diego Gas &
           Electric" uniform.  He nervously scans a clipboard.

                                 PARKER
                        Excuse me, are you Miss - 
                                 JENNA JAMESON
                        I'm Jenna Jameson.  Who the fuck are
                        you?

                                 PARKER
                        We're with the gas company. 

           Jenna nods to Bosley, Eugene and Larry, gathered behind Parker
           in street clothes.

                                 JENNA JAMESON
                        Even those guys? 

                                 LAUREN
                        Casual Sunday. 

                                 PARKER
                        I didn't get the memo.

           Parker sniffs the air.

                                 PARKER
                        Wow, you can almost smell that.

           He looks to the other guys, who nod seriously. 

                                 EUGENE
                        Tell me about it.  

                                 LARRY
                        We got here right in time.   

                                 JENNA JAMESON
                        What are you talking about?  I don't
                        smell anything.

                                 PARKER
                        You wouldn't.  It's carbon monoxide.

                                 LARRY
                        The odorless killer.

                                 PARKER
                        It takes a very trained nose to detect
                        it, and even then we still need one
                        of these.

           Parker holds out a device that is obviously not a carbon
           monoxide detector.  It beeps crazily. 

                                 PARKER
                        That's not good.
                            (to Jenna)
                        If you don't mind, Ms. Jameson, we're
                        gonna need to inspect your room.
           Parker moves for the door, but Jenna doesn't budge. 

                                 JENNA JAMESON
                        Four young guys knock on my door,
                        say they're from the "gas
                        company"...sounds like the beginning
                        of a really good movie. 

           Bosley glances at his watch. 

                                 BOSLEY
                        We, uh, got a bit of time. 

           Bosley slides past Jenna and into the room.  A moment later,
           he hurries out, looking like he's seen a ghost.  

                                 BOSLEY
                        Tito Ortiz is naked in there.  We
                        better give them a second.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY, HARD ROCK HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Jenna and TITO ORTIZ head off down the hallway.  The guys
           wave at them. 

                                 PARKER
                        Shouldn't be more than an hour. 

           INT. VINCE NEIL SUITE, HARD ROCK HOTEL - DAY

           The guys enter.  The room is trashed.  Bosley examines a
           pair of thong underwear hanging from a lampshade. 

                                 BOSLEY
                        Sexy.

           Parker loudly clears his throat.  

                                 PARKER
                        All right, let's do this.

           Parker heads into the bathroom. 

           INT. BATHROOM, VINCE NEIL SUITE - DAY

           Parker takes the last of the screws off a ventilation cover
           and removes it.  He and Larry hoist Eugene up into the
           ventilation shaft.

           INT. VENTILATION SHAFT - DAY

           Eugene quietly crawls down the shaft.
           INT. ROOM SERVICE KITCHEN, HARD ROCK HOTEL - DAY

           HOTEL STAFF prepare meals.  A WAITER walks over to a loaded
           room service cart.  Marcus suddenly appears in an identical
           uniform and grabs the reigns. 

                                 MARCUS
                        I'll handle this one, Ramon. 

           The Waiter, obviously not named Ramon, looks confused as
           Marcus pushes the cart away.  Marcus tosses the destination
           card in the garbage.

           INT. VENTILATION SHAFT - DAY

           Eugene passes over an air vent.  He looks down into the living
           room of Terrence's suite.  The coast is clear.  He continues
           on.

           INT. CARGO VAN - DAY

           Lauren sits behind the wheel of the van, wearing Parker's
           sunglasses, cool as can be.  She watches the entrance to the
           Hard Rock from across the street.

           INT. ELEVATOR, HARD ROCK HOTEL - DAY

           Marcus rides up with the room service cart.  He takes the
           cover off the tray, eats a handful of fries, then replaces
           it.   

                                 MARCUS
                        You okay in there?

           From beneath the cart's white cloth, we see The Professor's
           hand emerge and give a thumbs up. 

           INT. BATHROOM, VINCE NEIL SUITE - DAY

           The guys wait.  Parker's cell phone vibrates.  He checks it.

                                 PARKER
                        We're clear to go.

           Parker and Larry hoist Bosley into the ventilation shaft,
           then climb up after him. 

           INT. 2ND FLOOR BEDROOM, AXL ROSE SUITE - DAY

           The air vent dangles open.  Crouched on the floor, Eugene
           listens through a stethoscope pressed against the room's
           combination safe as he turns the knob.  He stops and enters
           something into his cell phone, then gets back to the safe.
           INT. VENTILATION SHAFT - DAY

           The guys reach the first air vent.  They pop it open and
           drop into the living room, one by one.

           INT. AXL ROSE SUITE, HARD ROCK HOTEL - DAY

           Parker lands with a thud.  He looks over to find Larry and
           Bosley frozen - 

           In the room are Terrence and his two Yakuza.  Parker slowly
           gets to his feet. 

                                 PARKER
                        What's he doing here!?  He's supposed
                        to be at the convention.

           Terrence shakes his head.

                                 TERRENCE
                        You guys have to be the biggest bunch
                        of losers I've ever -

           The sound of breaking glass echoes from the upstairs bedroom. 
           Terrence nods to Kenji, who sprints up the spiral staircase.

                                 TERRENCE
                        I'm assuming that has something to
                        do you with you?

           Kenji returns with Eugene, his arm twisted behind his back. 
           He throws him to the ground.

                                 KENJI
                            (in Japanese, subtitled)
                        He was trying to break into the safe. 
                        I checked him.  He's clean.

                                 TERRENCE
                            (to Parker)
                        Is there anyone else in here?  

           There is a knock at the door.

                                 MARCUS (O.S.)
                            (disguising voice)
                        Room service. 

           Terrence shakes his head, incredulous.  He opens the door. 
           Marcus pushes the cart inside.

                                 TERRENCE
                        Funny, I don't remember ordering any
                        room service.
           Kiyoshi suddenly stops the cart with his foot.  Due to the
           continued momentum, The Professor rolls out on his chair
           from under the cart's tablecloth.  

                                 TERRENCE
                        Are you kidding me?  I thought after
                        one idiotic heist you'd quit. 
                        Apparently, I'm gonna have to make
                        my guys beat some sense into you. 

           The crew look at each other, nervously. 

                                 PARKER
                        Screw it...abort!

           Marcus uses everything he's got to ram the cart into Kiyoshi
           and Kenji, knocking them over.  The crew bolt for the door.

           The Professor tries to wheel away, but Terrence throws on
           his brakes.  He grabs a bike lock from the counter and locks
           down the Professor's chair.

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        Hey!

                                 TERRENCE
                        We'll be back for you.  

           Terrence and the Yakuza take off after our guys. 

           INT. HALLWAY, HARD ROCK HOTEL - DAY

           Parker and the guys sprint down the hallway and into the
           open elevator.  A winded Marcus dives in just as the doors
           close. 

           Terrence and the Yakuza get to the elevator bay a moment too
           late.  Terrence slams the elevator call button, then looks
           to the Yakuza - 

                                 TERRENCE
                        What are you waiting for!?  Take the
                        goddamn stairs!  

           INT. ELEVATOR, HARD ROCK HOTEL - DAY

           Parker talks into his cell phone - 

                                 PARKER
                        We'll be out front in 30. 

           INT. CARGO VAN - DAY

           Lauren goes to pull out.  In the side view mirror, she sees
           a traffic cop pull in behind her, siren flashing.  
           She realizes she is in a loading zone. 

                                 LAUREN
                            (into cell)
                        We might have a problem.  

           INT. ELEVATOR, HARD ROCK HOTEL - DAY

           Parker shuts his phone. 

                                 PARKER
                        Shit.  We're gonna have to run, guys.  

                                 MARCUS
                        Seriously?  Running?

           The other guys start stretching in preparation as the elevator
           descends.  

                                 MARCUS
                        Seriously?

           INT. STAIRWELL, HARD ROCK HOTEL - DAY

           The Yakuza use parkour moves to navigate the stairwell.

           INT. LOBBY, HARD ROCK HOTEL - DAY

           The elevator dings and the guys rush out.  Across the way, 
           a stairwell door opens and the Yakuza emerge. 

           Our guys haul ass out of the hotel, past Jenna and Tito in
           the lobby bar.

                                 JENNA JAMESON
                        Does that mean our room is safe?

           At the elevator bay, another set of doors open and Terrence
           hurries out. 

           EXT. HARD ROCK HOTEL - DAY

           The guys spot Lauren getting written up for a parking
           violation.  Parker quickly scans the options, points toward
           the nearby convention center.

                                 PARKER
                        We'll lose them back at the Con!

           The guys avoid two-way oncoming traffic as they sprint across
           the busy street.  Behind them, the Yakuza mount their crotch
           rockets and give chase, weaving around cars. 
           EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           The guys push through the crowd and into the convention
           center.  The Yakuza ride their bikes right up onto the curb,
           causing a commotion.  A HAPLESS GUARD blocks the entrance -

                                 HAPLESS GUARD
                        Hey, you guys can't - 

           The Guard jumps out of the way just before he is run over. 

           A moment later, Terrence reaches the convention center and
           looks in at the chaos.  He decides to avoid the heat, shakes
           his head and casually strolls off. 

           INT. CONVENTION FLOOR, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           The guys bolt inside and weave through the crowd. 

                                 EUGENE
                        I think we lost them. 

           Eugene stops and takes a hit off his asthma inhaler.  As he
           exhales, we hear the sound of revving engines.  The guys
           turn to see Yakuza peel out onto the convention floor.  

                                 LARRY
                        Fuck!  We didn't lose them!  We
                        definitely did not lose them! 

                                 PARKER
                        We gotta split up. 

           Parker and Larry break one way.  Bosley, Marcus and Eugene
           break the other.  The Yakuza follow suit, each going after a
           group.  They expertly pilot their bikes through the crowd,
           popping up onto tables and cutting through displays...basically
           fucking shit up.  Fanboys scream and dive out of the way.   

           Parker and Larry pass the display for the new Bond movie. 
           Parker stops suddenly and pulls Larry back toward 007 Aston
           Martin, which rotates on a pedestal.  They hop the rope
           blocking it off and Larry jumps into the driver's seat.  

           INT. ASTON MARTIN - DAY

           The guys slam their doors. 

                                 PARKER
                        Floor it!

                                 LARRY
                        There aren't any keys!  Or a gas
                        pedal! 
           The car is just a model.  As it spins on the rotating pedestal
           the guys find Kenji coming right at them on his bike.  The
           front wheel crashes through the windshield, spraying glass
           at the guys.  They scream and roll out of the car. 

           INT. CONVENTION FLOOR, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Kiyoshi trails Marcus, Bosley and Eugene.  Marcus starts to
           lag behind.  

           INT. AXL ROSE SUITE, HARD ROCK HOTEL - DAY

           Terrence enters.  He finds The Professor's wheelchair
           overturned on the floor.  He quickly scans the room...nothing. 
           He looks to the staircase, where The Professor is sprawled
           on his stomach, having crawled halfway to the second floor.  

           Terrence slowly walks up the stairs.  He looks down at The
           Professor, covered in sweat from the exertion. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        You almost made it. 

           Terrence's black loafers grinds The Professor's hand against
           the step.  The Professor lets go.  He steps on The Professor's
           other hand.  The Professor lets go and slides all the way
           down the steep stairs. 

           INT. CONVENTION FLOOR, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Kenji tries to pull his tire out of the windshield of the
           Aston Martin.  It won't budge.  He abandons the bike and
           leaps at Parker, who narrowly avoids him. 

                                 PARKER
                        Fine!  Let's do this!

           Parker takes a pathetic swing at Kenji, then finds himself
           on the receiving end of a brutal karate combo.  As Kenji
           closes in for a finishing move, he gets slammed on the back
           of the neck with one of the brass posts used to rope off the
           car.  Larry stands over him, holding the post and wearing a
           crazed smile.  

                                 PARKER
                        Nice moves, Larry. 

           Larry helps Parker up and they take off, leaving the
           unconscious Kenji behind. 

           Across the floor, they spot Kiyoshi pulling next to Marcus. 
           He grabs him by the shirt and drags him along the floor.  As
           they run toward him -  
           Parker spots a World of Warcraft guild with large plastic
           weapons.  He charges them. 

                                 PARKER
                        We need those axes!

           Parker wrestles two of the battle axes from the scrawny GUILD
           MEMBERS and tosses one to Larry.  The guys hurry off. 

                                 GUILD MEMBER
                        That is un-fucking-cool! 

           A few aisles away, Kiyoshi lets go of Marcus, who slides
           head first into a display.  Kiyoshi launches his bike off a
           table and lands in front of Eugene and Bosley, doing a 180
           slide so he is facing them. 

           Kiyoshi revs his engine.  He kicks the bike into gear and
           guns it toward the guys.  They run for their lives. 

           Parker and Larry charge out of nowhere with the battle axes. 
           They can't catch up with Kiyoshi.  In a last ditch effort,
           they wildly launch the axes.  Kiyoshi is hit in the helmet
           and skids out of control.  He crashes into a wall. 

           Parker and Larry gather the other guys and they all flee. 
           Parker whips out his phone.

           INT. CARGO VAN - DAY - MOVING

           Lauren answers her cell.

                                 PARKER (O.S.)
                            (from phone)
                        Meet us at the loading dock in 45
                        seconds.

                                 LAUREN
                        I'll be there in 30.

           EXT. LOADING DOCK, CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           The guys push through a door, all tripping over one another. 
           They pile into the waiting cargo van and it peels out. 

           INT. AXL ROSE SUITE, HARD ROCK HOTEL - DAY

           Terrence sits on the staircase, cracking his knuckles.  He
           stares daggers at The Professor, who is back in his chair.

           The Yakuza enter, their heads lowered in shame. 

                                 KENJI
                            (in Japanese, subtitled)
                        They got away.
                                 TERRENCE
                        Dammit!

                                 KIYOSHI
                            (in Japanese, subtitled)
                        What should we do with the cripple? 

           Terrence gets up.  He walks menacingly over to The Professor. 
           He bends down toward him...

                                 TERRENCE
                        We let him go.  

           Terrence unlocks the bike lock on The Professor's tire. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        I need him to deliver a message.

           Terrence gets right in The Professor's face. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        Tell your pathetic friends that with
                        money, comes information.  I intend
                        to find out who all of them are,
                        where they live...and when I'm done
                        with them, you guys will have your
                        own relay team for the Paralympics.

           The Professor nods and wheels himself out of the room.  

           Terrence checks his watch, then looks to his Yakuza.

                                 TERRENCE
                        You're pathetic.  Seagal would be
                        ashamed.  
                            (shakes his head)
                        Grab the comic.  We have business to
                        attend to.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, BEST WESTERN - DAY

           The crew sit around, quiet and somber.  Bosley holds an ice
           pack to Marcus' bruised head. 

           A moment later, The Professor wheels in. 

                                 PARKER
                        So?

           The Professor reaches under his shirt...and pulls out Action
           Comics #1.  Off the crew's smiles - 

                                                            FLASHBACK TO:
           INT. 2ND FLOOR BEDROOM, AXL ROSE SUITE - DAY

           TITLE: How Shit Really Went Down...

           Using the stethoscope, Eugene quickly cracks the safe's
           combination.  But he doesn't open it.  He enters the
           combination into his cell phone and hits send.  Then he walks
           over to the dresser and casually tips a vase onto the floor,
           shattering it.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A CELL PHONE

           It lights up from an incoming text message.  REVEAL we're -

           INT. UNDER SHEET OF ROOM SERVICE CART - DAY

           The Professor is in his chair under the cart.  He checks the
           message to find the safe's combination. 

           INT. AXL ROSE SUITE, HARD ROCK HOTEL - DAY

           Terrence and the Yakuza take off after the guys, leaving the
           Professor in the immobilized wheelchair.  

           The Professor looks around, makes sure the coast clear...then
           stands up, stretches his legs and strolls up the stairs.

           INT. 2ND FLOOR BEDROOM, AXL ROSE SUITE - DAY

           The Professor opens the safe with the combination Eugene
           texted him.  He takes the fake Action Comics #1 from under
           his shirt and swaps it out with the real one inside the safe. 

           INT. BATHROOM, AXL ROSE SUITE - DAY

           The Professor splashes some water on his face for effect,
           then ruffles his hair and his clothes.

           INT. AXL ROSE SUITE, HARD ROCK HOTEL - DAY

           The Professor walks halfway down the stairs, then gets on
           his stomach and grabs the step above him.  He waits for a
           beat, until he hears Terrence enter.  He holds his breath to
           flush his face, then starts to pull himself up the steps.    

           As before, Terrence walks up the stairs and looks down at
           The Professor, covered in "sweat" from the exertion. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        You almost made it. 
           As Terrence grinds his loafer into The Professor's hand, we
           see a smile flash across The Professor's face.  

                                                               RETURN TO:

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, BEST WESTERN - NIGHT

           The crew is partying for real this time.  Lauren sidles up
           next to Parker and The Professor. 

                                 LAUREN
                        You never said how you knew The
                        Professor could walk?

           Parker looks over at The Professor for permission.  He nods. 

                                 PARKER
                        A couple of years ago, I walked into
                        the restroom at the convention center
                        and saw him using the urinal.

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        I'd drank two Mountain Dews and some
                        asshole was using the handicap stall.

                                 LAUREN
                        So, the whole wheelchair thing...?

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        A week before the convention I get
                        into character.  Don't break it until
                        after the Con.  I'm a true fan. 

           The Professor runs his hand over his bald head. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        I actually have really nice hair,
                        too. 

           He takes out his wallet and shows off his Driver's License
           photo, in which he has long, beautiful hair.  

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        Like Pitt in "Legends of the Fall." 

           Lauren nods, impressed. 

           Parker checks his watch.

                                 PARKER
                        All right, guys, we got a comic to
                        sell.
           INT. VIP ROOM, STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

           Valeri Bupkin and his Thugs sit on a red velvet couch.  Valeri
           slurps oysters off a silver tray.  Two STRIPPERS put on a
           private show.  

           Another Thug enters and whispers something in Valeri's ear. 
           Valeri calls the Strippers over, gives each of them a tap on
           the ass and a few bills, then sends them on their way. 

           Valeri looks back at his Thug.

                                 VALERI
                        Send him in.

           Terrence enters, flanked by his Yakuza.  He has a leather
           briefcase handcuffed to his wrist.    

                                 TERRENCE
                        Pyvit, Comrade Bupkin.

                                 VALERI
                        Mr. Watanabe.  How nice to see you. 

           Valeri pulls a duffel bag from under the table.  He unzips
           it and shows off the bills neatly stacked inside. 

                                 VALERI
                        Your turn.

           Terrence snaps.  Kiyoshi takes out a key and unlocks the
           cuff around his wrist.  Terrence holds the briefcase up to
           his face and a built in retina scanner sweeps across his
           eyes then unlocks the case.  

                                 VALERI
                        I like a man who takes security
                        seriously. 

           Terrence grins.  He removes Action Comics #1 from the case.
           He and Valeri simultaneously swap goods for cash.  

           Terrence throws the duffel at Kenji. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        Check it out. 

           Valeri pull a monocular from his suit jacket and examines
           the comic.

           Terrence looks to Kenji.  He nods, it's all there.  

                                 TERRENCE
                            (to Valeri)
                        Nice doing business with you. 
           Terrence starts to walk off.  He hears Valeri loudly clear
           his throat and turns to find him standing.

                                 VALERI
                        Mr. Watanabe, there is only one thing
                        that angers me more than a man who
                        promises a delivery that they do not
                        deliver.  And that is when they
                        deliver me bullshit!  Such as this
                        fake comic!

           Valeri draws a gun that was tucked in the back of his pants.  

                                 TERRENCE
                            (in Japanese, subtitled)
                        Kill them all!

           Nothing.  Terrence turns to find that his Yakuza have been
           taken out by Valeri's Thugs.  He panics. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        I didn't try to rip you off!  I would
                        never try to rip you off!  

                                 VALERI
                            (to Thugs)
                        Make it look like an accident.  

           The Thugs drag Terrence and his Yakuza off.  Terrence tries
           to kick free, screaming - 

                                 TERRENCE
                        They have it!  I know who has it! 
                        The nerds!

           One of the Thugs shuts him up with a quick jab to the face
           and they pull him out the door. 

           Valeri slumps back down on the couch and shakes his head. 
           He crumples the fake comic book and tosses it.  Another Thug
           enters.   

                                 UKRAINIAN THUG 1
                        Someone else is here to see you,
                        boss.

           Valeri slams his hand down on the table. 

                                 VALERI
                        What is it now!?

           Parker enters.  He holds up the real Action Comics #1.

                                 PARKER
                        I thought we had an arrangement. 
                                 VALERI
                        I still have the cash. 

           Parker hands over the comic book.  Valeri examines it with
           his monocular.  He looks up and nods at one of his Thugs. 
           The Thug hands Parker the duffel bag.

           Parker starts to leave.

                                 VALERI
                        You know...I am actually in the market
                        for an Action Comics #23.  First
                        appearance of - 

                                 PARKER
                        Lex Luthor.  Although, some people
                        argue that Superman #4 was his first
                        appearance because it hit the stands
                        earlier.  

           Valeri grins. 

                                 VALERI
                        In that case, I'll take both.  If
                        you happen to know of anyone
                        interested in "selling."  

                                 PARKER
                        If I were you, I'd check Ebay.

           Parker turns around and continues out. 

           EXT. POOL, BEST WESTERN - NIGHT

           Parker hands out manilla envelopes stuffed with cash to
           Bosley, Eugene and Marcus.   

                                 MARCUS
                        Show me the money!  

                                 EUGENE
                        With this I'm gonna buy...
                            (hits asthma inhaler)
                        ...respect!

           Bosley looks at his envelope.  He starts to tear up. 

                                 BOSLEY
                        I don't know if you guys have noticed, 
                        but my nose ain't the only thing
                        that's been broken.  I've been walking
                        around with a broken heart and all I
                        want is a hug.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOSLEY (CONT'D)
                        A hug and this 50 grand to buy a new
                        truck that no one got jacked off by
                        my girlfriend in the back off.  

           Marcus and Eugene hug it out with Bosley. 

           Parker smiles.  He scans the pool for The Professor. 

           INT. BAR, BEST WESTERN - NIGHT

           The Professor sits at a back table, nursing a cocktail. 
           Parker enters and takes a seat across from him.  He takes
           The Professor's envelope of cash out and slides it across
           the table.  The Professor looks down at it, then slides it
           back.   

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        I did it for justice. 

           Parker looks down at the envelope. 

                                 PARKER
                        You sure?

           The Professor nods.  Parker goes to put the money back in
           his bag.  The Professor grabs his hand. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        Of course I want the money.  I thought
                        you were gonna insist I keep it a
                        few more times. 

           Parker hands it over.  The Professor hefts it and smiles
           broadly. 

                                 PARKER
                        You earned it, Professor. 

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        It's Donald.

                                 PARKER
                        Really?  Never took you for a Donnie.

                                 THE PROFESSOR
                            (seriously)
                        That's 'cause it's Donald. 

                                 PARKER
                        Well, Donald, maybe we could hang
                        out in the real world some time. 
                                 THE PROFESSOR
                        Right now, I think someone else is
                        looking for you. 

           The Professor nods to the entrance of the bar, where Lauren
           and Larry wait.  Parker gets up and crosses to them. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Shouldn't you be getting back to
                        save Duke?

                                 PARKER
                        The bank doesn't open until 9:00 AM
                        tomorrow.  

                                 LAUREN
                        My flight doesn't leave for a few
                        hours. 

           Larry looks at the two of them.

                                 LARRY
                        Well, don't waste your time hanging
                        around with me.  Parker and I have
                        the whole summer together. 

           Parker smiles. 

                                 LAUREN
                        I'm actually going to go upstairs. 
                        I think I may have left that Wonder
                        Woman outfit somewhere in my room. 

                                 PARKER
                        Oh, well, yeah, you shouldn't leave
                        that behind.  I'll, uh, come help
                        you look for it in a second. 

           Lauren smiles at him, then heads to the elevator. 

           Parker looks to Larry. 

                                 PARKER
                        Dude, what the fuck do I do?

                                 LARRY
                        Animal instinct.  It just takes over. 
                        Trust me.  

           Parker takes a deep breath. 

                                 LARRY
                        Hey, man, I meant what I said about
                        this summer.  I'm there.  It's gonna
                        be awesome. 
           Larry takes out the IOU and hands it back to Parker. 

                                 LARRY
                        And maybe hang on to this for now. 
                        Just because I left some of that
                        bullshit from high school behind,
                        doesn't mean I have to throw it all
                        away.  

           Parker takes the IOU. 

                                 PARKER
                        Are you serious, man?

                                 LARRY
                        Yeah, I also left half my share of
                        the money in your bag.  We're
                        partners.

                                 PARKER
                        That's what I always said. 

                                 LARRY
                        Also, I just remembered this.  The
                        ear is like the panty lever.  You
                        pull on it at the right moment, and
                        the panties just drop.

                                 PARKER
                        I'm gonna do that.  And I'm gonna
                        think about you when I do. 
                            (beat)
                        Not in a creepy way.  

           Parker heads for the elevator.

                                                               FADE OUT:

           TITLE OVER BLACK: Monday

           EXT. DUKE'S COMICS - DAY

           The Le Car screeches to a halt out front and the guys get
           out.  They find the metal gate to the shop closed.  They
           both bang on it. 

                                 PARKER
                        Duke!  Open up, man!  

                                 LARRY
                        We got great news!

           The guys continue to bang, causing a racket.  A CLERK steps
           out of the Mailboxes, Etc that is two stores down.  
                                 CLERK
                        Duke left a half hour ago.

                                 LARRY
                        Which way did he go?

                                 PARKER
                        Whichever way El Paso is.  We gotta
                        get to the highway. 

           The guys jump in the car and peel out.  

           INT. RENAULT LE CAR - DAY - MOVING

           The car flies down two blocks, blowing a stop sign.  Parker
           make a hard right turn.  He slams on the brakes as the guys
           find themselves right behind 

           A VERY SLOWING MOVING U-HAUL TRAILER

           The guys hop out of the car. 

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           The guys run to the front of the U-Haul, where they find
           Duke's moped hitched up to it and straining to move it. 

                                 PARKER
                        Duke, cut the engine. 

                                 DUKE
                        No way.  I'm making shitty enough
                        time already. 

           The guys continue to walk beside Duke as he pulls the trailer
           at less than a mile per hour. 

                                 LARRY
                        We got all the money you need to pay
                        off the loan. 

                                 PARKER
                        Yeah, you don't have to close the
                        shop.

                                 DUKE
                        You're not ever really here, are
                        you?  Get outta my head!  

                                 PARKER
                        You're not hallucinating!  We got
                        the money!

           Parker unzips a backpack he is carrying and shows Duke the
           money.  He suddenly cuts the engine.  
                                 DUKE
                        That looks pretty real.

                                 LARRY
                        It is real.

                                 DUKE
                        What the hell did you do to get that?

                                 PARKER
                        I probably shouldn't tell you because
                        it would make you an accessory.  But
                        the guy we did it to had it coming. 

           Duke shrugs.

                                 DUKE
                        Who gives a shit.  You did it.  You
                        really did it!

           He throws down the kickstand, hops off the moped and hugs
           the guys.  

           EXT. DUKE'S COMICS - DAY

           Duke raises the metal gate on the front of the shop. 

                                 DUKE
                        Duke's Comics is back open for
                        business.  

           Duke opens the door and the guys enter. 

           INT. DUKE'S COMICS - DAY

           The place is completely empty.  Parker and Larry both wince
           from the smell. 

                                 PARKER
                        What the hell is that?

                                 DUKE
                        Oh...right.  I took a shit on the
                        floor to give those guys from the
                        bank what for.  I guess we gotta
                        clean that up.

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. TERMINAL, BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY

           TITLE: Two Months Later...

           Parker walks Larry, in his Tufts ball cap, toward the security
           check in.  
           They're both laughing and joking, an easiness between them
           we haven't seen before.  Larry stops and sets down his bag. 

                                 LARRY
                        Well...this is it. 

                                 PARKER
                        Yeah.  I guess I'll, uh, email you
                        in a few days. 

                                 LARRY
                        Or call. 

                                 PARKER
                        Yeah, I'll call. 

                                 LARRY
                        You gonna be okay by yourself? 

                                 PARKER
                        I'm gonna have my hands full.  I've
                        been kicking around some new comic
                        ideas.  Like this one about a bunch
                        of guys who steal some shit at Comic-
                        Con.

                                 LARRY
                        You know, I don't think anybody would
                        believe it.

           The guys hug.  Larry picks up his bag.  Parker watches him
           walk off.  Once he's gone, Parker turns to leave, stops.   

           Parker looks over at one of the airline counters.  He crosses
           to it and walks up to the AIRLINE ATTENDANT. 

                                 PARKER
                        Do you guys fly to Baltimore.  

                                 AIRLINE ATTENDANT
                        Yes, we do, sir.

                                 PARKER
                        I'll take one ticket to Baltimore. 
                        For right now. 

           The Airline Attendant checks the computer.

                                 AIRLINE ATTENDANT
                        We have an 11:30.  It'll be 750
                        dollars.

                                 PARKER
                        Really?  You guys know it's going to
                        Baltimore, right?
                                 AIRLINE ATTENDANT
                        Yes, we're aware of that.  Do you
                        want the ticket? 

           Parker looks at her for a long beat.

                                 PARKER
                        Fuck it.  You gotta grow up some
                        time. 

           The Airline Attendant just stares at him. 

                                 PARKER
                        Yes, I'll take the ticket. 

           The Airline Attendant rings him up.  Off Parker's expectant
           face, we - 

                                                               FADE OUT.
