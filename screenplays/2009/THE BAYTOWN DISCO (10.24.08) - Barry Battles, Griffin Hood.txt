           EXT. BACON STREET - DAY

           Billboards for ALABAMA COMMUNITY COLLEGE and MONTGOMERY LOCAL 
           NEWS sit atop rows of dilapidated project homes that line 
           Bacon Street in east Montgomery, Alabama. HISPANIC CHILDREN 
           play in the midst of drug deals on every corner. An OLD 
           HISPANIC MAN sits on his front porch as he watches TEENAGE 
           GIRLS getting off of a school bus. A few small HISPANIC BOYS 
           run back and forth over an old woman’s garden sprinkler in an 
           effort to find relief from the Alabama humidity. A little boy 
           plays FETCH with his dog. The dog hands him a bone.

           The sound of daily activity is interrupted by the faint 
           rumble thump of rock-a-billy music in the distance. The music 
           grows louder as the group of boys continue playing.  

           The boy throws the bone far across the neighborhood street.  
           The dog feverishly runs after it. He is the pinnacle of raw 
           power and driven instinct. He crosses the scene and reveals 
           in the background--

           ---A 1976 FORD MAVERICK. 

           It barrels around the corner and squeals its way to a stop in 
           front of the house marked 809 BACON STREET. The Maverick has 
           a bumper sticker on the back of the trunk that reads: PRIDE 
           NOT PREJUDICE

           The neighborhood stops in awe.

           The Maverick’s driver side door opens and BRICK OODIE hops 
           out. Brick is 30, 5’9” proudly displays a tank top made of a 
           confederate flag and holsters a sawed off scatter gun down 
           the front of his leather pants. He leans against the hood of 
           his car while he lights a cigarette. His brother MCQUEEN 
           OODIE steps out of the passenger seat. McQueen is 24, 6’1” 
           and immediately removes his filthy, sweat stained t-shirt 
           brandishing a cross tattoo that covers his entire back and 
           reaches shoulder to shoulder. 

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Hot as hell down here in ole 
                        Mexico.

           Several HISPANIC MEN that were washing a nearby ESCALADE take 
           offense to the comment and start to walk over to the Maverick 
           when LINCOLN OODIE climbs out of the backseat. The HISPANIC 
           MEN about face and the street begins to clear as Lincoln 
           stands 6’5” 250 pounds of muscle, has a five inch mowhawk, 
           and carries a shotgun he casually rests on his shoulder. 
           Lincoln removes a ratty old SPEAK-N-SPELL he wears around his 
           neck and tosses it into the driver’s seat.

           MCQUEEN puts an obviously fake detective badge around his 
           neck as the three brothers make their way up to the front 
           door.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        I got this.

           McQueen bangs on the door.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Open up! This is the dog bra, and 
                        we got a warrant for Hector Del-a-
                        taco. So send him on out.

           Brick and Mcqueen can barely control their laughter as 
           Lincoln stands stoic.

           A LARGE VATOS that is sitting inside the house grabs a hand 
           gun off of the coffee table and makes his way over to the 
           door. He looks out the peep hole to find the Oodie brothers.

                                 LARGE VATOS
                        I think you got the wrong house 
                        ese.

                                 BRICK
                        Yeah, but seriously this is the FBI 
                        and we need to speak with the man 
                        in charge here.

           The large vatos chambers a bullet.

                                 LARGE VATOS
                        You hillbillies don’t look like no 
                        FBI.

                                 BRICK
                        It’s cause we’re undercover. Now go 
                        on and send Paco Grande out here 
                        for us to whip his illegal ass and 
                        we’ll be on our way. 

           Brick and McQueen continue to snicker.

           A few more members inside the house start making their way 
           toward the door.

                                 LARGE VATOS
                        I’m gonna give you puntas ten 
                        seconds to get the hell off my 
                        stoop.

           Brick reigns it in.

                                        ©2008 Barry Battles & Griffin Hood
                                 BRICK
                        Alright, listen! We are cops. We 
                        just need to speak with you about 
                        some tickets. Just take a closer 
                        look at our credentials. Officer 
                        McQueen, show him your badge.

           The large Vatos puts his eye up to the peep hole once again, 
           but sees nothing but black.

                                 LARGE VATOS
                        I don’t see shit.

           Brick pulls the trigger of his hand cannon he has firmly 
           placed against the peep hole blowing a hole in the door and 
           the large vatos’ head off. Brain matter and blood cover all 
           the other members gathered around the door. They quickly 
           begin to scurry around for their weapons.

           Lincoln tosses McQueen the shotgun.

           Lincoln kicks what is left of the door in as Brick and 
           McQueen follow behind blasting away in all directions.

           A heavy exchange of gunfire takes place between the Oodie 
           boys and the 11 GANG BANGERS left inside the house.

           Drugs and money come flying off of tables as bullets riddle 
           the home. Half naked women flee from the couches and bedrooms 
           as they exit the house screaming.  

           Lincoln spots the largest man in the house he can find and 
           spear tackles him through a wall. The room he is now in 
           contains several high powered rifles.

           Brick and McQueen make quick work out of 8 of the gang 
           bangers. They are in a stand off with the remaining 2 who are 
           hunkering down in the kitchen.

                                 GANG BANGER 1
                        (in Spanish)
                        Squeeze through the doggie door and 
                        come around through the front. 

                                 GANG BANGER 2
                        (in Spanish)
                        Fire some shots in there to cover 
                        me.

           A grenade comes flying into the kitchen landing between the 
           two gang bangers.

           Upon realizing what it is, they come out of the kitchen as 
           fast as they can only to be mowed down by Lincoln and his new 
           found gun.

           No more shots are fired out as the gun battle comes to an 
           end.

                                 BRICK
                        Well I’ll be danged if that just 
                        don’t work every time.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Where’d you get those?

           Lincoln points to the hole he made in the wall. McQueen goes 
           through the hole.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        They got any cervasos back there?

           Brick surveys the house making sure there are no others when 
           he sees some life left in a man attempting to crawl.

           Brick walks over and turns him on his back.

           The mortally wounded man begins to plead with Brick in 
           Spanish as he is bleeding out from the mouth.

                                 BRICK
                        I’m sorry fella, I don’t understand 
                        a damn word you’re saying. But I 
                        did know enough to figure out that 
                        your two friends in there were 
                        cooking up a plan on us.

           The man grabs his leg and begs in Spanish.

                                 BRICK
                        I told you I don’t speak no 
                        Spanish! Now see if you’d just 
                        learn the damn language you could 
                        be saying,”Please sir, don’t let me 
                        die. I’m a Federale and this was 
                        all a mistake.” And I’d help ya. 
                        But you come on in to this country 
                        speakin all that jibba jabba and 
                        don’t even bother learnin how to 
                        talk. What am I supposed to do with 
                        that? I don’t go into your country 
                        and expect everybody to speak 
                        English, now do I?

           Brick begins to reload his gun.

                                 BRICK
                        But despite how it looks that ain’t 
                        what all this was about. I figure 
                        since you can’t speak my language 
                        you can’t hear my language none 
                        either, but just so you know, the 
                        Latin Kings paid us to come make 
                        all this mess. I don’t know why and 
                        I don’t give a shit, but the point 
                        is...they want you dead, whoever 
                        you are. I am sorry for that.

           The man’s plea is getting louder.

           McQueen comes out of the room with a piece of mail.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        You ain’t gonna believe this.

           Brick fires a shot into the man’s face finally silencing the 
           him.

                                 BRICK
                        What?

                                 MCQUEEN
                        We got the wrong house.

                                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER

           MONTAGE - The Oodie brothers are flying down a two lane 
           highway in their Ford Maverick snorting coke and drinking a 
           Spanish labeled soda they took from the house on BACON 
           STREET. Lincoln does a line of coke off of his SPEAK-N-SPELL 
           then makes it say.

                                 SPEAK-N-SPELL
                        That yayo is good sheet.

           They continually swap out drivers, while never stopping the 
           car.

           SUPERIMPOSE: THE BAYTOWN DISCO

           The Maverick flies past O'Houlihan's Pub, which sits remotely 
           by the highway. The Maverick backs up and pulls into the 
           parking lot.

           INT. O'HOULIHAN'S PUB - DAY

           The Oodie brothers stroll into the pub that is littered with 
           Irish memorabilia and patrons. The POUGES play on a juke box 
           as Lincoln, Brick, and McQueen saunter up and sit at the bar. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        What can I get you boys?

                                 MCQUEEN
                        (mumbles)
                        Bowl of lucky charms.

                                 BARTENDER
                        What?

                                 BRICK
                        Some beers.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Coming right up.

           The bartender walks away.

                                 BRICK
                        Something American!

           Bricks spins around on his bar stool to check out the crowd. 
           He spots a few fair complected gentlemen playing pool and 
           elbows McQueen for him to turn around.

           They smirk at each other.

                                 BRICK
                        (loudly)
                        What’s two miles long and has an IQ 
                        of forty?

                                 MCQUEEN
                        (loudly)
                        I don’t know brother, what?

                                 BRICK
                        (loudly)
                        A Saint Patty’s Day parade.

           A deafening silence falls over the crowd. The pool players 
           they were targeting begin to rustle about.

           CELESTE MARTIN, 35 strikingly beautiful Hispanic woman, sits 
           in the back of the bar watching all of this unfold.

           The bartender walks back over with their beers.

                                 BARTENDER
                        C’mon boys lets not have any 
                        trouble here today.

           Brick and McQueen continue to sit with their backs to him.

                                 BRICK
                        Awe, we ain’t gonna make no 
                        trouble. We just like tellin’ a few 
                        jokes.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Yeah, you need one of them open mic 
                        nights. I got one. What happened 
                        when the Irish woman bought a 
                        vibrator?

           The bar is completely silent.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        She smashed all her teeth out.

                                 BARTENDER
                        All right boys that will be enough.

           Brick and McQueen spin around focusing all their attention on 
           the bartender when a SMALL MAN makes his way from the pool 
           area over to Lincoln, who is without his speak-n-spell.

           Lincoln sits drinking his beer.

                                 SMALL MAN
                        And what about you big fella? You 
                        got something to say?

           Lincoln just sits quietly drinking.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Ah shit, look at the wee little

                        For you.

           The small man smashes a glass beer bottle over Lincoln’s head 
           as the other men that were playing pool run over to join in.

           McQueen jumps up and marches in a circle.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Thank you for getting it started!

           He punches the nearest bar patron he sees.

           Brick grabs the bartender and head butts him to the ground.

                                 BRICK
                        Don’t you ever talk to me like I’m 
                        a child!

                        Pub? Horseshit! This is bama!

           Brick smashes the bottle on the head of a man trying to get 
           out of the way of the fight.

                        Where you going?

           Lincoln calmly stands up as he towers over the small man.

                        Nice to meet you Goliath. I’m 
                        David.

           The small man punches Lincoln in the dick as hard as he can, 
           dropping Lincoln to the floor.

           A full on bar room brawl has begun.

           Police cruisers and uniform officers cover up the street as 
           several cops are taping off a perimeter around the house. 
           Several CORONER VANS line the street as a steady stream of 
           body bag topped gurneys flow out of the house. DETECTIVE 
           REYES, 29, physically fit Caucasian, emerges from the front 
           door. He makes his way over to DETECTIVE MILLARD, 50, thickly 
           built African American, who is wrapping up a witness 
           interview.

                        Chinese.

                        The thing that bothers me about 
                        this one is that it was just a 
                        rampage. No exterior hits, so 
                        nothing got ugly out here. Nobody 
                        tagged the house and somebody got 
                        their big ass thrown through a 
                        wall. That does not fit usual 
                        gangland behavior.

                        These kids will smoke navel lint or 
                        peach juice or some shit like that.

           out of his pocket.

           A coke induced Brick is standing on the bar shirtless and 
           flexing his biceps. His face is bloodied and his ear has been 
           gashed.

                        I’ll kill all you dirty micks!

           Brick dives into a crowd of brawling patrons as McQueen has a 
           bar stool broken over his back. Lincoln staggers around the 
           corner with the small Irish man on his shoulders continually 
           punching him in the ear. Lincoln can’t defend himself with 
           two additional men attached to each arm.

           pub’s door sprinting toward the Maverick then diving into the 
           passenger side window. His legs dangle as he retrieves a 
           shotgun and dashes back into the pub.

           CELESTE MARTIN sits outside in her car watching as she hears 
           three loud shotgun blast coming from inside the pub.

           Patrons begin pouring out of the bar going for their 
           vehicles.

           Almost every car in the parking lot clears out as quickly as 
           possible.

           After a moment, the Oodie brothers exit. Lincoln is holding 
           his ear as they make their way over to the Maverick.

                                 BRICK

           Lincoln just holds the side of his head as they get in the 
           car.

           Music blares as they crank up and peel out of the parking 
           lot. 

           Celeste Martin cranks up her car and proceeds to slowly 
           follow the Maverick.

           Detective Millard is sitting at the desk of Detective Reyes 
           while phones are ringing all around the bustling police 
           station. Reyes is searching through a filing cabinet that is 
           located in the corner of his three-wall cubicle. Millard is 
           casually laid back, reclining in a chair.

           out referee starts screaming at Lincoln so Lincoln grabs him 
           and snaps his neck as well. Then another wrestler runs into 
           the ring, Lincoln snaps his neck. Four more men run 
           frantically into the ring one after another to try and stop 
           Lincoln. All of them have their necks snapped. The bodies 
           pile on top of one another. The crowd cheers.

                        gimmick. He was the neck breaker.

           Celeste Martin pulls up to the Oodie’s trailer. She parks 
           behind the Maverick that sits in the driveway as she surveys 
           knee high grass all around. A huge satellite dish from the 
           1980’s sits in the front yard as well as a massive oak tree. 
           Empty chains, that used to house guard dogs, lay on the 
           ground still attached to the tree. 

           As she steps out of her car she is immediately welcomed by 
           swarms of gnats and the loud chirping of Cicadas. 

           She makes her way up to the door and knocks.

           She stands waiting for a response.

           shoulders.

           CARLOS MARTIN, 43, iron chin with jet black hair, stands over 
           a table with an apron on.

           He is swinging a clever, chopping down on a massive slab of 
           meat.

                                 CARLOS
                        So I’m sitting there flipping 
                        channels, and I run into this movie 
                        that was just out at the theaters, 
                        like three months ago.

           Carlos chops down.

                                 CARLOS
                        I mean what happened? Didn’t movies 
                        used to run at the theater for an 
                        entire summer, then a year later, 
                        it would come out on video, then 
                        another year later, it would show 
                        up on HBO? Now days if you don’t go 
                        see something immediately, it’s 
                        gone from the theaters.

           He chops down again, spraying blood on his apron.

                                 CARLOS
                        But I guess that’s okay if you miss 
                        it at the movies, they come out on 
                        DVD almost immediately. It’s just 
                        some movies really need to be seen 
                        at the theater, you know? Jurassic 
                        Park is a prime example. When that 
                        T-rex roared, you felt it in your 
                        bones.

           Carlos chops down again.

                        You just can’t get that at home.

           Carlos looks over at a bound MAN AND WOMAN in their 40s 
           sitting in petrified awe.

                                 CARLOS
                        Not that you guys are ever going to 
                        see another movie again. I’m just 
                        saying.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - SUNSET

           The Oodie boys are flying down the highway in the Maverick 
           driving west into the sunset. Brick drives while McQueen 
           reads a map in the passenger seat. Lincoln is nodding off 
           asleep in the back. 

                                 BRICK
                        We should make it to Dallas by 
                        midnight, but I’ll just drive til 
                        I’m done.

           McQueen stares at the map for a moment before crumbling it 
           up.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Yep. Can you believe she went ahead 
                        and paid us five grand up front?

                                 BRICK
                        I know, right.

                        You’d think that bitch would have

                        I know we got an address for El 
                        Paso, but shouldn’t she have given 
                        us a picture or something of the 
                        kid?

                        How many kids you think they got 
                        laying around there?

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Well what if we get there and Rob 
                        is a baby, what if it’s little baby 
                        Rob and then we got to go get a 
                        baby seat and formula and shit.

                                 BRICK
                        Well I’m sure if Rob is a baby then 
                        there’ll be all that junk there. If 
                        Carlos took a baby it’s not like he 
                        just rides around with it in a shoe 
                        box, I’m sure he has that shit 
                        there.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        You’re right, you’re right, you’re 
                        right.

           They ride for a moment in silence again.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        What if there is more than one 
                        baby? How will we know which one is 
                        Rob?

                                 BRICK
                        Did we not just go over this!? Drop 
                        it already. We’ll roll up in there 
                        and be all hand over Rob. We’ll 
                        make sure we clarify we want Rob, 
                        alright.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Alright, sorry. I’ll drop it. 

                                 BRICK
                        This is no more complex than a 
                        smash and grab. We smash whoever is 
                        in our way and grab the Rob kid.

           A flickering neon sign that reads $29.99 SINGLE & FREE HBO 
           sits mounted at the entrance to the Shade Tree Motel. The 
           forty room flat level property is in terrible shape. Five 
           cars sit scattered throughout the motel in front of their 
           respective rooms. 

           The Maverick pulls into the parking lot and up toward the 
           office.

           McQueen is asleep in the passenger seat as Lincoln is curled 
           up in the back seat snoring.

           Brick shuts off the car.

                        few hours. Let’s just stay here.

           Brick opens his door and steps out, McQueen does the same. 
           They shut their doors simultaneously. 

           Lincoln darts up from the back seat to find an empty car. His 
           mowhawk is matted down and deep impressions mark his face 
           from sleeping so hard.

           Brick opens the door and turns on a lamp from a doorway 
           switch. McQueen and Lincoln stand behind him peering into the 
           room. They take notice that the room has one twin bed and two 
           cots. The bed is in decent shape while the cots are broken 
           down and slightly stained. 

           Brick makes his way over to the only bed and flops down face 
           first.

           McQueen and Lincoln grab Brick and begin to wrestle him off 
           of the bed. Brick violently puts up a fight.

           morning news on a small television that sits on the front

                        That ain’t bad.

           McQueen takes notice of a BROCHURE STAND sitting next to the 
           desk.

           He picks up a bunch of assorted pamphlets.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        These free?

           The clerk looks rather befuddled.

                        Yes sir, take as many as you want.

           The clerk hands McQueen the receipt.

           McQueen never takes his eyes off of the clerk as he continues 
           gathering pamphlets.

                                 CLERK

           The Maverick pulls up outside the front door. Bricks sits on 
           the horn.

           The Clerk watches through the front office window as McQueen 
           jumps into the Maverick.

                        You think all the cool stuff in 
                        movies is really just boring in 
                        real life?

           Brick and Lincoln look over at McQueen astonished at the 
           depth of his comment.

                                 BRICK
                        I bet if an astroid crashed into 
                        your damn home, or Chuck Norris 
                        kicked your door in you wouldn’t be 
                        too bored.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        True.

           The brothers get back into the Maverick, McQueen throws torn 
           up pieces of brochure out the window as the car drives away.

           EXT. CARLOS’ HOUSE - DAY

           The Maverick is parked hidden behind a tree line that borders 
           the house that sits quietly at the end of a dirt road.

           McQueen and Lincoln are loading themselves down with weapons 
           out of the trunk of the Maverick as Brick watches the house 
           through a pair of binoculars.

           McQueen shuts the trunk and walks around to Brick. He puts 
           his fake BADGE around his neck.

           Brick snatches it off.

                                 BRICK
                        Not this time. I’ve got a better 
                        plan.

           Brick turns to Lincoln.

                                 BRICK
                        You feeling strong?

           INT. CARLOS’ HOUSE - DAY

           Seven thuggish looking men sit around the living room of the 
           modest ranch style home. 

           The front door is broken down as a body is thrown through. 
           All of the men inside the house scurry for their guns and 
           point them at the body laying on the ground. Brick Oodie 
           shakes off the impact and looks around to see the guns being 
           pointed at him.

                                 BRICK
                        Hola.

                                 MCQUEEN (O.C.)
                        That plan wasn’t for shit.

           The men look toward the door, where the voice was coming 
           from.

                                 MCQUEEN (O.C.)
                        You still down?

           The men cock their weapons.

                                 BRICK
                        (to the men)
                        Wait a minute fellas, 
                        (to McQueen)
                        yeah!

           Through the dust and debris rounds are unloaded on the men 
           surrounding Brick, from outside.

           Brick pulls his guns out and begins shooting at the men as he 
           scrambles to get behind the couch.

           Two of the men turn to go out the back Lincoln busts through 
           close lining them simultaneously. McQueen quickly runs 
           through the front door and up the stairs dodging bullets 
           along the way. 

           Some of the men retreat into the kitchen. Mcqueen is about to 
           enter the hallway.

                                 MCQUEEN (SMIRK)
                        Here we go.

           McQueen draws his guns and faces the hallway.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Give us Ro!!!!

           A hail of bullets are fired through the hallway. Mcqueen 
           takes cover.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Shit!!

           Brick charges into the kitchen firing away. Mcqueen notices 
           Brick’s heroic push.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        We’re all fuckin impressed Brick.

           McQueen focuses, gets his guns prepared and moves into the 
           hallway. He shoots a guy coming down the hallway and ducks 
           into the first room he comes to. 

           He can still hear yelling and gunshots being fired from down 
           stairs as he slowly makes his way through the upstairs. He 
           hears rustling a few doors down. The door is cracked and he 
           can see, what he thinks, is the reflection from a gun in the 
           room. He inches down the hallway with a gun in each hand. 
           Just as he is about to reach the door he sees the reflection 
           move in the mirror through the crack. He immediately drops to 
           the floor and shoots through the door.

           He hears a body drop and sees blood come out from underneath. 
           McQueen stands up and slowly pushes the door open he can’t 
           quite get it all the way because the body is blocking the 
           path. He gives the door a good shove to reveal a SPANISH 
           WOMAN, THAT WAS TRYING TO HIDE, laying in a pool of blood and 
           ROB, 15 thin and pale sitting in a wheel chair wearing 
           pajamas that read: ROB.

           McQueen is taken aback for a moment at the site of Rob. 

                                 MCQUEEN
                        You Rob?

           INT. CARLOS’ HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           CARLOS enters the house stepping over bodies and destruction. 
           He is flanked by two of his men.

           One of the bodies laying face down on the ground begins 
           coughing up blood and wheezing. CARLOS walks over to DENNY, 
           45 large build, on the floor and kicks him over on to his 
           back.

                                 CARLOS
                        Denny, what happened here?

                                 DENNY
                        They took Rob.

                                 CARLOS
                        Who took Rob?

                                 DENNY
                        Th...Thr...Three guys came in 
                        and...

           DENNY begins to run short of breathe. Carlos steps on his 
           bloodied hand.

                                 DENNY
                        Ahhhh. They came in looking for 
                        Rob.

                                 CARLOS
                        Denny, I need you to hang in there 
                        buddy and tell me exactly what the 
                        hell happened.

           DENNY takes a few more breathes before giving out.

                                 CARLOS
                        Ah, shit! I knew that bitch 
                        wouldn’t give up.

           Carlos takes off and runs up the stairs to see for himself.

                                 CARLOS (O.C.)
                        Bastards killed my maid?!

           Carlos runs back down stairs, pulls himself together and 
           swallows his anger.  He turns to one of his men.

                                 CARLOS
                        Marty, I need my pills please.

                                 MARTIN
                        Yea sure thing.

           Martin hands him an iron tube that rattles with pills.

                                 CARLOS
                        Thank you.

           Carlos turns around and BEATS Martin with the long box of 
           pills; stabbing it into his face. After what seems like 
           fifteen stabs he tires himself out.

           Reveal that Martin is dead, with the long tube of pills 
           wedged in the bloody hole where his eye was.

                                 CARLOS ( RELAXED )
                        That’s better.

           Carlos calmly walks over to a closet that houses security 
           camera monitors. He immediately begins rewinding a tape.

           He pulls a cell phone from his pocket.

           He dials.

                        What the hell did Carlita do to 
                        these fuckers?

           The phone is ringing as he is watching the mayhem in reverse.

           Brick drives as McQueen sits in the passenger seat. Lincoln 
           is in the back next to Rob, who is obviously frightened as 
           tears roll down his cheek. The brothers have blood on their

           McQueen slaps his hand into his chest several times as to 
           imply he’s retarded.

           plantation style home. A few men in suits wander throughout 
           the downstairs mingling with the women.

           EVE, 30, beautifully trampy tattooed woman, is putting on a 
           tightly cut motorcycle jacket as she exits a bedroom at the 
           far end of the hall. The jacket has a logo on the back that 
           reads: FLAMEBANGERS

           Eve proceeds to walk down a long upstairs hallway. Bedroom 
           doors come one after another.

                                 EVE
                        Bangers! Bag it up, we got to move.

           As she walks past the second door, a scantily clad MONA, 21, 
           tall and thin falls in behind Eve.

           As they walk past the third door, JEZ, 22 petite Asian, 
           emerges with a sawed off shotgun she hands to Mona. Jez puts 
           on a pink satin jacket with a FLAMEBANGER LOGO on the back, 
           and falls in line as they walk.

           Eve, Mona and Jez continue down the hall as ANGEL and PAMMY, 
           23, extremely sluty/sexy twins simultaneously appear from the 
           last two bedrooms and join the pack. Angel and Pammy both 
           have matching semi- automatic assault rifles they sling over 
           their shoulders as all of the women, but Eve, finish 
           buttoning, zipping, or fastening their clothes. 

           All of the conversations downstairs come to a halt as they 
           approach.

           The five FLAMEBANGERS stride in a perfect “V” formation out 
           the front door and mount their individual motorcycles parked 
           in a row out in front of the house.

           The ladies crank up their bikes and begin to head east down a 
           long dirt driveway that ends at the brothel.

           apple pie sign sits on the counter. Booths line the walls as 
           waitresses serve coffee to their customers. The diner looks 
           like it was built in the early 80’s then left to fend for 
           itself. The place is as clean as it can be considering the 20  
           plus years of wear and tear it’s endured. Behind the counter 
           an older lady stands at the cash register. The kitchen can be 
           seen through a window in which the orders are served. It’s 
           the kind of place where “regulars” are often found. A 
           casually dressed Reyes and Millard sit in a booth drinking 
           coffee.

           The waitress, CANDICE, 43, thin and formerly cute, approaches 
           and sets two pieces of pie on the table.

                                 CANDICE
                        Anything else Mike?

                                 MILLARD
                        That’s it for now Candice but we’re 
                        gonna camp out here for awhile if 
                        that’s okay.

                                 CANDICE
                        Sure thing.

                                 MILLARD
                        Did you get enough to eat?

                                 REYES
                        Yeah everything was fine I 
                        appreciate you bringing me here. I 
                        hope you don’t mind but I brought 
                        the Oodie files with me.

                                 MILLARD
                        What for? This is where I come to 
                        get away from work.

                                 REYES
                        I’ve been looking through these 
                        files and I can’t even count how 
                        many cases we could build against 
                        them.

                                 MILLARD
                        I thought you said nothing sticks.

                                 REYES
                        From what I can tell, nobody has 
                        really tried. A handful of 
                        misdemeanors but everything 
                        criminal gets tossed. I want to 
                        know why no one takes them 
                        seriously.

                                 MILLARD
                        Boy you can’t take a hint can you.

                                 REYES
                        Excuse me?

                                 MILLARD
                        Son how bad at my job do you think   
                        I am?

                                        ©2008 Barry Battles & Griffin Hood
                                 REYES
                        Sir, that’s not what I was 
                        implying.

                                 MILLARD
                        Don’t you think if I wanted to 
                        stick something on these boys I 
                        could. Of course I know who the 
                        hell they are. Fact is we got a 
                        genie in a bottle with these red 
                        necks. 

                                 REYES
                        Are you sayin you help them? You’ve 
                        covered all this up?

                                 MILLARD
                        Oh, good grief. This ain’t some spy 
                        Nancy Clancy movie with some big 
                        ass conspiracy theory. Do you know 
                        how much federal and state money is 
                        spent prosecuting these bottom 
                        feeders that are out there? Way I 
                        see it I’m doing taxpayers a favor 
                        letting trash take out the trash. 
                        We could stop them, that’s true but 
                        somebody else would just replace 
                        them.

                                 REYES
                        You can not be serious.

                                 MILLARD
                        Why mess up a good thing? Let em do 
                        what they do and if things get out 
                        of hand we bring em down.

           Reyes takes it all in. He suddenly springs up.

                                 REYES
                        Wait, what time is it?

                                 MILLARD
                        Four fifteen.

                                 REYES
                        I gotta call the Mrs.

           As he gets up.

                                 MILLARD
                        All she’s doing is setting the tone 
                        for the rest of your married life.

                                        ©2008 Barry Battles & Griffin Hood
           Reyes walks off.

                                 REYES
                        Well when you get one of your 
                        marriages to work, you can talk to 
                        me. 

                                 MILLARD
                        Wise ass, I speak from experience. 

           Millard smirks, takes a sip of his coffee and watches 
           Candice’s rear as she strolls by. 

                                 MILLARD
                        My my.

                                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. RED STABLE BAR - EVENING

           A vacated bar called THE RED STABLE sits along the highway in 
           east Texas. The face of the bar looks like an old west saloon 
           complete with water troughs and horse ties. The Oodies 
           Maverick pulls into the parking lot.  

           To the side of the Red Stable is a group of six teenagers and 
           twenty-something kids, pissing off an angry dog in a cage. 
           Two of them, Jordan and Matthew are rattling the cage bars 
           and poking him with a stick, as the dog barks ferociously. 
           The four other boys are scattered about, drinking and finding 
           amusement at the antics.

           The Oodies casually walk up behind the two agitators. They 
           take notice of the men behind them and turn around to face 
           them. Brick stares right at Matthew.

                                 BRICK
                        Can I ask what you boys are doing?

           Jordan arrogantly gets between them.

                                 JORDAN
                        You can fuck off if yo----

           Lincoln punches Jordan in the face and begins wailing on him. 
           The young men are in shock as Lincoln just pummels the kid 
           into oblivion. After what seems like a minute of beating, he 
           throws his unconscious body into a stack of beer bottles and 
           leaves him there.  Brick then turns to Matthew.

                                        ©2008 Barry Battles & Griffin Hood
                                 BRICK
                        Sorry about that interruption. Now, 
                        can I ask what you’re doing?

           Matthew is scared, but clearly trying to put on his unafraid 
           face.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Nothing. Just having fun.

                                 BRICK
                        Fun huh? Does that pup look like 
                        he’s having fun to you?

           Brick takes the stick Matthew was using to poke the dog and 
           begins poking Matthew in the chest repeatedly.

                                 BRICK
                        Maybe I wanna have some fun.

           Brick continues to poke Matthew as he winces in pain, but 
           stands frozen.

                                 BRICK
                        You might be on to something, this 
                        is a grand ole time. You having 
                        fun? You think it’s fun to pick on 
                        something that can’t defend itself?  
                        What about that boy over there?

           Brick looks back at Rob.

                                 BRICK
                        You think it’d be fun to poke him 
                        with this here stick? Would that be  
                        fun?

                        (To Matthew’s friends in the back, 
                        but without taking his eyes off 
                        Matthew)

                        You boys better stop eyeballing me 
                        if you know what’s good for you.

           Marty, one of the friends bows up.

                                 MARTY
                        There’s five of us, and three of 
                        you.

                                 BRICK
                        Lincoln, shut that turd up.

                                        ©2008 Barry Battles & Griffin Hood
           The boys stand, readying themselves for a moment.

           Lincoln takes one step in their direction, and they scatter 
           frantically.

           Brick never takes his eyes off of Matthew. The two are locked 
           on each other.

                                 BRICK
                        You wanna run them numbers again? 
                        You see, you can’t cage a wild dog.    
                        It goes against nature. And ain’t 
                        nothing more powerful than mother 
                        nature. You may think you got the 
                        upper-hand, you hold the key, 
                        reinforce the bars. Eventually 
                        though, you’ll slip up. Because 
                        watching him is only a small 
                        fraction of your life, but getting 
                        out...that’s his whole reason for 
                        living.  That freedom is what 
                        drives him. Because ain’t nothing 
                        more important to a wild dog than 
                        his freedom. And if you’re standing 
                        in the way of that...BARK BARK!!!!   

           Matthew almost has a heart attack as he catches his breath.

                                 BRICK
                        That’s your ass.

           The Oodies walk away.

           INT. RED STABLE BAR - EVENING

           Brick and McQueen walk in first and begin to survey the 
           layout. An OLD MAN sits in the back portion of the bar four 
           feet from an old sixty inch projection television. The light 
           of the screen flickers on the old man’s face as the sounds of 
           moaning from porn are softly heard coming from the TV.

           The BARTENDER takes notice of Brick and McQueen as soon as 
           they walk in.

           There are no other patrons in the bar.

                                 BRICK
                        Classy joint you got here.

           The bartender takes notice of Brick’s Dixie flag tank top.

                                 RED STABLE BAR TENDER
                        Yeah thanks, nice shirt.

           Brick and McQueen chuckle.

                                 BRICK
                        That’s cute.

           McQueen grabs a seat at a table in anticipation of what might 
           transpire.

                                 BRICK
                        You mind having him cut that shit 
                        off?

                                 RED STABLE BAR TENDER
                        He’s ninety-eight years old, I 
                        think he’s earned the right to 
                        watch a little T and A.

                                 BRICK
                        What for? Unless he’s got a billion 
                        dollars it ain’t like he’s gonna 
                        marry one of them.

                                 RED STABLE BAR TENDER
                        He’s been sitting there watching 
                        that stuff for the ten years I’ve 
                        been working here. He can’t get 
                        enough.

                                 BRICK
                        Just turn it off.

                                 RED STABLE BAR TENDER
                        Mac’s not hurting anybody. You 
                        don’t want to see it don’t go back 
                        there.

                                 BRICK
                        If I go back there I’m gonna kick 
                        the shit out of Mac and your TV.

                                 RED STABLE BAR TENDER
                        Is that a fact?

                                 BRICK
                        We got a minor with us and I don’t 
                        want him listening to that.

           Lincoln enters pushing Rob in his wheelchair. 

           The bartender looks over Brick’s shoulder at Rob.

                                        ©2008 Barry Battles & Griffin Hood
           Brick smugly grins at the bartender in order to make him feel 
           bad. 

           The bartender sits three bottled beers and a soda on the 
           counter.

                                 RED STABLE BAR TENDER
                        Hey Mac why don’t you give it a 
                        rest for a little bit huh?

           The bartender punches the power button on the remote shutting 
           off the television. Mac doesn’t flinch he remains motionless 
           staring at the television.

           Brick turns around setting two beers and the soda on 
           McQueen’s table. He walks back and grabs a seat at the bar.

                        Mac?

           The bartender walks over to check on Mac feeling his neck for 
           a pulse. He lowers his head and closes his eyes.

                                 BRICK
                        Guess he got enough.

           McQueen holds up his bottle.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        To you Mac. You dirty old perv.

           The FLAMEBANGERS drive in a single file line past the Red 
           Stable Bar with Eve out in front. As soon as they pass by Eve 
           notices the Maverick sitting in the parking lot. She leads 
           them in a turn around pulling into the parking lot. 

           Eve parks directly next to the Maverick. She pulls a computer 
           print-out photo of a surveillance camera shot of the Maverick 
           leaving Carlos’

           McQueen sit with Rob at a table.

           They all turn toward the door as they hear the rumbling of 
           the Flamebanger’s motor cycles parking in the lot.

           The bartender is on the phone.

                                 RED STABLE BAR TENDER
                        Yes I’m going to need an ambulance 
                        down here at the Red Stable bar. 
                        Seems Mac has done past on.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        As soon as your done with that can 
                        we get the kid some food.

                                 RED STABLE BAR TENDER
                        Sure.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        (to Rob)
                        Damned if you ain’t like a golden 
                        ticket.

           The bar door flies open as Eve, Mona, Jez, Angel and Pammy 
           stroll in to survey the bar.

           All of the men turn to notice the Flamebangers, except for 
           Mac who still sits staring at the black television screen.

           The bartender finishes up his call quickly and hangs up the 
           phone.

                                 RED STABLE BAR TENDER
                        Hello ladies, what can I get for 
                        you?

           Eve stares at the Oodies.

                                 EVE
                        Don’t know what I’d like yet.

           Eve begins making her way over to an old juke box that sits 
           at the back of the bar. Eve pulls her hair up to reveal a 
           tattoo on her neck that reads Flamebangers under the 
           silhouette of a woman with her legs spread and flames coming 
           out from in between them.

           She looks upon Rob sitting at the table then her eyes make 
           their way over to McQueen who gives her a wink and a smile. 
           McQueen keeps his eyes locked on Eve as she walks toward the 
           back. Brick leans from his bar stool over to McQueen. Before 
           Brick can get a word out McQueen face shoves Brick.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Dibs.

                                 BRICK
                        Damnit.

           The rest of the girls grab a booth in the corner and 
           immediately start batting their eyes at the Oodie table.

           McQueen saunters up to Eve who is standing in front of the 
           juke box perusing the selection of songs.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        They got any David Allen Coe?

           Eve never looks up.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Names McQueen, can I buy you a 
                        drink?

                                 EVE
                        Names Eve and you can buy us a 
                        drink.

           Eve turns around and looks at the other girls. McQueen thinks 
           for a second then decides he’s game.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Bar tender! Some beers for my new 
                        friend Eve and her ladies.

                                 RED STABLE BAR TENDER
                        I’m gonna have to dig something up 
                        for the kid in the cooler, we ain’t 
                        got much.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Figure it out.

                                 EVE
                        What’s with the kid?

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Uh that’s our little brother.

           Eve looks over at Rob in his pajamas.

                                 EVE
                        Is it bedtime?

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Something like that, maybe.

                                 EVE
                        Great place for him to be in.

                        He can hold his own.

                                 EVE
                        And him?

           Eve looks over at Lincoln.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        My other brother Lincoln.

                                 EVE
                        And the fella at the bar that won’t 
                        stop staring at me?

                                 MCQUEEN
                        That’s my older brother Brick he’s 
                        born with out a pecker real sad. So 
                        what’s your story?

           Eve presses J5 on the panel selecting: ANGEL by MASSIVE 
           ATTACK

                                 EVE
                        No story just riding free. You 
                        wanna dance?

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Hells yeah.

           McQueen grabs a chair from a nearby table and sits squarely 
           in front of Eve in preparation for a lap dance.

                                 EVE
                        Not like that.

           She grabs McQueen by the collar leading him to a small cube 
           of dance floor in the middle of the bar.

           As she moves with McQueen the other Flame Bangers take their 
           que and begin moving into place.

           Mona makes her way over to Brick and begins seductively 
           dancing for him. He grabs her firmly so she can continue her 
           dance on his lap.

           Pammy and Angel glide over to Lincoln, pulling him up and 
           away from Rob, leading him over to a booth where each girl 
           straddles a leg and comes together closing him off from the 
           room.

           Eve removes McQueen’s belt and uses it much like a stripper 
           uses a boa as they dance.

           The Oodies are in a hypnotized trance as the music grinds on.

           Jez slowly makes her move over to Rob and begins wheeling him 
           out when Lincoln notices what she is doing through a crack in 
           between Pammy and Angle.

           Lincoln raises up sending the girls flying off of his lap in 
           opposing directions.

           Without saying a word he marches directly toward Jez and Rob 
           only to be stabbed in the back by Pammy. He slowly turns 
           around to face his assailant while removing the knife from 
           his back. She stands in awe of the fact that Lincoln never 
           flinched. He quickly grabs her by the hair and spins her 
           around and stabs her in the back in the very same spot he was 
           stabbed.

           Pammy screams as she drops to the ground. 

           Everyone takes notice.

           Jez hastily continues to wheel Rob out of the bar, with 
           Lincoln in pursuit. Angel pops up to finish what Pammy 
           started but before she can get within striking distance of 
           Lincoln he turns around and punches her in the face exploding 
           her nose and knocking her off her feet. 

           McQueen attempts to sling Eve off of him and assist his 
           brother when she whips his own belt around his neck and 
           begins to strangle him from behind. She plants her stiletto 
           heel in the small of his back to give her leverage for the 
           choke. The heel begins to pierce through his shirt as blood 
           begins to soak to the surface from the puncture wound she is 
           creating over McQueen’s spine. 

           Lincoln turns around to find that Jez and Rob are gone.

           Mona head butts Brick staggering him momentarily. When she 
           goes in for a second one he swiftly moves to the side 
           slamming her head into the bar railing.

           McQueen struggles to get the belt from around his neck, but 
           once he does Eve kicks him into the bar. Her leg lands back 
           on the ground awkwardly as she notices that she broke her 
           heel off into McQueen’s back.

           Eve grins as she backs up to the door.

           Lincoln, Brick and McQueen stagger together at the bar 
           against the lone Eve, who stands in between them and the 
           door. As they make their way toward Eve, Jez returns with a 
           semi-automatic rifle.

           The confident brothers turn around in retreat diving over the 
           bar as Jez opens fire.

           RED STABLE BAR COOLER - CONTINUOUS

           The bar tender looks around thinking he hears some racket 
           going on outside. He shakes it off and continues to look for 
           anything edible for Rob to eat. 

                                                CUT BACK TO:

           INT. RED STABLE BAR

           Bottle shards rain down on the brothers as McQueen spots a 
           sawed off shotgun mounted on a swivel under the bar. He slaps 
           the handle so the gun will rotate toward Brick. Brick meets 
           the handle and blasts a hole through the bar sending Jez back 
           out the door in a violent fury.

           Brick, McQueen, and Lincoln peer at Eve through the hole in 
           the bar.

           Brick pulls the trigger again to an empty chamber. Eve turns 
           and runs out the door. The brothers hop over the bar and 
           follow.

                                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. RED STABLE BAR - NIGHT

           Eve stands outside the door of the bar holding a pipe she 
           picked up, ready to connect with the first Oodie out the door 
           she sees.

           As Lincoln comes barreling through, Eve swings only to have 
           her pipe caught by a suspecting Lincoln. He snatches the 
           pipe, smacks her in the knee with it before slinging it 
           across the road.

           McQueen and Brick follow behind Lincoln and quickly spot Rob 
           sitting, quite upset, next to Jez’s bike. They run over to 
           secure Rob’s safety. 

           As Eve back peddles Lincoln marches steadily toward her. She 
           drops to her knees to beg for mercy when Lincoln sweetly 
           caresses her head before snapping her neck.

           Lincoln stares down at the Flame Banger tattoo on her neck, 
           then puts her hair down to cover over it.

           INT. RED STABLE BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           The bar tender comes out of the kitchen holding a plate 
           littered with celery, cheese and a few crackers. He stops in 
           his tracks looking at what is left of his bar and the bodies 
           of the remaining Flame Bangers splattered across the floor. 
           Mac still sits in the chair unmoved by the events. A 
           paramedic cautiously comes through the front. The bar tender 
           and paramedic stare at each other in complete silence.

           INT. MAVERICK - MOMENTS LATER

           Brick drives down the road, Lincoln is in the passenger’s 
           seat, McQueen is sitting in the back with Rob.

                        I don’t know but that bitch broke 
                        her damn heel off in my back.

                                 BRICK
                        They were after Rob, but who the 
                        hell sent them is what I wanna 
                        know?

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Maybe Celeste thought we’d double 
                        cross her because if it was Carlos, 
                        he got them on us fast.

                                 BRICK
                        We’re sure as hell gonna find out.

           Lincoln removes a blood soaked stained shirt exposing his 
           stab wound. Brick, McQueen and even Rob grimace at the sight 
           of it. 

                                 BRICK
                        That bitch stabbed you?

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Hells yeah, Rambo time.

           McQueen pulls out a Rambo style knife that was taped under 
           the driver’s seat. He opens the handle to get out the 
           supplies he needs to sew up the wound. 

                                 MCQUEEN
                        You might wanna bite on somethin I 
                        got a feeling this is gonna hurt.

                                 BRICK
                        You need me to pull over to do 
                        that?

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Why?

           McQueen pours out some whiskey on a piece of clothe after 
           which he takes a swig for himself and presses the clothe on 
           the wound. Lincoln just sits stoic taking the pain like it 
           was nothing. McQueen sticks the needle into the skin and 
           waits for a moment expecting Lincoln to react.

           Lincoln does not.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Look at him! Look at him take it! 
                        Look at him Brick he’s takin it.

                                 BRICK
                        He’s takin it like Drago.

           INT. POLICE STATION - MORNING

           Millard sits at his desk when Reyes comes in tossing a 
           newspaper down in front of him.

                                 REYES
                        Looks like they went too far!

           Millard picks up the paper reading the headline. “Bar room 
           massacre”.

                        If you read a little further it 
                        says there was a 15 year old 
                        crippled boy in a wheelchair with 
                        them. The name Rob was monogrammed

                        his mother seven years ago when he 
                        was eight.

           Millard looks perplexed.

                        Spivo’s wife, Teresa fled with Rob 
                        when he was eight. Stole half a

                        but I guess it takes a lot of money 
                        to hide, because two years ago she 
                        resurfaced and went to the feds and 
                        turned states evidence on her 
                        husband.

                        Report says she and the boy were 
                        offered protection in exchange for 
                        ratting him out. They were 
                        relocated to a safe house in Biloxi 
                        Mississippi, but apparently she’d 
                        had enough of the quiet life and 
                        after about a year or so started 
                        finagling every river boat gambler 
                        that would buy her a decent dress.

           MONTAGE: A much more glammed up Teresa Spivo is hanging all 
           over an OLD GAMBLER in the middle of a Biloxi Casino. She 
           blows on his dice before he rolls at a craps table. Carlos 
           and Celeste are also at the table. Teresa, the Old Gambler, 
           and Rob are dining at the Casino as Carlos and Celeste watch 
           them.

                        I’m thinking she let the wrong 
                        people get the impression she was 
                        loaded because Rob was kidnapped, 
                        or I guess I should say, re-
                        kidknapped about six months ago.

                        What do you mean it wasn’t the 
                        Oodies? They had the kid at that 
                        bloodbath.

                        I’m telling you, they wouldn’t be 
                        the kidnappers.

           EXT. GAS STATION - MORNING

           The Maverick pulls into the parking lot of a service station. 
           The station is the only building visible on a long stretch of 
           highway besides a small trailer that sits about 100 yards 
           away most likely owned by the people that run the gas 
           station. A single pay phone stands in the parking lot 
           seemingly like the rest of the surroundings to have been 
           untouched for years. The lone gas pump appears to have been 
           installed in the nineteen seventies.

           McQueen pours himself out of the car still half asleep and 
           grabs the wheelchair to put Rob in.

           Brick makes his way over to the pay phone.

           McQueen pushes Rob toward the gas station popping wheelies 
           with the chair as he walks.

           Brick reaches in his pocket pulling out a few quarters and a 
           small piece of paper with Celeste’s number on it.

           The clerk, 46 wafer thin wearing a short sleeve button down 
           that looks as if at one time was some shade of white sits 
           behind the counter. He takes a moment to look up from his six 
           inch television to see what’s going on. The news pops up with 
           a special bulletin displaying artist renderings of the Oodie 
           brothers and Rob. 

           The clerk takes a moment to look back and forth between the 
           television and McQueen who is holding up t-shirts for Rob to 
           look at.

           clerk.

           McQueen and Rob at gunpoint. Lincoln steps out of the car 
           stretching and looks around. He notices Brick on the phone 
           and turns around to the commotion going on inside. He pulls 
           the scatter gun out of the door of the Maverick and marches 
           toward the gas station.

           The door chimes as the clerk swings around with the shotgun. 
           His mouth drops and he lowers the gun as Lincoln towers over 
           him holding the scatter gun at his face. McQueen snatches the 
           shotgun out of the clerks hands.

           of the events that are going on behind him as McQueen waves 
           the shotgun around yelling at the clerk. He begins to grab 
           things off the shelves waving them in the clerk’s face before 
           handing them off to Rob.

                        Mr. Amberson, I won’t take much of 
                        your time, I’m sure you’re busy so 
                        I’ll just take a minute. Before you 
                        deny what I’m about to say I want 
                        you to know that I have proof and 
                        know for a fact that you are in

                        his lawyer, you handle all of his 
                        family business.

                        something he’s been wanting back

                        and yes, this information will cost

           INT. CARLOS’ HOUSE - DAY

           Carlos is pacing back and forth while watching a news 
           broadcast on the RED STABLE BAR shoot out.

           He has several cleaning ladies scrubbing the blood stains out 
           of his floor while he paces around them on his cell phone.

                                 CARLOS
                        I don’t know, I guess if you do the 
                        math, five whore assassins can’t 
                        trump three retards and a cripple.

           Carlos walks over to one of the cleaning ladies.

                                 CARLOS
                        That looks great, when you get 
                        finished here can you hit the 
                        upstairs bathroom? Are you 
                        available full time? 

           Carlos goes back to his phone call.

                                 CARLOS
                        Listen, I don’t know where they are 
                        exactly! But as best I can guess 
                        they should be getting close to 
                        your area, but then again that’s 
                        not my job to figure out. Isn’t 
                        that your thing? You guys own the 
                        road or some shit like that?

           Carlos listens.

                                 CARLOS
                        That’s fine, I don’t care if you 
                        kill them, just bring me back the 
                        boy.

           Carlos hangs up the phone and walks back over to the same 
           cleaning lady.

           passenger seat, at the tiny television that sits in his lap 
           watching the ongoing news report. Brick drives as Lincoln and

           chunking it out the window. Millard can be heard through the 
           cell phone asking what is happening. McQueen goes wide eyed

           road. He starts to punch McQueen but McQueen squirts out of 
           the passenger side and runs. Brick climbs out and chases 
           McQueen through a field. Lincoln gets out of the car and 
           walks away.

           Rob sits patiently watching all of this unfold.

           An old closed garage sits in a desolate area. Rust covers 
           almost all of the three bay door structure that has an old 
           tin sign which used to read: LEXON FUELS now has a JOLLY 
           ROGER (pirate) logo painted over it.

           The door, to what used to be, the office area springs open as 
           MONTANE, 30, filthy leather clad leader emerges. He has long 
           dreadlocks and his left eye is completely white.

           He chews on a cigar as he squints at the sun. He puts on a 
           pair of sunglasses that have one lens, to cover his 
           functioning eye leaving the other side open to expose his 
           white iris.

           As Montane starts walking over toward the bay doors, SMOKE, 
           27, dust covered mechanic pops up and follows behind Montane.

                                 SMOKE
                        Hood pirates!

           The three bay doors rise up simultaneously.

           RONDO, 33, massive and tattoo covered from head to toe 
           emerges first.

           TUCKER, 20, thin and ripped, follows behind.

           MEWES, 33, short and stocky brings up the rear. 

           They all fall in line as a black flat bed truck pulls out of 
           the middle garage door. It is modified to look similar to a 
           sailing vessel, with wooden sides complete with gun ports and 
           an eleven foot crows nest that rises from the middle. 

           DIGG, 21, bearded Rastafarian, drives the impressive truck 
           that reads: THE NUBIAN PRINCESS across the back. All of the 
           other Hood Pirates climb aboard as it is pulling away from 
           the garage.

                        I don’t know. I was embarrassed.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Well damn, it’s not like you was 
                        the one all buggered up.

                                 BRICK
                        I’m telling you now.

           McQueen ponders the new information.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        How’d he die?

                                 BRICK
                        Not sure. He was there one day and 
                        gone the next. That’s about all I 
                        know. 

           The two sit in silence for a moment. 

                                 MCQUEEN
                        What was his name? 

           Brick contemplates the question.

                                 BRICK
                        Nothing, they never named him.

           The Nubian Princess is barrelling down the highway. Tucker is 
           perched in the crows nest with a pair binoculars looking down 
           the road.

           He spots the Oodies Maverick ahead in the distance.

           Digg steps on the gas while all the other member of the HP, 
           that are in the back, start gathering weapons.

           Montane raises a JOLLY ROGER FLAG (skull & cross bones) to 
           the top of the crow’s nest.

           The Hood Pirates cheer.

           Brick is listening to McQueen when he double takes into the 
           rear view mirror.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        ...I mean what the Hell? I know 
                        daddy was a sack of shit, but not 
                        gonna name a kid because he’s got a 
                        case of the cripples,...that’s 
                        just, that’s just... wrong.

                        What the hell?

           Brick’s eyes are fixated on the mirror and not the road in 
           front of them at all.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        What?

           McQueen turns around to see the Nubian Princess gaining on 
           them rather quickly.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        You want to step it up a bit?

                                 BRICK
                        Yeah, I’m gonna do that.

           Brick puts the accelerator to the floor as McQueen and 
           Lincoln start loading guns.

                                 BRICK
                        Strap him in.

           The Nubian Princess catches up to the Maverick and pulls 
           along side them. Only Digg, the driver, is visible.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        What the hell is this mess?

           McQueen sticks a shotgun out the window and points it at 
           Digg.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Hey! Stankhead! You best back the 
                        hell off!

                        Is that all you got?

           The gun ports along the side of the Princess open up as 
           shotguns spring from all three port openings.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Ah Hell, Brick!

           Brick sees the arsenal and slams on the breaks.

                                 MONTANE
                        FIRE!

           The Maverick burns rubber off of the tires as the Princess 
           flies by firing all their guns. They miss the brunt of the 
           assault, but the radiator is hit.

           Smoke begins to poor out from under the hood of the Maverick.

                                 BRICK
                        They did not just do that.

           Brick once again steps on the gas.

           Now with the Maverick behind the Princess McQueen hangs 
           himself out of the passenger side window. Lincoln does the 
           same on the driver side as they both fire shotgun blast into 
           the back of the Princess, which they are now within ten feet 
           of.

           Their blast are merely scratching the surface of the back of 
           the Princess.

           The mayhem passes by a POLICE CAR sitting behind a ground 
           level billboard.

           Brick looks ahead as weapons protrude from the gun ports that

           Brick and McQueen look at each other in amazement.

                        Well, that definitely was 
                        something.

           All they can do is watch as muzzle flashes and stray bullets 
           come from the back of the ship.

           Tucker, the only Hood Pirate visible to the Maverick, is 
           yanked down by the ankle from the crow’s nest.

           Blast are continually heard as the Princess swerves

           As soon as Brick pulls them even with the cab of the truck 
           McQueen extends the shotgun to find Lincoln in the driver 
           seat struggling with the manual transmission.

           The vehicles come to a stop.

           They are the only things visible on an endless stretch of two-
           lane highway.

           McQueen hops out immediately and trots over to Lincoln. Brick 
           jumps out but turns to Rob.

                                 BRICK
                        You doing okay? Just hang tight, 
                        I’m gonna be right back.

           Brick follows McQueen.

           Lincoln opens the door and climbs out over a dead Digg, in 
           the passenger seat.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        How the shit did you pull that off?

           Lincoln holds his side to cover over a bloodied gun shot 
           wound.

           McQueen sticks his gun into the cab of the Princess first, 
           then follows with his head.

           He finds a massive hole Lincoln blasted into the cab from the 
           back of the truck.

           Maverick.

                        level.

           Lincoln reaches in the car and grabs his Speak-n-spell.

           Lincoln types again.

                        Okay.

           Lincoln tosses his speak-n-spell back into the car.

           Brick sticks his finger into Lincoln’s side wound. Before 
           Lincoln can swat Brick’s hand away he grimaces in extreme 
           pain then passes out.

                        Fine my ass. Told you.

           Brick goes around to the front of the Maverick and pops the 
           hood.

           Smoke billows out as he finds most of the radiator in shards.

                                 BRICK

           wrapped up in a pappous made from the jolly roger flag. The

           INT. MEXICAN VAN - LATER

           Lincoln is laying in the middle of the van as ARIANA, 27  
           BEAUTIFUL HISPANIC WITH STRIKING FEATURES, looks over his 
           wound. Brick, McQueen, Rob and a small Mexican child sit on 
           the floor of the van as they all look on.

                                 ARIANA
                        What’s his name?

                        Lincoln? Can you hear me?

           She slaps the nonresponsive Lincoln.

                        How long has he been out?

                        I can stitch your friend up but he 
                        really needs a hospital.

           She notices the bad stitch job on his back.

                        What happened here?

                                 MCQUEEN
                        I did that.

                        The stabbing or the stitches?

           McQueen chuckles.

           Ariana does not.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        The stitches.

                                 ARIANA
                        It’s a miracle he hasn’t died of 
                        infection.

                        Let me guess, you saw it in a 
                        movie.

                        The human body is meant to endure 
                        but he is pushing it. He’s going to 
                        need to rest for a couple of weeks.

                        I said you’re stupid. Willing to 
                        risk the life of your brother for

                        you are mixed up in but if you want

                        And what about him?

           Ariana looks over to Rob.

                                 ARIANA
                        Is he your brother too?

           INT. MEXICAN VAN - LATER

           Lincoln is propped up in the back of the van. The color in 
           his face is starting to come back. He has bandages around his 
           mid section and a new dressing over his old stab wound.

           McQueen and the small Mexican boy are asleep curled up near 
           one another.

           There is still a tension between Brick and Ariana

                        Our town was run by a man who 
                        didn’t care about the well being of 
                        the people. After our father was 
                        murdered I couldn’t stay and put 
                        the rest of my family at risk.

                        Violence only brings more violence. 
                        We may have had peace for awhile 
                        but then somebody else would have 
                        taken over. Good people become 
                        corrupt and it all starts again.

           Brick begins to light a cigarette.

                                 ARIANA
                        Don’t do that.

           Brick puts the cigarette back in the pack.

                                 CELESTE
                        Salt in the wound. I win. You lose.   
                        Bitch.

           Celeste hangs up the phone. Carlos smashes is repeatedly on 
           the counter top. 

           Even though the phone receiver is smashed to bits Carlos 
           still picks it up and screams into it.

                                 CARLOS
                        Durango Inn it is! Now, I’m going 
                        to have to kill the boy just for 
                        spite! See how much Spivo trust you 
                        when Rob’s head is on his door 
                        step!

           The new house keeper is working in the background.

           Carlos looks like he’s going to explode.

           EXT. DURANGO INN - DAY

           An old sign sits high in the sky. Most of the bulbs are 
           smashed or blown out, but it still clearly reads: THE DURANGO 
           INN.

           The MEXICAN VAN is pulling into the parking lot of what is 
           left of the Durango Inn Motel. The run down property sits off 
           of an old highway that hasn’t had traffic or seen costumers 
           in ten years. Nothing can be seen around the property, just 
           dust and dead foliage surround the Inn for as far as the eye 
           can see.  

                                 ARIANA
                        Are you sure this is where you want 
                        us to drop you?

                                 BRICK
                        Yeah, this is it.

           The van parks for a moment.

           The side cargo doors open and McQueen hops out first. He then 
           pulls Rob out in his wheel chair.

           Brick helps a weakened Lincoln get out of the van.

                                 ARIANA
                        It’s none of my business, but 
                        whatever it is that's about to go 
                        down here, please keep the kid 
                        safe. He doesn’t deserve this.

                                 BRICK
                        Nothing bad is gonna go on, we’re 
                        just gonna finish up a job.

                                 ARIANA
                        I’m foreign, not stupid. I’ve seen 
                        a lot of bad things and most of 
                        them start like this.

           Brick gives Ariana a knowing smirk.

                        And change his bandages, I don’t 
                        want to lose another patient.

           Ariana winks at Brick and shuts the door.

           Brick, McQueen, and Lincoln stand and wave goodbye to the van 
           as the brother, his wife and baby sit in the front seat 
           waving back wearing the Hood Pirate gear.

                      BRICK

           Brick smacks McQueen.

                        I’m just playing.

           The cell phone rings in Lincoln’s pocket.

                                 BRICK
                        Where’s that comin from?

                        Grab it out see who it is.

           Lincoln shoots Brick a look, grimaces and pulls the phone out 
           himself handing it to Brick.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Answer it.

           McQueen grabs the phone from Brick and answers.

           The four story SILVERSTAR CASINO sits attached to it’s eight 
           story HOTEL in Philadelphia, MS. Cars, buses, and motorcycles 
           liter the massive parking lot. A colorful electronic marquee 
           sign sits atop the set of four revolving doors at the 
           entrance of the casino. The sign reads: SILVERSTAR CASINO 
           OWNED AND OPERATED BY A BAND OF MISSISSIPPI CHOCTAW INDIANS.

           The revolving doors begin to spin as seven leather vest 
           wearing Native Americans exits the casino. Their eyes never 
           look anywhere but straight ahead as they emerge stoically.

           They all have long straight hair, that is pulled back tightly 
           in a pony tail. Their vests have an emblem stitched across 
           their backs of two crossing tomahawks and a banner that 
           reads: THE NATION 

           They all fall into a “V” formation as they descend down the 
           front steps into the parking lot. They are led by CHOGAN, 40, 
           chiseled physique under leathery skin, who leads them to 
           their motorcycles that sit parked in HANDICAPPED spaces 
           directly in front of the casino.

           NASTAS, 27, tall and muscular, has a six inch scar right at 
           his hair line and adorns braided scalps down the seams of his 
           vest. 

           They pull new stainless silver hatchets and sawed off 
           shotguns from saddle bags at the back of their bikes and 
           mount them into holsters near the gas tanks.

           The Nation mount their individual model of vintage Indian 
           Motorcycles and roar through the parking lot, nearly running 
           over several patrons that are in their way.

           EXT. DURANGO INN - DAY

           Brick and McQueen kick the door to one of the rooms in. Dust 
           stirs everywhere unlocking a room that’s been vacant for 
           several years. Spider webs hang from the ceiling and across 
           the door frame, signs are stapled to the plywood covering the 
           windows that reads “Condemned”. Brick looks at the sign.

                                 BRICK
                        That’s fitting.

           Brick and McQueen help Lincoln into the room and lay him down 
           on a ratty mattress that sits on the floor in the corner. 
           Graffiti covers the floral pattern wallpaper. 

                                 MCQUEEN
                        If we make it through this you 
                        think your girlfriend can let us 
                        stay at a nice hotel for once?

                        Just grab the bag.

           McQueen steps back outside and tosses the bag through the 
           door. Brick steps outside with McQueen and strikes up a 
           cigarette.

                                 BRICK
                        Well I guess we better have a look 
                        around see what we got to work 
                        with.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        What about Rob?

                                 BRICK
                        You can bring him, just leave 
                        Lincoln to rest.

           McQueen steps back inside and wheels Rob out of the door.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Did you try Runt again?

                                 BRICK
                        Can’t, seems they finally shut the 
                        phone off.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Lasted longer than I thought.

           McQueen continues to pop wheelies with Rob’s wheelchair. 

           EXT. CUTTER’S GARAGE - DAY

           A gravel parking lot surrounds a pieced together mechanic’s 
           garage. The sheets of tin metal look like patch work thrown 
           together to create the outer walls of the building.

           Singing can be heard from inside the garage. The garage door 
           is lifted open revealing RUNT BEGGLEY, 30, he stands at 5’6” 
           his hair is greased back. He appears to have just crawled out 
           of the engine of a car. His faded wranglers are held up by a 
           belt that has RUNT branded into the back of it and a rebel 
           flag belt buckle. He has on a sleeveless button up shirt with 
           a wife beater underneath. He holds a chain in his hand that 
           is attached to the feet of a man lying on the ground behind 
           him.

                                 RUNT
                       (singing)
                        Can’t pay on time now you gotta 
                        ride the train on out in the mornin

           Runt exits the garage dragging the body behind him. The man 
           is bloodied bound and gagged obviously trying to plead with 
           Runt.

                                 RUNT
                       (singing)
                        Gonna find my hammer in this truck 
                        gonna find that hammer and fix you 
                        up.

           Runt opens the door to his 1987 CHEVY SILVERADO he notices 
           the light blinking on his cell phone. He picks it up to check 
           the voice mail. He continues to hum while digging through a 
           tool box pulling out a small hammer putting it back and 
           grabbing a bigger one. The man on the ground continues to 
           plead through the piece of clothe shoved in his mouth. 

                                 RUNT
                       (singing)
                        Gotta improvise cause my cousin’s 
                        are in trouble. I was just gonna 
                        beat you with hammer now I’m gone 
                        drag you with my truck.

           While Runt is singing he grabs the chain and wraps it around 
           the trailer hitch on the truck. The man begins to kick and 
           wail violently.

           EXT. MERIDIAN MIDDLE SCHOOL - LATER

           Runt’s truck pulls into the parking lot while an empty chain 
           rattles on the pavement as it drags behind the truck. The 
           school is average looking. Children can be heard playing on 
           the playground that is nothing but a cloud of dust. Runt gets 
           out of the truck and makes his way up to the front of the 
           school.

           Runt enters the principal’s office. From the inside 
           everything is very plain, it obviously hasn’t been renovated 
           in several years.

           A SECRETARY, 70, wrinkled and sweaty, sits pecking away on a 
           1990 macintosh computer. A SMALL GIRL, 7, blonde with what 
           used to be pigtails, sits waiting in one of the chairs. Her 
           pink dress is filthy, obviously from romping around on the 
           playground. The secretary looks up as Runt enters.

                                 SECRETARY
                        May I help you?

           teachers desk making out with a SEXY FEMALE TEACHER in an 
           empty classroom.

                        Yeah? What’d he call you?

           The little girl leans over to whisper into Runt’s ear. Runt’s 
           face goes sour.

                                 RUNT
                        The hell are they teaching you kids

           DIRT enters the office. He’s sweaty and disheveled as he 
           tucks the remainder of his shirt back into his pants. 

           As he rounds the corner he spots Runt first.

                                 SECRETARY

                        “assistance” with some guns.

           Dirt shakes his head at Runt’s inability to be discreet.

                        For what it’s worth I think you 
                        deserve more than what you’ve been 
                        through. Ain’t right people using 
                        you just because you can’t help 
                        yourself. I know you may not have 
                        had a lot of people in your life 
                        you could look up to and I sure as 
                        hell ain’t tellin you to look up to 
                        us, I just want you to know we’re 
                        gonna do everything we can to keep 
                        you from getting hurt. I better go 
                        in and see if Brick needs my help. 
                        Why don’t you just stay out here 
                        and be the lookout. 

           McQueen stands up and slaps Rob on the back. He goes inside 
           the room.

           Brick has brought a chair out into the dirt parking area of 
           the motel. He sits with his elbows on his knees looking down 
           at the ground, smoking.

           In the midst of complete quiet, he hears the faint sound of 
           an engine.

           He looks up.

           In the distance he see’s dust kicking up from a vehicle 
           approaching.

           Brick darts up and grabs a rifle he had lying next to his 
           feet.

           He targets the vehicle, through the mounted scope, that is 
           quickly nearing.

           As he is lining up the cross hairs he recognizes a mowhawk 
           sporting Rob perched up in the back of the truck. 

           Rob screams with excitement as they make their way toward

                        from El Paso to here we can’t run 
                        no more. It ends here one way or

           Dirt walks over to the bed of the truck and pulls a blanket 
           off a bevy of guns. A crate sits to the side with U.S. 
           Government stamped on the side.

           INT. COMMUTER AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

           Celeste is sitting by herself on a row of seats in a sparsely 
           populated commuter airport terminal. 

           She is fumbling through her large purse when a MAN, 55, 
           casually dressed in business attire walks up and sits down in 
           a seat that directly faces Celeste.

           He opens up a news paper.

                                 MAN
                        These gas prices are unbelievable.

           Celeste looks up from her purse.

                                 CELESTE
                        Excuse me?

           The man drops the paper to his lap.

                                 MAN

                        I said these gas prices are getting 
                        out of control.

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh, yeah. I don’t think it’s ever 
                        going to end.

                                 MAN
                        No, it’s going to end.

           Celeste smirks uncomfortably and goes back to her purse.

                                 MAN
                        So where you headed?

                                 CELESTE
                        Just taking a little vacation.

                                 MAN
                        That’s great. I guess you could go 
                        anywhere in the world, with the 
                        kind of money Mr. Amberson paid 
                        you.

           Celeste drops her purse.

                                 CELESTE
                        Look, we had a deal. It was a 
                        business arrangement. I didn’t have 
                        anything to do with the Spivo kid 
                        being abducted. I just found out 
                        about it and called Mr. Amberson.

                                 MAN
                        Ma’am I appreciate you telling me 
                        this, but I’m not the guy you need 
                        to explain this too.

                                 CELESTE
                        Let’s not bullshit each other here. 
                        What are going to do? I don’t think 
                        you’re going to kill me out here in 
                        public. You need me to get the 
                        money and I really don’t think...

           The man shoots five shots rapidly into her chest from a 
           silenced nine millimeter concealed under the news paper. 

           Celeste is stopped in mid sentence as she falls back in her 
           seat.

           A few on lookers turn around, but do nothing since they are 
           not sure what the five “thuds” they heard was.

                                 MAN
                        Some things aren’t about money.

           The man gets up and walks over to Celeste who is gargling 
           blood with her last breath.

                                 MAN
                        You can’t extort a man like Mr. 
                        Spivo. This will always happen. 

           The man walks away from Celeste down the terminal.

           No one does a thing.

           EXT: GAS STATION

           The cops who escorted Millard are waiting in their car. COP 
           is twirling Millard’s handcuffs around on his finger.

           COP #2 notices.

           They both take a moment and look at the bathroom door.

           Knocking is heard on the bathroom door.

           EXT. DURANGO INN - LATER

           Three black SUVs roll up in front of the motel. Eleven 
           different men, wearing dark casual suits, emerge from the 
           vehicles. They all have pistols or semi-automatic rifles.

                                        ©2008 Barry Battles & Griffin Hood
           RAY, 50, thick black coif of hair sits atop thick Italian 
           man. He pulls a hand gun from a shoulder holster concealed 
           under his navy blazer.

           Ray and the men look around to find that all of motel doors 
           have been kicked in.

                                 RAY
                        I know you’re here! Bring out Mr. 
                        Spivo’s son and all of this will go 
                        away.

           Ray leans over to one of his men.

                                 RAY
                        Kill anything not in a wheelchair.

           Ray looks around for the voice but finds nothing.

                                 RAY
                        I’m the man sent to get Rob,

                        Yeah, yeah, yeah, just bring the 
                        little bastard out!

                        Runt!

           Ray is rocketed to the ground.

           The echo of Runt’s sniper bullets rings all around the area.

           Ray’s men scatter as they look down to find Ray dead on the 
           ground with blood pouring out of the bullet hole in his 
           forehead spilling into his coif of hair.

           Runt chambers another round while he lays hidden in a 
           sniper’s nest two-hundred yards away from the motel.

           Brick pops out from room 27, at the back end of the property. 
           He opens fire on the men and SUVs.

           As they return fire, Brick ducks back into the room.

           McQueen comes out of room 3, at the front end of the 
           property.

           He opens fire, drawing their attention away from Brick.

           As the men turn to fire at McQueen, Brick pops out of room 
           14, in the middle of the property. He fires at the cluster of 
           men, dropping two of them.

           Even though, they are trying to hide behind their car doors, 
           Runt is successfully piercing the doors landing kill shots.

                                 RUNT

                        Saw that on Mythbusters. Don’t 
                        protect you from shit.

           Brick retreats back into room 14, while McQueen burst out 
           from room 11 firing away.

           Bricks runs from inside room 14 through the adjoining door 
           into room 15, through a hole they made in the wall into room 
           16, through it’s adjoining door into room 17.

           He pops out the door and fires at the disoriented men and the 
           SUVs.

           After he fires he ducks back into the room. He waits for a 
           moment but doesn’t hear the sound of McQueen’s gunfire.

           Brick peaks his head out to find one of the men holding 
           McQueen at gun point.

           He’s using McQueen as a shield.

                        Brick!

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Say cheese.

           A shot drops McQueen as a bullet pierces his shoulder. 
           McQueen’s blood squirts all over the henchmen.

           McQueen has to improvise and grabs the gun away from his 
           assailant, shooting the henchmen in the heart.

           The Henchmen drops, as McQueen looks at his shoulder 
           mortified.

           Dirt appears on the top of the roof.

           He stands behind an M134 Gatlin gun. In a matter of thirty 
           seconds, the gun sprays 1,500 bullets into the SUVs and the 
           men tearing them all to shreds.

           The hum of the mini gun is silenced as Dirt removes a pair of 
           goggles he wears. He has a cigar crammed in the side of his 
           mouth.

                                 DIRT
                        We about done? I got a teachers 
                        conference I need to be at.

           McQueen staggers out looking toward the sniper’s nest.

                        (yelling)
                        What the hell? You never miss!

           Helaku stands up proudly holding Runt’s scalp in one hand and 
           a bloody tomahawk in the other.

           Helaku war cries.

           Dirt immediately turns the Gatlin gun spraying bullets toward 
           the sniper’s nest chopping Helaku down.

           His scream is silenced as he falls away from the gun with a 
           tomahawk in the middle of his back.

           Nastas mounts the fallen Dirt and begins to scalp him.

           Takoda comes from around the corner on his motorcycle, 
           directly toward McQueen who is out in the middle of the 
           parking area.

                        McQueen!

           McQueen, without having to turn around to see what’s coming, 
           bolts back toward the motel.

           Takoda is swinging a bola (rope with balls attached at each 
           end) over his head and releases it to ensnare McQueen’s legs. 

           McQueen drops to the ground.

           Kangee, on his bike, coming from the opposite direction has a 
           hook in his hand. He plans on snatching McQueen by the bola 
           and dragging him to his death. 

           Right before Kangee drops low to grab McQueen he is shot off 
           of his bike by Brick.

           Kangee immediately springs back up and charges Brick.

           He brandishes a tomahawk as he sprints, Brick attempts to 
           chamber another round in his shotgun, but it jams.

           Kangee fires the tomahawk at Brick. 

           All Brick can do is hold the shotgun out in front of him for 
           protection.

           As luck would have it, the tomahawk lands squarely in the 
           wooden stock of the shotgun.

           Brick looks up to see Kangee still coming.

           With no other means of defense, and Kangee running top speed 
           at Brick, Brick kicks Kangee squarely in the chest stopping 
           him in mid run.

           Brick then proceeds to stomp Kangee’s head into mush as he 
           lays at his feet.

           Nastas, reloads the Gatlin gun and puts McQueen in the cross 
           hairs. McQueen is attempting to get the bola from around his 
           legs.

           Several shots come up through the roof underneath Nastas feet 
           striking him in the groin, chest, and ultimately his chin.

           Nastas drops.

           Lincoln staggers into the doorway of room 18, the room 
           directly below the Gatlin gun. He can barely hold himself up.

           McQueen sits on the ground in amazement.

           Everything is quiet for a moment.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        (imitating a sickly Doc Holiday) 
                        Why Wyatt, I wasn’t as sick as I 
                        let on.

           Lincoln staggers back into the room.

           A bullet strikes the wall next to Brick’s face splintering 
           shards of the wall into his eye.

           Brick drops to the ground holding his face.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Hang on Brick!

           McQueen gets the bola off his legs.

           McQueen makes his way over to Brick dodging gunfire from the 
           remaining Nation members taking cover behind the shards of 
           SUVs.

           Lincoln stumbles trying to reload the pump shotgun. He leans 
           on the hole in the wall in between rooms 17 and 18. He looks 
           to Rob sitting in the wheelchair, Rob turns, looks out the 
           door and looks back to Lincoln, Lincoln’s eyes widen. A gun 
           shot is heard as a bullet strikes Rob in the chest. The 
           impact of the bullet sends Rob’s wheelchair rolling 
           backwards. Lincoln blasts the open door frame before passing 
           out on the floor.

           McQueen makes it to the room with Brick and sees the 
           wheelchair roll backwards through the passageways they 
           created in the rooms.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Rob!

           McQueen grabs the tomahawk out of the rifle handle and gets 
           up to rush Takoda.

                                 BRICK
                        Don’t!

           Brick grabs at McQueen trying to get him to sit back down. 
           Bullets pepper the wall forcing Brick to retreat back into 
           the room.

           McQueen chunks the tomahawk at Takoda who catches it and 
           prepares to refire at McQueen when McQueen pulls a revolver 
           out and unloads on Takoda.

                                        ©2008 Barry Battles & Griffin Hood
           Takoda drops in mid air.

           A bullet zips into McQueen’s leg putting him to the ground 
           near the SUVs. Brick continues to fire out of the door frame 
           unable to see out of his left eye, he looks down the passage 
           way to see Lincoln lying on his back in the floor and Rob 
           slouched down in the wheelchair. 

           Bullets continue to pop all around Brick as he looks out the 
           door to see Chogan approaching McQueen who is pulling himself 
           over to one of the bodies laying on the ground going for a 
           gun. Brick attempts to warn McQueen but isn’t able to as 
           Lokni and Neka continue to lay cover fire. Chogan grabs 
           McQueen by the ankle and drags him away from the gun. He 
           pulls McQueen up, drawing out his 10 inch blade from his side 
           holster.

                                 CHOGAN
                        Any last words?

           McQueen struggles in Chogan’s grip, the knife begins to dig 
           into McQueen head.

           McQueen spits in his face.

                                 MCQUEEN
                       (screams)
                        Dirty savage!

           Blood begins to stream down McQueen’s face. A gunshot is 
           heard, Chogan stops, two more shots ring out Chogan drop to 
           the ground bringing McQueen with him. Millard stands behind 
           Chogan with a pistol drawn. He then draws on Lokni and Neka. 
           McQueen rolls over and stabs Chogan’s dead body repeatedly 
           with the knife.

                                 MILLARD
                        Put your weapons down! On the 
                        ground, get on the ground!

           Gunshots ring out.

           Lokni and Neka fall to the ground Millard swings around to 
           see Brick holding the smoking gun. Brick tosses the gun to 
           the side and puts his hands in the air. 

                                 MILLARD
                        Put your hands down. Where’s the 
                        kid?

           Brick looks to the room and runs to check on Rob.

                                        ©2008 Barry Battles & Griffin Hood
           McQueen tires of stabbing Chogan and rolls over on his back 
           exhausted. He looks at Millard’s weapon.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Nice piece.

                                 MILLARD
                        Found it on the ground. Quite a 
                        selection down there. You boys made 
                        a mess.

           Brick enters the room and sees the bullet in the KEVLAR VEST 
           Rob is wearing.

                                 BRICK
                        Son of a bitch.

           He shakes Rob who slowly wakes up. Millard and Reyes help 
           McQueen to his feet.

                                 BRICK
                        He’s alright.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Where’s the cavalry? 

                                 MILLARD
                        Oh, they’re coming.

           McQueen puts an arm around Millard as he helps him over to 
           the room. Brick taps Lincoln’s body with his foot. Lincoln 
           barely opens one eye. Millard pulls McQueen into the room.

                                 BRICK
                        Where’d this vest come from?

           Lincoln motions to a bag in the corner several vests can be 
           seen in it.

                                 MCQUEEN
                       (laughing)
                        We had vests? We’re getting all 
                        shot up and we got we got...

           Millard lets go of McQueen who leans on the window sill.

           They look outside to see a fleet of cop cars and SWAT 
           vehicles surround the motel. Reyes emerges and takes the lead 
           while uniform officers draw their weapons.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Is that your boy?

                                 MILLARD
                        Not anymore.

           Brick gives Millard a knowing look.

           Reyes gets on a MEGAPHONE.  

                                 REYES
                        Alright boys, unless you can flush 
                        yourselves down the toilet, there’s 
                        only one way out of there. Let’s 
                        not make this dirty.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        So what now?

           They turn to Millard.  

                                 MILLARD
                        Don’t look at me. I’m one of you.

           Brick looks at one of the fallen Indians. He sees a carving 
           of a Cheyenne Indian flag on one of their belt buckles. He 
           points to the buckle area.  

                                 BRICK
                        You know what this is?

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Dead In’gen cock.

                                 BRICK
                        I’m talking about the belt buckle.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        No.

                                 BRICK
                        Any of you guys? That is a Cheyenne   
                        nation flag.  

                                 MCQUEEN
                        ...and?

                                 BRICK
                        Those were the boys that took down 
                        General Custer in little big horn. 
                        Ain’t you never seen the movie?

                                 REYES
                        You have two minutes to drop your 
                        weapons and come out or I’m sending 
                        my men in!

                                 BRICK
                        What do you think was going through 
                        that general’s head when he saw 
                        those warriors coming over the 
                        ridge?

           Mcqueen looks at the blockade of cops.

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Brother, if you have a point, could 
                        you get to it, seein as how we’re 
                        all about to bleed out.

                                 REYES
                        You have one minute!

                                 BRICK
                        They want a show. They expect it. 
                        They think we’re mindless animals. 

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Aren’t we?

                                 BRICK
                        Yeah, I guess we are. But I got 
                        enough sense to know it’s better to 
                        be tried by twelve than carried by 
                        six. Besides, I ain’t seen a cage 
                        that can hold us yet.

                                 REYES
                        Thirty seconds!!

                                 BRICK
                        Now we can go out there and satisfy 
                        our instincts. Give’em what they 
                        want, fuck it, I’ll do it. I can 
                        get fired up like general Custer 
                        and be a legend in this hotel. 
                        That’s the spot where some typical 
                        inbred dumb fuck got shot up by a 
                        bunch of cops....or...

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Or what?

                                 REYES
                        Your time is up! Come out now!

           Beat.

                                 BRICK
                        ...We let Lincoln decide.

           Lincoln types on his speak and spell. He plays it.

                                 SPEAK-N-SPELL
                        ( weird sputtering noise )

                                 MCQUEEN
                        Holy shit.  The batteries died.

                                 MILLARD
                        Shall we?

           EXT. PARKING LOT

           Reyes stands firm in front of the cops.

                                 REYES
                        Alright boys, let’s get ready to 
                        move!

           Suddenly the men move out to of the hotel. The scene seems to 
           slow down as the wind covers the area with sandy dirt.

           The cops tighten up as they lock on the boys. The boys all 
           have their hands behind their backs.

                                 REYES
                        Get your hands on your head!!

           An armed cop turns to another.

                                 COP
                        Get ready.

           The boys continue walking towards the blockade.

                                 REYES
                        Get your hands on your head or we 
                        will fire!!

           The boys continue walking towards them. The cops seem anxious 
           as the boys creep towards them.  Their trigger fingers loosen 
           up.

                                 COP
                        Shit.

           The boys get closer. Reyes nervously glances at his fellow 
           officers. He turns back to face the boys.

                                 REYES
                        This is your last warning, I said  
                        get your han---

                                 BRICK
                        I heard what you said!!

           The scene goes absolutely frozen.

           The lot of them stand with baited breath, waiting on Brick’s 
           response. Reyes is silenced.

                                 BRICK
                        Are you gonna yell like a little 
                        bitch all day or you gonna arrest 
                        us?

           Brick puts his hands on his head. The rest of the boys follow 
           suit.

           Reyes and the cops are in shock.

           The boys get on their knees. 

           The shouting of all the arresting officers is MUTED as they 
           seize the men.  

           They push them all to the ground.  

           Brick looks to the right and sees a loose STRAY DOG looking 
           at him.

           As he gets cuffed, the dog takes a last look and runs off 
           into the woods. Brick seems hopeful as he watches the dog 
           proudly running through his territory.

           Brick is helped to his feet.  

           Rob is taken out of the room. Reyes is holding Brick by the 
           cuffs. Mcqueen and Lincoln are cuffed nearby.

                                 BRICK
                        Can we talk to the boy?

           The officer allows it. Brick bends over to eye level with 
           Rob.

                                 BRICK
                        You’re a tough little shit. You 
                        took a bullet today, and that makes 
                        you a man. Don’t let anybody take 
                        that away from you. If we could 
                        we’d keep you with us.

           The boy tears up.  

           Mcqueen turns to him.

                        Listen buddy, you’re gonna be on 
                        your own. We won’t be there to 
                        protect you, but you can handle it. 
                        But if shit gets too hard, we’ll 
                        find out. Don’t you worry about 
                        how.

           The boy smiles. Lincoln gives him an approving salute.  

                                 BRICK (SMIRKING)
                        Now fuck off.

           The kid is rolled away, he looks back at the boys and smiles.  

           They are put into the squad cars.

           Brick is put in the same car with Millard.

                                 BRICK
                        Where they takin him?

                                 MILLARD
                        They’ll send him back to his mother 
                        and relocate the both of them. 
                        They’ll be fine. Now us on the 
                        other hand.

                                 BRICK
                        You let me worry about that. Any 
                        idea where they’ll stick us?  

                                 MILLARD
                        I’m guessing St. Martin.

                                 BRICK
                        Is that a fact?

           The two give each other a smirk.

                                 BRICK
                        Seein as we’ll be in the pokey, you 
                        still want me to call you 
                        detective?

                                 MILLARD
                        I’d rather you didn’t.

                                                    CUT TO:

           INT. CARLOS’ HOUSE - DAY

           Carlos sits in his living room watching an episode of DEAL OR 
           NO DEAL, when a news broadcast interrupts the program.

                                 NEWS REPORTER ON TV
                        Massacre in Mississippi is what the 
                        local authorities are calling this 
                        one. Police raided the scene to 
                        stop a murderous rampage by the 
                        Oodie brothers; Lincoln, McQueen 
                        and Brick.  The raid came on the 
                        tail end of a twenty man massacre 
                        in a condemned motel in Jackson. 
                        Members of the notorious Spivo 
                        crime family, a Native American 
                        biker gang known as the Nation, and 
                        the three men accused of horrific 
                        slaying at a bar in east Texas this 
                        past week have all been shot dead.

           The news broadcast shows artist renderings of the Oodie 
           brothers.

                                 NEWS REPORTER ON TV
                        The story takes an even darker turn 
                        with the discovery of a young, 
                        wheel chair bound boy with cerebral 
                        palsy who was a tragic casualty in 
                        this already gruesome scene. 
                        Because the victim was a minor, no 
                        names have been released at this 
                        time. 

           Carlos flips off the television.

                                 CARLOS
                        Done and done.

           The door bell rings.

           Carlos happily answers the door to find a DELIVERY MAN, brown 
           jacket and pants, standing there with a package.

                                 DELIVERY MAN
                        Mr. Carlos Martin?

                                 CARLOS
                        Yeah.

                                 DELIVERY MAN
                        Could you sign here?

                                        ©2008 Barry Battles & Griffin Hood
                                 CARLOS
                        Absolutely. How’s it going?

           He hands Carlos a small box and gives him the electronic pad 
           to sign.

                                 DELIVERY MAN
                        I’m good, and you?

                                 CARLOS
                        I couldn’t be better.

           Carlos signs the pad and hands it back to the delivery man. 
           He looks down at the address label on the box.

           It reads: Moe Greene

                                 CARLOS
                        Hey buddy, I think you got the 
                        wrong house. Who the hell is Moe 
                        Greene?

           The delivery man looks up, revealing that it’s the hitman 
           that Teresa Spivo encountered when she was being picked up by 
           the state troopers.

                                 DELIVERY MAN
                        Haven’t you ever seen the 
                        Godfather?

                                 CARLOS
                        No.

                                 DELIVERY MAN
                        Well I ought to kill you just for 
                        that.

           The delivery man pulls a revolver and pulls the trigger.
