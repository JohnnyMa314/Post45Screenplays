           AND RESTING ON THAT DOOR: a blue LAPD uniform SLEEVE packed 
           tight with working MUSCLE that you can’t get in a gym. 
           Belongs to the original vaquero, Police Officer III MIGUEL 
           MARQUEZ, urban samurai, masterless and mean. Looks 45-55, but 
           his eyes are 100. Rodin sculpture, non-regulation Zapata 
           moustache, cheek distended with a mouthful of Red Man chaw. 

           Next to him, Officer I ARCADIO RAMOS (21) in the passenger 
           seat. Marquez’s wide-eyed rookie, clueless, worshipful. 
           Marquez spits chaw out the window, direction of the VAN.

           Cargo van at 2 o’clock,

           BLOOD pumping from GSW to his head. 12 mid-day bank PATRONS 
           stone-still, watching SMOKE curl from the Scorpion Pistol. 
           The SHOT-CALLER now aims his Scorpion at cowering patrons. 
           Just his EYES behind a black balaclava, Kevlar tactical vest,

           INT/EXT. BLACK AND WHITE - CONTINUOUS

           Marquez & Ramos HUNCH below the dash as high-velocity rounds 
           CHEW through the car. Under fire, Marquez throws the car in 
           REVERSE, blindly FLOORS it. Flames licking the pocked hood, 
           the black & white LEAPS backward over the curb and reverses 
           right through the glass front of the 99 CENT STORE!

           CASHIERS and CUSTOMERS scrambling of the way of Marquez’s

           Chaos. BACKUP now arriving on scene. A column of LAPD black &

           The grenade DETONATES, up-ending the black & white, spewing

           TACTICAL FLIGHT OFFICER’S POV:

           The 211 crew firing control bursts as they move, like a SWAT

           -But then BUDABUDABUDA! Everything north of Ramos’ jaw 
           suddenly disappears in a misty-red explosion, spattering the 
           interior (and Marquez) with his blood and brain matter.

           BUDABUDABUDA! Gunfire strikes the black & white. Horror/rage 
           on Marquez’s blood-flecked face. The 211 crew fans out, a 
           firing squad blasting into the stalled black & white. Marquez 
           SHOULDERS open the door, ROLLS out on to the wet floor. 

           INT. 99 CENT STORE - CONTINUOUS

           From behind the car’s engine block, Marquez FIRES back at 
           them. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Smith .45 coughing thunder. Shell 
           casings clatter on the wet floor around him. The Crew 
           ADVANCES, steps over/around sobbing civilians proned roach-
           tight to the floor. Marquez FIRES to slide-lock, crouches 
           behind the car, bullets SPARKING off the hood as he drops his 
           empty mag/slams in a fresh one/slide SNAPS forward. Ready.

           Marquez POPS up to FIRE back, LOCKS EYES with the Shot 
           Caller. Even at this distance, Marquez recognizes those eyes 
           behind the black balaclava and it just fucking crushes him. 
           He HESITATES for a split second. But the shot caller doesn’t. 
           He fires --slishkt!-- his round pierces Marquez’s neck! 

           MARQUEZ

           BLOOD glugging through twin dime-sized punctures in Marquez’s 
           neck. Marquez’s palm on it: Blood spurting between fingers. 
           BACK TO SCENE:

           FIRING back at them, Marquez LUNGES down the aisle, CUTS 
           left. Sprinklers RAINING.  The Shot Caller’s on point now, 
           HUNTING Marquez through the aisle MAZE, following his BLOOD 
           TRAIL even as it’s obliterated by the sheeting sprinklers.

           Lurching and STUMBLING, Marquez SEARCHES the aisles for some 
           FIRST AID, eyeing the paper towels? No. Superglue? No. Fuck. 
           Marquez snatches a roll of DUCT TAPE from its peg, TEARS it 
           open with his teeth, hastily TAPES over his own NECK, 
           covering the wound, some blood still flowing. Sirens closer.

           SHOT CALLER

           Shot Caller raises his fist, HAND SIGNAL stopping his 
           disciplined crew. More sirens: calvary’s on its way. 

           MARQUEZ

           His eyes FLUTTER, world SPINNING, fingers slacken, losing his 
           grip on the .45. Passing out. He WRAPS tape round his fist. 
           Taping his .45 there so he won’t drop it, even in death.

                        Come on, you fuckers.

           MARQUEZ’S SHAKEY POV:

           A .357 revolver appears in Marquez’s vision, the weapon 
           angled low, gripped by two chubby fingers. Wedding band. 
           Someone stepping into the aisle, leading with the .357. 
           Tremors along Marquez forearm, strength flagging. But it’s 
           LAPD Detective BAE CHUIN (40s) a wry Buddha with a comb-over. 

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Their eyes meet. Old friends. Marquez collapses. Chuin 
           KNEELING, palm CLAPPED over Marquez’s wound.

           INT. 77TH DIVISION ROLL CALL ROOM - DAY

           Crude letters on a wood plaque over the Roll Call room read:

                          ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE

           BEN HALLORAN, rookie, street candy, sits ramrod straight, 
           first row. Ben’s 1st day, as a new probationer - or boot. 

           Behind Ben sit the 77th P2 DOGS - hardcore South-end 
           gunfighters, unreformed lifetime street cops - their uniforms 
           patched - torn going over fences, in brutal street fights. 
           They KICK their scuffed boots against the back of Ben’s 
           chair, taunting him. *Think High School homeroom with guns.

           Doors pushing open. Heads turn to watch MARQUEZ, striding 
           alone into roll call. Marquez holding his BADGE & shine rag. 

           Even other old-timers give Marquez distance. The stink of 
           failure is on him. An archipelago of fresh SCAR on his neck. 
           All their EYES on Marquez as he takes his seat in the back 
           corner, under the FLAG. Holding his badge like the Blessed 
           Sacrament, fingers methodically polishing it with a rag.
           After decades of polishing, Marquez’s BADGE is almost 
           featureless. The LA City hall on his badge has been rendered 
           windowless, his badge now resembles a medieval coat of arms.

           The P2s PELTING Ben with wadded Winchell’s napkins and paper 
           airplanes. But Ben know’s better than to turn around. Ben’s 
           face neutral, eyes front - Don’t let them rattle you.

                                                   PII DOG 1
                                 Hey, college. Don’t ignore 
                                 this officer when he’s 
                                 addressing you. 
                        PII DOG 2
           I know they couldn’t exactly 
           tell you guys ‘No Fags’ in 
           the academy, but seriously, 
           dude, No Fags.

           LIEUTENANT VINTNER enters, carrying the lineup, rotator. He’s 
           a Buffalo Soldier in LAPD blue. Black, 60s, walked a beat in 
           Nickerson Gardens for 20, never lost his feet in a fight.

                        Alright, people. Roll call.

           Without a word, the entire watch straightens for him. Vintner 
           dons his half glasses, takes a brief look at Ben before 
           addressing the watch.

                                LT. VINTNER
                        Our beloved media - in its infinite 
                        wisdom - is calling this a ‘race 
                        war’ either because they don’t know 
                        what else to call it or they’re 
                        lookin to get one started.

                        Either way, there’s a lot of blood 
                        in the water now. 
                           (to Ben)
                        So be careful where you swim.  

                                PII DOG 1
                        Any idea what set them off, LT?

                                LT. VINTNER
                        None. RHD says the truce fell apart 
                        over some kind of dope dispute. 
                        Sheriff’s Homicide says they heard 
                        there was a disagreement on the 
                        yard somewhere upstate. But we’ve 
                        still got no actionable 
                        intelligence on the source of their 
                        beef. 
                           (eyeing Marquez over his 
                           half-glasses)
                        We could use some. 

           Marquez offers Vintner the barest nod of acknowledgement; 
           message received. Vintner closes the rotator, glasses off.

                                LT. VINTNER (CONT’D)
                           (sarcastic)
                        But where are my manners? We’ve got 
                        a brand new probationer here with 
                        us tonight. All the way from ... 
                           (motioning to Ben)
                        Okay, Son, you’ve got one minute, 
                        one second.

           Ben stands, stiffly addressing them in clipped Academy-ese.

                                BEN
                        Thank you, sir. There’s nothing 
                        much to tell, I guess. Except to 
                        say that I feel lucky to be here in 
                        the 77th. And I’m eager to learn.

           Marquez eyes Ben with sheer contempt. Fucking worthless.

                                LT. VINTNER
                        How bout telling us your name, son?

           A few chuckles. Headshakes. 

                                PII DOG 1
                        Fucking retard.

                                BEN
                        Ben Halloran, sir.

           Ben stumbles on the name, almost like he’s not used to it.

                                LT. VINTNER
                        Halloran? You’re going to be 
                        working with Officer Marquez.
           Silence. The P2 Dogs are suddenly somber. Marquez’s pissed.

                                LT. VINTNER (CONT’D)
                        Dismissed.

           Everyone stands. Marquez heading straight for the Lieutenant.

           INT. CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER

           First out the door, Ben rushes eagerly down the corridor, 
           past framed pictures of 77th Officers killed in the Line of 
           Duty over the years, heading straight for the KIT ROOM. 

           INTERCUT WITH ROLL CALL ROOM

           Cops filing out. Marquez and Vintner stand off to the side.

                                                  LT. VINTNER 
                        MARQUEZ
           This is bullshit. 
                                 No, this is the Officially 
                                 Deployment. Out of my hands.

           Ben checks out all the standard LAPD patrol equipment. The 
           KIT ROOM OFFICER hands Ben the items one-by-one across the 
           counter: 2 Motorola Rovers, Remington 870 Shotgun, Ithaca 
           Bean Bag Shotgun, Taser. Almost more than Ben can carry.

           The Kit Room Officer hands MARQUEZ his M-16A2 Urban Police 
           Rifle. Marquez slings the rifle and grabs his black nylon 
           WARBAG. And Ben counts about thirty kerchiefs  tied off to 
           the warbag’s handle, like Comanche scalps. Blue bandannas. 
           Red bandannas. Trophies taken from vanquished gangsters. 

           Marquez heading to the parking lot - past the last photo in 
           the corridor without looking at it. Ben follows Marquez out - 
           the new apprentice like a Sherpa laden with gear - struggling 
           keep up with Marquez. Ben pauses, eyes the PHOTO of the most 
           recent cop killed in the Line: baby-faced RAMOS. Ben’s age. 

           INT. BLACK AND WHITE - MOMENTS LATER

           Tires SQUEAL. Marquez Steve-McQueening them straight to the 
           top of the 77th Parking Structure.

                                MARQUEZ
                        We need to get a few things 
                        straight before we hit the street.
                           (throwing it in park)
                        Get out.

           EXT. TOP OF THE 77TH PARKING STRUCTURE

           Below the sizzling palm trees lies the WILD WEST, the 
           sprawling, brawling camptown that is South Central - 
           birthplace of the Crips and Bloods. Home of the quick and the 
           dead. Rippling LA heat. Sirens. Squalor. Faint gunfire.
           Marquez looms over Ben, sneering at Ben’s LAPD-issue BERETTA.

                                MARQUEZ
                           (re: Ben’s Beretta 9mm)
                        Well, that nine suits you, not 
                        worth a pinch of dry shit. 

           Marquez wears a big SMITH & WESSON .45 - stainless steel, 
           sandalwood grips, in a swivel holster like an old gunslinger.

                                                      BEN
                    MARQUEZ (CONT’D)
           Tell me you at least carry a 
           backup?
                                 Yes, sir. Five-shot .38 
                                 Airweight in my left rear 
                                 pocket.

           Marquez reaches across his own chest to pull open a hidden 
           VELCRO SLIT running down the left seam of his uniform shirt. 
           Ben sees Marquez isn’t even wearing a Kevlar vest under there 
           - just a t-shirt and a hidden shoulder holster. Marquez now 
           draws a giant .44 revolver from his secret holster, 
           definitely not Department-issue. MARQUEZ’S HIDDEN BACKUP.

                          BEN
           I wasn’t aware the Department 
           had approved-
                                                    MARQUEZ
                                 It’s not a throwdown piece. 
                                 It’s a weapon of last resort.

           Marquez re-sheaths the .44, closes the Velcro. 

                                MARQUEZ (CONT’D)
                        Go home alive and apologize later. 
                        Or play nice and go home in a box.

           Marquez pulls a bag of Red Man from his pocket, JAMS a load 
           of CHAW into his mouth, works his jaw around some. Gross.

                                                      BEN
                    MARQUEZ (CONT’D)
           Better to be judged by twelve

                                             (noticing Marquez’s

           Ben watches TAGGERS spray the shit out of an MTA bus while 
           it’s stopped for a red light. Marquez ignores them, drives 
           through another country, a Demi-America. Discount Liquor 
           Markets shoulder-to-shoulder with storefront iglesias.

           Older BLACK MEN porch-playing penny dominos in the shade lift

           Black and brown KIDS. Some barefoot. Some in diapers, chasing

           signs at a crew of Hispanic STREET VILLAINS hanging right 
           across the street from the Swans. Tribal tension palpable,

           Marquez pulls their black and white to the curb in front of a 
           grimy Korean liquor store. The middle-aged wino TONY 
           TEIRASIAS AKA Tony T slumps in his rusty wheelchair in front 
           of the liquor store, drinking from a paper bag. Dreadlocks,

           DRIVES a BODY SHOT into Ben’s gut, lifting Ben off his feet, 
           smashing his wind out. Ben drops his pen, ticket book, FALLS

           BURIES a bowel-shattering kidney PUNCH. ANOTHER. Agony. Tony

           see Ben’s FIST CLOSING on the piss-stained crotch of his

           THROWS his shoulder into him, judo FLIPPING Tony on to the 
           sidewalk. Still gasping, Ben rolls Tony over, HANDCUFFS him. 

           Ben staggers to his feet, gut-KICKS Tony, hard! Ben leans on 
           the black & white, catching breath. Marquez wasn’t expecting

           Packed sidewalks. Park-soccer. Cash-&-carry dentistas. Street

           INT. BLACK AND WHITE - CONTINUOUS

           LAPD officers CABE RISLEY and ARNOLD MAPES cruising Alvarado, 
           Risley whistling Macarthur Park. Badasses in blue uniforms. 
           If you encountered RISLEY on the street, he’d impress you as 
           a model officer, projecting both sophistication and street 
           cunning. But his partner MAPES is pure muscle.

           SHEENA, stacked, redheaded hooker in a faux-leopard 
           miniskirt. She fidgets. Risley CHIN-BECKONS Sheena to his 
           black & white. She clicks over on wobbly heels, leaning in 
           Risley’s open window, tits in his face. Now, we see Sheena’s 
           just a kid, a black-talkin’ white runaway - 16 max - with a 
           big terrified smile for her ‘Daddy.’ Risley plucks a wad of 
           bills from Sheena’s bra, thumb-counts them absently.

           Sheena scratching herself, licking her lips. Risley pulls a 
           baggy of Mexican Brown from his sun visor, PASSES it to her. 
           Relieved, Sheena tucks the smack into her bra.

           Risley draws his side-handle baton from his gun belt, and 
           motions to two stainless steel sinks on the wall.

                        Get your right up there anyway.

           Risley waits. Deadeye sighs, resting his right FOREARM across 
           the two stainless steel SINKS, his arm making a bridge 
           between them - like a board waiting to be karate chopped. 

           Risley raises his baton, about to ...

                                DEADEYE
                        Hang on. Hang on.

           Deadeye pulls an ornate leather WALLET. BITING down on the 
           wallet, he lowers his head, squeezing his eyes shut- just as 
           Risley’s baton CHOPS savagely down through his arm - the 
           compound fracture FOLDING the arm like wet wood splintering.

                                RISLEY

           Marquez and Ben back in their black and white, cruising 
           CRENSHAW BOULEVARD, South Central’s elementary canal; a hip-

           INT/EXT. BLACK AND WHITE - CONTINUOUS

           Ben is fucking pissed. Marquez looks relaxed, almost bored, 
           scanning the boulevard for quarry. He spits chaw into a

           EXT. CRENSHAW CAR WASH - MOMENTS LATER

           Their black & white rolling up on a dozen BOOT HILL MAFIA 
           CRIPS are out playing speed craps - jackals around a carcass. 

           Their black & white in plain view. Marquez eyeing them.

                        half-bad place to start.

           Seeing Marquez, the Boot Hill Mafia snatch their ducats off 
           the deck, throw defiant ‘Boot Hill’ signs, lifting their 
           shirts to display BH tattoos. Flash their winnings, cackling, 
           beckoning the po-po, just daring them. Gold grills. No fear.

           Deandre sidles away from his homies, hops into a puke-green 
           pig-iron Bonneville, and pulls out of the car wash. Deandre 
           trying to look casual with his eyes glued to the rearview.

           Marquez gently accelerates with the flow of traffic, working 
           the gas pedal the way an angler works a reel. But Deandre 
           panics, smoke boiling from the tires as the Bonneville 
           LURCHES across traffic into southbound lanes up the curb to 
           sidewalk-plow newspaper machines, garbage cans. PEDESTRIANS

           The Bonneville cuts east on to train tracks, across a NARROW 
           TRELLIS spanning the LA RIVER. A FREIGHT TRAIN coming fast.
           Marquez CRANKS the wheel, FLOORS it on to the trellis. 

           BEN’S POV: 

           The Bonneville makes it across the trellis and CUTS left out 
           of the train’s path. Now the train bears down the black & 
           white, closing the distance to the trellis, AIR HORN blaring.

           spins, peeling up Slauson. Marquez weaving through traffic.

           Deandre DIVES and rolls out of the moving car as the 
           rudderless Bonneville floats across the intersection and 
           smashes through the front of an open-air tienda. Deandre,

           intersection - dodging traffic - sprinting with him in a hand-
           held balls-to-the-wall foot pursuit - *Ghetto Parkour. 

           BACKYARDS

           Deandre goes over after fence after fence, but Ben’s right on 
           his ass - the 2 of them SPRINTING through backyards past 
           black KIDS on a rusty swing set. Deandre VAULTS a wobbly 
           WOODEN FENCE. Ben STUMBLES on the swing set and CRASHES right 
           THROUGH the fence, gaining on Deandre. Ben tries it again, 
           RUNNING full-speed at the next wooden fence - BASH! Ben’s 
           knocked on his ass by a CINDER BLOCK WALL behind that one!

           Marquez behind the wheel, heading east on 58th, PARALLELING 
           Ben. Between the houses, Marquez can see Deandre going over 
           fences and he keeps pace with Deandre in the black and white.

           And now, Ben VAULTS the fence into the yard -- just as the 
           woman’s ursine sons - two hardcore FLORENCIA GANGSTERS charge 
           out the back door to rescue their Mom with aluminum BATS. 
           Rage-blinded, the men CHARGE the cop to take him apart for

           heels. Ben topples LAWN FURNITURE. The dogs LEAP at Ben just 
           as he DIVES over the fence, tearing Ben’s uniform pants. 

           EXT. OVER NORMANDIE AVENUE - CONTINUOUS

           The sound of rotors biting the air as an LAPD helo SWOOPS in 
           like a bird of prey, prop-wash rippling the trees below.

           PILOT’S POV:

           Deandre desperately scrambles over the last fence on the 
           block, SPRINTING out across Normandie Avenue.

           We can see other BLACK & WHITES on Slauson, 57th and 58th, 
           converging on Deandre. 12A45 skidding to a stop as it drifts 
           past Deandre, throwing it in reverse. Marquez driving 
           backward up Normandie to stay with the sprinting Deandre. 
           Deandre now RUNS up on the sidewalk, past stucco apartments, 
           the laundromat, past the liquor store-

           EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Ben coming from out of nowhere to open-field TACKLE Deandre, 
           the two of them CRASHING through the liquor store WINDOW. 

           INT. LIQUOR STORE

           Glass, neon beer signs IMPLODE as Ben and Deandre fly through 
           the obliterated front window, TOPPLING a rack of chips. The 2 
           men rolling, grappling. Broken glass. Cheetos Ben tries to 
           HOOK his arm round Deandre’s throat (CHOKE HOLD). Deandre 
           answers with a swift ELBOW to Ben’s face = bloody nose. 

           Deandre scrambles away from Ben and BOOM! The refrigerated 
           beverage case DETONATES, a geyser of glass and foam covers 
           Ben and Deandre. The perma-frowning KOREAN proprietor tracks 
           Deandre from behind the counter with his sawed-off 12-gauge!

           EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Marquez running to the liquor store, his .45 coming up.

           Deandre DIVING behind a candy aisle as the proprietor fires 
           again. BOOM! The candy aisle explodes like a pinata. The 
           Korean breaks open his shotgun, plucks out the smoking 
           shells, RELOADS. While the guy’s reloading, Deandre SPRINTS 
           out the emergency exit - daylight pouring in from the back 
           alley. Ben follows, slipping in spilled beer on his way out.

           Marquez arrives in front of the store, his gun up, just in

           PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE spanning the HARBOR FREEWAY. 
           EXT. PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Deandre’s running HARD on the bridge, huffing now. Traffic

           Ben’s RUNNING on the bridge now, relentless, closing in on 
           Deandre, all those Academy runs now paying off in extra wind.

           EXT. BLACK AND WHITE - CONTINUOUS

           Marquez PULLING AHEAD of them, fishtailing on to FLOWER ST. 
           on the other side of the Freeway, screeching to a stop.

           EXT. PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Marquez taking the stairs two at a time, reaching the 
           elevated span, CUTTING Deandre off. Waiting, huffing. Deandre 
           running right at Marquez, stopping dead when he sees him. 
           TRAPPED on the bridge between Ben and Marquez. Throwing a 
           look back at Ben, Deandre CLAMBERS up the chain-link barrier 
           and Ben watches Deandre LAUNCH himself off the bridge - 50 
           feet down - to the land on CONCRETE MEDIAN.

           Ben barreling after Deandre like a man possessed. Traffic 
           roaring on either side of him. Deandre shoulder-throws a 
           desperate look at Ben and CUTS ACROSS THE FUCKING FREEWAY! 
           Horns BLARE. Cars SWERVE. SCREECHING. Ben winces, but Deandre 
           makes it, scrambling up the ice plant embankment. 

           Ben high-dive MEASURES, breathes, and RUNS. Fuck. Fuck. A 
           suicide-dash across the freeway. Holy-fucking-shit. Traffic 
           SLASHING the air around Ben. HORNS. Ben Frogger-stops, pin-
           wheeling arms like a man at a cliff’s edge. A SEMI passing 
           INCHES from his face. Ben lunging across the final lane. 

           Scrambling up the embankment after Deandre. Deandre looking 
           back, loving this cop. Deandre clambers up a cyclone fence, 
           JUMPING from the fence to the ROOF of a swaybacked house. 

           EXT. ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS

           Deandre’s desperately Peter-Panning it across the rooftops of 
           55th Street with Ben right behind him, LEAPING house to house 
           Rotor blades. Deandre sees AIR 18 circling overhead, the 
           black and whites keeping pace with him, mid-block on 55th and 
           54th. The net closing. Deandre breathless, weighing options. 
           Suddenly, Ben TACKLES Deandre from behind. The two men roll 
           down the sloping roof to CRASH through a SKYLIGHT into ...

           INT. WIZARD’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Ben and Deandre land in a heap. BLOWFLIES swirling around 
           them, clouding the squalid air like a storm of raisins. Flies 
           cover Wizard’s bloated CORPSE slumped over the sink, like 
           bees on a Guinness freak, distorting the corpse’s shape and 
           size - the dead man looking almost like a bear.
           BEN AND DEANDRE

           The ungodly smell of decomposition hits them both like an 
           invisible fist. And Ben and Deandre scramble over each other, 
           stumbling through the blinding swirl of flies, groping for 
           the back door. Deandre panic-fumbling with the dead bolt.

                                BEN

           The kitchen door bangs open, Ben and Deandre stumble out into 
           the yard, both dry-heaving.

           Ben CUFFS him and, for a second, they both look relieved.

           Ben standing over Deandre. Ben grinning, stoned on 
           adrenaline, proud of his catch. But Ben’s triumphant smile 
           fades fast. Marquez grabbing a fistful of Ben’s uniform shirt 
           and slamming Ben against the house. 

                                                      BEN

           whites. Coroner’s van. Uniforms holding the perimeter.

           Detective Chuin watches uniforms stuff Deandre in their black 
           and white. He ducks under the yellow tape, into the backyard. 
           And we stay with Chuin, following him around back. Marquez 
           and Ben waiting. Ben looks green. Chuin dabs some Old Spice

           Ben surveys the pad. It’s clearly been tossed. Furniture

           A photo of Wizard on the Corcoran yard. Recent photos of 
           Wizard marching alongside Edward James Olmos behind a TAKE

                                 That don’t mean I killed him. 
           Well, here’s the route you 
           took after you ditched the G-
           ride. Across the freeway? 
           Come on. You had a 
           destination in mind. I’ll bet 
           my pension SID pulls your 
           prints out of that house.
                (off Deandre’s stricken 
                look)
           And not just from the kitchen 
           either. I’m thinking maybe 
           the bathroom. Hell, they 
           might even get DNA from 
           saliva you left on one of 
           those beer bottles in the 
           trash.

           Okay, but I can make a twelve 
           people believe this was you 
           returning to the scene of the 
           crime. Juries love that shit.

                                 didn’t even know Wizard was 
                                 dead. I just thought he could 
                                 hide me out.

           Okay, but how does a 
           Neighborhood Crip know Joe 
           Carcosa’s taxman?
           Damn. Sixth Amendment coming down like a portcullis. And here 
           ends the interview. Chuin hiding the frustration on his face.

                                CHUIN
                        Well, that’s your right of course. 
                        Your decision to make.   

           Chuin gathers his papers and leaves.

           INT. DETECTIVES BUREAU INTERVIEW ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Marquez steps into the interview room now, smiling, holding 
           the YELLOW PAGES out to Deandre.

                                MARQUEZ
                        Heard you were askin for a lawyer.

           THUD! THUD! THUD! Marquez swings the YELLOW PAGES like a 
           cudgel, expertly slamming the big book against Deandre’s 
           chest, shoulders, and the back of Deandre’s head. Damn.

                                 questions way above his 
                                 paygrade, just won’t shut the 
                                 fuck up. Until finally, the 
                                 frog gets so sick of his 
                                 college mouth that he kicks 
                                 the scorpion out of a moving 
                                 police car in the middle of 
                                 South Central.

           EXT. FLORENCE AVENUE - MINUTES LATER

           A NEON SHARK sign over Florence Avenue traffic. Marquez pulls 
           their black & white into the alley across from CLUB TIBURON. 
           Ben and Marquez step into the jagged SHARK’S MOUTH entrance 
           to the gloomy nightclub.  Los Tigres Del Norte on the juke.

                                                      BEN
                        MARQUEZ
           Deadeye hangs here.
                                 Guy from the ledger?
           INT. CLUB TIBURON - CONTINUOUS

           Marquez chest-plowing the packed crowd. GANGSTERS and WHORES 
           red-sea parting for Marquez. Ben travels in Marquez’s wake.

                                MARQUEZ
                        Watch your back. These guys get 
                        kinda stabby after a few cervezas.

           Ben trying to look everywhere, as they move past the BAR, 
           where SINALOAN COWBOYS (cartel mules) drink mescal, each one 
           giving Ben and Marquez the murder-eye in the BAR MIRROR. Ben 
           notices the Sinaloan Cowboys are all packing huge HANDGUNS in 
           their waistbands, behind ornate belt buckles. 

                          BEN
           Dudes at the bar are armed, 
           sir.

                                 this shithole without a 
                                 cohete.

           INT. BACK OF THE CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           On the back wall: a sumptuous mural of Santa Muerte, Jesus 
           Malverde, Zapata, Aztecs, Cheyenne Cadena - worthy of Rivera. 
           Below the mural, CHUPA, PELON & SNIPER (the 18th Street Crew) 
           leaning at the mine-shaft mouth of the STAIRWELL. Deadly 
           casual sentries guarding the stairs. They sip Modelo, 
           brazenly eye-fucking Marquez and Ben as the cops approach. 

                        MARQUEZ
                                                     CHUPA
           Looking for Deadeye.
                                 No hablo ingles.

                        MARQUEZ
                                                     PELON
                                 No, no hablo.
                (to Pelon)
           What about you?

           Marquez shrugs. Then his right arm FLASHES, a HALF-FIST like 
           the head of a brown viper striking Chupa’s throat, knocking 
           the seeds from Chupa’s Adam’s apple. Marquez PIVOTING before 
           they can react, his reversing right ELBOW bashing Pelon’s 
           unsuspecting temple with ball-peen force. Chupa on his knees, 
           eyes gushing water, gagging, coughing. Pelon falls in a heap, 
           cold-cocked. Elapsed time: 3 seconds. 

           Ben gapes, awed by Marquez’s speed and savagery. Then Ben 
           HEARS movement behind them, bar stools scraping the floor. 
           Ben WHIRLS, DRAWING his Beretta, facing the Sinoloan Cowboys 
           getting up from the bar, pistoleros spoiling for a gunfight.

                                BEN
                        Quien quiere ser a el primer 
                        muerto?
                        [Which one of you dies first?]

           And Marquez registers Ben’s flawless SPANISH.
           Ben’s nervous finger on his trigger. Beat. Reluctantly, the 
           Sinoloans return to their stools. Relief flooding Ben.

           Marquez’s big hand now wrapping Sniper’s throat, Darth-
           Vadering this little pendejo right up to his tip-toes.

                                SNIPER
                           (gulping)
                        He’s upstairs.

           INT. UPSTAIRS STOREROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Sniper leading Marquez and Ben through the shadowy storeroom, 
           past cobwebbed kegs and dusty cases of booze. 

                        MARQUEZ
                                                      BEN

                                 You didn’t ask.
           You didn’t tell me you spoke 
           my language?

           Sniper KNOCKING on a STEEL DOOR at the far end of the room. 
           Ben and Marquez stand off-set from the door, out of view of 
           the speak-easy EYE PANEL SLIDING open on the door. We can’t 
           see who’s behind the slot, just the strip of LIGHT from the 
           officer spilling out through the panel across Sniper’s face. 
           And we hear a series of LOCKS turning and popping. As the 
           door opens, Marquez SHOVES Sniper aside and KICKS the door.

           INT. DEADEYE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           The door FLIES open, knocking NAVIDAD MENJIVAR (AKA DEADEYE) 
           backward. Ben and Marquez charge in through the open door. 
           Marquez grabs Deadeye, WRENCHING his left arm behind his 
           back. Marquez sees Deadeye is wearing a CAST (sharpied with 
           gang scrawl) on his freshly-broken right arm.

                        MARQUEZ
                (re: cast)
           What happened to your arm?
                                                    DEADEYE
                                 Police brutality, dog. Know 
                                 how many Los Angeles Police 
                                 Officers it takes to break a 
                                 guy’s arm?

           Marquez SHOVES Deadeye. Deadeye spilling on to his couch.

                                                    DEADEYE
                                 Don’t know any Wizard.
                        MARQUEZ
           None. Suspect fell down the 
           stairs.
                (beat)
           Tell me about Wizard.

           Marquez KICKS Deadeye, his BOOT hitting with Deadeye’s knee 
           like a croquet mallet. Ben winces in involuntary sympathy. 
                    DEADEYE (CONT’D)
           Arrgh. Damn.
                                                    MARQUEZ

                        DEADEYE
           Bullshit. I render unto Cesar 
           what is Cesar’s, which is 10 
           off the top, to the penny.

           of the damn realm, dog.

                                 Hey, mystery solved. But if 
                                 Wizard stole from Carcosa? 
                                 Shit, I’m inclined to rule it 
                                 a suicide. 
                        DEADEYE
           Well, Wizard’s little book’s 
           wrong. I’m Horton the fuckin 
           Elephant. His ledger says 
           different? I don’t know. 
           Maybe that that fool’s 
           skimmin’ his damn self.

           Ben and Marquez watch genuine grief flooding Deadeye’s face.

                                DEADEYE
                           (in shock)
                        Wizard didn’t have a Green Light on 
                        him, Marquez. I’d a heard about it. 
                        I mean, off the record? I’m the guy 
                        they send to clean house down here. 
                           (beat)
                        Naw, this wasn’t us, Marquez. 

                                MARQUEZ
                        Okay, then who the fuck was it? 
                        Who’s gonna take on La Eme? 

                                DEADEYE
                        Maybe MS? I mean, everybody knows 
                        those motherfuckers are crazy.

           Well, seeing as you’ve been 
           out of the Academy all of 
           four minutes, I think I’ll 
           file ‘who benefits’ under

           Ben and Marquez exiting their car now among SHANTIES forming 
           an off-the-books OPEN-AIR MARKET of corrugated steel & 
           particle board along the river. MEN selling mangoes, 
           coconuts, fresh-caught fish. A makeshift CARNECERIA: PIGS & 
           GOATS hang upside down, their blood draining into basins.

           The BUTCHER hacks the head off a CHICKEN. Ben winces. 
           Headless chicken flops, runs. Children laugh, chase it. 
           FLATBED SEMIS, hauling equipment from nearby warehouses, blow

           They’re heading for the sclerotic, 4-story ABANDONED BUILDING 
           like a doomed colonial outpost reclaimed by the jungle.

           Marquez pushes aside vines hanging over the darkened doorway 
           and Ben follows him inside. It’s like entering a troll's den.

           Something wet falls on Ben's shoulder. Ben brushes it away, 
           smells GUANO on his fingertips. Looks up. BATS clinging to 
           the ceiling like black suede oysters quivering in the 
           shadows. They stretch their wings, yawn, baring needle teeth. 

           Ben follows Marquez up the rotted, garbage-strewn stairway to-

           Finger to his lips, Marquez POINTS to a TRIPWIRE stretched 
           across the rotted 2nd FLOOR LANDING, tied to the trigger of a 
           SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN - Booby trapped. Ben’s eyes: Jesus Christ!

           MS-13’s ESCUADRON DE LA MUERTE (Death Squad); more Mayan than 
           Mara. Bandy-legged bezerkers gather around SOMBRA: all sinew 
           and savagery, scrimshawed by Gothic MS-13 tattoos, even on 
           Sombra’s face, giving him an almost Maori look. Warriors heft 
           BUCKETS of NAPALM. Sombra passes ROAD FLARES out to his men.

           Ben gingerly STEPS over the TRIPWIRE, but Marquez GRABS Ben 
           before Ben’s BOOT can land on a yellowed sheet of NEWSPAPER. 
           Marquez squats, delicately LIFTS the newsprint to reveal the 
           steel jaws of a BEAR TRAP! Their booby trap is booby trapped.

           Side-stepping the bear trap, Ben & Marquez MOVE silently 
           upstairs. Passing the 3rd FLOOR now, reaching the ...

           INT. 4TH FLOOR - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Guns drawn, Ben & Marquez heel-toe their way down a dark 
           hallway. Rats scuttle. Whole SECTIONS of FLOOR piss-rotted 
           away. Fading sunlight slanting in through HOLES in the roof. 

           EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

           Sombra & his warriors stalk wraith-like across roof with 
           Buckets. Flares. Peering down through holes at Ben & Marquez. 

           INT. 4TH FLOOR - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Ben SEES a SHADOW PASS quickly over a hole in the roof. He 
           touches Marquez’s shoulder, POINTS upward. I saw something.

           Marquez swiftly shifts position, finding an angle, gun raised 
           craning his head to see up through the hole. AND ... SPLASH!

           Marquez suddenly DOUSED with SUGARED GASOLINE. [Arrgh!] 
           Marquez blinded. Ben SMELLS the gas, sees Marquez’s GUN blind-
           pointing up, Marquez’s FINGER instinctively squeezing ...

           Ben TACKLES Marquez out of the way just as the first FLARES 
           drop down through HOLES in the ceiling. Marquez & Ben 
           CRASHING together down through ROTTED FLOOR just as the 
           FLARES land in the 4th Floor HALLWAY. Fire spreading quickly.  
           INT. 3RD FLOOR - ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They CRASH LAND on the 3rd floor. Ben drywall-dusted. Yanking 
           Marquez to his feet. Marquez gags, coughs, eyes gushing. 
           Ben’s hand over Marquez’s, easing his .45 into its holster.

           Ben SHOVING Marquez out into the 3rd FLOOR HALLWAY just as 
           SOMBRA’S WARRIORS ceiling-DROP into the room. They draw 
           MACHETES, each blade with an edge measured in molecules.

           INT. 3RD FLOOR - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Marquez staggers, stumbles, FEELING his way along walls. Ben 
           DRAWS his Winchester telescoping ASP BATON from its breakaway 
           scabbard. He FLICKS his wrist/SNAP!/Telescoping ASP extends, 
           tripling in length. And Ben turns to FACE their pursuers.

           WARRIOR 1 HURLS his MACHETE, blade hissing air, seeking Ben. 
           Ben YANKS open a DOOR to shield himself. CRUNCH! A burst of 
           splinters and the BLADE of the machete STICKING right through 
           the door - steel vibrating inches from Ben’s face! Holy Shit!

           Now from behind that door, from the shadows inside that room, 
           CHARGES WARRIOR 2, HATCHET raised Norman-Bates style, RUSHING 
           Ben. Panicked, Ben quickly SLAMS that SAME DOOR on the guy, 
           forcing the Warrior 2 right into the machete now imbedded in 
           the door. Warrior 2 IMPALES himself, pinned against the door.

           WARRIORS 3, 4 ATTACKING feral-fast, upright hyenas from the 
           last great Blade Culture, handling their machetes the way 
           Darth Maul wields a lightsaber. Ben FENCES them off with his 
           BATON. Blades glint, whistle. A close-quarters battle backing 
           Ben to the stairs. Picture 3 guys sword-fighting in a phone 
           booth. Ben KICKS Warrior 3! The guy falling backward, 
           CRASHING through the splintered bannister INTO the STAIRWELL-

           off the roof to LAND on to the bed of MOVING FLATBED TRUCK!

           EXT. FLATBED TRUCK (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           Marquez rolls, ALMOST falls off, Ben pulls him back on the 
           truck bed. Ben looking back to see SOMBRA & more warriors 
           sprinting in pursuit, taking an angle across the overgrown 
           lot, two of them SCRAMBLING up on to the flatbed, stalking 
           toward Ben & Marquez. Sombra RUSHING for the cab, HOPPING on 
           to the running board, throwing OPEN the PASSENGER door. 

           INT. TRUCK’S CAB - CONTINUOUS

           The TRUCK DRIVER takes one look at the tattooed SOMBRA 
           climbing into his cab and decides to abandoned ship! He jumps 
           out, rolling away from the moving truck. 

           EXT. LOS ANGELES RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           Truck drifts off course, toward the SHANTY MARKETPLACE. 
           Sombra grabs the free-floating WHEEL, but he’s too late.

                        Hang on to something!

           Panicked people and animals scramble out of the way as the 
           truck PLOWS through the marketplace. Shanties BURSTING one 
           after another, shattered against the truck’s Peterbilt GRILL. 
           And, like a train jumping the tracks, the truck BARRELS down 
           the cement slope riverbank, TUMBLING over on two wheels - 

           Ben watching the world turn on its side as the truck TIPS 
           OVER, spilling Ben & Marquez & the warriors off its bed as it 
           SPLASHES like a breeching whale into the shallow LA river.  

           Ben LANDS facedown in the water, comes up sputtering. He sees 
           one warrior TRAPPED against the crushed cab. Another PINNED 
           under the overturned truck bed, his face underwater blood 
           BUBBLING from his slack mouth. No sign of Marquez. 

           Ben struggling to his knees to find SOMBRA standing over him, 
           MACHETE raised high! Ben REACHES for his 9MM, but his 
           holster’s EMPTY!
           Sombra draws back, about to take Ben’s HEAD OFF! but Sombra 
           sees BEN’S FACE (washed clean by the river)-freezes in mid-
           stroke. Checking his swing. HE RECOGNIZES BEN! 

                                SOMBRA
                        You!

           BOOM! A .45 Caliber hollow-point BLOWS wet confetti out of 
           Sombra’s chest, spattering Ben. Sombra’s machete DROPS and 
           Ben watches as Sombra rag-doll FACEDOWN into the river.

           Bloodied, stunned, Ben looks over to see MARQUEZ soaked & red-
           eyed. Smoke curls from his 45. Marquez just saved Ben’s life!

                 Ben’s blood-flecked face, gasping, taking this all in.

           Marquez SPLASHES to Sombra, HAULS him up by the scruff of his 
           neck. Sombra maniacally laugh-coughing blood, water.

           In light of your 
           distinguished military 
           service, the judge has agreed 
           to a reduced bail.

           It’s been taken care of.
                                 After they said they were 
                                 gone put that murder on me, 
                                 that Mexican cop - the one 
                                 with the scar - he’s the one 
                                 gave me the phone book 
                                 massage, like I told you.

                (off Deandre’s surprise)
           Now, if we’re going to beat 
           this it’s imperative that I, 
           as your attorney, find out 
           exactly what the cops know. 
           Anything you haven’t already 
           told me? Anything at all?  
                                 And that’s when he come at me 
                                 about that bank.

           a huge PIT BULL paddles across the pool’s surface - a pair of

           from whatever’s in there. Bites it. Juice on his chin.

                                      DARIUS
                        Wasn’t me, counselor. Swear on my 
                        hood.

                                      BIG BEN
                        That’s not going to be good enough. 
                        We need to get out in front of 
                        this. Give him something. We have 
                        to find out who killed Wizard.

           Outside Darius’ bedroom, a live JAGUAR lounges on an ottoman, 
           chained to the floor. Tail snaking through the air, the big 
           cat regarding them with imperious contempt.

                                                     DARIUS
                        BIG BEN
           Can’t believe you still keep 
           that fuckin’ thing. 
                                 Well, any nigga can have a 
                                 guard dog. But check this 
                                 shit out.

           Darius beckons Big Ben around the edge of the landing to an X 
           of BLUE TAPE on the floor. Darius sets the BUNNY down on the 
           X. The cat’s eyes fix on the rabbit. Waitiing. 

                                DARIUS
                        Ulaga.

           The jaguar LAUNCHES too swiftly for our eyes to track. It’s 
           as if the rabbit is suddenly enveloped by dense, spotted 
           smoke. Then the cat is back on its ottoman, feeding. Nothing 
           left on the X but a few tufts of FUR.

                                DARIUS (CONT’D)
                        Means ‘kill’ in Swahili.

                        Benji used to think that was fuckin 
                        hilarious. Me teachin a South 
                        American cat to speak Swahili.

           Big Ben reacts to the mention of Benji.

           INT. 77TH STATION LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

           After his End-of-Watch, Ben at his locker changing out of his 
           ruined uniform, his second of the day, soaked and torn. 

           Ben sees Marquez down the row at his own locker, easing out 
           of his uniform. Marquez winces. Sore. Ben sees Marquez’s body 
           remains powerful, but this job’s aging him hard and it shows.

                                BEN
                        I suppose this was just a typical 
                        day for you, sir.

           Marquez pulls a cloth-wrapped something from his locker,  
           weighs the object in his hand. Pain locked behind his eyes.

                                MARQUEZ
                        Better than some.

           Marquez crosses to Ben, unwraps the object, holds it out to 
           Ben. It’s a gently-used GLOCK .45 with the slide pulled back.

                                MARQUEZ (CONT’D)
                        Look, you need a gun. And Ramos - 
                        he can’t use his anymore. So ...
                           (dry)
                        Welcome to 77th.

           Ben takes the weapon from Marquez’s hand, solemn, touched. 
           Ben wasn’t expecting this from Marquez. An almost moment. 

                                BEN
                        Uh, thank you, sir. I ...

           But Marquez has already about-faced. And Ben watches the big, 
           graying wolf stalk back to his locker. Solitary and forlorn.

                                MARQUEZ
                        And you can knock off that ‘sir’ 
                        crap from now on. 

           And Ben’s face holds something for his Training Officer that 
           wasn’t there before. A grim respect that adumbrates fealty.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. BEN’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Ben (civilian clothes) limps into his little apartment, 
           stiff. Grabs a beer from the fridge, slumps into his couch, 
           hits the remote. Quavering television light on Ben’s face. 

           Ben draws Ramos’ GLOCK, places it on his coffee table. Beat. 

           Then Ben pulls WIZARD’S LEDGER from his waistband. Ben 
           considers the LEDGER, Ramos’ GLOCK, at war with himself.
           INT. BEN’S BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Ben dragging a chair to his closet. He stands on the chair, 
           SHOVES aside an ACCESS PANEL in the ceiling of his closet. 

           ANOTHER ANGLE:

           Ben HIDES Wizard’s LEDGER up in the ATTIC CRAWLSPACE, 

                                     DING-DONG!

           Ben reacts to his doorbell, quickly replacing the access 
           panel. And closes his closet door. Returning the chair

           Ben approaches his front door cautiously, holding his GLOCK.

                          BEN

                                 It’s me, Benji.

           Ben sighs, tucks the Glock in his rear waistband. OPENS his 
           door for IGNACIO BAROA(30): Hired killer for the Mexican 
           Mafia. Leathery face bathed in orange glow of his cigarette.

                          BEN

           Risley handing his firearm over to JAX. Darius lounging on 
           his California King. On the walls: ANCIENT WEAPONS, framed 
           movie posters: Cotton Comes to Harlem and Black Belt Jones.

           Risley admires the ancient weapons mounted on Darius’ wall, 
           whistling Macarthur Park. The SABER labeled NAT TURNER’S.

           EXT. CARCOSA’S MANSION - NIGHT

           Spanish Mission + Venetian Palace, his mansion is roughly the 
           size of Rhode Island. Armed SENTRIES with automatic weapons. 

           POOL:

           DON JOSE CARCOSA reclines in the moonlight on a foam raft, 
           floating like a crocodile with a mojito. From his infinity 
           pool, Carcosa commands a panoramic view of his ranchito: Los 
           Angeles. The smog-shrouded basin sprawls below him with the 
           downtown skyline rippling mirage-like in the warm night air.

           CARCOSA:

           Mexican Mafia’s Dracula, the ageless, deathless Source 
           Creature. Imagine the result of an evil experiment fusing the 
           genetic material from Pacino in Scarface and Alan Rickman in 
           Die hard. With a word, Carcosa can grant your fondest wish or 
           have your balls cut off, stuffed into your mouth. 
           Ben stands at the edge of the pool. Ignacio’s behind him.

                                IGNACIO
                        In you go, Benji. He said He wants 
                        to talk to you. 

           Ignacio shoves Ben INTO THE POOL. Ben slogs awkwardly over to 
           Carcosa. Carcosa’s voice carries across the dark water.

                                                      BEN
                                 No, but it sounds like the 
                                 beginning of a joke.
                        CARCOSA
           I am sorry, mijo. Of course, 
           I know you would never wear a 
           wire to my home. But police 
           work is like malaria. Gets in

                        I was just a chiclero, you 
                        understand? And here is Ochoa, of 
                        Arellano-Felix, encargado de la 
                        Plaza de Baja. I tell Ochoa I want 
                        to mule for him. Ochoa laughs. 
                        Because he has all the mules he 
                        wants and he does not need me. 
                           (beat)
                        The one next to him in the booth 
                        stands to throw me out and I open 
                        his throat with a straight razor. 

           A breeze stirs the eucalyptus, scimitar-leaves wafting to 
           float on the surface, and Ben looks suddenly cold. 

                                      CARCOSA (CONT’D)
                         The man’s on his back, gurgling, 
                         and I tell Ochoa: Ya me necesitas.
                              (laughing)
                        Now, you need my help. True story.

                        Okay, is that your way of telling 
                        me you need my help?  Cause I mean, 
                        that’s, that’s pretty fuckin’ 
                        creepy, Joe.

                        Lo siento. I’m just, I guess I’ve 
                        had a pretty rough day. I mean, you 
                        know Sombra just tried to kill me, 
                        right?  
                                CARCOSA
                        Yeah, well everybody’s emotional 
                        about Wizard. He was an honorable 
                        man and they butchered him like he 
                        was an animal. 
                           (crosses himself)
                        I’ll talk to Sombra.

                                BEN
                        No, don’t bother. It’s, well, it’s

                                BEN
                        Claro que si.

                                CARCOSA
                        Wizard kept a book, a ledger. 

           Ben’s face betrays nothing.

                                BEN
                        We didn’t find any ledger.

                                CARCOSA
                        You’re sure? It’s important.

                                BEN
                        Positive.

                                CARCOSA
                        I need you to find these men for 
                        me, Benji. And find that book.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY CORONER’S AUTOPSY ROOM - NEXT DAY

           Marquez, Ben, and Chuin - all wearing plastic gloves, aprons, 
           and filtered 3M masks to protect them against airbone 
           pathogens - all (3) men peering down at a half-eaten CORPSE. 
           We recognize the corpse as that of DEANDRE, their arrestee 
           from last night. 
           Though we just get GLIMPSES of Deandre’s sightless EYES 
           staring back at us. Lips torn away from his TEETH. His limbs 
           gnawed to the bone. RIBS exposed. Savaged.

                                CHUIN
                        Well, this was no boating accident.

           SIZZLE. Witchy purple light flickers; FLINTROL Insect 
           Electrocutors. This ain’t CSI. Less a lab than a medieval 
           dungeon, or abattoir. Blood on the floor. We can practically 
           smell the cloying decay. Ben’s eyes dart; he looks woozy.

           Deandre’s and (3) other autopsies are all underway at once. 
           DEPUTY CORONERS in masks and bloodstained aprons bent over 
           tattooed BODIES with Y-sutures, holes in them that shouldn’t 
           be - white spots on backlit X-RAYS where bullets reside. 

                    MEDICAL EXAMINER
                (re: Deandre)
                                                    MARQUEZ
                                 Not as soon as he would have 
                                 liked.
                                             (beat)
           Antemortem wounds. Probably 
           defensive. But this kind of 
           tissue loss? Hard to tell 
           when he died. 
                                 They took him to the Spook 
                                 House, put the dogs on him. 
                                 That’s no way for a man to 
                                 die.

           Jewels of cold sweat form on Ben’s forehead. Deputy Coroner 
           at a nearby examination table uses garden clippers to cut 
           through a body’s rib cage. Ben sucking air through his mask.

                                BEN
                        The Spook House, sir?

           The deputy coroners remove the organs from their bodies, drop 
           the organs - one by one - into hanging scales, then place the 
           organs into steel pans. Yellow gloves marbled with blood. 

                                MARQUEZ
                        Yeah, they say the Boot Hill Mafia 
                        Crips have a warehouse somewhere in 
                        the hood. 
                           (beat)
                        With a pit full of dogs.

           Ben closes his eyes, tries to normalize his breathing. 

           A deputy coroner holds a man’s heart, wriggles his gloved 
           finger through a bullet hole in the left ventricle. Ben sways 
           on his feet. But Marquez and Chuin don’t notice.

                         CHUIN
                                                    MARQUEZ
                                 Cash? Anything on the actual 
                                 bills?
           They didn’t waste any time 
           getting him there. Deandre 
           just bailed outta Men’s 
           Central last night. Twenty 
           large. Cash on the barrel. 
                                                    MARQUEZ
                                 So who put up the money?
                         CHUIN
           You mean did the money come 
           from that bank robbery? 
                (off Ben’s look)
           Got SID at the bondsman’s 
           lookin for traces of dye. 

           Chuin opens his folder, hands Keith’s CCHRS (Consolidated 
           Criminal History Report) with Keith’s recent MUGSHOT.

                         CHUIN
                                                    MARQUEZ
                                             (softly)
           A Boot Hill nobody by the 
           name of KEITH WALLACE. AKA C-
           Love.  
                                 I know Keith. I put his dad 
                                 in San Quentin about ten 
                                 years ago. Keith turned out 
                                 alright, considering he was 
                                 raised by wolves. He’s no 
                                 bank robber. He’s somebody’s 
                                 errand boy. 

                                CHUIN
                        There’s something else.

           Chuin’s eyes tell Marquez this is for his ears alone.

                                MARQUEZ
                           (to Ben)
                        Go on and get some air, professor. 
                        Mommy and Daddy need to talk.

           Ben looks incredibly relieved, RUSHES from the autopsy room.

                                CHUIN
                           (whispering)
                        So I took a peek at your boot’s 
                        personnel file this morning. You 
                        could eat off it. Ben Halloran’s 
                        never had so much as a speeding 
                        ticket. Nobody’s that goddamn 
                        clean. Take a look under his 
                        uniform. Your partner’s probably 
                        got a zipper down his back.

           Bone flakes waft as the ME’s whirring bone saw does its work. 
           But Marquez and Chuin don’t seem to notice the ME remove 
           Deandre’s brain. He might as well be changing a flat tire.

                                CHUIN (CONT’D)
                        You already know Beachamp’s wants 
                        your tin in his trophy case. He 
                        practically told us last night.

           INT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY CORONER’S (CORRIDOR) - CONTINUOUS

           Pale, Ben lurches down the drab, cavernous corridor - lined 
           with BODIES, and more bodies, lying on wheeled steel tables, 
           some draped in opaque plastic sheets, others naked. Decayed.
                                CHUIN (V.O.)
                        Get rid of the kid, Miguel. Fire 
                        him. Shit, tell Vintner you want a 
                        new partner. I’ll back you up.

           Ben’s almost running now. A dead Yakuza covered in exquisite 
           tattoos. A drowned child. One that doesn’t look like a body 
           at all, but an uprooted tree stump - a burn victim.

           INT. CORONER - RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ben rushes into the restroom, tears off his mask and gloves, 
           lunges to the sink. Splashes cold water on his face.

                                MARQUEZ (V.O.)
                        No, if you’re wrong, I’m fangin’ 
                        the kid without cause. If you’re 
                        right I want the little prick right 
                        where I can keep an eye on him. 

           Ben takes his hands from his wet face, staring at his own 
           pale reflection in the smudged bathroom mirror. And we ...

                                                     FLASH BACK TO:

           INT/EXT. CARCOSA’S MANSION - NIGHT

           In the past ... a PARTY you could see from space. Carcosa’s 
           daughter’s QUINCEANERA: Hundreds of GUESTS. Thousands of 
           Christmas lights. The Godfather wedding.  

           BENJI AND DARIUS

           Benji with a mop of blonde hair, two friends SLAMMING 
           tequila, people watching, having the time of their lives.

           Gyrating on a temporary STAGE is SASPARILLA WHISKEY - 
           underwear model turned white rapper & teen heartthrob. 
           Ridiculous. *Think Vanilla Ice; Buster Crabbe jumpsuit, hair 
           gelled straight up. Girls scream, giggle. Dancing.

                         BENJI
           How the hell did Carcosa get 
           The Death of Hip Hop here for 
           a private performance? 
                                                     DARIUS
                                 He asked. As a favor to me. 
                                 I’m gone sign that fool here. 
                                 Tonight.

                         BENJI
           I thought he was with Certain 
           Death now. 
                                                     DARIUS
                                 Well, the Cracker’s about to 
                                 trade up.

           INT. CARCOSA’S MOTOR COURT - LATER

           In the bowels of Carcosa’s mansion. Away from the party. 
           Dozens of CLASSIC CARS high-gloss gleaming everywhere. 
           Benji, Darius, Jax, Ignacio & Sombra gather around 
           SASPARILLA: now Bound, hanging upside down by his ankles from 
           an ENGINE HOIST. Rag in his mouth. Sasparilla’s eyes PLEADING 
           with Benji. Benji looks away as Ignacio and Sombra finish 
           wrapping Sasparilla in RED CREPE PAPER.

           To his credit, Sasparilla still has some fuck-you left in his 
           eyes - defiant, even now. But that’s about to change.

           CARCOSA flows in, flush from the party, WRAPPING Benji and 
           Darius in his rib-cracking, avuncular bear hug. Love.  

                                CARCOSA
                        Ah, mis hijos. 
                           (kissing Benji)
                        Mis unicos hijos. [My only sons.]

           Carcosa turns to Sasparilla. Becoming something deadly.

                                CARCOSA (CONT’D)
                           (to Sasparilla)
                        You know who I am.

           Not a question. Sasparilla game-fish TWISTS on the hoist.

                                CARCOSA (CONT’D)
                        When the mayor dines here in my 
                        home, I sit at the head of the 
                        table. And do you know why? Because 
                        I am the Alpha and the Omega. I am 
                        He Who Must Be Obeyed. 

           Carcosa removes his coat, hands it to Ignacio. Carcosa 
           cuffing up his sleeves. The other men smile knowingly.

                                CARCOSA (CONT’D)
                        And you know what today is. Today 
                        is my daughter’s Birthday. 

           Ignacio hands Carcosa an aluminum BASEBALL BAT. Carcosa 
           taking a few PRACTICE SWINGS. Warming up. Benji watches.

                                CARCOSA (CONT’D)
                        Since she was small, every year she 
                        has a pinata on her Birthday. 

           Carcosa allows Ignacio to carefully BLINDFOLD him. Ignacio 
           and Sombra spin Carcosa, disorienting him. 

                                CARCOSA (CONT’D)
                        I’m traditional that way.

           Now Jax KICKS Sasparilla, causing him to swing on the hoist. 
           And Carcosa SWINGS blind. SMASH! The bat MISSES Sasparilla by 
           inches, DENTING a 1970 Olds 442 Coupe.

                    CARCOSA (CONT’D)
                                                     SOMBRA
           Mierda!
                                 Choke up on it, Jefe.
           Laughter. Sasparilla bug-eyed, panic-pissing. Benji looks 
           like he’s going to be sick. Then Benji catches Carcosa’s 
           eyes, just PEEKING out from under the blindfold. Carcosa can 
           SEE exactly what he’s doing. And he’s missing on purpose. 
           Carcosa WINKS at Benji. Benji smiles. And Carcosa SWINGS 
           again, ‘MISSING’ again. His bat SHATTERING the windshield of 
           his own 1995 Porsch 911.

                                SASPARILLA
                           (spits the rag out)
                        Please! PLEASE! Jesus! I’ll do it. 
                        I’ll sign with him. Fuck. 

                                CARCOSA
                        Claro. Conveniently, my attorney 
                        has the papers for you to sign.

           INT. CARCOSA’S DEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

           His sanctum sanctorum, away from the party. Roaring fire. 
           Painting of Old California: Bullfights. Bear baiting.

           Carcosa, drinking from a huge snifter, watches Big Ben 
           FLIPPING contract pages, indicating SIGN-HERE TABS.

                                BIG BEN
                        Here. And here.

           Sasparilla, badly shaken, hastily signs his life away.

           INT. CARCOSA’S DEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Big Ben and Carcosa having a quiet drink. Alone.

                                                    CARCOSA
                                 I know, but listen to me.
                       BIG BEN 
           Benji wasn’t supposed to be 
           part of this. My son, Joe. 

                        BIG BEN
                                                    CARCOSA
           You stood here and told me 
           we’d keep my son clear of it.
                                 Listen to me, right now 
                                 Benji’s a bird standing in 
                                 the crocodile's mouth. 
                                 Picking shit out of his teeth 
                                 for him.  But tell me

           EXT. STREETS OF SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY

           PRESENT: Ben & Marquez cruising in their Black & White. Some 
           tension between them. Marquez scanning the hood, hunting.

                          BEN
                                                    MARQUEZ
           You alright?
                                 Fine.

           INT. BLACK AND WHITE - CONTINUOUS

           Up ahead, Marquez spies Keith Wallace, AKA C-LOVE, a reedy 
           Crip in a North Carolina jacket. Pedaling a girl’s BIKE.

                                 No sir. 
           Have I shown you how to 
           conduct a proper 
           investigative stop on a 
           narcotics suspect riding a 
           bike?

           EXT. BLACK AND WHITE - CONTINUOUS

           Marquez drives alongside C-Love and THROWS his baton like 
           spear out his open window - into C-Love’s front spokes. And C-
           LOVE goes ass-over-handlebars, flopping in the street like a 
           stunned fish. Marquez and Ben step out of the car, cuff him.

                        MARQUEZ
           You okay, Keith?
                                                     C-LOVE
                                 Marquez? Shit. Like to kill 
                                 my ass, shit.

           So I hear. How many times I

                                                     C-LOVE
                                 Yeah, I know, I know, but I’m 
                                 like a ninja, walkin through 
                                 walls and shit. They can’t

                                 lesson learned? Marquez? I 
                                 mean, ain’t like I was out 
                                 here servin’ or anything.

                                 Yeah, but when you hemmed me 
                                 up I was just on my way to my 
                                 girl house.

                    MARQUEZ (CONT’D)
           Yeah? Hope she’s worth it. 
                                                     C-LOVE
                                 See for yourself.
           C-Love tilts his chin toward his breast pocket. Ben reaches 
           in, pulls out his MTA bus pass with the RAYNEECE’s photo 
           tucked into it. Soft focus. Satin dress. Rayneece (17) 
           resting her delicate chin on her fist. Trying to look older 
           only accentuates Rayneece’s youth.

                          BEN
                                                     C-LOVE
           She’s lovely.
                                 She’s havin’ my baby.

           Ben and Marquez share a brief look.

                        C-LOVE
           And that’s why I’m actually 
           glad this happened, you know? 
           I’m feelin, I’m really feelin 
           the hand of God right here, 
           Marquez.

           INT. BLACK AND WHITE - MOMENTS LATER

           Marquez driving with C-Love handcuffed in the backseat, 
           talking to Marquez’s through the open plexiglass window that 
           separates the black & white’s backseat from the front.

           I just thought, you know, I 
           just heard Deandre was locked 
           up in the county. An those 
           eses in county will creep

           So when he gave me the money

                        But he’s a trapdoor spider,

           INT. RISLEY’S GARAGE - DAY

           Risley’s home garage serves as his workout room and Dojo. 
           Free weights. Mats. Muk Yang Jong - a Wing Chun wooden 
           training stand. Jiu-Jitsu grappling dummy. A set of Katana, 
           self-help books on the shelf. Bogu - Kendo armor. THUG 
           MAGAZINE covers pinned on the walls. News Clippings from the 
           ROBBERY OF THE BANCO POPULAR IN LOS ANGELES. 

           Big Ben sips a beer, watching Risley (in workout clothes) 
           expertly wield a Shinai. The bamboo sword hissing the air. 

                                BIG BEN
                        What’d Deandre tell them?

                           (off Big Ben)
                        No, we cool. Marquez yellow-paged 
                        him. But Deandre’s a good soldier. 
                        Didn’t tell Marquez a damn thing.

                        Need a Ouija board to interrogate

                        Yeah, and I think he’s got somebody

                        chasing this thing down for him. 
                        Maybe it’s this guy Marquez.

                                RISLEY
                        No fuckin way. Marquez is a mean 
                        son of a bitch, but dirty he aint.

           EXT. GRAVEL ROOFTOP OF 2-STORY APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON

           Ben and Marquez stealthily Comanche-crawling to the edge of 
           the flat gravel roof, two stories up.

           I thought we were going after 
           Get Some, sir.

           Calliope music, the Turkey in the Straw from an ice cream 
           truck PA system. Prone on the roof, Marquez props himself up 
           on his elbows, peering through binoculars at Brynhurst Ave. 

           BEN’S POV (THROUGH BINOS): 

           The ice cream truck stopped mid-block on Brynhurst. A line of 
           Rollin 60s CRIPS (20s and 30s) forming at the ice cream 
           truck’s open window. Hardcore riders dressed down in powder 
           blue Yankees caps, oversized bone-white Hanes Beefy Ts and 
           North Carolina (Neighborhood Crip) jackets.

           No kids. I’m guessing he 
           ain’t sellin’ ice cream. 
           Dope?

           The Crip in front of the line draws a .357 from his 
           waistband, hands it butt-first through the truck’s window.

           EXT. GET SOME’S CRIB (DENKER AVE) - LATER

           Like a lot of the homes in South Central, Get Some’s Queen 
           Anne-style two-story would be on a historic registry if it 
           weren’t rotting here in the hood. The house looks haunted, a 
           crumbling beauty - surrounded by a spear-topped bedlam fence - 
           the yard a riot of crabgrass, chickweed, El Camino on blocks. 

           Four BOOT HILL MAFIA CRIPS hanging out on the porch, passing 
           a blunt from man to man. Gunslingers. Watchful and laconic.

           We hear the Turkey in the Straw and few Crips crane their 
           necks to see the ICE CREAM TRUCK approaching. They wander out 
           to the curb to meet the truck. Chronic, Get Some’s pit bull 
           chained to the porch. 
           The screen door OPENS. Gethsemane Guyton, AKA GET SOME, 
           stands in the doorway. BOOT and HILL tattooed under his eyes. 
           Get Some calling out to his homies.  

                                GET SOME
                        Hold up.

           Get Some beckons, BIG TRIG, one of his homies, back to the 
           door. Get Some draws a Tec-9 from his waistband, passes it to 
           Trig, who tucks the weapon under his sweatshirt. 

                                GET SOME (CONT’D)
                        That one’s ready to go back.

           BIG TRIG jogs back out across the lawn to meet the ice cream 
           truck, clutching his sweatshirt. Big Trig opens the iron 
           gate. The truck slows to a stop. Chronic growls.

           INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           The stricken ICE CREAM MAN (Hispanic 30s) handcuffed to the 
           wheel. Marquez and Ben crouch in the cargo space behind him.

                        stay cool. 

           Ben’s trembling next to him, clutching the Bean Bag Shotgun. 

           EXT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Get Some watches from the doorway. Chronic’s really going 
           nuts, barking, straining against the chain. Get Some kicks 
           the dog.

                                GET SOME
                        Shut up.

           The other Crips milling in the yard as Big Trig approaches 
           the truck’s window, pulls the Tec-9, and hands it butt-first 
           through the window. Suddenly, Marquez’s hand lashes out, 
           clamping down on Big Trig’s wrist. 

           INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK

           Ben watches Marquez YANK the struggling Big Trig halfway into 
           the truck and PEPPER-SPRAY him point blank in the face.  

                                BIG TRIG
                        Aaargh! Fuck! Fuck!
           EXT. ICE CREAM TRUCK

           Big Trig stumbles backward away from the truck, rolling on to 
           the lawn, palms pressed over his eyes. 

                                BIG TRIG
                        My eyes! 

           One of his panicked homies rushes to Big Trig, two others 
           turning on the truck. But the cargo door slides open and 
           BOOM! BOOM! Ben flattens them both with his BEAN BAG SHOTGUN. 
           They crumple to the lawn, one clutching his belly, the other 
           gasping - wind knocked out of him. The remaining Crip bolts.

           EXT. DENKER AVENUE - CONTINUOUS

           Get Some and Ben lock eyes across the lawn. Get Some turns, 
           disappearing into the house. Ben SPRINTS after him, slinging 
           the Bean Bag shotgun across his chest, and drawing his GLOCK 
           as he runs past Trig, dodging the snarling dog. Marquez 
           running across the lawn, right behind Ben.

           But Big Trig reaches out, blindly catching Marquez’s ankle, 
           and Marquez goes down on the lawn. Big Trig on top of him 
           now, a blind fury of gouging and desperate punching. 

                                BIG TRIG
                        Kill you. Motherfucker!

           INT. GET SOME’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           We’re right at Ben’s shoulder [first-person shooter] with the 
           adrenalized Ben as he RUSHES headlong into the house with his 
           GLOCK up, moving swiftly through the darkened living room 
           into the hallway, trying to look everywhere at once.  

           HALLWAY

           Get Some CHARGES out of the bathroom, slamming Ben against 
           the wall, Get Some’s hands - honed by years of streetfights 
           and speed craps - already on Ben’s wrists. Ben and Get Some 
           grapple for Ben’s gun - a stumbling waltz - the two men 
           CRASHING through bead curtains into the bedroom. 

           BEDROOM

           Rolling on the floor now. BOOM! Ben’s Glock goes off and the 
           bean bag chair EXPLODES in a snow-globe blizzard of Styrofoam 
           beads. They grapple, roll and BOOM! Another wild shot and the 
           huge fish tank SHATTERS, spilling water and writhing, 
           snapping SNAKEHEADS across the floor. 

           Ben loses his grip on his gun, the Glock slipping away in the 
           water. But now Get Some takes hold of the BEAN BAG SHOTGUN, 
           using its nylon sling to CHOKE Ben. Gagging, Ben reaches for 
           his gun. Just beyond his outstretched fingers.
           MARQUEZ 

           Marquez KNOCKS Get Some off his feet with a John Wayne 
           haymaker. Get Some splashing down into shallow water.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Gasping, Ben unslings his bean bag shotgun, grabs his Glock, 
           holsters it. Marquez rolls Get Some over, his handcuffs 
           biting deep. Marquez pauses a half-moment, appraising the 
           hydroponics, marijuana plants.

                        So you don’t approve? You rather I 
                        play tennis with those kids from
                        Crossroads? Is that it?

           As we ...

                                                     FLASH BACK TO:

           INT. WILTERN THEATRE - NIGHT

           In the past ... The star-studded LAUNCH PARTY for THUG, 
           Darius' hip-hop lifestyle magazine: The venue redecorated in 
           CRIP BLUE. Packed with enough beautiful people to put the 
           Fire Marshall into cardiac arrest.  Music BLARES. 

           Big Ben and Benji at the bar, arguing.

                                                     BENJI
                                 Good, because you made it 
                                 happen.
                        BIG BEN
           Listen. It’s not a matter of 
           my approval. You know you 
           always have my approval. 
           Always. It’s-

                        BIG BEN
                                                     BENJI
                                 I come by it honestly.
           Made her leave, you mean? 
           Christ, you got a mean streak 
           on you, kid.

                        BIG BEN
                                                BIG BEN (CONT’D)
                                 You’re the one who introduced 
                                 me to Darius. He’s your 
                                 client. So is Carcosa. I grew 
                                 up calling him Uncle Joe for 
                                 shit’s sake. And that’s on 
                                 you, Dad.   
           Yeah, yeah. I know I’m the 
           son of a bitch who named you 
           Sue and all that jazz, but 
           I’m also the son of a bitch 
           who stayed. Because you’re my 
           son and the life I wanted for 
           you? This ain’t it.   

                                                     BENJI
                                 Well, you’ve come a long way, 
                                 baby.
                        BIG BEN
           It was different when I hung 
           my shingle out here. LA was 
           different. People were scared 
           of Daryl Gates and the LAPD 
           was all these Hoss 
           Cartwrights who’d choke you 
           out being black in Brentwood.
                        BIG BEN
                                                     BENJI
                                 Accomplishment? I guess 
                                 that’s the real opiate of the 
                                 masses isn’t it? The good 
                                 sportsmanship trophy.
                                             (off Darius)
           You’re old enough to know 
           life’s a scholarship to clown 
           college, kid. And that’s if 
           you’re lucky. If you’re lucky 
           you just wind up with seltzer 
           and banana cream pie in your 
           face. If you’re not so lucky, 
           it’ll make an example of you. 
           And your accomplishments.
                                 But see?  Boom!  Now, that's 
                                 real power, Dad.  The power 
                                 to unmake, the power to tear 
                                 it down. 

           Big Ben throws up a sardonic Black-Power fist.

                        BIG BEN
           Power to the People, huh? 
                (beat)
                                                     BENJI
                                 I’d say it sounds like more 
                                 of your Pet-Rock bullshit.
           Look, what if I told you I 
           was working on my own killer 
           app?

                        BIG BEN
           No bullshit. You and me could 
           change the whole equation 
           here.
                                                     BENJI
                                 Yeah, sorry. I know the Cat’s 
                                 in the Cradle and all that 
                                 shit, but I think we’re past 
                                 it, you know. Whatever you’ve 
                                 got in the hopper, leave me 
                                 out of it, okay?  

           INT. WILTERN - VIP TABLE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Benji, Darius, Jax toast. They're all pretty tight by now, 
           but Sasparilla's totally shit-faced.

                        DARIUS
                                                     BENJI
                                 Right next to Michael 
                                 Jackson. He’d love your pet 
                                 jaguar. More Jesus Juice? 
           Fragrances.  Video games. 
           Last week, I talked to some 
           Saudis who want to bankroll a 
           hip hop theme park in Dubai. 

                        DARIUS
                                                     BENJI
                (laughing)
           Fuck you, man. I want out. 
           I’m goin legit here.
                                 So you can grow out your 
                                 nails, start saving your 
                                 urine in jars?
                                             (sobering)
                                 Jesus, you’re serious?

           A moment between friends. 

                                DARIUS
                        Serious as a drive-by, brother. 

           EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - MINUTES LATER
           Paparazzi FLASHBULBS.  The four of them step out on to the 
           red carpet.  Jax leads the way, making a hole.  Behind him, 
           Sasparilla stumbles with one arm draped around Darius' 
           shoulders and another draped over Benji's - heading for 
           Darius' HUMMER, parked right in front. SECURITY holds back a 
           human wall of rabid FANS.  WANNABEES thrusting demo CDs at 
           Darius. WOMEN in stylish cocktail dresses begging to be let 
           into the party.

           Then a HAND GRENADE rolls under the ropes and everything 
           slows way down ... Benji, Darius - the whole crowd - holding 
           their breath, bracing for an explosion. The grenade HISSES, 
           leaking dark RED SMOKE.

                                DARIUS (CONT’D)
                           (drawing pistol)
                        Get to the car.

           ANOTHER hand grenade lands on the red carpet in front of 
           Benji. Hiss.  Then ANOTHER. Hiss. Roiling RED SMOKE.  The 
           crowd panic-surges through the velvet ropes, stampeding 
           security guards.  Fire alarm BLARING.  Guests bustling out 
           the exits.  Chaos.  People trampled. GUNFIRE ERUPTING.  Benji 
           hits the deck.  Incendiary TRACERS slicing through 
           particulate smoke around Benji, leaving red CONTRAILS - 
           torpedoes through deep water. 

           Sasparilla suddenly COLLAPSES in front of Benji, convulsing. 
           White phosphorous smoke pouring from the hole in Postmortem’s 
           chest.  He's on fire.  Benji tries to put it out, burns his 
           hands.  Darius hauls Benji to his feet. 

                                DARIUS (CONT’D)
                        Leave him, Benji.  He's all done.

           Ghostly FIGURES stalk them through the swirling red smoke. 
           Appear. Disappear. Gas masks, carrying AK-47s.

           Darius, Ben, and Jax running for the Hummer. Jax FIRING his 
           twin pistols to cover their escape. Jax throws open the 
           Hummer's back door, SHOVES Darius in the back seat, COVERS 
           him like a secret service agent.  Benji SCRAMBLES over the 
           hood, into the driver's seat.

                                JAX
                        Go!  Go!

           Benji SLAMS the gas, squealing west down Wilshire.

           INT. CERTAIN DEATH'S HOTEL SUITE - LATER

           CERTAIN DEATH, kneels in front a glass coffee table.  A naked 
           CALL GIRL across the coffee table. Certain Death SNORTING 
           rails of coke from the girl's flat belly. She sees Darius 
           before Certain Death does, the coke demanding his 
           concentration. But she knows better than to scream.Certain 
           Death comes up for air, pushes his dreadlocks out of his 
           dilated eyes and sees Darius standing over him. 
                     CERTAIN DEATH
                                                     DARIUS
                (sniff)
           What's up?
                                 You’re a bitch, brah. With 
                                 pigtails and shit. Serious.

                     CERTAIN DEATH
                                                     DARIUS
           He was mine. Fuck you. 
                                 Fuck you. 
                                             (to Benji)
                                 This Little girl’d tear the 
                                 head off her own dolly before 
                                 she’d let another kid play 
                                 with it. 

           Certain Death REACHING for something under the bed and Darius 
           KICKS him full in the face.  His head SNAPS back, mouth-blood 
           rooster-tailing. Certain Death goes down. The call girl 
           gathers her clothes, slips out the door. Quick.

                                                     DARIUS
                         BENJI
           Whoa! Whoa! I thought we were 
           going to negotiate here.
                                 This is how Israel 
                                 negotiates.  Thought you'd 
                                 appreciate that.

           Jax CUTTING the nylon cord from the blinds, letting them FALL 
           to cover the window. Bowie knife between his teeth, he 
           straddles Certain Death, WRAPPING the cord around the man's 
           hands and feet like a champion calf roper. Benji watches Jax 
           stuff a SOCK into the man's bloody mouth.

                                BENJI
                        Darius, you have to stop this.

           And, in this moment, everything changes between them.

                        DARIUS
           What did you just say?
                                                     BENJI
                                 You told me you wanted out. 

           Jax circles stealthily, ready to take Benji out.

                                                     BENJI
                                 I can’t let you do this.
                        DARIUS
           There is no out. There’s just 
           this. And the ride doesn’t 
           stop long enough for anyone 
           to get off.

           Darius dips his shoulder, catching Benji’s chin with an 
           UPPERCUT that lifts Benji off his feet. Benji falls backward, 
           CRASHING down through the glass coffee table.

                                DARIUS
                        You don’t even know what this is! 
                        What the fuck do you know about the 
                        life? You like all the parties and 
                        pussy. Grand Theft Auto. One big 
                        fuckin videogame. You don’t know 
                        me. You don’t know shit, Benji. 
                        You’re a fuckin’ tourist.
                                (MORE)
                                DARIUS (CONT'D)
                           (beat)
                        Me and Jax. We were born to this. 

           Dazed, Benji sees Jax SLIDING his BLADE behind Certain 
           Death's ear. Certain Death screaming into the sock -

                                BENJI
                        No!

           -Jax surgically PASSING the blade around Certain Death’s head 
           in a single practiced motion, SCALPING him! Now Jax OPENS his 
           throat.  Blood soaks the sock in Certain Death’s mouth until 
           looks like he’s swallowed a rose. Dead. Jax gets up, blade in 
           hand, stalking toward BENJI now.

           Benji turns his head. Under the bed next to him, Benji 
           catches sight of Certain Death's .44 COLT DESERT EAGLE.  
           Benji rolls, grabs the Colt, angles it up at Darius.  

                                DARIUS
                        Oh, you gone shoot me?

           Jax grips the blade of his Bowie knife, ready to throw. Benji 
           moves quickly, putting his back to the wall.

                                BENJI
                        I'm going to shoot Jax first. See 
                        where it goes from there. 

           The three of them in a close-quarters Mexican standoff. 

           KNOCK!  KNOCK!  KNOCK!

                                SECURITY GUARD
                           (behind door)
                        Hotel Security.

           Jax and Darius exchange panicked looks.  Jax throws the 
           bedspread over Certain Death's body.

                                BENJI
                        CALL THE POLICE!

           Darius LUNGES for Benji's gun. Jax YANKS open the door, 
           expertly drives his knife into the first SECURITY GUARD’S 
           chest, pulls it out and SLASHES the second SECURITY GUARD’S 
           throat, killing both men instantly. While Benji & Darius 
           viciously GRAPPLE for the Colt, Jax hurriedly drags the 
           bodies into the room. Grim. Efficient.

           Darius and Benji stumble, CRASHING through the window, 
           TUMBLING out through 10 stories of empty desert air.

           EXT. HARD ROCK HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Darius and Benji SPLASHING down into the pool.  

           Darius surfaces, stroking to the side. Benji's gone. And we 
           HEAR Carcosa’s voice PRELAPPING:

                        This isn’t good for anyone. There 
                        is a natural order in this city. A 
                        delicate ecosystem. And these 
                        savages have upset the balance.

           INT. CARCOSA’S DEN - THE NEXT DAY

           BENJI & CARCOSA in high-backed leather chairs, watching NEWS 
           FOOTAGE: the daring ROBBERY of the BANCO POPULAR.

                                      CARCOSA
                        There will be blood in the streets 
                        now. Needless blood, Benji. Unless 
                        you and I can restore that balance.

                                      BENJI
                        Look, it’s not that I don’t care, 
                        but what the hell am I supposed to 
                        do about it? Darius has a god 
                        damned price on my head. I’m Salman 
                        Rushdie here, Joe. I can’t go home. 
                        Can’t even go out. I’m fucked.

                                CARCOSA
                        Well, this unfortunate business 
                        with Darius and has presented us 
                        with a unique opportunity. I 
                        believe I have a way to solve both 
                        our problems. If you’re willing.

                        So this is your big plan? Not that 
                        I’m ungrateful or anything, but, 
                        what? I mean, I just run? Where?

                        assurances he will pass his 
                        background examination without 
                        difficulty. 

                                BENJI
                        You want me to become a cop?
           INT. ACADEMY BARBER SHOP

           Ben settles into the barber’s chair. One after another, 
           CLUMPS of freshly-cut hair hit the checkered linoleum.

                                CARCOSA(V.O.)
                        I need another pair of eyes inside 
                        the LAPD for this, mijo. Someone I 
                        can trust. But no one can know, 
                        Benji. Not even your father.

                                                          BACK TO:

           INT. DETECTIVES BUREAU - NIGHT

           PRESENT: Marquez and Ben sit in Chuin’s cubicle. They’ve been 
           stuck waiting here a while. From here, we can see through the 
           window into Lt. Vintner’s office. Chuin and Vintner inside 
           the office, having a ‘heated discussion’ (read: shouting 
           match). Profanity leaking out through the thin walls. The 
           other detectives chuckle, shake their heads. 

           Chuin suddenly charges red-faced out of Vintner’s office, 
           slams the door shut behind him.  

                         CHUIN
                                                    MARQUEZ

                                 me.

                         CHUIN
           He’s a CRI.
                                                    MARQUEZ
                                 Bullshit. Bullshit.

                                BEN
                        CRI?

                         CHUIN
                                                    MARQUEZ
                                 Who’s runnin’ him?
           ‘Confidential Reliable 
           Informant.’

           At the moment, the doors to the corridor swing open.

                                CHUIN
                        Guess.

           Risley and Mapes swagger into the bureau, two dark-blue 
           gunfighters stepping into a saloon. The bureau falls silent. 

           MARQUEZ

           As soon as he sees Risley, Marquez bolts up from his chair. 

                                CHUIN (CONT’D)
                        Miguel, Miguel! Wait! Jesus!

           Chuin grabs his arm, but Marquez YANKS it away, charging at 
           Risley. Ben rushing to his partner’s side. 
           Risley giving Marquez his homicidal, hail-fellow smile, even 
           as Marquez bunches his fists, consuming the distance between 
           them in long strides, just steps away from a fist fight.

                                CHUIN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, hey! Officer needs assistance!

           Other detectives see Marquez about to throw blows (and throw 
           his career away). They’re instantly out of their cubicles, 
           rushing to intercept Marquez before he reaches Risley. 

                                DETECTIVE 1
                        Easy, Miguel.

                                RISLEY
                        Yeah, Miguel. Easy.

           Two detectives hold Marquez back, but Marquez BULLS them 
           forward, reaching for Risley. A third detective locks his 
           arms around Marquez, holding on for dear life.

                                DETECTIVE 2
                        He’s not worth your badge, brother.

           Marquez’s blood is up, rage thickening his features. 

                        MARQUEZ
                (growling at Risley)
           Take that badge off, Cabe. 
                                                     RISLEY
                                 Maybe you think you can take 
                                 it from me, old man. Come on.

           Ben steps forward, SHOVING Risley hard. Risley stumbles, a 
           death for Ben in his eyes now. 

           Mapes steps in, CLAMPS his left mitt around Ben’s throat and 
           cocks his right FIST, ready to put his knuckles through the 
           back of Ben’s skull. Ben unflinching.

                                LT. VINTNER
                        Enough. All of you. Stand down.

           Mapes releases Ben. Nobody dares let go of Marquez, still 
           seething. 

                                RISLEY
                           (re: Ben)
                        Whoa, they let you have another 
                        boot, Marquez? Damn. I mean, after 
                        what happened to Ramos I figured 
                        they’d have you ridin’ the pine. 

                                MARQUEZ
                        Next time, I will not hesitate. Not 
                        for a second, hear me?

                                LT. VINTNER
                        I said that’s enough. Goddamnit.
                           (to Chuin and Marquez)
                        You two. In my office. Now.
           Marquez and Chuin head into Vintner’s office like two hangdog 
           kids going to see the principal. Ben remains.

                                LT. VINTNER (CONT’D)
                           (to Risley and Mapes)
                        And you two. Out of my station. 

           Cold stares from the other detectives. Risley and Mapes are 
           not welcome here in 77th, but Risley doesn’t give a fuck. 

           Risley lingers, taking a moment to return each of the 
           detectives’ hostile stares with a smug fuck you in his eyes.

           And one by one, the detectives lower their eyes. Afraid. No 
           one in the bureau holds up to Risley’s alpha-wolf glare.

           No one, that is, until Risley’s gaze settles on Ben. The two 
           men face each other for a long moment, Risley realizing 
           there’s more to this rookie than he first suspected.

                                RISLEY
                        See ya ‘round, Mayonnaise.

                                BEN
                        Yeah, count on it.

           And Risley does a slow turn, like a banking shark, Risley 
           giving Ben a runway-model exhibition of his sleeve-bursting 
           arms. Risley’s lupine grin telling Ben - the better to eat 
           you with - then Risley stalks out the door with Mapes in tow. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. LT. VINTNER’S OFFICE - SECONDS LATER

           Vintner behind his big desk. Chuin sitting across from him on 
           Vintner’s leather couch. Marquez still pacing back and forth.

                                LT. VINTNER
                        Sit down, Miguel. 

                                MARQUEZ
                        I’ll stand, LT.

                        sit your ass down.

           Reluctantly, Marquez slumps into the couch next to Chuin.

                        -No, you listen. Guyton says you 
                        asked him about a bank robbery. And 
                        Miguel? I love you, and you’re my 
                        boy, but brother if you do not let

                        Marquez and his partner jacked a

           launches himself at Marquez, but Marquez lays the guy out 
           with a John-Wayne haymaker. Marquez KICKS the guy off Ben. 

           Ben scrambles to his feet and both officers draw their BATONS

           aluminum BASEBALL BAT comes at Ben from behind, HITTING Ben 
           across the shoulder blades. Ben stumbles forward, dropping 
           his baton, almost losing his feet.   

           Marquez sheaths his baton and DRAWS his PISTOL in one 
           practiced samurai-like MOTION. The crowd reacts.

           with the business end of his .45. Ben draws his gun and the 
           two men stand back to back, totally surrounded by hostiles.

           A phalanx of riot-geared METRO OFFICERS wedge through the

           Ben awkwardly trying to stay out of the way of a efficient 
           scramble of TRAUMA SURGEONS bustling around Rayneece, 
           intubating her. Giving her a syringe full of ADRENALINE.

           CRACKING the girl’s ribs, gloved hands REACHING into her open 
           chest cavity to massage her heart. No response.

           INT. TRAUMA CENTER AT CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL - SECONDS LATER

           The bloody SHEET comes up over Rayneece’s open, beautiful 
           eyes. The girl’s delicate HAND hangs limply from the 
           operating table, dangling out from under the sheet. 

           Ben notices her glitter fingernail polish. Blood drops from 
           her thin fingers on to the linoleum floor. 

                                  Plip. Plip. Plip.

           Ben facing RAYNEECE’S MOTHER, the woman herself is so young 
           that she and Rayneece could have been sisters. 
           And the woman’s eyes, desperate with hope, finding Ben’s 
           BADGE under the fluorescents. His nameplate: HALLORAN. Her 
           EYES closed to shut out what Ben has to tell her.

                                RAYNEECE’S MOTHER
                        Oh, my dear Jesus Lord! Not my baby 
                        girl! Please, God, not my baby!

           She COLLAPSES under the weight of it, falling against Ben. 
           Ben just holds her. He doesn’t know what else to do. And now 
           the other PEOPLE milling around the lobby STARE at them.

           EXT. TRAUMA CENTER LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Marquez standing alone in the dark PARKING LOT, just outside 
           the window, looking into the lighted lobby at his partner. 
           The effect is like a two-way mirror. Marquez can see Ben, but 
           Ben can’t see him. Marquez watching this young cop holding 
           the utterly broken mother while her sobs shake them both.

           Ben catches sight of his own spectral REFLECTION in the night-
           black lobby WINDOW. And Ben doesn’t even recognize himself at 
           first, the COP staring back at him. Because somehow, in spite 
           of all the lies, Ben’s not pretending to be a cop anymore.

           Around them silhouetted against the night sky like the bones 
           of some dead leviathan, rise the rotting timber remnants of 
           the original LAPD CONFIDENCE COURSE. Ladders, climbing walls,

           Ben’s lost. They both are. The radio suddenly CRACKLES,

           Marquez re-holsters his gun. He looks out over the basin, 
           taking in the city, his city, one last time.

           INT. GET SOME’S CRIB (LIVING ROOM) - MINUTES LATER

           Television light flickers over Get Some’s face. He’s alone, 
           watching the aftermath of C-Love’s murder. On the TELEVISION: 
           live aerial footage of angry crowds on 10th Avenue, pushing 
           against a skirmish line of cops in full riot gear. A car 
           tipped over. Another car engulfed in flame. 

           Get Some’s front door suddenly SPLINTERS, kicked open. BEN 
           and MARQUEZ charge into the house. Marquez’s .45 evident in 
           his fist. Ben carries a Remington 870 12-gauge shotgun.

                                GET SOME
                        What the fuck?!? What is this 
                        bullshit? You can’t do this, man. I 
                        work for LAPD, remember?

           Marquez adjusts his aim, putting the muzzle of his .45 
           between Get Some’s eyes. 

                                MARQUEZ
                        Ask me if I give a shit.

           Ben handcuffs Get Some, patting him down. Nothing on the guy 
           but a cellular phone. Marquez nods to Ben: Check the house. 
           Ben heads into the hallway, leading with his shotgun. 

                                GET SOME
                        Call your boss. I’m a registered

                        major mistake comin’ here, Marquez.

           Marquez pulls a rickety wooden chair from the kitchen table, 
           SLAMS the chair into the backs of Get Some’s legs, forcing 
           his knees to bend - Oww - Get Some slumps into the chair.

                                MARQUEZ
                        Made ‘em before.

           Marquez opens the fridge, grabs a cold BUDWEISER, pops the 
           tab, lifts the foaming can to his lips. Pausing to savor it. 
           Get Some watches Marquez suck the whole can down. Marquez 
           looks at Get Some, crushes the can in his fist, tosses it on 
           the kitchen floor. Belches.

           ON THE TELEVISION, aerial footage of the mob on 10th Avenue 
           swarming over an LAPD black and white, rocking and tipping 
           it. Fire spreading to C-Love’s apartment building. Chaos.

           ‘Cause you’re next on 
           Risley’s hit list. You know 
           that, right?  

           Marquez peels the stained pillowcase off a pillow, then takes 
           the wooden fruit bowl from the counter and dumps the flyblown 
           oranges into the pillowcase.

                        Really? You sure that’s how you 
                        wanna play this?

           With a flick of his wrist, Marquez expertly twists the end of 
           the weighted pillowcase, winding it around his fist. The 
           pillowcase full of oranges now swings like a mace and chain.

                        killed Wizard, Deandre, and Keith-

           SWINGING the weighted pillowcase with precision. Oranges THUD 
           bluntly into Get Some’s solar plexus - stealing his breath.

           Ben searches the house. On Get Some’s dresser: a FRAMED PHOTO 
           of Get Some with Deandre and Keith at Magic Mountain - all 
           three of them throwing up Boot Hill. Ben pauses.

           Ben checks the closet, finds a BARNETT QUAD 300 CROSSBOW. Ben 
           slings his shotgun, hefts the wicked-looking crossbow.
           INT. GET SOME’S CRIB (LIVING ROOM) - CONTINUOUS

           Plip. Plip. ... Juice from the broken oranges already seeping 
           through the cotton pillowcase, dripping on to the carpet.

           Marquez swings UNDERHAND, like a softball pitcher, DRIVING 
           the weighted pillowcase deep into Get Some’s GUT. Get Some 
           folds over in his chair. Get Some LAUGHING through his agony.

                        Dunno. Bought ‘em from a Messican.

           Laughing in spite of himself, Marquez swings OVERHAND, 
           bringing the pillowcase DOWN on Get Some’s KIDNEYS. Orange 
           splotches on Get Some’s t-shirt. Marquez pauses, hearing Get 
           Some’s guts CHURN. Marquez leans in. Sniffs theatrically.

                        Fucking juice oranges.

           Marquez unwraps the pillowcase, tosses it aside. He fishes 
           another Bud from the fridge. He cracks the Budweiser, Marquez 
           getting a little tight, this one going down easier.

           Ben walks back into the living room, holding the BARNETT QUAD

           Marquez digs a $20 out of his own pocket, places it on the 
           table next to Ben’s, grabs a fresh Bud from the fridge.

           Get Some pitches his head like a horse dodging a bridle. 
           Marquez CLAMPS his fist around Get Some’s throat and SLAMS 
           the back of Get Some’s head against the wall - hard enough to 
           crack the plaster. He balances the can atop Get Some’s head - 
           William Tell style. Ben shoulders the crossbow, takes aim.

           Some’s head RUPTURES, jagged lobes of aluminum peeling back 
           like flower petals - the arrow embedded to its fletching.

           Ben LEAPING over the couch. He PARTS the curtains with two 
           fingers - just enough space for one eye.

           THROUGH THE CURTAINS:

           We see an LAPD Black & White cruising slowly up the darkened 
           street like a crocodile through muddy water.

           The Black & White parks diagonally in front of Get Some’s 
           house. TWO G-RIDES pull in behind it. FOUR MEN in each car - 
           all wearing black balaclavas. Practiced professionals. 

           INT. G-RIDE - CONTINUOUS

           Risley black-clad Crip assassins hastily screwing sound-
           suppressors on to their COMPACT ASSAULT WEAPONS. 

           Each donning NIGHT-VISION goggles. One of them throws the

           WHINE and then go SILENT. Ben keys his radio, keys it again.

           No answer. Risley holding a SILENCED SCORPION MACHINE PISTOL 
           slyly behind his back - the weapon definitely NOT LAPD-issue. 
           Risley CALLING out to the house.

           Risley starts, then SMILES warmly as he and Mapes move to 
           cover behind the engine block of his black and white.

                                RISLEY

           INT. GET SOME’S CRIB (HALL CLOSET) - CONTINUOUS

           Ben’s hurriedly removing Get Some’s handcuffs, quietly 
           pulling up the ACCESS PANEL in the floor, so Get Some can 
           slip down into the crawl space under the house. Safe.

                        because her butt is too narrow!

           Get Some’s WTF look. Ben puts his finger to his lips and 
           closes the panel, then Ben tosses some clothes over the panel 
           to camouflage it. Ben closes the closet door. 

           EXT. GET SOME’S CRIB - CONTINUOUS

           Silently signalling his troops. The Crips in black exit their 
           cars and quickly surround the house, moving like a SWAT team. 

           INT. GET SOME’S CRIB (HALLWAY) - CONTINUOUS

           Ben heading back out toward the living room, keeping low. He 
           GLIMPSES the DARK SHADOWS moving past the windows outside.

           EXT. GET SOME’S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           An ENTRY TEAM of Crip Commandos crouched at the back door, 
           keyed-up, locked and loaded, ready to storm the place. 

           INT. GET SOME’S CRIB (BACK DOOR) - CONTINUOUS

           Ben with the crossbow and Marquez with the shotgun waiting on 
           the other side of the door.

                        What do say, Miguel?

           INTERCUT:

           The LEAD MAN, stands, kicks the back door open and - thunk - 
           an ARROW goes through him like a hot knife through butter - 
           the bloody point bursting out through his back to PIERCE the 
           man directly behind him, PINNING the two of them together! 

           They crumple in the doorway, exposing the Crip behind them. 
           Marquez FIRES the shotgun, obliterating that guy’s goggles 
           and most of his skull. Bodies falling, blocking the door. 

           The bad guys answer Marquez with the unholy BZZZZT of 
           silenced AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRING, chewing through the house. 

           CRAWL SPACE: Get Some curling fetal, palms over his ears.

           BEN AND MARQUEZ RUNNING AND GUNNING

           Marquez DRAWS his .45 as he TOSSES the shotgun to Ben. 

           And the SHOTGUN seems to FLOAT. 

           Two CRIPS hard-charging through the door, WEAPONS BLAZING. 
           Geysering splinters and powdered sheetrock - bands of mote-
           filled moonlight slotting in through big bullet holes.

           The SHOTGUN FLOATS through bands of moonlight. End over End.

           Ben CATCHES the shotgun, TROMBONES the slide, FIRING out his 
           window, BLASTING two CRIPS backward off their feet. 

           More coming. Marquez firing as he shoves Ben out of the way. 
           Stitching the walls as Ben and Marquez hustle up the stairs.

           OUT FRONT:

                                RISLEY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck it. There’s a riot on anyay. 
                        Just burn it down around them.
           The CRIP crouching behind the G-RIDE, pops the trunk, pulls a 
           pre-made MOLOTOV COCKTAIL from a plastic crate FULL OF THEM. 

           RUNNING UPSTAIRS:

           Reaching the top of the stairs, MARQUEZ topples a DESK, to 
           form a barricade, FIRING down over it at their PURSUERS.

           OUT FRONT:

           FLICK! The Crip LIGHTS the gas-soaked rag, COCKING back to 
           THROW the bottle ...

           BEN UPSTAIRS:

           Ben putting the stock of the SHOTGUN to his shoulder. From 
           the upstairs window, Ben takes careful aim at the THROWER. 

           The guy at the top of his WIND-UP when Ben FIRES, buckshot 
           hitting the BOTTLE itself - WHUUMPPFF! The bottle EXPLODES, 
           instantly turning the guy into the HUMAN TORCH. Arrgh!

                        God damn it-

           Totally engulfed in flame, the guy SLUMPS over the trunk -

                        Oh, fuck no.

           KA-BOOOM! Like a cherry bomb under a giant coffee can, the 
           whole G-RIDE lifted and spun by a BALL OF FLAME!

           UPSTAIRS

           Ben and Marquez seize the moment, running and CRASHING out 
           through the upstairs window -

           -AIRBORNE, FLAILING, SAILING OVER THE SPEAR-TOPPED FENCE-

           - landing HARD on the neighbor’s single-story ROOF, rolling 
           off and ... 

           ... RUNNING like hell through BACKYARD after BACKYARD with a 
           wolf-pack of swift SHADOWS stalking them. FZZZT! Banners of 
           fire flickering from their muzzles, chewing through fences.

           NEXT BLOCK:

           Their Black & White, discretely parked on the dark street mid-
           block. Ben and Marquez SPRINTING for the car like it’s a life 
           raft, Ben duke-sliding the hood, JUMPING into their seats ...

           INT. BLACK AND WHITE - CONTINUOUS

           Ben grabbing the Convertacom MIKE, keying it HARD. Hoping.

                        and Slauson! 

           Marquez turns the ignition. Click! DEAD.

                                MARQUEZ
                        EMP must have killed the - 

           FROM OFF SCREEN:

           Something RAMS us, shattering glass, SPINNING the black and 
           white 360 degrees. Ben’s stunned, glass in his hair, 
           blinking, trying to get his bearings. A spidery BULGE in the 
           windshield. Marquez’s gashed head bleeding on to his airbag. 

           And now the world slows WAY down ... Marquez’s lips are 
           moving, shouting orders at Ben, but there is no sound.

           Ben reaches around his airbag, fumbles for his gun, but he’s 
           BLINDED by halogen high beams - whiteness filling the world 
           as the TRUCK charges up the street to RAM us head-on. 

           Squinting against the supernatural glare, Marquez raises his 
           big Smith .45, FIRING soundlessly out through the windshield.

           Ben’s in shock, mesmerized by each spent .45 casing SLOW-
           MOTION ejecting from Marquez’s weapon as he fires. One after 
           another, the brass casings flip like coins on to their dash.

           BEN’S POV:

           The oncoming truck’s left headlight WINKS out. And now - all 
           at once - all the SOUND and SPEED come flooding back into the 
           world with the bone-shattering HEAD-ON COLLISION that folds 
           the front of their black and white like a piece of tinfoil. 

           EXT. BLACK AND WHITE - CONTINUOUS

           The big TRUCK comes on like a bulldozer, SHOVING the black 
           and white backward. The black and white shudders and jumps, 
           rear wheels hopping the curb, the back bumper shearing a city 
           FIRE HYDRANT from its bolts. A SUDDEN GEYSER pounding the 
           underside of the car. The engine sputters and stops.

           INT. BLACK AND WHITE - CONTINUOUS

           Ben looks down to see the frothy water somehow SPURTING up 
           through the floor, boiling up to float the floor mats, now 
           churning up over their seats. Ben struggles, but he’s pinned 
           to his seat by the buckled dash. Sizzling SPARKS as the water 
           FRIES their radio, RISING to chest level. 

           Out the windows, Ben sees shadows stalking around the car, 
           the Boot Hill Mafia surrounds them.
                                BEN
                        Miguel, I can’t reach my shit, man. 
                        You gotta hand me your gun.

           Marquez groans, his head lolling forward, nose split open. 
           Blood covering his mustache like paint on a brush, pouring 
           down the front of him to cloud the churning water. 

                     BEN (CONT’D)

           Now Timberline BOOTS stomp out our shattered windshield. 
           Glass raining down on us. 

           Ben draws his KNIFE. Claw-like hands reaching down through 
           broken glass, grabbing the semi-conscious Marquez, hauling 
           him out. More hands tearing at Ben’s uniform shirt. Ben 
           twists away, stabbing desperately until the knife is yanked 
           from his hand. A big HAND clamping down on Ben’s wrist. 
           Crazed, Ben BITING down through brown fingers, blood filling 
           his mouth. Yowling screams.

           EXT. BLACK AND WHITE - CONTINUOUS

           CRIPS working with the practiced efficiency of firemen, 
           forcing crowbars between the posts and buckled doors. The 
           doors groaning, POPPING open - and a sudden, sucking 
           WATERFALL carries Ben tumbling out into the street. 

           BEN

           Hands and knees, trying to find his feet; Crips surround him, 
           dark shapes blotting the night sky. Ben tries to scramble 
           away, but BOOTS smash down on scrabbling fingers, cave in his 
           ribs, stealing his breath. HOWLING LAUGHTER. A bottle 
           explodes against the back of Ben’s head ...

           .. and our world goes BLACK.

           INT. SPOOKHOUSE - NIGHT

           Ben blinks, eyes adjusting to eerie torchlight, his wrists 
           handcuffed in front of him. Marquez slumps next to Ben, 
           unconscious. Or worse. They’re curled on the dirt floor of a 
           long-abandoned QUONSET WAREHOUSE: verging on collapse, 
           supported by sagging struts. Rock pigeons among the rotting 
           beams. SNEAKER FRUIT hanging by laces from the crossbeams. 
           The only light in the warehouse comes from a ring of bamboo 
           Tiki torches around a LARGE PIT in the center of the floor. 

           ANOTHER ANGLE

           Ben staring in horror at the wispy scraps of FLESH and HAIR 
           hanging from fishing line in front of him. Dried scalps.
           Wooden pallets and olive drab CRATES of MA-27 Light Antitank 
           Weapons. Grenades. A Vulcan MINIGUN on a tripod. An arsenal.

           THE BOOT HILL MAFIA CRIPS

           30 gangsters STARE back, anxious to get this party started. A 
           A young CRIP approaches Ben. Ben closes his eyes, feigning 
           unconsciousness, as the Crip, unzips, PISSING on Ben’s head. 

                                CRIP
                        Rise and shine, Onetime. 

           Echoing laughter. Crips crowd, encircling Ben & Marquez. 
           Rough hands forcing them both to sit upright. Marquez’s 
           bloody head hanging. Still out cold. Or dead.

                                BEN
                           (sardonic)
                        Alright, fuck it. You’re all under 
                        arrest. Hands behind your heads. 

           Roaring LAUGHTER. A kid (15) wearing a WAVE CAP, tears off 
           Ben’s BADGE, proudly holds it up for the others like he’s 
           caught a fly. They snatch at it, but the kid twists away. 
           POWAY CHARLIE pushes through the crowd, wearing both Ben’s & 
           Marquez’s GUN BELTS bandolier-slung across him. He rips off 
           Ben’s HALLORAN nameplate, turning it to catch the torchlight. 

           Poway Charlie pockets Ben’s nameplate, SNAPS his fingers. 
           Someone tosses him a SPRAYCAN. Ben struggles to turn away 
           while Poway Charlie covers Ben’s face in BLACK SPRAY PAINT. 

                                POWAY CHARLIE
                        Uh huh. There now, you the nigga.

           Laughter. [String him up! Hang that nigga! ] Ben gasps, 
           blinded for a moment, crying caustic paint from his eyes. 

           ANOTHER ANGLE:

           Crips PART for Risley and Mapes. Risley HAULS Marquez to his 
           feet. Mapes yanks Ben up. Risley twirls his SIDE-HANDLE BATON 
           -LAPD’s infamous 24” Monadnock. *see under Rodney King.

                                RISLEY
                        So, gentlemen. Here’s the $64,000 
                        question: Where you hidin’ 
                        Gethsemane Guyton, AKA Get Some? 
                           (beat)
                        I know you damn sure didn’t book 
                        his ass. I checked. He’s not in 
                        County. Not at 77th. Donde esta?

           Marquez stands as if at attention - Aslan before the stone 
           table - his handcuffed wrists crossed in front of him. Risley 
           circles Marquez, a prowling wolf, his baton prodding.
                                MARQUEZ
                        This is between us, Cabe. Leave the

                                RISLEY
                        You’re kidding, right? Hey, I’m not 
                        the bad guy here, Marquez.
                           (to Ben)
                        You know he’s the one taught me 
                        proactive policing. But I take it 
                        to another level and now he comes 
                        at me like I’m Pol Fuckin’ Pot? 

                                MARQUEZ
                        Because you crossed the line, Cabe.

                                RISLEY
                        Yeah? And just who the fuck are you 
                        to tell me where the line is? Who 
                        made you Pope of the Popo, huh?

           Risley SWINGS at the backs of Marquez’s legs. Marquez goes 
           down. Laughter. Ben struggles, can’t break free of Mapes.

                           (husky with pain)

                                RISLEY
                        Grow up. You know as well as I do 
                        somebody’s always going to supply 
                        that demand. Simple economics, 
                        Miguel. Magic of the marketplace.

           Marquez painfully regains his feet to FACE Risley. Bloody but 
           unbowed. Risley gets nose to nose with him, serious. 

                                RISLEY (CONT’D)
                        You’re telling me you’d rather 18th 
                        Street run Rampart? MS 13? They’re 
                        animals, Miguel. With me en cargado 
                        the trains ran on time and shit 
                        wasn’t poison. I impacted crime. I 
                        saved lives. I kept the peace. I 
                        brought Jesus to those Indians. And 
                        you’re all up in my shit for it.

           Risley STRIKES - a vicious underhand blow - the BATON deep 
           into Marquez’s solar plexus. Ben practically feels it.

                          BEN

                        blah-blah. You taught me that.

           Risley cocks back to swing. Ben RAKES his boot heel down 
           Mapes’ shin, twists from him and LAUNCHES at Risley’s back. 
           But Risley’s ready with a spinning BACK KICK that knocks Ben 
           on his ass. CRIPS pinning Ben down, kicking, grinding his 
           face into the dirt. Daddy Python draws his Colt.

                                RISLEY (CONT’D)
                        Now where was I? Oh, right.

           Risley catches Marquez in the TEETH his baton. Marquez falls.

                                RISLEY (CONT’D)
                        Ramos was your responsibility,

                        Just like he is.

           Risley NODS and Daddy Python digs the muzzle of his Colt into 
           Ben’s cheek, thumbing back the hammer. Ben closes his eyes. 
           Beat. Then Ben laughs. And LAUGHS. All eyes on him. 

                                BEN
                           (laughing)
                        You assholes still don’t know who

                                DADDY PYTHON
                        Ooh, right, the po-lice. Yeah, I’m

                        I work for Joe Carcosa.

           The room goes silent. The oxygen gone. The Crips look scared. 
           And Ben’s eyes find Marquez. Marquez looks crushed, betrayed. 

                                BEN (CONT’D)
                        Carcosa sent me after the people 
                        who robbed his bank.

                        He sent me after you.

                                RISLEY
                        It’s bullshit. Filibuster. He’s 
                        desperate. Right now, he’d tell you 
                        he could bring back the sun if he 
                        thought you’d turn him loose.
                                BEN
                        You’ll be lucky to see another 
                        sunrise, actually. You’re looking 
                        at a Green Light here, supercop.
                           (to the crowd)
                        All of you fuckers. Poof.

           Risley raises his baton, rushing at Ben. But Marquez rolls, 
           catching Risley’s ankle, TRIPPING him. Risley rage-swarms 
           over Marquez, savagely clubbing his skull. Marquez goes limp.

           INT. SPOOKHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben’s handcuffs are now hooked to a long CHAIN, the chain fed 
           through a pulley high above, and the other end of the chain 
           hooked to Marquez’s handcuffs. Marquez in bad shape.

           Sleepy Loc and Daddy Python haul Ben to the edge of the PIT. 
           Ben struggles, his heels plowing furrows in the dirt as they 
           drag him forward. Two Crips drunk-hold Marquez upright next 
           to Ben. The two of them standing at the edge of the pit.

           Ben peers down into the darkness. 

           THE PIT

           Gnawed bones litter the dirt. Movement. Ben’s eyes adjust to 
           the black. Battle-scarred PIT BULLS staring back at him; pig-
           eyes glittering. Inbred ferocity. Lips drawn back over bright 
           fangs. They leap and snarl, jaws snapping wetly. 

           MARQUEZ

           Swaying on his feet, eyes half-mast. Murmuring something.

                        What’s that? Ready to give?

           Marquez comes ALIVE all at once, savagely HEAD-BUTTING 
           Risley. Risley’s head snapping backward, nose bloodied. 

           *Now quickly - while they’re distracted - Marquez turns and 
           SPITS a blood gob on to Ben’s right wrist - on the handcuff. 

           Marquez gotcha-SMILES at Risley. Mapes grabs Marquez, the 
           muzzle of his .45 pressed against Marquez’s forehead.

                                 give it to him.

           Crips hold them at the edge of the pit. Ben & Marquez stand 
           shoulder-to-shoulder, facing execution. Risley behind them. 
                                RISLEY (CONT’D)
                           (whispering to Ben)
                        Now, Marquez’s a bit heavier. And 
                        that means you get a few minutes to 
                        watch him die. 
                           (letting that sink in)
                        You want to tell me where I can 
                        find Get Some, I’ll put a magic 
                        bullet in your head. As my gift.
                           (snapping his fingers)
                        To say thank you for playing. 

           And Risley SHOVES them both over the edge. They drop, 
           handcuffs yanked over their heads, hanging there.

           INT. PIT - CONTINUOUS

           Ben and Marquez dangling side by side, the dogs below crazed 
           by the sight of them hanging just out of reach. They snarl 
           and leap like dolphins, jaws closing just short.

           The Boot Hill Mafia Crips crowd the edge of the pit, jeering 
           at them, spitting and pissing. Bloodthirsty laughter. 

                          BEN
                                                    MARQUEZ
           I’m sorry.

                                             (Off Ben’s look)
                                 It doesn’t matter, hear me? 
                                 It doesn’t what you were 
                                 before. You’re a cop now.

           The pulley above them creaks slowly. Marquez’s body weight 
           pulling him DOWN into the pit as Ben is pulled UP. Marquez 
           locks eyes with Ben. The last words he’ll ever speak ...

                                MARQUEZ
                        Remember our first day out.
                           (Off Ben’s look)
                        Better to be judged by twelve than 
                        carried by six.

           Ben nods. He understands. Thank you.

           Suddenly, a speckled bitch (with a misshapen snout resembling 
           a bat’s) vaults the pack. Her jaw sinking deep into the meat 
           of Marquez’s left calf - pulling him down ever faster. 

           Marquez kicks and twists, but he can’t shake the dog off. She 
           hangs there, jaws locked in place, Marquez’s blood filling 
           the crinkles in her snout. 

                                BEN
                        No! NO!

           Ben watches - helpless - a the dog, short legs splayed like a 
           gator’s, pulls Marquez down into hell. Laughter.

           DOGS
           Savaging Marquez now, but - amazingly - Marquez does cry out. 
           They’re tearing the meat from his legs, but the man does not 
           make a sound. Blood-painted muzzles rooting the bowels from 
           Marquez’s belly. Fighting each other over his guts.

           MARQUEZ

           Now, Marquez turns upward in a final act of defiance. His 
           eyes find Risley’s: MARQUEZ’S BROWN EYES ARE ALMOST ECSTATIC, 
           BLAZING RIGHTEOUS HATE.  And for that moment, Ben sees that 
           Risley is actually frightened. Even the blood-drunk Crips are 
           chastened, somehow respectful of Marquez’s courage.  

           Then Ben watches Marquez’s eyes cloud over, sightless, and 
           his head slumps. Dead. 

           The pulley overhead CREAKS again. *Marquez outweighed Ben by 
           40 pounds, but the dogs have now torn that away from him.

           And now, like some grotesque Ascension, Marquez dessicated 
           body is pulled UPWARD as Ben DESCENDS toward the slavering, 
           blood-crazed dogs. 

                                RISLEY
                        Last chance to dance, mayonnaise.

           BEN

           As Marquez’s body rises past Ben, Ben KICKS off the wall of 
           the pit, SWINGING to WRAP his legs around Marquez’s ruined 
           body. The pulley STOPS turning.

                                RISLEY (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck?

           Risley peers down at Ben With Ben’s ankles locked around 
           Marquez’s body, they’re both suspended over the snarling 
           pack. Even if Risley wanted to shoot, Marquez’s body blocks 
           his shot. Marquez still protecting his rookie, even in death.

           The Boot Hill Mafia shouting down at Ben. 

                                RISLEY (CONT’D)
                        Shit, shake him loose. 

           Sleepy Loc leans out over the pit, grabs the chain, trying to 
           RATTLE Ben loose.

           BEN

           Ben wriggles his right wrist against the handcuff -slick with 
           Marquez’s bloody spit - finally TWISTING his right hand free.

           Ben slides his hand into the velcro slit in Marquez’s torn 
           uniform for the shoulder holster, pulling out the big bore 
           .44 REVOLVER - Marquez’s secret weapon. 

           Ben FIRES up at Sleepy Loc. BLAM! Catching him in the neck.
           RISLEY

           Risley sees Sleepy Loc shot through the throat. He watches 
           Sleepy Loc pitch forward, grabbing Marquez’s chain as he 
           falls into the pit. The pulley SPINS - whirrr - sawdust 
           trickles and the lattice of rotting timber struts GROANS 
           under the combined weight. About to collapse. Crips scatter.

           INT. PIT - CONTINUOUS

           As Sleepy Loc’s weight pulls him down, Ben’s ROCKETED up out 
           of the pit. Ben comes up firing, BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! 

           HITS Poway Charlie in the face, blowing most of it off. 

           HITS a tiki torch. The bamboo torch EXPLODES, spattering 
           three Crips with BURNING FUEL. 

           CRIPS ON FIRE, panicked, running, stumbling against the 
           pallets. FIRE SPREADS, climbing the walls of the warehouse. 
           Others chase them, trying to beat the flames out.

                                RISLEY
                        Out of my fuckin way!

           Risley shoulders aside panicked Crips, raising his pistol to 
           take aim at Ben - dangling in there his sights.

           BEN

           Ben SWINGS to the edge of the pit just as the rotting timber 
           struts above him finally SNAP! 

           Risley FIRES - just as the crossbeam holding his pulley 
           BREAKS and Ben’s chain goes slack. Risley’s shots fizzing 
           over Ben’s head as he drops to the edge of the pit, rolling 
           away. 

           Risley adjusts his aim, about to fire again when the whole 
           lattice of timber COLLAPSES, crashing down into the pit. 
           Risley dives clear of a roiling cloud of dust and splinters.

           INT. PIT - CONTINUOUS

           The fallen beams form a kind of Jacob’s Ladder. The DOGS 
           instinctively use it to scramble up and out of the pit. 

           INT. SPOOKHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Dust. Smoke. Chaos. Silhouetted by flames, Ben takes 
           Marquez’s pistol in hand, and turns to face the Crips. 

           Behind him, blood-maddened pit bulls pour out of the pit, 
           like demons escaping hell. Some of the gangsters actually 
           run. The dogs tear into the Boot Hill Mafia. Stampeding 
           gangsters fall. 
           The dogs savage these gangsters, tearing their throats and 
           faces. It’s almost as though the dogs, having consumed 
           Marquez’s flesh are infused with his essence. 

           BEN

           Ben shoots and pistol-whips his way across the warehouse.

           RISLEY

           Raises his pistol, tracking Ben. A snarling PIT BULL charges 
           Risley. Risley whirls, shooting the dog mid-leap. He turns 
           back, trying to reacquire Ben, but Ben’s gone.

           The fire spreads to the weapons crates. Mapes grabs Risley. 

                                MAPES
                        We gotta move! NOW!

           EXT. SPOOKHOUSE - SECONDS LATER

           Ben’s running like hell from the warehouse, across a vacant 
           lot, toward the train tracks. 

           A violent EXPLOSION rips the warehouse in half like an 
           aluminum can, the blast knocking Ben off his feet. 

           EXT. VACANT LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Debris and burning bodies landing in the lot around him. Hot 
           ash falling like snow. Fire spreads across the dry grass of 
           the lot. Ben lying there, empty-handed, catching his breath.

           We hear the AIR HORN of a SOUTH PACIFIC FREIGHT. The train 
           coming, its HEADLAMP piercing the smoke as it barrels down 
           the track. Ben struggles to his feet, limps for the tracks. 
           Risley & Mapes pursue him, firing wildly with the train’s 
           blinding HEAD LAMP. Bullets buzzing around Ben’s ears.

           EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - CONTINUOUS

           Ben lurches across the tracks right in front of the ONCOMING 
           TRAIN. Diving out of the way as the train ROARS past him, 
           cutting off Ben’s pursuers. Their bullets sparking off the 
           train cars.

           Ben’s up and moving, using the train as cover. In the spaces 
           between the moving freight cars, Ben can see Risley and Mapes 
           tracking him - like looking into a zoetrope. Ben sees THE END 
           OF THE TRAIN IS COMING. He’s about to lose his only cover. 

           Ben works up to a jog, hurling himself at the ladder on the 
           side of one of the passing cars. Grabbing the ladder, his 
           feet dragging near the grinding wheels. Pulling himself 
           slowly up the ladder, rung by rung. 
                                MAPES (O.S.)
                        Motherfucker’s on the train!

           BLAM! BLAM! Shots winging off the iron ladder around Ben.

           EXT. TOP OF THE TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

           Ben hauls himself to the top of the train. He turns, looking 
           back over his shoulder, and sees Risley & Mapes have climbed 
           up here to pursue him. Ben jogging, leaping from car to car 
           as the train clanks along through RIOTING South Central.

           Scudding smoke. An apocalyptic, NIGHTMARE LANDSCAPE flashing 
           by Ben on both sides of the moving train. GANGSTERS weilding 
           baseball bats, tire irons, swarming over streets choked with 
           empty cars. Overturned. In flames. A MAN SAWING through a 
           telephone pole with a chain saw. An LAFD FIRETRUCK engulfed 
           in flame. A MAN in a barbecue apron with a bloody fire axe, 
           HOWLING at the passing train. Ben just keeps running.  

           Risley and Mapes nimbly gaining on Ben, pistols in their 
           hands. Risley pausing to take aim, FIRING, his rounds 
           WHANGING SPARKS off the car around Ben as he JUMPS to the 
           next car. BLAM! -schnikt!- Ben falls, reaches his hand down 
           to his ribs. Graze wound. 

           EXT. TRELLIS - CONTINUOUS

           The train crossing a graffiti-covered TRELLIS that spans the 
           CENTURY FREEWAY. Risley and Mapes closing in on Ben. Trapped, 
           running out of train, Ben looks over the side of the car and 
           sees HEAVY FREEWAY TRAFFIC passing beneath the trellis as the 
           train rattles across the freeway. 

           Ben sees a MODULAR HOME approaching on a long FLATBED, the 
           OVERSIZE LOAD traveling slower than the other freeway 
           traffic. Measuring, Ben turns, actually RUNNING back toward 
           Risley and Mapes just to stay in position on the trellis.

           Risley plants his feet to take aim, the train’s motion 
           carrying him right toward Ben. Ben’s running at him, 
           stumbling, running to stay in position as the modular home 
           passes under the trellis. Risley’s trigger: CLICK!

           ANOTHER ANGLE:

           Ben JUMPS off the train, falling, tumbling through the air, 
           finally CRASHING down through the modular home’s flimsy roof - 

           INT. MODULAR HOME (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           - Ben crashing down through drywall, punching through heavy 
           plastic sheets to THUD on the floor inside the moving house.
           EXT. TOP OF THE TRAIN (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           Risley helplessly watches the house lumbering up the freeway. 
           He cop-memorizes the LICENSE PLATE on back of the flatbed.

                                RISLEY
                           (out of breath)
                        Change of plan.

           INT. PREFAB HOME (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           Coughing dust, Ben rolls on to his side, hurt, but alive. 

                                                     TRANSITION TO:

           EXT. CENTURY FREEWAY - MINUTES LATER

           An LAPD BLACK & WHITE slaloms through traffic at 90 MPH, 
           sliding in behind the flatbed carrying the PREFAB HOUSE. 

           INT. PETERBILT SEMI-TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Siren WAILS and the TRUCKER checks his side-view mirror. 

           IN THE SIDE-VIEW MIRROR:

           An LAPD Black & White offset behind the truck, flashing its 
           TAKEDOWN LIGHTS.

                                TRUCKER
                        Shit.

           EXT. CENTURY FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The lumbering flatbed tractor trailer pulls slowly to the 
           shoulder of the freeway. The Black & White slides in behind.

           INT. PREFAB HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Ben stirs, opens his eyes, realizing the truck has STOPPED. 
           Ben scrambles for the door, puts his shoulder to it, FORCING 
           the door open. 

           EXT. PREFAB HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Ben lurches out through the door, falling to his hands and 
           knees on the shoulder of the freeway. He scrambles to his 
           feet, only to be BLINDED by the BEAM of a STREAMLIGHT shone 
           right into his face. Ben squints at the two COPS approaching 
           him, their guns drawn. 
           *Ben looks like a madman. His uniform is unrecognizable, 
           torn, singed and bloodstained. His face is still covered in 
           black spraypaint - streaked with vertical rivulets of sweat.

                                RISLEY (O.S.)
                        STOP! Lace your fingers behind your 
                        head. 

           Ben begins to comply, then recognizes the voice.

                                RISLEY (CONT’D)
                        Do it NOW! 

                                BEN
                        How about you go fuck yourself?

           Risley raises the TASER, laser-target dots dancing on Ben’s 
           chest. Risley FIRES. Twin darts THUNKING into Ben’s chest. 
           BZZT! Blue lightning actually ARCS between the Tasers wires. 
           And Ben goes down, his body bucking and seizing. 

           ANOTHER ANGLE:

           The trucker watches from the shoulder, rapt by this real-life 
           episode of COPS. Mapes SWARMS Ben, wrenching Ben’s arms 
           behind him, his handcuffs BITING deep into Ben’s wrists. Ben 
           ROARS, twists, and kicks, but he’s caught. Risley JUICES him 
           again - BZZZT! - and Ben goes limp. 

                                TRUCKER
                        Holy Jesus. 

           Mapes roughly hauling Ben to their black and white.

                                RISLEY
                        Yeah, well, the guy’s on PCP, sir.
                           (smiling)
                        You’re lucky we caught up with you.

           INT. DARIUS’ MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           LIVE FOOTAGE of what they’re calling the 10th AVENUE RIOTS on 
           Darius’ projection television. Homes in flame. 

           Risley and Mapes drag Ben (handcuffed) into Darius’ room, the 
           way you’d bring a spy before a king. 

           Jax moves to intercept them.

                                DARIUS
                        What the fuck is this?

                                RISLEY
                        Yeah, turns out those drums were 
                        right, D. It was cops zapped 
                        Carcosa’s taxman. 
                           (prodding Ben with his 
                           gun)
                                RISLEY (CONT'D)
                        This is one of the fool’s right 
                        here. Other one’s dogshit.

           Ben & Darius face each other. Smiling in spite of themselves.

                                BEN
                        Yeah, I’d shake hands but ...

                                DARIUS
                        I heard you were dead.

                                BEN
                        Well, gimme a minute.

           Risley’s off-balance now, trying to catch up.

                                RISLEY
                        Hold up, D. You know this fool?

           Darius ignores him.

                                DARIUS
                        Hell yeah, we used to be road dogs. 
                        His daddy’s my lawyer.

           Ben reels a little, seeing the truth of it. The way it all 
           fits together. Risley and Mapes looking panicked. Priceless. 

                                RISLEY
                           (to Ben)
                        Wait. Wait. Big Ben’s your daddy?

                                BEN
                        Well, the results are in, Officer 
                        Risley, and you’re a fucking 
                        genius. No wonder my dad used you.
                           (Off Risley)
                        He gave you the idea to take down 
                        Carcosa’s bank, right? Then lemme 
                        guess, my dad holds the money. You 
                        dipshit. You were dead the minute 
                        you cut a deal with Big Ben. 

                                MAPES
                           (nervous)
                        Cabe, let’s get outta here, man.

                                RISLEY
                        In a minute, boo.

           Risley comes across the carpet at Darius, his GUN up. Jax 
           moves to intervene, but Mapes SHOVES his .45 into Jax’s 
           abdomen, stopping Jax mid-stride. A standoff. Risley grill to 
           grill with Darius, shoves his gun under Darius’ chin.

                        RISLEY
           Open the goddamned safe.
                                                     DARIUS
                                 Not gonna happen.
           Risley savagely pistol-whips Darius across the face. Darius 
           goes down, then slowly gets up. With Mapes’ gun pressed to 
           his gut, Jax doesn’t move, but there’s murder in his eyes. 

                                BEN
                        A chickenshit home invasion? Are 
                        you fucking kidding? What’re you 
                        gonna do next, make a run for the 
                        border? You stole from Carcosa. You 
                        might as well kill yourself, you 
                        asshole. ‘Cause you’re done.

                                MAPES
                        Shut the fuck up!

           Mapes take his eyes off Jax. Jax’s arm moves like a striking 
           cobra - an underhand THROW - the BOWIE KNIFE making one full 
           rotation as slices through the air before sinking to the HILT 
           in Risley’s THIGH. Risley spins on Jax, raising his Glock -   

                                      BLAM! 

           Darius wheels toward the sound of the gunshot and sees Jax 
           SLUMPED against the stereo, hugging himself where hollow-
           point round punched through his abdomen.  

                                DARIUS
                        Daddy?

           As Darius rushes to Jax, Risley PIVOTS, angling his pistol at 
           Darius’ back and BLAM! Darius drops like a marionette with 
           all his strings cut.

           Darius struggles to his hands and knees - a superhuman effort 
           - with a mean-ass entry wound in his back that looks big 
           enough to drive a toy train through. 

           Risley struggles to pull the knife out. Agony. 

           And Ben LUNGES, SLAMMING his shoulder into Mapes, FORCING 
           Mapes against the wall. Ben’s knees jerking up into Mapes 
           groin. But Mapes instinctively blades his body (jiu-jitsu) 
           and Ben’s knees just glances off Mapes’ wide hip. 

           Ben’s all over the much bigger man, cheek-to-cheek with 
           Mapes. With his hands cuffed behind him, Ben must draw on 
           every resource. He’s gone mad, rabid, savage to survive this. 
           Ben cants his head, getting his teeth around Mapes nose, and 
           CRUNCHES down through cartilage. Blood.  Mapes yowling.

           Risley finally YANKS the knife out, sinks to the floor YANKS 
           a cord out of a LAMP and WINDS the cord tight around his 
           bleeding thigh.  

           Mapes PISTOL coming up in Ben’s peripheral vision, aimed at 
           his head. Ben PUSHES off Mapes, DIVES over the sofa. BLAM! 
           BLAM! Bullets punch holes in the wall behind Ben as he 
           scrambles over the bed. BLAM! 
           Rolling off the bed as pillows EXPLODE in a flurry of wafting 
           feathers - obscuring Mapes vision for a moment. Mapes fires 
           to slide-lock. 

           Cornered. Ben curls on the opposite side of the bed, tucks 
           his legs, bringing the handcuffs under his feet. Still 
           cuffed, but at least now his hands are in front of him. 

           Mapes drops his empty mag on the carpet, slams a fresh one 
           into the weapon. Ready to rock. Mapes steps around the bed, 
           blood coming from his nose. The Glock aimed straight at Ben.

                                MAPES
                        Motherfucker. You’re done.

           Nowhere to go. Ben braces himself.

           Mapes doesn’t see Darius staggering behind him, doesn’t see 
           NAT TURNER’S SABER. Darius DRIVES the blade. SHICK! 

           And Mapes suddenly looks down with something like curiosity 
           at the blood-slick BLADE sprouting from his sternum. That 
           shouldn’t be there. Then his eyes roll and he crumples 
           forward on to the bed. Done indeed. 

           Darius DROPS the sword on the floor, unable to hold it 
           anymore. Gasping, Darius leans against the wall and SINKS to 
           his knees - eye level with Ben. The ghost of a smile. 

           With some effort, Risley regains his feet. He looks at Mapes’ 
           body, then at Darius and Ben.

           Eerily calm, Risley pulls the iKlwa - King Shaka’s sword - 
           off the wall. Risley walks stiffly into the center of the 
           room, holding the sword. He just stands there, eyeing Ben.

                                RISLEY
                        Well? You ready to do this?

           Panting, Darius nods to the SABER there on the floor. Ben 
           HEFTS his sword, finding a two-handed grip that works with 
           his handcuffed wrists. Ben stands, facing Risley. 

                                BEN
                        Okay, motherfucker. Okay. Let’s go.

           Risley bring his blade down hard, blade hissing. Ben 
           sidesteps, parries, swings awkwardly at Risley’s head. Risley 
           ducks Ben’s swing, driving his shoulder into Ben’s chest, 
           knocking the wind out of Ben, and toppling Ben off his feet.

           Risley stabs down at Ben as he falls, his blade sticking into 
           the floor just as Ben rolls away. Risley yanks his sword up 
           out of the floor, slicing Ben across his shoulders as he 
           scrambles to his feet.  

           Ben cries out, staggers against the wall. Ben pulls a tall 
           BOOKSHELF crashing down in Risley’s path. Risley comes over 
           the bookshelf, bringing his sword down on Ben. 
           Ben raises his blade to meet Risley’s. CLANG. Ben and Risley 
           leaning drunkenly into each other - their blades locked - 
           shifting their footing, nose to nose. 

           Ben shifts his weight suddenly, Ben’s ELBOW-STRIKE catching 
           Risley under his eye. Risley pirouettes, the iKlwa coming 
           around to slice deeply into Ben’s side. 

                                BEN (CONT’D)
                        Arrgh! 

           Ben’s sword spins out of his grip and falls to the floor as 
           Ben stumbles out on to the marble landing. Ben trying 
           desperately to regain his feet, slipping in his own blood. 

           Risley limps through the doorway, sees Ben panting there on 
           his knees with his cuffed hands in his lap. Ben looks 
           exhausted, utterly defeated awaiting his execution. 

           Risley smiles as he moves across the landing to stand over 
           Ben. Triumphant, Risley raises the sword high over his head. 

                                RISLEY
                        Any last words, mayonnaise?

           Risley’s standing on the X of blue duct tape. 

           And perched like a gargoyle on the ottoman behind him, the 
           JAGUAR lowers its head, churning its shoulders in 
           anticipation.

                                BEN
                        Ulaga.

           Risley’s eyes widen and he WHIRLS around, warding his sword 
           up too late. The jaguar practically explodes from the 
           ottoman. Risley’s SCREAM instantly silenced by the MASSIVE 
           IMPACT of the cat’s pounce - Risley’s body folds sickeningly. 
           Risley’s useless sword clatters on the floor as the big cat 
           lands astride him, claws kneading Risley’s chest. 

           Ben struggles back to his feet, keeping his back against the 
           wall to stay out of the creature’s reach as Ben picks his way 
           back to the bedroom. The jaguar GROWLS at Ben, jubilant as 
           its jaws close over Risley’s throat. Risley’s limps flop 
           weakly, no fight left in him now.

           Risley’s eyes roll to Ben, blood bubbling from Risley’s 
           nostrils. He’s trying to speak, but Risley only gurgles as 
           the jaguar backpedals, dragging Risley to the ottoman. 

           INT. DARIUS’ MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ben staggers into the bedroom, falling to his knees when he 
           finds the two of them together. 

           Darius has crawled to where Jax slumps against the stereo. 
           Darius now hugging Jax’s neck, his shoulders shaking. 
           He sobs, nuzzling Jax’s cheek. Their commingled blood soaking 
           the carpet. Jax’s eyes unfocused now, far away.

                                                      JAX
                        DARIUS
           Daddy. Please don’t leave me.
                                             (whispering)
                                 Don’t you ever let me see you 
                                 cry like a bitch, bwoy. Get 
                                 mad. Get- 

           Jax voice trails off, head slumping to his chest. Darius hugs 
           him, crying into Jax’s still chest until his hands fall away 
           and Darius sags into Jax and they die in bloody Pieta.

           INT. DARIUS WASHINGTON’S MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Ben limps down the stairs. 

           EXT. DARIUS WASHINGTON’S MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Limps out to the veranda, where there is a spectacular view 
           of the Los Angeles Basin. 

                          AND SOUTH LOS ANGELES IS ON FIRE.

           The apocalypse strangely beautiful. Ash flakes waft down to 
           float on the surface. Orange flames reflected on the water As 
           Ben steps into the pool, up to his chest - the soot and blood 
           lifting away from him in the water, dissolving like smoke. 

           Ben finally DUNKS his head under the cool water, closing his 
           eyes like a man being baptized. Purified.

                                                     TRANSITION TO:

           EXT. FOREST LAWN CEMETARY - A WEEK LATER

           An LAPD Funeral. The pipe bands plays the procession - proud 
           retirees in feathered caps and kilts, playing mournful 
           bagpipes as they head up the winding road to his plot. 
           They’re followed by his hearse, a limo for the family, 
           another for the Mayor and The Chief. And here comes a 
           squadron of Black & Whites, all their light bars flashing.

           MOTOR COPS on big LAPD Harleys and the MOUNTED UNIT on 
           horseback. The rest of US march in formation, a river of dark 
           blue wool; all in Class A dress blues - long sleeves and 
           ties, caps. Every spit-shined boot hits the deck in rough 
           unison - two hundred badges catching the light. 

           MARQUEZ’S GRAVE

           The LAPD HONOR GUARD stands with ceremonial rifles at port-
           arms. LAPD’s brass: The CHIEF, DEPUTY CHIEFS (including 
           Beachamp), ASSISTANT CHIEFS, COMMANDERS and CAPTAINS all 
           stand at attention behind Marquez’s flag-draped coffin. 
           At the podium, Lt. Vintner speaks. 

                                LT. VINTNER
                        Miguel Marquez came up hard right 
                        here in Rampart Division. When I 
                        met him he was just a kid playing 
                        soccer Macarthur Park. 18th Street 
                        controlled the park then, but they 
                        didn’t want him. Because Miguel was 
                        too damned crazy for them. 

           Knowing laughter and some tears from a sea of blue.

                                LT. VINTNER (CONT’D)
                        But hell we like ‘em crazy, at 
                        least we did back then. So we took 
                        Miguelito into fellowship, into our 
                        family. 

           Ben stands at attention, we follow his eyes to ...

           MARQUEZ’S PARENTS

           Marquez’s MOTHER is a handsome, sturdy Mixtec woman in a 
           black dress and black veil. A Rosary moving through her 
           fingers throughout the service. Marquez’s FATHER has 
           Marquez’s same Easter Island brow, same masonry cheekbones, 
           the same prideful eyes. Black cowboy boots. Black suit. 

           Vintner slipping into revival-tent mode.

                                LT. VINTNER (CONT’D)
                        Courage is pleasing to the Lord 
                        and, brothers and sisters, Miguel 
                        had more natural courage in him 
                        than any man I know. Retrograde? 
                        Yes. Recalcitrant? Yes. Rough? Oh, 
                        hell yes. The man never donned a 
                        pair of kid gloves in his career.

           More laughter. Applause. Beachamp looks abashed, ashamed.

                                LT. VINTNER (CONT’D)
                        It’s no secret we didn’t always see 
                        eye to eye, but I always respected 
                        Officer Marquez, always will.
                           (beat)
                        Vaya con Dios, brother.

           Ben watches a formation of LAPD helicopters soar over the 
           ceremony. Now, one chopper peels away - the Missing Man. 

           A mariachi band softly plays Mision Cumplida de Mi Padre as 
           the flag over Marquez’s coffin is folded into a neat 
           triangular parcel. The Chief presents the flag to Marquez’s 
           mother. A 21-gun salute as Marquez’s coffin is lowered into 
           the earth. 
           Now, crazed with grief and guilt, Marquez’s father charges 
           the grave, falling to his knees. Ben can only watch as the 
           man TEARS up the grass, POUNDS his fist, HOWLING in aguish.

           EXT. MARQUEZ’S GRAVE - LATER

           Ben lingers while the crowd thins, breaking up to wander back 
           down the slope overlooking the San Fernando Valley. 

           Alone at Marquez’s grave, Ben places a smooth river rock on 
           Marquez’s headstone. Quietly, clearly, Ben says Kaddish.

                                BEN
                           (flawless Hebrew)
                        Yis’ga’dal v’yish’kadash sh’may 
                        ra’bbo, b’olmo dee’vro chir’usay

                        Yisroel, ba’agolo u’viz’man koriv; 
                        v’imru Omein.

           Big Ben sidles over to stand behind his son Ben. Big Ben’s 
           head bowed in respect, or perhaps in a sarcastic pantomime of 
           mourning. Big Ben speaks the part of the congregation.

                                BIG BEN
                        Omein. Y’hay shmay rabbo m’vrorach 
                        l’olam ul’olmay olmayo.

           Hearing his father’s voice, Ben pauses, closes his eyes.

                                                         SMASH TO:

           INT. MACARTHUR PALMS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Last Night ...

           The hotel’s Grand Ballroom packed, overrun with big ballers 
           and shot callers from every barrio south of the Kern River.

           PRELAPPING:

                      BEN (V.O.)
                                                 BIG BEN (V.O.)
                                 B’rikh uh.
           Y’isborach v’yishtabach 
           v’yispoar v’yisroman 
           v’yismasay, v’yishador 
           v’yis’aleh v’yisalal, shmay 
           d’kudsho.

           As Ben stalks through a sea of LATINO GANGSTERS, heading 
           straight for the courtyard. Waters part for Ben, the way they 
           once did for Marquez. As if everyone can smell death on him. 
           Even the worst want no part of this new Ben. Gangsters having 
           an instinctive respect for any battle-tested warrior.
           EXT. COURTYARD MACARTHUR PALMS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Ben walks into bloodthirsty roar. Temporary bleachers packed 
           for the cockfights. Fighting cocks slash and peck each other. 
           The birds crashing breast against breast with a dull thud. 

           CARCOSA

           The unquestioned Master of the Universe sits on a raised dais 
           with a beautiful WOMAN on his arm. BODYGUARDS around him. As 
           Ben draws closer, Carcosa’s bodyguards reach into their suit 
           jackets. But Carcosa recognizes Ben and waves his bodyguards 
           off the dais. Carcosa cheerfully beckons Ben to the seat next 
           to him on the dais - opposite the girl. 

                                                      BEN
                                 My dad calls that chutzpah.
                        CARCOSA
           Gameness, Benji. You see the 
           cock does not fight over a 
           hen, does not fight over 
           territory. He fights because 
           it is in him to fight, 
           because ‘fuck you I don’t 
           like your face’ is why he 
           fights. 

           All around them, gamblers shout across the bleachers, waving 
           bills in their fists. Signalling odds. The odds men 
           scratching house figures on a chalkboard. 

                                CARCOSA
                        Claro. Your father is game, Benji. 
                        He does not fight for money or 
                        pussy. Not for headlines. Your 
                        father fights because he has fuck 
                        you in his soul.  
                           (beat)
                        You father could not stop even when 
                        his life depended on it. I’m sorry, 
                        but there’s no help for him now.

           Ben understands Carcosa has sentenced Ben’s father to death, 
           but his face betrays nothing. Carcosa uncaps a bottle of 
           Patron, fills two shot glasses, lifts one, Ben the other.

                    CARCOSA (CONT’D)
                                                      BEN
           Salud.
                                 L’chaim.

           They drink together.

                    CARCOSA (CONT’D)
                                                      BEN
           What’s on your mind, Benji?
                                 I came to tell you I’m 
                                 through. I’m not working for 
                                 you anymore.

           The COCKERS sweep up their bloody birds. One of the cockers 
           actually licks the blood from his bird’s eyes - the bird’s 
           head pecked down to the skull in places. 
                                                      BEN
                                 Something like that.
                        CARCOSA
           I see. Knocked from our horse 
           on the road to Damascus, were 
           we?

           The cocker blows up the bird’s neck in an attempt to revive 
           it, rippling its blood-glossed feathers. Then he works his 
           thumb into the bird’s beak, gives the bird mouth to mouth.

                                CARCOSA (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me, joven. When I had to 
                        put you in a car with this man 
                        Marquez, I’ll admit I was concerned 
                        for you. He had big Mexican balls, 
                        that charro.
                           (Carcosa crosses himself)
                        But I knew my Benji was too smart 
                        to fall in love.
                           (beat)
                        Was I wrong? 

           And now the cocker puts the bird’s entire head inside his 
           mouth, puffing his cheeks like Dizzy Gillespie to force air 
           into his bird. With each breath, the bird’s limp body swells 
           like a bellows.

                                CARCOSA (CONT’D)
                        Did you fall in love, Benji?

                                BEN
                           (dry)
                        I guess ‘I have chosen to stay and 
                        fight.’

           The cocker gives up, discretely twists the bird’s head off.

                                CARCOSA
                        Fight? Please. Fight for what, 
                        mijo? I am very concerned for you, 
                        Benji. You’re not yourself.

                                BEN
                        You shouldn’t have sent me down 
                        there, Joe. But you did. And I 
                        can’t unsee it what I’ve seen.

                                CARCOSA
                        Please, you don’t know what you’ve 
                        seen, joven. 
                           (beat)
                        You see this lovely girl beside me? 
                        It’s alright, Benji. She is muy 
                        paisa, this girl. Speaks no 
                        English. Not a word.

           Ben leans forward to surreptitiously take in the girl. She’s 
           very young and very beautiful. Carcosa rests a proprietary 
           hand on the girl’s tan thigh. Her smile almost imperceptible.
                                CARCOSA (CONT’D)
                        Her husband washes dishes at the 
                        Jonathan Club and he loves his wife 
                        beyond reason. And yet here she 
                        sits ... because no one has told 
                        him the secret I tell you now.

           The next bout begins: Another pair of birds leaaping, 
           slashing, pecking each other to death - their spilled blood 
           Jackon-Pollocking the dirt pit.

                                CARCOSA (CONT’D)
                        Benji, love is just a lie we tell 
                        our children because fucking is 
                        ugly. 

           As he speaks, Carcosa caresses the girl’s cheek. She lowers 
           her eyes coquettishly. Oblivious to their conversation.

                                CARCOSA (CONT’D)
                        And if she moans for you, be 
                        assured she will moan still louder 
                        for another. Scream for him as you 
                        have never heard her scream.
                           (Off Ben)
                        So please, do not fall in love, 
                        mijo. The world is older, uglier 
                        than you suppose. There are no 
                        countries, just as there are no 
                        marriages. The United States, the 
                        War on Drugs, the LAPD - all just 
                        lies we tell to spare ourselves the 
                        ugliness of fucking.
                           (beat)
                        Do you know what you do after you 
                        fall off that horse on the Road to 
                        Damascus? You get right back on 
                        that chingada horse and ride.

                                BEN
                        Look, I came to give you fair 
                        warning. I owe you that much.

                                CARCOSA
                        He came to give me fair warning.

           Ben gets up to leave, turns back.

                                BEN
                        Tell me something. How many heads 
                        do you have inside the department?

                                CARCOSA
                        Oh, bastante. Jesus, more than 
                        enough. How do you think I got you 
                        past backgrounds? Membership has 
                        its privileges, Benji.
                                BEN
                        Then why? For Christ’s sake, Joe. 
                        Why me?

                                CARCOSA
                        After the bank, I asked myself, who 
                        in this town would have the 
                        chutzpah to move against me? Not 
                        those mayates. Not the Russians. 
                        And certainly not the cops.
                           (considering)
                        Of course, I could have killed him 
                        outright. Were I a younger man I 
                        would have killed him, on suspicion 
                        alone. But I am not a young man, 
                        and I suspected, yes, but I didn’t 
                        know. 
                           (beat)
                        I thought there was a certain 
                        poetry in this, in you. Like 
                        scripture. Who better to bring the 
                        man down than his own blood, his 
                        prodigal son?

           Ben considers this. Digs something out of his back pocket. 
           This guards surrounding them draw their weapons - laser 
           sights finding Ben’s chest and head. Carcosa waves them off.

                                BEN
                        This is yours.

           Ben hands Carcosa Wizard’s ledger. 

                                BEN (CONT’D)
                        Wizard was skimming from you. 

                                CARCOSA
                        Bullshit.

                                BEN
                        See for yourself.

           Carcosa thumbs through it, fingers carefully tracing numbered 
           columns, swift calculations.

                                BEN (CONT’D)
                        You’re organization’s been rotting 
                        from the inside, Joe. Right under 
                        your nose. You’ve lost control. 

           Off Carcosa, the barest glimmer of doubt in his eyes.

           EXT. MACARTHUR PALMS HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Palms CLACKING dryly over Macarthur Park as Ben steps out on 
           to Park View Boulevard and into the passenger seat of the 
           waiting plain-wrap CROWN VICTORIA. 
                      BEN (V.O.)
                                                 BIG BEN (V.O.)

           INT. PLAIN CROWN VICTORIA - CONTINUOUS

           Ben tears open his shirt, pulls the hidden RECORDING DEVICE 
           out of its nylon and velcro harness, tosses the device on to 
           the dash in front of him. Satisfaction on Ben’s face.

                                                     CHUIN
                                 Fuck yeah, he did.
                          BEN
           He took the ledger, took it 
           from my hand.

           In the driver’s seat next to Ben, LT. Vintner smiles, claps 
           Ben’s shoulder. And they pull away, past Macarthur Park.

                                BEN (V.O.)
                        Y’hay shlomo rabbo min sh’mayo,

           EXT. MARQUEZ’S GRAVE - DAY

           A river rock resting on Marquez’s headstone. 

                                BIG BEN
                        Omein.

           Big Ben stands behind Ben, but Ben still cannot turn to face 
           his father. His eyes remain fixed Marquez’s grave.

                                BEN
                        I was beginning to think you 
                        wouldn’t show.

                                BIG BEN
                        Are you kiddin? Come on, Benji. 
                        This is me you’re talkin to. The 
                        calf is well fatted, all that jazz.

           Chuin appears now, flanked by two plainclothes DETECTIVES. 

                                CHUIN
                        Bejamin Kahn. I have a warrant for 
                        your arrest. 

           Big Ben’s eyes flick to his son for a moment before he 
           realizes he’s the Benjamin Kahn Chuin means.
                                BIG BEN
                        What’s the charge?

                                BEN
                        Racketeering. Conspiracy. Robbery. 
                        Conspiracy to commit murder.

                                BIG BEN
                        Yeah, well, good luck with that. 
                        This is what I do, remember? Turns 
                        out you need evidence to convict. 
                           (to Ben)
                        Who’s going to testify?

                                BEN
                        Get Some swore out a statement. 
                           (beat)
                        So did I.

           Father and son lock eyes. 

                                BEN (CONT’D)
                        Carcosa knows, Dad. 
                           (Off Big Ben)
                        On the street, you’re dead by the 
                        end of the week. You’re going to 
                        prison. Maybe WITSEC. But this way, 
                        this way at least you have a chance 
                        to live, you son of a bitch.

           And Big Ben understands.

                                CHUIN
                        You have the right to remain 
                        silent. Do you understand?

           One of the plainclothes detectives approaches Big Ben with 
           his handcuffs. 

                                BIG BEN
                        No.
                           (nodding to his son)
                        Let him do it.

           The detective hesitates. Chuin nods approval. 

           Ben takes the cuffs, steps forward to face his father. Big 
           Ben offers Ben his upturned wrists. A moment. Ben handcuffs 
           his father. Their eyes meet over the cuffs. Big Ben beams at 
           Ben. He’s both broken and redeemed by his son. Bitterly, 
           tenderly proud of the man his Benji’s become. 

                                BIG BEN (CONT’D)
                        Me too, kiddo. With all my heart.

           And we pull up and away. Across a sea of headstones.

                                      THE END
