           EXT. PLAYBOY MANSION - DAY

           Poolside.  A flurry of high-heeled, bikini-clad PLAYMATES 
           wipe across the frame.  NOLAN BUSHNELL (32) -- the picture of 
           70’s cool in a black turtleneck, plaid bell-bottoms, and a 
           groovy moustache -- smokes his pipe and tries to appear 
           mellow, but he’s distracted.  He squints across the pool 
           through red-tinted shades.

           Journalist BOB WIEDER (30’s) sits opposite Nolan, speaks 
           rapidly, gushing enthusiasm. 

                                 BOB WIEDER
                        Listen, man, I’ve seen things in my 
                        lifetime...  

           NOLAN’S P.O.V.: A cluster of Playmates under an umbrella, all 
           buoyant breasts and feathered hair.  Toned ass cheeks move 
           aside, revealing two freaked-out little girls, ALISSA (7) and 
           BRITTA (4).

                                 BOB WIEDER (CONT’D)
                        ...but the things I heard about 
                        your factory...the women...

           Alissa clutches a cage containing a small, gray RAT.  Britta 
           gapes at the scantily clad alien beings around her, cries.

                                 BOB WIEDER (CONT'D)
                        ...the debauchery, it’s...

                                 NOLAN
                        ...all part of the plan.

                                 BOB WIEDER
                        A good plan.  You’re -- what -- 32?

           Wieder looks up from his notes to Nolan for confirmation, 
           follows Nolan’s uneasy gaze across the pool to Britta.

                                 BOB WIEDER (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to take a minute...?

           Nolan gestures -- She’s fine.

           Two Playmates reach in to console Britta.  She recoils, 
           SCREAMS, launches into a massive SHIT FIT.  

                                 NOLAN
                                  (to himself)
                        Ah, Jesus.

           Britta’s shriek spooks Alissa’s rat.  It flies around its 
           cage.  The Playmates recoil in horror.
           Nolan springs up, dangles for a beat with his mouth open.  

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Britta -- Brit, honey, I’m right 
                        here.  Britta, they’re nice ladies.

           Sobs continue.  The Playmates, Nolan and Wieder are clueless.

                                 BOB WIEDER
                        Beautiful children, Nolan.

           A frumpy LATINA HOUSEKEEPER shuffles over to the girls, 
           whispers.  The crying dies down.  She takes both girls by the 
           hand and walks them towards the mansion, past Nolan.

                                 NOLAN
                        Thank you!  Sorry.

                                 ALISSA
                        She’s giving us chocolate milk.

                                 NOLAN
                        Oh, okay.  Have fun. 
                                  (sitting, to Wieder)
                        Sorry.  You were...?

                                 BOB WIEDER
                                  (reading from notes)
                        ...A genius, egomaniac, the Edison 
                        of the New Age, P.T. Barnum of the 
                        Silicon Valley -- these are quotes.  
                        Architect of a revolution.  Prophet 
                        of doom who has unleashed this 
                        unholy scourge upon our children.
                                  (looks up)
                        Do ya want to add anything to that?

           Nolan takes a beat, puffs his pipe.

                                 NOLAN
                        ...Saint?

                                                                SMASH CUT TO:

           SPLASH.  We see 8-YEAR-OLD NOLAN plunged under the surface of 
           the water in a baptismal bathtub.  His father CLARENCE, 
           standing in the tub, lifts his son to the surface.  A wet 
           Nolan wears the traditional white Mormon jumpsuit.  FAMILY 
           MEMBERS and CLERGY stand by.  Clarence leans close, whispers.

                                 CLARENCE
                        You understand the significance, 
                        Nolan, what this means?
                                 8-YEAR-OLD NOLAN
                        Think so.

                                 CLARENCE
                        Means you don’t have to shower 
                        later.

           Bing Crosby’s “Simple Melody” begins, and we CUT to...

           “Utah, 1951”

           INT. BUSHNELL HOUSE - DAY

           The extended BUSHNELL FAMILY -- uncles, aunts, cousins, 
           Nolan’s three sisters, mother DELMA -- still wearing their 
           stiff church clothes, sit silently, barely move.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        Pretty much everybody in my family 
                        wanted me to be a priest.

           Delma checks her watch.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Not my old man.

           EXT. HORSE RACE TRACK - DAY

           Nolan and Clarence, also in church clothes but with loosened 
           ties, jump up and down, waving race tickets.

                       8-YEAR-OLD NOLAN
                                                              CLARENCE
           Come on, Fire Balls!
                                                  Go, Fire Balls!  Go!

           INT. BUSHNELL HOUSE - DAY

           Clarence and Nolan enter, ties now tightened.  An annoyed 
           Delma and all the relatives see them enter.

                                 CLARENCE
                        ...talking to Elder John about the 
                        significance of his baptism.

           Delma glares at Clarence.  He looks away, emasculated.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        Dad wasn’t real big on domestic 
                        life.  But he and I did have one 
                        escape that thrilled him...

           INT. BUSHNELL HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

           CLOSE on a big arm sweeping papers off a table.  A CHESS 
           BOARD smacks down.  Nolan and Clarence set up the pieces.  
                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        Games.  

           Another arm sweep, and a MONOPOLY BOARD drops in.  Another: 
           BACKGAMMON.  Nolan marks a point on a game tally chalkboard.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        We played ‘em all.  But there was 
                        one.  I wouldn’t even call it a 
                        game.  It was an obsession.

           CLOSE on Clarence’s eyes, alive now, reflecting a game board 
           covered with a complex pattern of BLACK AND WHITE STONES.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The Japanese call it “Go”, and 
                        legend has it that the samurai 
                        played it to prepare for battle.

                                 DELMA (O.S.)
                        Clarence!

           Clarence studies the board then makes his move.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        And in this epic struggle, there is 
                        a single move so devastating that 
                        its name means ‘prepare to be 
                        destroyed.’  I only got to say it 
                        once, but man did it feel good...

                                 8-YEAR-OLD NOLAN
                        Atari, Dad.

           Little Nolan places a piece.  As Clarence proudly offers 
           Nolan his hand, Delma enters the basement.  Clarence wilts.

                                 DELMA
                        You’re late for work.

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

           Clarence strains to carry a huge sack of cement on his back.  
           Nolan runs ahead, clears a spot on the ground. 

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        He hated his job.  He hated the 
                        fact that he couldn’t read.  And he 
                        was determined that I wouldn’t 
                        follow in his footsteps.

           INT. BUSHNELL HOUSE - DAY

           Christmas morning.  Nolan sits beside the tree.  
           Clarence hands him a gift.  He tears it open.  A thick book: 
           “INNOVATIONS IN SCIENCE”.  Clarence taps the book’s cover.

                                 CLARENCE
                        Go further.

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

           Nolan, NOW 16-YEARS-OLD, holds “THE COMPLETE BOOK OF SPACE 
           TRAVEL” while tamping down concrete with boots.  Clarence, 
           looking much older, stands to the side, rubbing his back.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD NOLAN
                        The puzzle nobody’s figured out yet 
                        is the ship’s heat shield.  But 
                        I’ve got some ideas.  I’ve got --

           ANOTHER DAY.  Nolan excitedly shows Clarence a POPULAR 
           SCIENCE magazine while he helps him with a tape measure.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        -- tons of uses for an 
                        oscilloscope.  Some guy figured out 
                        a way to hit a point of light back 
                        and forth.  It’s --

           ANOTHER DAY.  Nolan’s engrossed in a stack of loose-leaf 
           papers.  Clarence struggles and sweats while pouring cement.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        -- gonna be big.  I mean, who’s not 
                        gonna want rocket roller skates?

                                 CLARENCE
                        So what’re you waiting for?

           INT. BUSHNELL HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           Clarence packs his truck for a new day while Nolan solders a 
           model rocket engine to a roller skate in the open garage.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD NOLAN
                                  (calling out)
                        ...thinking a test run by the end 
                        of the day, Dad.

           The door from the house opens.  Delma’s there.

                                 CLARENCE
                        I know.  Late for work.

                                 DELMA
                        Hurry up, Nolan.
                                 CLARENCE
                        No no.  He’s staying back today.  
                        He’s working on something.

                                 DELMA
                        He’s working on nonsense.  Nolan, 
                        go to work with your father.

           Clarence turns, face reddens, approaches Delma.

                                 CLARENCE
                        Why would you say that??

                                 DELMA
                                  (shocked)
                        You’re not feeling well.  You need 
                        the help.

                                 CLARENCE
                        He is helping me!  He’s doing 
                        something he loves and he’s gonna 
                        keep doin’ it and the boy’s gonna 
                        change the goddamn world, you 
                        understand me?

           Clarence walks to his truck.  Nolan and Delma are silent.

           EXT. BUSHNELL HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Nolan crouches over the roller skate in the driveway, making 
           adjustments.  Two younger NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS watch.  None of 
           them are aware of the POLICE CAR driving up the street.

           Nolan lights the wick.  The rocket engine flares and spins 
           the skate, sending it flying into the open garage.  It 
           crashes into the wall and EXPLODES.

           Nolan runs into the garage, grabs an extinguisher and sprays 
           out the flames.  Behind him, the police car parks in the 
           driveway.  The other kids take off.  The POLICEMAN gets out.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD NOLAN
                        I, I, I didn’t -- there’s no --

           The noise draws Delma outside.  She’s shocked to see the cop.

                        POLICEMAN
                                                               NOLAN
           Ma’am.
                                                  -- it was an accident.

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Are you Delma Bushnell?

                                 DELMA
                        Yes.
                                 POLICEMAN
                        Something’s happened, ma’am.  Can 
                        we step inside?

                                 DELMA
                                  (face losing color)
                        What happened?

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Can we speak in --

                                 DELMA
                        Tell me what happened!

                                 POLICEMAN
                        We found your husband at the 
                        construction site.  Appeared he’d 
                        had a heart attack.

           Delma covers her mouth with both hands.

                                 POLICEMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           Painful silence.  SLOW MOVE IN on Nolan’s face as the 
           information washes over him.  We hear the echo of children 
           playing in the distance.

           INT. BUSHNELL HOUSE - NOLAN’S ROOM - DAY

           Shades are drawn.  Nolan lays on his bed in the falling 
           gloom.  Above him, several MODEL SPACESHIPS dangle from the 
           ceiling.  Their shadows play against the wall.

           Clipped WHISPERS drift in from another part of the house.

                                 WHISPERS
                        ...a tragedy...there at the 
                        site...took on too much...

           Nolan turns and peers through his slightly open door.  He 
           sees Delma, surrounded by relatives, all wearing black. 

                                 ELDER JOHN
                        Maybe I could get some people 
                        together, help finish the job.

                                 DELMA
                        He was working too hard, that was 
                        the problem...spent 3 months on the 
                        job.  And for what?

           Nolan’s face grows red.  He’s heard enough.
           QUICK SHOTS: Nolan sheds his black suit, straps on his dad’s 
           cement-crusted boots, pulls on his gloves.  He marches 
           swiftly past Delma and the relatives.

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

           Nolan strains to finish the job alone.  He pours cement, 
           loses grasp, spills it.  He tenses in frustration.  THE SUN 
           GOES DOWN.  He continues.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        I spent a week trying to finish 
                        Dad’s work.

           DAY AGAIN.  Nolan is bruised, scratched, exhausted.  NIGHT.  
           Rain pours.  Nolan frantically tries to cover the job with a 
           tarp.  The tarp rips.  The job is ruined.  Nolan drops to his 
           knees, finally cries.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And then I gave up.

                                                               FADE TO BLACK.

           The Animals’ “House of the Rising Sun” plays over... 

                 INT. PI KAPPA ALPHA FRATERNITY HOUSE - NOLAN’S ROOM - DAY

           “University of Utah, 1966”

           We PAN the room: a bong, overflowing ashtray, old pizza.  We 
           find Nolan, now 23, long-haired, unshaven, sitting on a 
           mattress, reading “PROFITABLE POKER”.  A knock on the door.  
           Nolan barely opens it.  A jittery FRESHMAN stands there, 
           hands over a drivers license and wadded up bills.

                                 FRESHMAN
                        I, I was thinking 23.

                                 NOLAN
                        Okay.  I’ll talk to my guy.

           Nolan closes the door and sits down before a TYPEWRITER and 
           an ink stamp of the Utah state seal.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        In 1966, you could make a Utah 
                        drivers license on a typewriter.  I 
                        made ‘em at $50 a pop.

           He lights a joint, and then starts typing.
                                 NOLAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And in the spring semester, when 
                        the ID business dried up, I turned 
                        to my only other source of income.

           INT. PI KAPPA ALPHA FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Air is thick with smoke.  FRAT BOYS are passed out all over.  
           Nolan plays poker against three other GUYS.  He looks wired 
           from lack of sleep, hordes a MOUNTAIN OF WINNINGS.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        I had a good run for awhile...

           Nolan holds a queen-high flush.  He slides ALL of his 
           winnings into the pot.  Two of his opponents fold...

                                 NOLAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...but the thing about poker is, as 
                        good as you think you are, there’s 
                        always somebody better.

           Third opponent calls.  Showdown.  King-high flush.  Opponent 
           rakes in the massive pot.  Nolan slumps in his chair.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        In one hand, my entire college 
                        tuition -- gone.  I was forced to 
                        do the unthinkable: get a job.

           EXT. MOTHER GOOSE LAND - CARNIVAL MIDWAY - NIGHT

           Next to a bustling PINBALL ARCADE, Nolan stands at a game 
           booth, wearing a carnival barker’s skimmer hat and striped 
           jacket, droning apathetically into a megaphone.  

                                 NOLAN
                        Welcome to Mother Goose Land.  
                        Three balls for a quarter.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...a job, though, that did teach me 
                        one valuable lesson...

           QUICK SHOTS of CUTE GIRLS losing Nolan’s game.  He gives them 
           all carnival prizes anyway.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Give out enough free kewpie dolls 
                        to enough Mormon chicks and one of 
                        ‘em is bound to be appreciative.

           The last girl, PAULA, smiles shyly at Nolan, blushes.
           EXT. MOTHER GOOSE LAND - NIGHT

           In a closed section of the park, Nolan and Paula are 
           passionately kissing in the grass under a roller coaster.

           INT. ACADEMIC ADVISOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           An ACADEMIC ADVISOR (40) consults Nolan’s folder.

                                 ACADEMIC ADVISOR
                        1560 on your boards...first place 
                        in the Westinghouse Science 
                        Search...recommendations from your 
                        high school teachers...and here you 
                        have a 1.9 GPA.  What happened?

           Nolan shrugs.  

                                 ACADEMIC ADVISOR (CONT’D)
                        Well you need to start going to 
                        class, Nolan.  If you flunk, you 
                        know we have a responsibility to 
                        inform the draft board.

           INT. ENGINEERING BUILDING LECTURE HALL - DAY

           Nolan sits in the last row, scribbling numbers in a poker 
           strategy book, half-listening to DR. EVANS’ lecture.

                                 DR. EVANS
                        ...and with the purchase, we’ve 
                        joined the ranks of MIT and 
                        Stanford as one of only three 
                        schools in the world offering 
                        students access to a computer...

           Nolan’s pencil slows down.

                                 DR. EVANS (CONT’D)
                        ...and each of you will have time 
                        with this cutting edge machine to 
                        experiment and program.

           Nolan’s pencil stops, he looks up and listens for a moment.

                                 DR. EVANS (CONT’D)
                        So far, at MIT, students have 
                        created a variety of programs.  
                        We’ve seen a text editing program, 
                        a FORTRAN compiler...

           Nolan’s eyes drift back to his book.
                                 DR. EVANS (CONT’D)
                        ...one student even did an outer 
                        space simulation with rocket ships 
                        flying around...

           On that, Nolan’s eyes dart up.

                                 DR. EVANS (CONT’D)
                        Guys, the frontier is wide open.  
                        Who’d like to take a look?

           INT. ENGINEERING BUILDING COMPUTER LAB - DAY

           The entire class is squeezed into this tight room.  Nolan 
           pushes to see through the crowd, only catches glimpses: tape 
           drives, switches, a folding chair.  Dr. Evans finishes 
           demonstrating how to use the machine’s tape reader.

                                 DR. EVANS
                        ...be sure to wind the tape onto a 
                        spool and store it on the rack.  
                        Sign ups begin next semester...

           Dr. Evans’ voice trails off as he exits.  Nolan searches for 
           a place to hide.  The students shuffle out.  Nolan drifts 
           back inconspicuously, steps behind a cabinet.  A TA shuts off 
           the lights, locks the door.  

           LATER.  Quiet.  The whir of a cooling fan.  In the dark, 
           Nolan feels around, turns on a small lamp.  A pool of light 
           spills onto...

           A vision of futuristic beauty: the PDP-1. Nolan stands before 
           the metallic behemoth.  He listens for noise in the hallway.  
           All clear.  

           Determined, Nolan walks to the small metal folding chair 
           before the beast...the captain’s chair.  He sits, takes a 
           deep breath, and runs his fingertips over the keyboard. 

           He then glances up at the rack of spooled paper tapes.  He 
           stands and searches through their handwritten labels:

           “CALCULATOR”, ”TYPEWRITER”, ”DEBUGGER”.  Then...”SPACE WAR”.

           Following Evans’ instructions, Nolan loads the tape, then 
           flips a switch.  CLUNK.  The tape zips through the reader.

           Nolan sits back down and stares ahead, his eyes reflected 
           onto the black screen.  And then...a vision.  Before him, the 
           cosmos: infinite space filled with bright white pixels, light 
           years away.  In the middle of the screen, a small triangle 
           appears: a spaceship.  He’s in awe.  He slides to the edge of 
           his seat and fondles one of two switches on the control 
           panel.  He flips it.  The rocket responds.  It flies silently 
           in one direction.  Nolan’s eyes widen.  He flips the switch 
           back.  The triangle decelerates.  He goes back and forth, 
           alternating speeds.  The pleasure of sheer response.  Then: 
           the second switch.  The ship rotates.  His innocence 
           reawakens as his eyes gaze in wonder at this tiny ship flying 
           through the galaxy.  We hold on his face, then pull back to 
           reveal that he’s elsewhere, surrounded by PINBALL MACHINES.  

           INT. MOTHER GOOSE LAND - PINBALL ARCADE - NIGHT

           Nolan is in a daze, sitting on the edge of a stool wearing an 
           arcade attendant’s apron and change belt.  He’s enveloped by 
           the arcade’s loud hustle and bustle but barely moves.

           We remain on his face as he watches KIDS obsessively pump 
           DIME AFTER DIME into pinball machines.  A subtle shift sweeps 
           over his expression.  The sounds of the arcade fade away...

                                 NOLAN
                        ...games...

           He stands slowly, wanders aimlessly down an aisle.  He picks 
           up his pace, suddenly on a mission.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ...on a computer...and I’ll charge 
                        people for ‘em...

           He starts to laugh with joy, moving faster now...

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Fuck pinball!

           INT. KAPPA KAPPA GAMMA SORORITY HOUSE - PAULA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Paula sits on her bed while Nolan paces.  She’s clearly got 
           something on her mind but Nolan’s too excited to notice.

                                 NOLAN
                        And I’ll have UFO’s flying around 
                        and...and...missiles...guided 
                        missiles, and...

                                 PAULA
                        Nolan.

                                 NOLAN
                        ...and sound effects of rocket 
                        thrusters and a...and a neat 
                        scoring system that people aren’t 
                        gonna believe...and then --
                                 PAULA
                        Nolan.

                                 NOLAN
                        ...then I’m gonna get an investor 
                        to pay for it.  I mean, baby, 
                        nothing’s gonna stop me now.

                                 PAULA
                        I’m pregnant.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (stops pacing)
                        Except...
                                  (smiles nervously)
                        ...that.

           A long pause as Nolan registers the consequences.

                                 PAULA
                        Nolan?

                                 NOLAN
                        That’s so...neat.

                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

           “Santa Clara, California (Silicon Valley), 1971”

           INT. SMALL HOUSE IN SANTA CLARA - KITCHEN - DUSK

           A baby WAILS.  Nolan (28) with a buzz cut and wearing a clip-
           on tie, sits at a table in a cramped kitchen with Paula and 
           his two daughters, ALISSA (3) and the crying BRITTA (3 
           months).  Trying to block out the shrill sound, he stares 
           down at his TV dinner.  Alissa throws food at him and laughs.

                                 PAULA
                        You have to eat your food.  Alissa, 
                        eat your food.  Nolan, please, tell 
                        her she has to eat her food.

           EXT. AMPEX - MORNING

           A massive, characterless white building.  Out front, white 
           block letters on a blue sign: AMPEX.

           Nolan’s battered ‘58 CHEVY coughs out dark smoke as he drives 
           around looking for a parking spot.

           MINUTES LATER.  Nolan walks through the parking lot carrying 
           his briefcase in the searing heat.  In front of the building, 
           he sees several empty parking spots, reserved for VP’s.
           INT. AMPEX - WORK AREA - MORNING

           The office is one huge open room filled with cubicles and 
           workbenches, with exec offices on the periphery.  

           Nolan punches his timecard, then navigates through the 
           cubicle maze.  He passes a hundred sweaty, mid-to-old-aged 
           ENGINEERS, all wearing thick glasses and short-sleeved button-
           down shirts.  They hunch over their benches, smoking, 
           soldering circuit boards.  No one speaks.

           Nolan reaches his bench, sadly nods to his friend AL “MOOSE” 
           ALCORN (27), a big shaggy fat guy.  Moose’s cubicle walls are 
           covered with photos of the Berkeley People’s Park protests.

           INT. AMPEX - CAFETERIA - DAY

           Long tables filled with passionless men, shoveling in slop.  
           Nolan, Moose, and their very nerdy friend TED DABNEY (28) 
           stand out.  These three guys still have a glimmer of hope.

                                 NOLAN
                        10 screens would probably...10 
                        might amortize out.

                                                               NOLAN

           INT. SMALL HOUSE IN SANTA CLARA - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Before Alissa at the dinner table, Nolan stands a CORN ON THE 
           COB on the table with one hand and holds a SWEET POTATO in 
           the air with the other.  Paula feeds Britta in the b.g.

                                 NOLAN
                        The sweet potato is a UFO, okay?
                        And your spaceship’s this corn on 
                        the cob.  Now you tell me when 
                        you’re gonna shoot at it.

           Alissa is wide-eyed. Nolan makes an INTERGALACTIC SOUND while 
           moving the sweet potato in one direction.  

                                 ALISSA
                        Now!

           While making a silly shooting noise, Nolan lifts the corn as 
           if it were a missile, completely missing the moving potato.

                                 NOLAN

           In a haze of cigarette smoke, the zombies toil away on their 
           circuit boards.  In the distance, an office door is slightly 
           ajar.  We have a partial view of Nolan, standing, gesturing.

           INT. AMPEX - EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY

           An excited Nolan finishes a presentation to his AMPEX BOSS, 
           mid 50’s, a creepy private guy with a little beard and a SELF-
           PORTRAIT on the wall that’s entirely made up of 0’s and 1’s.

                                 NOLAN
                        Sir, I’m just saying, if you grant 
                        me an opportunity to use one of the

                        even make a lot of money for Ampex.

           The boss stares at Nolan as if he’s really thinking about it.

           Nolan stands there, frustrated, then wanders out.

           Depressed, Nolan sits slumped in a chair in the family room.  
           The Brady Bunch is on.  Alissa sits on the floor, half-
           watching the TV while playing with her LITE BRITE set.  

           Nolan watches the show.  Thoughts envelop his mind.  We MOVE 
           IN SLOWLY to his face, lost in thought.  He sits there, his 
           eyes darting back and forth until a single thought stops him. 
           He gets up slowly, thinking, concentrating, steps to the TV.

                                 NOLAN
                        Honey, I need to unplug this for a

                                 ALISSA
                        Why?

                        One second, okay?

           He unplugs it, lifts the TV and runs out of the room with it.

           Nolan places the TV screen-down on a table, unscrews the

           The empty parking lot is barely illuminated by a few lights.  
           Moose and Nolan bust out of the Ampex building, their arms 
           stacked with machine parts.  They walk swiftly, looking

           Nolan lifts his sleeping daughter Alissa from her bed, 
           carries her into the living room, puts her on a couch, and 
           tucks her under a blanket.  He runs back in, scoops up her

           Paula charges into Alissa’s room, sees a nest of wires and 
           machine parts everywhere.

           Alissa enters in a long pink shirt, rubbing her eyes.  Paula 
           shoots Nolan an extremely condemning look.  Nolan sees his 
           daughter’s innocent face stare at him.

           Nolan’s hunched over a wire wrap board, attempting to create 
           the sound of a rocket ship incinerating a UFO.  Alissa’s room 
           -- this once sweet refuge of unicorns and rainbows -- has 
           become a testing ground for intergalactic combat.

           Alissa approaches the door holding a small GRAY RAT.

                        just not very safe right now.

           Paula steps into the doorway while holding a babbling Britta.  
           Paula speaks calmly as if continuing a previous conversation.

           Paula and Alissa enter.  In the center of a TV SCREEN is a 
           tiny, bright, white ROCKET SHIP.  It moves to the top of the 
           screen, disappears, reemerges on the bottom, and continues 
           up.  Nolan looks proud.  Paula and Alissa look nonplussed.

           A SEA OF PINBALL MACHINES light up and ding across the

           video game known to man:

           and a scoring system: a precursor to Asteroids without the 
           asteroids.  Nolan grabs the attention of anyone who walks by. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Control a rocket ship in a space 
                        battle against flying saucers!

           A middle-aged man saunters over.
                                 NOLAN (CONT'D)
                        Step right up, sir.  This button 
                        rotates your rocket, this one 
                        thrusts you forward, and this one 
                        fires missiles at the UFO’s.

           The man gives it a try and gets killed quickly.  He looks 
           perplexed.  He tries it again and is immediately destroyed.  
           The man tries it one last time.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        You can see it’s based on Newton’s 
                        second law of physics...if you push 
                        twice as...

           “Game Over.”  

                                 MAN
                                  (stepping away)
                        Interesting.  I gotta...my wife’s 
                        waiting for me.  Interesting, 
                        though.  Good luck with it.  

           LATER.  A sweating fat man in a button-down shirt and tie 
           stands and reads the thick COMPUTER SPACE MANUAL.

                                 NOLAN
                        The next chapter talks about the 
                        hyperspace option.

                        Okay, well, I signed up for a 
                        Bally’s symposium at 1, so, yeah, I 
                        don’t think I can read all the 
                        instructions now.

                                 NOLAN
                        Okay.  Yeah, no problem.  Tell your 
                        co-workers.  A space battle.  

           EXT. NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE IN SANTA CLARA - DAY

           A barbecue in a modest backyard.  Adults hold drinks and 
           mingle while kids chase each other.  By the grill, Nolan 
           stands next to his NEIGHBOR, a burger-flipping schlub. 

                                 NOLAN
                        I know I’ve got something here. 
                                  (secretly)
                        Paula’s been on my case since June 
                        to get back to work, but I’m...you 
                        know, I just--
                                 NEIGHBOR
                        I hear you, man.  Jane says if I 
                        don’t go back to work by --

                                 JANE
                        Joe, you’re not cooking ‘em long 
                        enough!

                            NEIGHBOR

           Medium-rare.  I thought I’m 
           doing them medium-rare.
                                                  Nolan.  This is Francine’s 
                                                  husband, Gerry.  Gerry works 
                                                  at Magnavox...says they have 
                                                  engineering positions open.

                                 MAGNAVOX EMPLOYEE
                        Paula says you made a computer 
                        game.  That’s crazy.  

                                 NOLAN
                        Yeah, yeah.  A space battle between 
                        a rocket ship and flying saucers.  
                                  (at Paula, guilty)
                        Maybe...maybe Magnavox might be 
                        interested in looking at it.

                                 MAGNAVOX EMPLOYEE
                        Well, you know, Magnavox made a 
                        game on a TV, too!

           Nolan’s face drops.

           INT. BURLINGAME AIRPORT MARINA - DAY

           RADIOS, PHONOGRAPHS, and TV’s are all on display in a large 
           MAGNAVOX SHOW ROOM.  Nolan is overwhelmed by the massive 
           display until he spots one little TV in the distance.  The 
           image is fuzzy, staticky.

           “Burlingame Airport Marina, May 24, 1972”

           Nolan storms over to it.  On the screen, two vertical lines 
           on opposite sides bat a POINT OF LIGHT back and forth.  The 
           screen goes in and out of static.  Compared to what he just 
           made, Nolan looks at this crude demonstration in disbelief.

           A meek man named RALPH BAER, 50, buttoned down white shirt 
           and tie, shows the game to an interested PASSERBY.  

                                 NOLAN
                        A physicist did this on an 
                        oscilloscope like 15 years ago.  

                                 RALPH
                        Really?  I’m not familiar.
                                 NOLAN
                        You mind if I--

                                 RALPH
                        Yeah yeah.  Go ahead.  This is the 
                        controller.

           Nolan takes it and hits the POINT OF LIGHT with his paddle, 
           opposite the man playing.  He then discovers he can move the 
           light up and down after its hit...making the paddle totally 
           inconsequential to how the ball moves.  The game doesn’t 
           adhere to any real physics, there’s no scoring system, and 
           there’s no sound -- just an opportunity to move light around.

           He looks at the man next to him, his mouth agape as he 
           manipulates the light. 

                                 NOLAN
                        You find this fun?

                                 GUY PLAYING MAGNAVOX GAME
                        My wife wants me to buy her a 
                        refrigerator I can’t afford.  
                        What’s not more fun?  

           EXT. AMPEX PARKING LOT - DAY

           A vast parking lot in the sweltering heat.  It’s dead quiet.

           We see a frustrated Nolan inside his car, baking in the sun.  
           He taps his finger on the cracked steering wheel.  He checks 
           his watch.  Noon.  Sweat drips down his temples.  

           A bell RINGS and glum engineers stream out of the building, 
           shuffling to the cafeteria.  Nolan sees Moose amongst them.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (calling out)
                        Moose...Al!  

           Moose sees Nolan, looks around nervously, walks to him.   

                                 MOOSE
                        What are you doing here, Nolan?

                                 NOLAN
                                  (unlocking door)
                        Shhh.  Just get in, get in.

           INT./EXT. ANDY CAPP’S TAVERN - AFTERNOON

           A dingy dive bar.  Nolan and Moose sip beers.  A sliver of 
           bright light fights its way through the cracked front door.
                                 MOOSE
                        I’m not leaving Ampex, Nolan.  I’m 
                        not.  It’s a secure job and I’m 
                        making $1,200 a month.

                                 NOLAN
                        Look, I get it, man.  I get it.  
                        But goddamn it, Moose, you’re 27.  
                        I mean...fuck...look at all those 
                        guys: Walt...and Sid...and and 
                        and...Larry?  All of ‘em -- these 
                        great engineers who’ve been ground 
                        down into these...these joyless 
                        unmotivated cogs, man!  You want to 
                        be like that??  I don’t.  I want to 
                        inspire people, man.  This is our 
                        time, Moose.  I mean, we could get 
                        shipped out any moment...any day 
                        our numbers could be called.

                                 MOOSE
                                  (checking watch)
                        If I don’t get back soon, I’m gonna 
                        get docked.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (rushing)
                        Alright alright alright.
                                  (pause, very slowly)
                        A driving game.

           Moose rolls his eyes.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Wait, hold on.  The last one 
                        was...listen, I get it, nobody 
                        wants to read an instruction 
                        manual.

           Moose gestures to the door, stands and walks.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        We put a steering wheel on this 
                        game.  One dime and you get to 
                        drive a race car on a track!  Oil 
                        slicks, car wrecks, I’d want to 
                        play it, wouldn’t you??

           Moose opens the door, steps out into the blinding light.
           EXT. ANDY CAPP’S TAVERN PARKING LOT - DAY

           Moose walks with Nolan back to Nolan’s car.  Nolan pops open 
           his trunk, revealing a small TV monitor, several computer 
           components, and lots of wires.  

                                 NOLAN
                        Listen, while I’m preselling this 
                        thing, I’d like for you to take 
                        this stuff and get started.

                                 MOOSE
                                  (nervously laughs)
                        No, I’m not doing it, Nolan.  No.

           Moose walks to the passenger door, opens it, gets into the 
           car.  Nolan slams the trunk and follows.  They both stick to 
           the vinyl seats in the blistering heat.

                                 NOLAN
                        Moose, you’re the best engineer I 
                        know, okay?  I’m not doing it 
                        without you.

           Moose looks down, shakes his head.

                                 MOOSE
                        Even if I was to get involved... 
                        what you’re describing here: the 
                        car, the track?  Just to get the 
                        collision algorithm right?  I 
                        wouldn’t even know where to begin.  
                        Seriously.  It’s mind-boggling.  
                                  (looks at watch)
                        I gotta get back, man.

                                 NOLAN
                        Alright.  Fine.  Here.   

           He quickly gets a pen and napkin, scribbles a rectangle.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        I just saw this piece-of-shit 
                        prototype Magnavox is peddling...

           Inside the rectangle, he scribbles two vertical lines on 
           opposite sides and a little dot in the middle. 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ...two lines on the sides move on 
                        the y axis, square bounces back and 
                        forth.  That’s it.  Take a week --

                        going to give you a small line of 
                        credit.

                                 NOLAN
                        Really???  Oh, that’s, that’s...
                                  (taking Paula’s hand)
                        ...you will not regret this, sir.  
                        Thank you. 

           INT. NOLAN’S CHEVY - NIGHT

                                 NOLAN
                        What do you mean you’re not going 
                        to sign the papers?
                                 PAULA
                        I’m not going to sign them.

           INT. SMALL HOUSE IN SANTA CLARA - NIGHT

           Nolan follows Paula around the house.  They lower their 
           voices every time they pass the sleeping children’s rooms.

                                 NOLAN
                        They’re not going to give us credit 
                        if you don’t sign the papers.

                                 PAULA
                        We can lose our house on this, 
                        Nolan.   

                        PAULA (CONT’D)
           We have two beautiful 
           children that hardly see you 
           as it is.
                                                               NOLAN
                                                  Paula.  This is monumental.  
                                                  You’re not understanding this 
                                                  thing.   

                                 PAULA (CONT’D)
                        You told me that I didn’t 
                        understand the other game, and look 
                        what that one did.

                             NOLAN
                                                               PAULA
                                                  We have a family now, Nolan.  
           That’s because it was 
           complicated...  

                             NOLAN
           The driving game is simpler.
                                                               PAULA
                                                  There are responsibilities...

                                 NOLAN
                        It’ll sell.

                                 PAULA
                        And if it doesn’t??  What’re you 
                        gonna say to me when it doesn’t 
                        sell and we lose everything?

                                 NOLAN
                        Problem is you don’t see it, Paula.

                                 PAULA
                        You’re right, I don’t see it.  And 
                        the truth is?  I’ve never seen it, 
                        Nolan.  The whole thing is pretty 
                        damn silly if you ask me.

           Nolan looks at her, hurt, stunned.  He grabs his wallet, his 
           keys, and storms out.
                                 PAULA (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going??

           EXT. MOOSE’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

           Nolan’s car screeches up to the front.

           INT. MOOSE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Nolan knocks on Moose’s apartment.  Moose opens the door 
           holding a half-eaten Ho Ho.  An orange cat MEOWS.   

                                                               MOOSE
                                                  Don’t let the cat out.
                             NOLAN
           Forget getting your feet wet.  
           Let’s dive in.

           The living room is strewn with RIBBON CABLES, CIRCUIT BOARDS,  
           and METAL BOXES.  Moose has been getting into this more than 
           even he had imagined.  

                                 NOLAN
                        We’re moving on!  

                                 MOOSE
                                  (Ho Ho in his mouth)
                        From what?

                                 NOLAN
                        The bankers want to see the driving 
                        game now...let’s get into it.

                                 MOOSE
                        Hold on.  Don’t you want to see the 
                        ping pong thing I made?

           Nolan gets a BEER from the fridge, then comes back and plops 
           down on the couch.  Moose sets up the game.

                                 MOOSE (CONT’D)
                        This is your controller.  This is 
                        mine.  I used potentiometers to 
                        track the paddles.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (sipping beer)
                        ...thinking we should add some kind 
                        of foot pedal to accelerate the 
                        car.  How neat would --

           Moose flicks a switch and the PING PONG game appears.  The 
           screen shows large white square numbers indicating: “0 - 0”.
                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Nice, Moose -- adding a scoring 
                        system...

           Moose flips another switch.  The SQUARE BALL is served.  
           Moose bats it to Nolan.  BOOP.  Nolan bats it back.  BOOP.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ...and I like this sound you got.

           Nolan misses the ball: “1 - 0”

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                                  (leaning forward)
                        Alright, alright, I got it.

           The SECOND BALL comes out.  Moose hits it and uses ‘English’ 
           to spin the ball in a particular direction.  Nolan laughs.   

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Look at you puttin’ ‘English’ on 
                        the ball.  We can use that when the 
                        car slides on the -- whoah.

           The ball moves twice as fast now.

                                 MOOSE
                        Yeah, I got it to double after 4 
                        volleys.  What do ya think?

                                 NOLAN
                                  (trying to keep up)
                        Shit.

           Nolan misses the ball.  The screen reveals “3-0”.  

                                 MOOSE
                        Three balls.  That’s it.

                                 NOLAN
                        Alright.  I get it now.  One more.  

                                 MOOSE
                        Okay.  One more. 

           “36 games later”

           Nolan and Moose are glued to the screen, playing the game 
           like excited little children.  FIVE EMPTY BEER BOTTLES are on 
           the table with a piece of paper revealing a score: “Nolan 11, 
           Moose 25”. 

                             MOOSE
                                                               NOLAN
           Ahh!  
                                                  Shit!
           They’re playing at four times the speed.  Nolan misses ball.

                                 NOLAN
                        When you put English on it at that 
                        speed, I can’t...

           Nolan looks for his beer.  Moose serves.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        No no no.  I wasn’t ready!  You 
                        can’t serve when I’m not ready!  

                                 MOOSE
                        I won.  

                                 NOLAN
                        Best out of 60.  Best out of 60!

                                 MOOSE
                        I’m going to sleep.  

                                 NOLAN
                        If we were at an amusement park, we 
                        would’ve spent -- 
                                  (checking paper)
                        ...at 10 cents a pop...no no...the 
                        fun I had...that wasn’t 10 cents 
                        worth of fun.  That was 25 cents 
                        worth of fun.  25 cents worth of 
                        fun, Moose...which means we 
                        would’ve spent 9 bucks.  Five hours 
                        a day, 7 days a week: $245.  Guy 
                        makes his money back in four weeks.  
                        Moose, this is the game!  I need 
                        you on full time.  Let’s get a 
                        prototype and get it out there.

                                 MOOSE
                        Nolan, Nolan, you haven’t even paid 
                        me for part time, how’re you gonna 
                        pay me full time?

           EXT. TED DABNEY’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           DING-DONG.  Nolan waits by the door.  He glances down and 
           sees a pair of old lady’s flip flops.  Ted (Nolan’s nerdy 
           friend from Ampex) answers, getting dressed for work.

                                 NOLAN
                        Ted!

                              TED
                                                      DABNEY’S MOTHER (O.S.)
           Nolan!
                                                  Who’s there?!!
                                 DABNEY
                        I got it, Ma!  Good to see you, 
                        Nolan.  What’re ya doin’ here?

           INT. TED DABNEY’S HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           Dabney writes a check on Nolan’s back.  Nolan leans forward.

                                 NOLAN
                        Thank you, Ted.  150% interest and 
                        a place at the company when you 
                        want it.

           EXT. ANDY CAPP’S TAVERN - NIGHT

           Moose’s teensy ‘69 TOYOTA COROLLA rolls up with a full-sized 
           RED COIN-OP CABINET strapped to the roof.  The game is nearly 
           as big as the car.  Nolan and Moose each keep an arm out 
           their windows to steady it from rocking.

           INT. ANDY CAPP’S TAVERN - NIGHT

           They lug the game inside.  The bar’s manager, BILL GATTIS, 
           smiles with wry amusement and points them to a spot in the 
           corner behind a POOL TABLE and next to a PINBALL MACHINE.  
           Nolan and Moose put the game down and stand back.  Below the 
           screen, a stencilled title: PONG.  They order beers, sit at a 
           table, and wait with bated breath.  

           TWO DRUNKS approach Pong like Neanderthals discovering fire.

                                 DRUNK GUY #1
                                  (reading off machine)
                        Avoid missing ball for high score.

           One guy turns a knob and sees a vertical line go up and down.

                                 DRUNK GUY #2
                        How does the TV station know I’m 
                        moving this thing here?

           One guy puts in a quarter and after the first ball, they 
           figure it out.  

                                 NOLAN
                                  (whispering to Moose, 
                                   watching)
                        We’ll produce a few more, maybe get 
                        an arcade route, make a few bucks.

           The drunks’ game ends.  #1 victoriously throws up his arms.
                                 DRUNK GUY #2
                                  (searching his pockets)
                        Alright, no, now I know how to 
                        play.  Let’s...I’m out of quarters.

           Drunk #1 slaps his opponent on the back, walks away.

                                 DRUNK GUY #2 (CONT’D)
                        Oh, no no.  No no no.  You’re not 
                        done.  We’re playin’ again.  
                        Gattis, I need change.

           Gattis shakes his head.  Nolan excitedly elbows Moose.

                                 DRUNK GUY #2 (CONT’D)
                        Anybody got change in here?... 
                        Change??...I need quarters!!

                                 NOLAN
                        Fuck the arcade route.  I’m going 
                        to Chicago.

           INT. SMALL HOUSE IN SANTA CLARA - BEDROOM - DAY

           Nolan hurls clothes into a suitcase.  Paula perches on the 
           edge of the bed, head in her hands.

                                 PAULA
                        It’s got to stop, Nolan.  This is 
                        your family.  We don’t see you for 
                        24 hours...and you’re buying a 
                        plane ticket??
                                  (shaky)
                        We can barely afford Alissa’s 
                        school right now.

           Nolan gets down on his knees to look her in the eyes.

                                 NOLAN
                        I’m going, Paula.  I’m going, and 
                        I’m gonna sell this, and I’m gonna 
                        come back and we will celebrate.

           He closes his suitcase, walks to the door.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        You’ll see, Paula.  Trust me.

           EXT. CHICAGO - DAY

           The ELEVATED TRAIN in Chicago WHIZZES by on the tracks.
           INT. EL TRAIN - DAY

           Nolan sits excitedly on the ‘El’ with a smaller Pong 
           prototype at his feet.  A BUM looks it over.  Nolan smiles.

           EXT. BALLY-MIDWAY MANUFACTURING - DAY

           Establish the massive Bally-Midway corporate compound.

           INT. BALLY-MIDWAY MANUFACTURING - EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY

           In this immense office, Nolan and a BALLY EXEC play the game 
           on a corner of the exec’s desk.  Total silence except for 
           Pong’s echoing BOOPS.  The exec isn’t trying to play, just 
           testing the paddle, accidentally hitting the ball once.

                                 NOLAN
                        Eventually you really get the hang 
                        of it...start doing all kinds of 
                        tricks.

           The exec’s intercom BUZZES.

                                 SECRETARY (O.S.)
                        Sir, you wanted me to remind you 
                        about your son’s game.

                                 BALLY EXEC
                        Oh, yes.  Yes, thanks.
                                  (packing his briefcase)
                        Kid’s an All-Star three years 
                        running, got a 310 batting average. 
                                  (stands, points to game)
                        Why don’t you give me your card and 
                        I’ll give you a call.

           The exec leaves the office.  Nolan follows him.

                                 NOLAN
                        You know, a lot of people looking 
                        at this thing.  Lot of people 
                        interested.  Gottlieb.  Williams.

                                 BALLY EXEC
                        Don’t do that.  You don’t think I 
                        talk to those guys?  You pitched 
                        them this morning.  Same problem as 
                        that Magnavox thing...nobody cared.
                                  (aside to secretary)
                        Help him move that thing without 
                        messing up the oak, will ya. 

           He walks to the elevator.  Nolan follows tentatively.
                                 NOLAN
                        You really don’t risk a lot if you 
                        put a few out there...and you can 
                        see for yourself.  I mean really, 
                        what’s the risk?  I mean, can’t we 
                        give it a trial run, can we try it, 
                        just to see?  I really think this 
                        could be big.

                                 BALLY EXEC
                                  (pushes elevator button, 
                                   turns around)
                        Look, kids go to an arcade, they 
                        wanna see things banging into real 
                        shit.  Pinball games.  Kids don’t 
                        have the patience to sit around 
                        watching a blip floatin’ on a TV -- 

           The elevator doors open.  Exec steps inside.

                                 BALLY EXEC (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, you ain’t gonna see kids 
                        playin’ “video” games.

           Elevator closes.

           INT. O’HARE AIRPORT - TERMINAL - DAY

           Still wearing his suit, Nolan trudges through the terminal, 
           dragging the Pong prototype behind him on a luggage carrier. 

           He passes a young COUPLE kissing, about to part...a little 
           GIRL with a doll, chasing her dad...a smiling FATHER greeting 
           his son as he gets off the plane.  Nolan slows to watch.  The 
           father and son bear hug.

                                 FATHER IN AIRPORT
                        So proud of you, son.

           Nolan wistfully watches them through the intermittent passing 
           of travelers.

           EXT. SMALL HOUSE IN SANTA CLARA - DAY

           Nolan stands outside the door.  He looks dejected, ashamed, 
           humiliated.  He rubs his face, takes a deep breath.

           INT. SMALL HOUSE IN SANTA CLARA - DAY

           Nolan enters.  Paula sees him.  It’s clear his trip was not 
           successful.  They don’t say anything to each another.  
           There’s nothing left.  Nolan walks around in a daze, collects 
           clothes and puts them in a suitcase.
           Excruciating silence before Alissa comes out, sees Nolan, 
           runs over to give him a hug.

                                 ALISSA
                        Daddy’s home!!!

                                 NOLAN
                                  (hugging her)
                        Hi, honey.  Unfortunately, Daddy 
                        has to go again.

                                 ALISSA
                        What do you mean??  You just got 
                        here!

                                 NOLAN
                        Daddy’s getting another place.  For 
                        work.  A whole ‘nother place.

           Paula observes the scene, her eyes well up.  

                                 ALISSA
                        What do you mean?  You’re not 
                        staying here?

                                 NOLAN
                        I can’t stay here right now, honey, 
                        but I’m going to see you a lot, 
                        okay?  I’m going to see you on 
                        weekends and you can have me all to 
                        yourself, okay?  And -- I’ll, you 
                        know -- I’m gonna still be there 
                        for you, okay? 

                                 ALISSA
                        No, I don’t want you to go.  Mommy, 
                        tell Daddy that he should stay.

           Paula wipes tears from her eyes and walks into the kitchen.

           EXT. MOOSE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Outside Moose’s apartment, Nolan sits in his parked car.  He 
           suppresses tears, rubs his eyes, spontaneously bangs his fist 
           into the roof. 

           INT. MOOSE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Nolan, now with 5 o’clock shadow and bed-head, sinks into the 
           couch, dejected.  Moose shares the couch with him, wearing 
           tighty-whities and a wife-beater.  They’re both watching 
           “H.R. Pufnstuf” on TV.  Moose digs his hand into a box of 
           Lucky Charms, picks out the multicolored, stiff marshmallows.
                                 MOOSE
                        Just...whatever, man.  You’ll get a 
                        job at Lockheed.  Or the phone 
                        company.  You can start at a 
                        thousand a month.  Just to, you 
                        know, get back on your feet.  
                        Things could be a lot worse, Nolan.

           The phone RINGS.  

                                 MOOSE (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           INT. ANDY CAPP’S TAVERN/MOOSE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Bill Gattis speaks into a phone at the bar.   

                                 BILL GATTIS
                        It’s Gattis.  Your game’s broken.  
                        Can you please just get it out of 
                        here ‘cause it’s causing problems.

                                 MOOSE
                        Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  We’ll be 
                        right there.
                                  (hanging up)
                        Andy Capp’s.  The game’s broken and 
                        they want it out of there.  See, 
                        Nolan?  I told you things could be 
                        worse.

           INT. MOOSE’S COROLLA - DAY

           Moose and Nolan drive in stark silence.  The sultry rhythm of 
           Steely Dan’s “Do It Again” plays over Moose’s tinny car 
           stereo, bleeds into...

           INT. ANDY CAPP’S TAVERN - DAY

           In SLOW-MO, Nolan and Moose stride into the dark bar.  Nolan 
           looks sweaty, burned out.  Few patrons abound.  Two guys play 
           pool in the back.  It’s an ordinary day.

                                 BILL GATTIS
                        Thanks, guys.  Thing’s dead.  I 
                        need it outta here.

           “September 17, 1972”

           Nolan and Moose walk to the out-of-order machine.  Blank 
           screen.  Moose sits down, unlocks the coin door to see what’s 
           wrong.  He can’t get it to open.  He pulls, but it’s jammed.  
           He jiggles the door...YANKS harder...until...it busts open: 
           1,631 QUARTERS GUSH OUT.  An endless waterfall.

           Nolan watches as they spill onto the floor, pile over his 
           ragged sneakers.  Gattis and the pool players turn to watch.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        That day: Pong was not broken.  No.  
                        It was jammed with too much money.  
                        Each quarter -- a single, sparkling 
                        fragment of validation.

           The last quarter drops.  Moose’s eyes rise to meet Nolan’s.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...and that was that.

           EXT. ANDY CAPP’S TAVERN - DAY

           Nolan charges down the sidewalk, a TRASH BAG bulging with 
           quarters is slung over his shoulder.  Moose lags behind, 
           lugging another jingling trash bag.

                                 MOOSE
                        Where are you going?!

                                 NOLAN
                        We’re moving ahead, man!  

                                 MOOSE
                        Where?  Back to Bally? 

                                 NOLAN
                        Bally??  You kidding me?  Fuck 
                        Bally!  We’re makin’ ‘em ourselves!

                                 MOOSE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 NOLAN
                        You heard me.  We’ll make 100 a 
                        day!  We’ll be bigger than Bally.

                                 MOOSE
                        Yeah, right.  You’re not gonna go 
                        into manufacturing.  What are your 
                        backers gonna say?  ‘Yeah, get a 
                        factory!’

                                 NOLAN
                        Don’t freak when I tell you this, 
                        okay, but there are no backers.  

                                 MOOSE
                        What do you mean no backers?
                                 NOLAN
                        I got money from Dabney.

                                 MOOSE
                        Dabney???!  

           On that, Al’s bag snags a tree branch and tears open.  
           QUARTERS pour all over the sidewalk.  

           INT. NOLAN’S CHEVY - DAY

           Nolan’s car screeches up to a parking spot before a huge 
           government office building.  Moose looks pissed.

                                 MOOSE
                        How can you ask me to quit when you 
                        don’t even have real backers?

                                 NOLAN
                        ‘Cause I’ll get the money.

           INT. CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Nolan and Moose wait at a public counter, two people behind 
           them.  A sign: Business Entities.  Nolan fills out a form.

                                 NOLAN
                        “Name of corporation”.  Help me 
                        think of something...renegade.

                                 MOOSE
                        What??  These are huge decisions, 
                        Nolan, and you’re just... 

                        MOOSE (CONT’D)
           ...rushing through.
                                                               NOLAN
                                                  A warning to the whole world, 
                                                  man, like: ‘Here we are.  
                                                  Brace yourself!’

           They reach the front of the line.  A CLERK waits.

                                 MOOSE (CONT’D)
                        You know you can’t just bounce back 
                        after something like this.  I mean, 
                        if you make a move like this, you 
                        better be sure it’s a kill shot. 

           Nolan thinks...and then: eureka, chills.  He scribbles down a 
           name, turns the paper around for the clerk to see.

           We ZOOM swiftly into it:

                                              ATARI
           EXT. STAR SKATE ROLLER RINK - MORNING

           A neglected building with a slumping terra-cotta roof.  A 
           sign: “STAR SKATE”.  Underneath: “For Rent”.  Nolan’s beater 
           and a rusted Lebaron are alone in a big weed-infested lot.  

           INT. STAR SKATE ROLLER RINK - MORNING

           A male REALTOR (50’s) with a long ponytail and tight shorts 
           that intersect his balls shows Nolan and Moose around.  

           Floor is caked in dust, littered with rat droppings.  A disco 
           ball hangs overhead.  Nolan looks around like he’s in heaven.

                                 NOLAN
                        We’re home, Moose.

           EXT. SMALL OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           Nolan and Moose approach the building. 

                                 NOLAN
                        What’s so complicated?  We need 
                        workers, they need work.

                                 MOOSE
                        I’ve just never heard of anyone 
                        doing this before.  

           PAN UP to reveal a sign: “CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT.”  
           Nolan throws open the door, stands before a hodgepodge of 
           middle-aged DRUG ADDICTS, HOMELESS GUYS, and BIKERS.

                                 NOLAN
                        Alright!  Who wants a job for $1.75 
                        an hour?

           EXT. SANTA CLARA - STREET - DAY

           Nolan’s Chevy zooms by, followed by a cacophonous convoy of 
           CHOPPERS, LOWRIDERS, and HARLEYS with raccoon tails flailing 
           in the wind.

           INT. NOLAN’S MOVING CHEVY - DAY

           Nolan looks alive, looks in his rear view mirror.  Moose 
           turns his head, anxiously looking behind.

           INT. STAR SKATE ROLLER RINK - DAY

           It’s chaos.  One FAT BIKER has his motorcycle inside and 
           spins donuts on the dusty floor.  The other 18 DERELICTS 
           stand around laughing and hooting.
           Moose looks scared.  Nolan looks like a kid next to these 
           men.  He lights his pipe, steps before the group, APPLAUDS 
           the bike trick.  He puts a hand in the air.  

                                 NOLAN
                        Okay.  Gentlemen, gentlemen... 
                        listen up.  Shhh...I want you to 
                        forget everything you’ve ever 
                        learned about working for ‘the 
                        man’, alright?

                                 FAT BIKER
                        Yeah.  ‘Cause, fuck -- now we 
                        workin’ for the boy.

           Fat Biker gets a laugh from the group. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Alright, alright --
                                  (lifting his hand)
                        You know, for a man who’s still 
                        riding around with Amal carbs on 
                        his bike, you might want to pay 
                        attention...

           Everyone laughs derisively...points to Fat biker.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Now, I don’t care where you worked 
                        before, who your friends are, if 
                        you smell...we’re all the same 
                        here...all that matters is that 
                        everyday we get this shit done.  
                        Now -- over the next couple days,  
                        Moose and I will be teaching you 
                        how to build computer games: an 
                        intense process that requires 
                        serious focus and absolute 
                        precision.

           Black Sabbath’s “Paranoid” fiercely rips to life as we...

                                                                SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. STAR SKATE ROLLER RINK - DAY

           A JOINT protrudes from a shaggy beard and is inhaled deeply.  
           The joint gets passed from one greasy hand to the next.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        ...and so...with Black Sabbath 
                        blasting through the roller rink 
                        speakers, Moose and I taught these 
                        derelicts how to make the games...
           It’s chaos.  Amongst metal shelves, wires, TV sets, and 
           yellow paint cans, we see 19 long-haired, tattoo-covered 
           hoodlums attempting to stuff circuit boards.  They’re 
           clueless, looking at each other’s work, but nobody knows what 
           they’re doing.  An uneasy Moose tries to help them.  Fat 
           biker attempts to close the YELLOW CABINET on a finished 
           machine but it won’t fit.

                                 MOOSE
                        No, no!  The power supply’s not 
                        seated --

           Fat biker WHACKS the cabinet with a MALLET.  It closes.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        ...but with perseverance, we made 
                        10 in the first week...  

           In QUICK SUCCESSION, Nolan plugs in 4 machines.  None work.  
           Finally, the 5th turns on.  

                                 NOLAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The next week?  20.  And with each 
                        one, bars flooded with patrons 
                        waiting their turn to play...

           INT. BARS (SERIES) - NIGHT

           QUICK SHOTS of various bars with groups of eager PLAYERS 
           hovering around Pong machines.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        ...sometimes lining up outside 
                        before these bars even opened...

           EXT. BAR - DAWN

           PEOPLE wait in a line.  An EMPLOYEE lifts the METAL GATE. 

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        ...and no matter how old or how  
                        young you were, everyone wanted a 
                        chance to hit that ball...

           INT. PROSPECT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           Before a class of opened-mouthed 5-YEAR-OLDS, Alissa stands 
           on a step stool and plays Pong against her dad.  Nolan looks 
           and smiles at the hot TEACHER.  The teacher smiles back.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        Of course, on career day...I was 
                        bigger than Big Bird...
           INT. BARS (SERIES) - DAY

           QUICK SHOTS of BAR MANAGERS taking out the change boxes, 
           counting quarters. 

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        ...and when bars got wind that 
                        Pongs brought in 400 bucks a week, 
                        we started selling them at $1000 a 
                        pop...fast...

           EXT. STAR SKATE ROLLER RINK - DAY

           Bikers wheel PONGS onto a truck.  The side of the truck which 
           once read “Atom Furniture” has the word “Furniture” X-ed out 
           and replaced with a spray-painted “HEART MOTHER FUCKER”, a 
           nod to the Pink Floyd album: “Atom Heart Mother.”     

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        ...and even though we started 
                        shipping 400 Pongs a week, we could 
                        barely keep up with our bills or 
                        the demand... 

           EXT. STAR SKATE ROLLER RINK - DAY

           A nervous Ted Dabney steps out of his CADILLAC DeVILLE and 
           sees greasy men everywhere.  He walks into the factory, 
           squinting from the smell and the haze.

           INT. STAR SKATE ROLLER RINK - NOLAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Ted sits before Nolan’s desk.

                                 NOLAN
                        Look, Ted -- you can cash out now 
                        at $375, or you can have an equity 
                        stake at the company.  Your choice.

           Phone rings off the hook.  Nolan picks up. 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                                  (into phone)
                        Atari?...Yeah, I know, I’m sorry.  
                        You’re actually next on the list.

           He walks to the door.  On the factory floor, we see row after 
           row of Pong machines, and Moose marching around, frazzled.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Moose!  Moose!  We need more 
                        machines!
                                 MOOSE
                                  (storming over, not 
                                   seeing Ted)
                        Nolan!  We got a guy in the 
                        bathroom shooting heroin right now, 
                        okay?  The pot smoke in here is so 
                        goddamn thick I can barely see, and 
                        I just caught two guys in the 
                        parking lot pawning off picture 
                        tubes!  

                                 NOLAN 
                        Say hi to Ted.

                                 MOOSE
                                  (walking out)
                        Ted.

                                 TED
                        You know what?  I think I’m just 
                        gonna cash out here.

           A frightened Ted takes his check and scurries out.  The phone 
           RINGS and RINGS.

                                 NOLAN
                        Hello?  Atari.  Please hold.  
                        Hello?  Atari, please hold.

           EXT. BARS AND OTHER LOCATIONS (SERIES)

           QUICK SHOTS: PONGS BEING WHEELED INTO ALL KINDS OF PLACES.  
           We see shots of each location that corresponds with the V.O.

                        ...and it wasn’t just bars, either: 
                        colleges, hotels, banks, country 
                        clubs, doctor’s offices.  Places 
                        that wouldn’t even allow Pinball.

           EXT. BALLY-MIDWAY MANUFACTURING - DAY

           The behemoth office compound.

           INT. BALLY-MIDWAY MANUFACTURING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           The Bally exec (from earlier) sits at the head of a long 
           conference table before a dozen EMPLOYEES, all in suits.  He 
           rubs his face in great anguish, not knowing how to begin.

                                 BALLY EXEC
                        5,000 units they shipped.  Our 
                        pins, on a good run?  3,000.  A 
                        good run.  What the hell am I

                        be on top of this shit.  Hal, 
                        you’re an engineer, make me some.

           INT. STAR SKATE ROLLER RINK - NOLAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Distressed, Nolan pores over a stack of unpaid bills.  Moose 
           sits at a side table working an adding machine.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        ...and right about then, I learned 
                        one valuable business lesson: never 
                        ever forget to file a patent.

           The phone rings.  Nolan answers.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Atari?...Wait...what??

           Moose gestures for Nolan to share what’s going on.  Nolan 
           listens...squints with confusion.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ...messing with police radios?  We 
                        don’t have that many Pongs in 
                        Nevada.   

           EXT. SILVER NUGGET CASINO - DAY

           Broad daylight in the desert.  A small casino against the 
           barren Nevada backdrop.  Nolan’s Chevy is parked in the lot.

           INT. SILVER NUGGET CASINO - DAY

           Amongst dozens of DINGING slot machines, amongst lifeless 
           leathery-faced, cigarette-smoking ELDERS playing them, Nolan 
           and Moose stand side-by-side in the darkened casino and stare 
           at a fixed point -- stunned.  Their POV reveals:

           A row of machines practically identical to Pong, called 
           PLAYTIME by Bally-Midway.

           INT. STAR SKATE ROLLER RINK - NOLAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           On a chalkboard, a frustrated Nolan draws up a schematic for 
           a new game with four paddles.  Moose contributes.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        And of course...because we couldn’t 
                        compete with these jerk-offs -- we 
                        slapped together a 4-player version 
                        of the game...
           INT. ARCADE - DAY

           Nolan and Moose enter an arcade.  They pass pinball machines 
           and find: PRO-TENNIS: a 4-player rip-off by Williams.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        ...but it took the schmucks three 
                        weeks to rip that off, too.

           CLOSE on Nolan and Moose, staring, seething.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        By the time we were up to 6 
                        paddles...? 

           In the reverse shot, we see Nolan and Moose staring at...

           INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY

           ...one machine: PRO MATCH: Pong with 6 paddles by Fun Games.

                                 NOLAN  (V.O.)
                        ...we were losin’ market share... 
                        by the minute.

           Nolan stamps on the ground.  Behind he and Moose, several 
           LAUNDROMAT DRYERS spin socks and underwear.   

           INT. BALLY-MIDWAY MANUFACTURING - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY

           The Bally engineer from the staff meeting tinkers inside a 
           dismantled Pong machine.  He gives a gentle tug, removes a 
           CIRCUIT BOARD, holds it up to the light.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        In the end...

           QUICK SHOT: Exact duplicates of the Pong circuit board zip 
           down a conveyor belt.  They’re packed into BOXES.

           In work spaces ranging from a high tech BALLY-MIDWAY FACTORY 
           to a warehouse CHOP SHOP, WORKERS build game cabinets.  In 
           each location we see boxes of the duplicate circuit boards.

           FAST SHOTS of several PONG RIP-OFFS in different

           INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY

           As if reacting to this dizzying sequence, Nolan and Moose 
           look exhausted, slumped on plastic chairs in the middle of 
           the laundromat, both staring at the spinning laundry.  

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        Isaac Newton once said: a body in 
                        motion maintains its direction 
                        until a bunch a’ assholes get in 
                        the way.

           Nolan spontaneously stands and leaves.  

           EXT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY

           Nolan reclines in the front seat of his car with his door 
           open and his eyes closed.  Moose slowly paces in front of the 
           strip mall, kicking pebbles, not wanting to go near Nolan.

                                 NOLAN
                        ...whole new direction.  New 
                        technology.  Stuff they can’t just 
                        copy with off-the-shelf parts... 
                                  (lifts head slightly)
                        Custom chips.

                                 MOOSE
                        Custom?

                                 NOLAN
                        We keep it in-house.

                                 MOOSE
                        Nolan -- we don’t know how to 
                        design semiconductor chips...

                                 NOLAN
                        So we hire new guys, new engineers 
                        who do know.

           Moose rubs his mouth, thinking.  He paces again, faster now.

                                 MOOSE
                        Stanford has a program...guys 
                        comin’ out of there know

                                 NOLAN
                        I want guys who can melt steel with 
                        their minds.  And not just, you

           INT. ANDY CAPP’S TAVERN - DAY

           Six frail, trembling DORKS in their mid-20’s are squeezed 
           into a booth with Nolan and Moose.  Nolan stares at these 
           guys, turns to Moose, then turns back to the guys.  Amongst 
           the group is a scared guy with his eyes bugging out like a 
           chihuahua, a few runny noses, a guy with an Abraham Lincoln 
           beard, a thin dude with big puffy hair like a Q-Tip.

                                 NOLAN
                        Fellas?  You’ve been handpicked as 
                        members of an elite team.  The 
                        journey ahead will be 
                        exhilarating...but I ain’t gonna 
                        sugarcoat it...it’s gonna be a 
                        bitch.  The competition will be 
                        fierce.  The work’s gonna get out 
                        of control.  But I make you this 
                        promise: we stick together here, 
                        and we’re gonna create stuff 
                        that’ll blur the line between ‘the 
                        possible’ and ‘the impossible’.  
                        You guys ready for that?  You guys 
                        ready to work harder than you’ve 
                        ever worked in your entire lives??

           EXT. PAJARO DUNES CONDO - NIGHT

           The scared new recruits sit in a bubbling hot tub, book-ended 
           by two topless STRIPPERS.

           “Atari Company Retreat, Pajaro Dunes Resort”
           The engineers sit as low as possible, not knowing where to 
           look.  Chihuahua Guy stares directly at the breasts.  Nolan 
           and Moose sit across from them.

                                 NOLAN
                        Just let the ideas flow, guys.  
                        Don’t filter anything.  It’s all 
                        compost, you know?  The door is 
                        wide open...Moose.

                                 MOOSE
                        The driving game.  I can do it now.
                        Car and track on discreet ROM 
                        chips.  Thinkin’ we use Pong’s 
                        potentiometer config, mount a 
                        steering wheel on that sucker.

                                 NOLAN
                        Awesome.  Anyone else?  Anyone?

           He sees Chihuahua Guy totally mesmerized by the boobs.

                                 NOLAN (CONT'D)
                                  (politely)
                        Um, girls...do you mind heading 
                        back into the condo and we’ll meet 
                        you back there?

           The strippers stand to leave, their slippery asses right at 
           the new guys’ eye level.  Half the guys practically sprain 
           their eyeballs trying not to look.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        We’ve all got to regress a bit -- 
                        back to when we were kids, before 
                        we learned that the pursuit of fun 
                        was something to be ashamed of.  We 
                        give people what they want, not 
                        what they need.  We do that, and 
                        mark my words, fellas, very soon 
                        Atari will be synonymous with the 
                        future of video games.

           INT. CHICAGO O’HARE HILTON - DAY

           In this crowded convention hall, Nolan, Moose, and the new 
           posse stare at a sign: “3:30PM -- THE FUTURE OF VIDEO GAMES.”  
           Beneath, the list of speakers includes representatives from 
           Bally-Midway, Williams, Taito, Ramtek, and Sega.  No Atari.

           “Amusement Operators Convention, Chicago O’Hare Hilton, 
           November 1973”
           Embarrassed and infuriated, Nolan subtly turns to Moose, 
           whispers harshly for only Moose to hear.

                                 NOLAN
                        Are you kidding??

                             NOLAN
                                                               MOOSE
           Are you fucking kidding??
                                                  That’s wrong.  No.  

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                                  (whispering harshly)
                        We invented this goddamn industry.  
                        Future of video games?!  We started 
                        it.  These guys weren’t -- Bally?  
                        Bally??  They were -- no.  No.

           INT. CHICAGO O’HARE HILTON - BALLROOM - DAY

           A CROWD of 400 attend the symposium.  Nolan and the others 
           sit in back.  Nolan’s leg shakes with suppressed rage.

           On the dais, EXECS from the six companies, men in their 40s 
           and 50s, ramble on in a breezy, self-satisfied manner.  The 
           Bally exec from before is on the stage.

                                 BALLY EXEC
                        Of course it came as no surprise.  
                        It was just a matter of the 
                        technology catching up and, as 
                        always, who got to market first.

                                 MODERATOR
                        Okay, we have time for one more...

           Nolan’s hand flies up, along with many others.  The MODERATOR 
           looks like he’s might pick someone up front.  Nolan jumps up.

                                 MOOSE
                        Nolan.

           Nolan charges into the aisle, marches to the MICROPHONE with 
           his hand in the air.

                                 NOLAN
                        Yeah, hi, I have something.

           The room quiets.  As Nolan nears the dais, the Bally exec 
           gets a better look.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Hi.  How are you?

           The Bally exec forces a tense smile, and nods.  Friendly.
                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s really, it’s a privilege to 
                        sit here and listen to you all 
                        predict the future of video games.
                                  (clapping earnestly)
                        Thanks for sharing your knowledge.  

           Back at his seat, Moose watches through his fingers.

                                 NOLAN (CONT'D)
                        I know that, um...every time we 
                        design a new game at Atari, you 
                        guys have a remarkable ability to 
                        predict your next game.  

           A MUMBLE rolls through the crowd -- “Atari?”...“Bushnell?”

                                 NOLAN (CONT'D)
                        So, while imitation is the 
                        sincerest form of flattery, your 
                        rip-offs, um -- suck...
                                  (turns to face crowd, 
                                   engaging them fully)
                        And my fellow gamers?  Every 
                        quarter you give these assholes up 
                        here...

           Laughter through the audience.  Onstage, the execs’ 
           expressions range from straight anger to mock amusement.

                                 NOLAN (CONT'D)
                        ...you’re keeping Atari from making 
                        new games that you’re gonna really 
                        love that actually represent the 
                        future of video games!!!

           Nolan ends the speech with a pumped fist in the air.  The 
           crowd loves it, bursts into raucous APPLAUSE.  Moose stands 
           up, cheers even louder.  In a second, everyone’s on their 
           feet.  People rush up to shake Nolan’s hand.  He loves it.

           EXT. LOS GATOS ATARI FACTORY - DAY

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        After that...nothing was the same 
                        again.

           The Who’s “Long Live Rock” kicks in with a vengeance.       
           For the first time, we see the classic ATARI “MT. FUJI” LOGO 
           soaring on a sign above a NEW FACTORY.

           “New Atari Factory, Los Gatos, California, 1975”
           INT. LOS GATOS ATARI FACTORY - DAY

           Nolan walks with a hip stride through the new Atari factory 
           while puffing his pipe.  He wears a pimped-out long-sleeved 
           checkered shirt with a wide collar and walks past a HUNDRED 
           EMPLOYEES tending to GRAN TRAK 10 machines (the driving game) 
           moving swiftly down an assembly line.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        Anything that didn’t make sense to 
                        us was out.  Anything that did... 
                        was in.  Assigned parking spots...? 

           Fat Biker, who has now upgraded to a thunderous HARLEY, rolls 
           up to an empty parking spot close to the building.

                                 NOLAN  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...out.  Time clocks...?

           Surrounded by his engineers, Nolan drops a TIME CLOCK off the 
           factory’s rooftop.  On the ground, the engineer with the 
           Abraham Lincoln beard films the crash with a Super 8 camera.  

                                 NOLAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        ...out.  Dress codes...? 

           THREE HOT GIRLS in BIKINI TOPS and DAISY DUKES walk past 
           Nolan on the factory floor.

                                 THREE HOT GIRLS
                                  (flirtatiously)
                        Hi Nolan.

           He smiles at them, then turns back to look at six supple ASS 
           CHEEKS leaking out from their short-shorts.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        ...in.  ‘The Atarian Philosophy’.  

           Seated on the assembly line, a HIPPIE GUY deeply massages the 
           neck of a cute HIPPIE GIRL next to him.  She rolls her head 
           in ecstasy with a joint hanging out of her mouth.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The dawning of a new era...‘Work’ 
                        for execution...but ‘leisure’ man.. 
                        ’leisure’ for perspective...

           EXT. VASONA PARK - DAY

           An ELECTRIC CHORD crackles through an amp on a grassy field.  
           A young BLACK ASSEMBLY WORKER with a headband and shades sits 
           on a folding chair and plays his ELECTRIC GUITAR to several 
           employees sitting on blankets, drinking, playing frisbee.
                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        And everybody got into it.  From 
                        the line workers to the engineers. 
                        We were all inspired, and for seven 
                        days a week...

           Nolan and his engineers sit on a picnic table, looking at a 
           SCHEMATIC of a new game.  They drink beers, discussing it.

                        ...we worked when we played...and 
                        we played when we worked...

           INT. LOS GATOS ATARI FACTORY - NOLAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           His feet up, Nolan sits back in a big chair, lights his pipe 
           and puffs.  The office is filled with CARNIVAL PARAPHERNALIA 
           and VIDEO GAMES.  Moose draws a SCHEMATIC on a CHALKBOARD 
           while a couple engineers play GRAN TRAK 20, each one with 
           their own steering wheel and gearshift.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        ...We had no idea what we were 
                        doing.  We had no reserve, 
                        everything on credit...one mistake 
                        and we were done.  If things got 
                        too tight, Moose and I didn’t cash 
                        our paychecks that week...

           Nolan sifts through the mail and finds his PAYCHECK.  He 
           opens a drawer and throws it atop a stack of other PAYCHECKS.

                                 NOLAN  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...If we couldn’t pay the vendors, 
                        we begged for more time.

           A BUSTY RECEPTIONIST answers the phone non-stop, pressing one 
           BLINKING LIGHT after another.

                                 NOLAN
                        Atari was small, but we squeaked 
                        by, and to keep up, we came out 
                        with a new game every month...

           TANK machines speed down the line...then other video games:

                        ...400 machines a day. 2,000 
                        machines a week.  Nobody saw these

                                 NOLAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        numbers coming..and for a little 
                        start-up like ours, it was...
                                  (pause)
                        ...well...it was pretty damn neat.

           Van McCoy’s classic “The Hustle” begins, plays into...

           INT. LOS GATOS ATARI FACTORY - NOLAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           A RED SIREN LIGHT swirls on the desk as Nolan (barefoot, 
           checkered pants, and a half-tucked-in, half-unbuttoned shirt) 
           attempts “The Hustle” line-dance amidst five drunk, half-
           naked employees: three girls and two guys.  Nolan watches 
           their feet and tries to stay in step.  People enter the room 
           and walk past him, lining up to pump beer from a KEG.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        Eventually...

           EXT. HEWLETT PACKARD COMPOUND - MORNING

           In a parking lot, balding old conservatively-dressed HEWLETT 
           PACKARD GUYS with their COFFEE MUGS and BRIEFCASES walk like 
           zombies to the front of their building.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        ...we were makin’ cracks in the 
                        Silicon Valley foundation like the 
                        biggest goddamn earthquake these 
                        poor bastards had ever seen.

           In SLOW-MO, the lifeless men turn their heads in unison to 
           the noise across the street.  Their POV reveals...

           EXT. LOS GATOS ATARI FACTORY - MORNING

           A cluster of excited young guys and girls stumbling out of 
           the impromptu discotheque, shielding their eyes from the 
           morning light.  Nolan exits last, his arms around TWO CUTE 
           GIRLS, the three of them parading euphorically to the CAMERA.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        Soon enough, “The Valley” started 
                        payin’ attention.

           CHEESY VIDEO GRAPHICS revealing the local TV show: “People 
           are Talking in the Afternoon.”  A CAMERA SWEEPS past a STUDIO 
           AUDIENCE of robotically-clapping, grinning women with big 
           hair and gaudy 70’s-colored clothing. 

           The IMAGE WIPES to a stage where Nolan sits before the 
           audience, interviewed by an eager 60-YEAR-OLD WOMAN and a 
           tall effeminate MALE CO-HOST with an enormous Adam’s apple.
                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        I would stay in my room and invent 
                        things.  Of course, that was before 
                        I discovered girls.  

           The audience laughs like they’re being tickle-tortured.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Atari was everything to me.  It was 
                        my home.  It was my job.  It was my 
                        family.

           INT. NOLAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Nolan’s in his office, on the phone.  He looks at a CALENDAR 
           with a WEEKEND circled and “Alissa & Britta” written inside.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (in tone as if talking 
                                   to a little child)
                        I promise, okay, Pumpkin?  I’m not 
                        gonna forget this time.  Okay?... 
                        Alright, I love you, too, honey.

           He hangs up.  Nolan’s hot SECRETARY stands in the doorway.

                                 NOLAN’S SECRETARY
                        Nolan -- you have the Oui interview 
                        this weekend.

                                 NOLAN
                        I don’t even know what that is.  
                        Let’s cancel.

                                 NOLAN’S SECRETARY
                        Oui is Playboy.  They wanted to 
                        interview you this weekend at the 
                        mansion for a 9-page spread. 

           Turning pale, Nolan stares at his secretary.  He 
           painstakingly picks up the phone and dials.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (into phone, guiltily)
                        Paula?  I think I might have 
                        to...no no...of course I’m not...
                        can-cel-ling...
                                  (to himself)
                        Shhhit.

           EXT. SMALL HOUSE IN SANTA CLARA - DAY

           Nolan’s new BLUE DATSUN 240Z drives up to his old house.  
           Alissa and Britta sit on the doorstep.  Nolan, dressed in the 
           plaid bell-bottoms and black turtleneck (from opening scene), 
           exits and hurries to them to get their bags.  He sees Alissa 
           holding CHUCK’S CAGE.  

                                 NOLAN
                        Wait, honey, you’re bringing Chuck?

                                 ALISSA
                        Well I thought you wanted to spend 
                        time with him.

           Nolan looks at her innocent, hopeful face.

                                 NOLAN
                        Yeah, yeah.  Good idea.  Bring him.

           INT. NOLAN’S MOVING DATSUN 240Z - DAY

           Alissa sits up front with the CAGE on her lap.  Britta sits 
           on a PILLOW between the seats...a tight squeeze.

                                 NOLAN
                        We’re going to, um...well...it’s 
                        kind of like a...like a funhouse!

           INT. PLAYBOY MANSION - DAY

           Poolside.  Oiled-up abs and tight asses abound.  Nolan’s 
           interview with Bob Wieder winds down.  In the b.g., a 
           PHOTOGRAPHER preps for a photo shoot.

           Alissa and Britta are in their seats across the pool.  
           Britta’s calm now, drinking from a tall glass of chocolate 
           milk.  Alissa’s still uneasy, her arms wound tight atop 
           Chuck’s cage.  The Latina housekeeper sits with them.

                                 BOB WIEDER
                                  (finishing the notes 
                                   from Nolan’s interview)
                        ...a fucking inspiration...you know 
                        that, man?  Some great stuff here.  

                                 NOLAN
                                  (gestures to daughters)
                        Great, well, I’m gonna...

           Nolan walks over to the girls. 

                                 ALISSA
                        Daddy, can we go?

                             NOLAN
                                                        PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)
           Soon, honey.  Probably.
                                                  Ready for you, Nolan.
                                 NOLAN
                                  (to housekeeper)
                        Would you mind watching them for a 
                        little...

           LATER.  In the lush garden, Nolan awkwardly poses for photos 
           with an AMMUNITION BELT loaded with QUARTERS instead of 
           BULLETS across his chest.  A female ASSISTANT stands by with 
           a bucket of QUARTERS.  Nolan puts out his hands and she puts 
           MOUNDS OF QUARTERS in his palms, then scurries away.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                                  (snapping photos)
                        C’mon!  You’re a fucking outlaw!  

           Nolan smiles eagerly as quarters fall between the cracks of 
           his fingers.  The camera SNAPS several photos in succession.

           EXT. PLAYBOY MANSION - NIGHT

           A few dozen WEALTHY-LOOKING MIDDLE-AGED MEN drink martinis 
           and ogle PLAYMATES who walk around in sexy evening wear.  The 
           men, a few with PERMS, huddle around Nolan with questions 
           about the video game industry.  Nolan looks uncomfortable in 
           this environment.  He steals a moment to check his watch.

           Bob Wieder approaches Nolan.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (quietly)
                        Bob, I think I have to go here.

                                 BOB WIEDER
                        Hold on, hold on.  One more guy.

                                 NOLAN
                        Actually--

           Wieder brings over MANNY GERARD, 45, a no-nonsense New York 
           businessman, short, horn-rimmed glasses.

                                 BOB WIEDER
                        Nolan.  This is Manny Gerard -- VP 
                        of Warner’s Entertainment Division. 

                                 NOLAN
                                  (shaking hands)
                        How’s it going?

                                 MANNY
                        Mr. Ross took his kids to 
                        Disneyland and they got hooked on 
                        your driving game.  Piqued his

                                  (picking an hors d’oevre 
                                   from a passing tray)
                        What kinds of new projects you 
                        workin’ on?

           A PLAYMATE walks by, leading a CREEPY RICH MAN by his hand.  

                                 NOLAN
                        Well, we’re, um -- we’re putting 
                        Pong on a chip about the size of a 
                        watch and we’re gonna introduce it 
                        for the home.

                                 MANNY
                        You did that before, no?

           An awkward pause.  Nolan looks almost taken aback.

                                 NOLAN
                        Well this is for the home.  And 
                        it’s on a microchip. 

                                 MANNY
                        Ahh.  Go back to the well, suck it 
                        dry.  Why not, right?
                                  (hands card to Nolan)
                        We should talk some time.  Who 
                        knows?   Warner and Atari.  Your 
                        brain and our resources -- see what 
                        kind of damage we could do.

           INT. PLAYBOY MANSION - NIGHT

           Nolan quickly enters the house.  He walks down a hallway, 
           passes a RICH GUY and a PLAYMATE talking closely, his hands 
           on her hips.  Nolan enters the KITCHEN, finds a SERVER.

                                 NOLAN
                        Hi.  The woman who was out there 
                        today, wearing a, uh, like a 
                        uniform.  Where do I find her?

                                 SERVER
                        Marisol?  She’s gone for the day.

                                 NOLAN
                        When did she leave?

           QUICK SHOTS: Nolan paces swiftly through a series of empty 
           rooms, his concern intensifying with each one.  He approaches 
           a room where a few middle-aged men sit on a couch, drinking 
           champagne, watching a BLONDE do a striptease.
                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Have you guys seen two little kids, 
                        they’re, uh, 7 and...4?

                                 MAN WATCHING STRIPTEASE
                                  (laughing)
                        You brought your kids here?

           Nolan’s in the KITCHEN again, sweating.  He speaks to a CHEF.

                                 NOLAN
                        She was supposed to be watching my 
                        kids and I don’t -- I need to call 
                        her.  I need her number.

           QUICK SHOTS: Panicked, Nolan knocks on door after door.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m looking for my daughters.

           He knocks on a door and opens it.  It’s dark inside.  A 
           SCREENING ROOM.  Disney’s “Peter Pan” is projected onto the 
           screen.  In the half-light, he can make out Alissa and Britta 
           sitting next to a lingerie-wearing, fake-breasted Playboy 
           Bunny.  Britta’s asleep.  Nolan’s visibly relieved.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                                  (to Alissa)
                        C’mon, sweetie. We have to go.  
                                  (to Playboy Bunny)
                        Thank you.

           Nolan picks up his sleeping daughter, takes Alissa’s hand.

           INT. CHATEAU MARMONT - NIGHT

           Nolan tucks Alissa in.  Britta is fast asleep next to her 
           with her thumb in her mouth.  Nolan runs his fingers through 
           Alissa’s hair, brushing her hair away from her eyes.

                                 NOLAN
                        I’m sorry.  I promise I’ll make it 
                        up to you.  Okay?

                                 ALISSA
                        Don’t worry.  I know.  You’re a 
                        very important person and you’re 
                        doing very important things.

           She makes Nolan smile.  He kisses the top of her head.
           INT. LOS GATOS ATARI FACTORY - DAY

           A large stack of OUI MAGAZINES slam down.  On the cover is a 
           half-nude model wearing a nurse uniform.  Employees’ hands 
           enter the frame and grab them one at a time.

           EXT. LOS GATOS FERN BAR - NIGHT

           Establish strip mall tavern "KHARTOUM" and a banner 
           indicating "Grand Opening".

           INT. LOS GATOS FERN BAR - NIGHT

           The place is jam-packed with ATARI EMPLOYEES.  Amongst the 
           crowd, we see a DOZEN OUI MAGAZINES being read.  Several 
           engineers, line workers, and groupies excitedly read from the 
           9-page feature, comparing Bushnell to “Disney and Hefner”... 
           calling him “Lawrence of Los Gatos”...and “young enough to 
           evolve into a Howard Johnson, sowing the land with uniformity 
           like a demented Johnny Appleseed.”

           Nolan is at the center of it all, drinking and laughing with 
           employees who razz him about the article.  GIRLS hang all 
           over him; some pull him by the hand to the bar so they can 
           order more drinks.  

           NANCY NINO (23), a beautiful young server, tries to keep up.  
           She’s overwhelmed but puts on a placating smile.  She tells a 
           COUPLE GIRLS the cost of their drinks and they respond with a 
           chorus of: “Put it on Nolan’s tab!”  Nolan spots Nancy 
           looking a little frazzled and leans over to talk to her.

                                 NOLAN
                        Sorry, sorry.  How much?

                                 NANCY
                                  (indicating other girls)
                        They said you’re covering them, 
                        too.

                                 NOLAN
                        Well, anybody that says I’m paying, 
                        just charge it to me.  That’s fine. 

           Nancy takes his card, smiles politely, and keeps moving.

           LATER.  Nolan keeps looking at Nancy from afar.  He can’t 
           keep his eyes off her.  Something about her: the self-
           assuredness, the lightness, the fun rapport she has with the 
           customers.  He slowly blocks out the sounds as he starts to 
           casually approach her through the crowd.
                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m Nolan.  I didn’t get your name 
                        before.

                                 NANCY
                        Nancy.  Hi.  Nice to meet you. 

                                 NOLAN
                                  (laughing nervously)
                        We’re partying now ‘cause we just 
                        got into our first national 
                        magazine, so...

                                 NANCY
                        Yeah.  I’ve been hearing about it.  

                                 NOLAN
                        9 page feature...thought I’d get 
                        the whole company to celebrate at 
                        the...at the “new pub.”  

                                 NANCY
                        That’s cool.  Congratulations.

           Nolan opens the Oui magazine and awkwardly gestures to 
           himself posing below the title: “A Fistful of Quarters.” 

                                 NOLAN
                                  (nervously laughing)
                        You get a chance to see this 
                        thing...or...

                                 NANCY
                                  (smiling, embarrassed)
                        Well -- let’s just say I’m probably 
                        not -- you know -- a fan of 
                        magazines like that.  But that’s, 
                        you know, I completely respect that 
                        this is a big deal for you guys.

                                 NOLAN
                        Uh oh, do I sense a women’s libber?

                                 NANCY
                                  (keeping it jovial)
                        Ummm...probably best not to go 
                        there.

                                 NOLAN
                        The pictures in here offend you?

           She looks at some of her checks, asks the BARTENDER for a 
           particular drink.  She places finished DRINKS on her tray and 
           moves through the crowd, serving them all.  Nolan follows.
                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cause, you know, there happens to 
                        be a lot of quality journalism in 
                        this.  There’s an interview with 
                        Francois Truffaut in here, there’s--

           Her hands free now, she turns, immediately takes the magazine 
           from him and deliberately starts thumbing through it to get 
           to a specific section she saw before, stopping on a 
           particular page that shows a provocative SCULPTOR’S WORKS.

                                 NANCY
                        A naked woman in bondage on all 
                        fours with a glass tabletop on her 
                        back...called ’Table Sculpture.’

                                 NOLAN
                        Satire.  Ironic commentary on what 
                        offends people.

                                 NANCY
                        Women in bondage depicted as 
                        furniture.  I’m sure a lot of guys 
                        are buying this to research their 
                        thesis papers.

                                 NOLAN
                        C’mon, I don’t control what’s in 
                        this magazine.

                                 NANCY
                                  (smiling, pointing)
                        No, no, no!  You can’t -- no...you 
                        can’t disavow the magazine’s 
                        content when you’re on 9 pages of 
                        it.  Let’s just...congratulations 
                        on being in...
                                  (turns to see cover)
                        “OUI” magazine.  Now I have to go 
                        and serve the rest of your harem, 
                        okay?

           She smiles at him, walks off.  Nolan stands there in absolute 
           awe, watching her slink away into the crowd, almost frozen by 
           this ridiculously cute, personable, intelligent woman.  

           EXT. LOS GATOS FERN BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

           A cluster of Atarians exit the bar at the same time.  Nolan 
           steps out with a BLONDE BIMBO and a BRUNETTE BIMBO on his 
           arms.  Once he gets to his car with the women, he sees Nancy 
           walking over to the DUMPSTER to take out the trash.
           Nolan opens the car for the girls.  They squeeze inside and 
           giggle.  One girl pulls down the visor and applies LIPSTICK.

                                 NOLAN
                        I’ll be right back, okay?

           Humbly, Nolan walks over to Nancy.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        What would you say if -- in a 
                        professional manner -- I offered 
                        you a job at my company...like a 
                        secretarial position or something, 
                        and I give everyone stock options, 
                        which you know, might be worth 
                        something some--

           Nolan’s car HONKS for a long duration in the background.  
           Nolan turns to look.  GIGGLES echo through the lot. 
           Embarrassed, Nolan gestures a ‘one second’ with his finger.  
           Nancy tries to hide her annoyance.  

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.  I’m just saying that maybe 
                        you can make more in a week with me 
                        than what you might make in a month 
                        at a dive like this.

                                 NANCY
                        Wow.  You are just a very confident 
                        guy, aren’t you?

           Nolan looks at her, smiles nervously, imperceptibly shakes 
           his head ‘no’.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        My father owns this dive, and I 
                        happen to like working with him.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (stammering)
                        ....said it with ‘affection’...I 
                        frequent bars like this.  I --

                                 NANCY
                        Where does your arrogance come 
                        from?  You make Pong...and it got 
                        you into a magazine that boys 
                        masturbate to.

           Nolan nods, embarrassed.  Nancy shuts the dumpster.
                                 NANCY (CONT'D)
                        It’s not like you’re changing the 
                        world here...

           She offers him a pathetic smile and walks back inside.  

           INT. NOLAN’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The living room of this modest 2-bedroom apartment is teeming 
           with ATARI EMPLOYEES drinking and talking over Pink Floyd’s 
           “Welcome to the Machine”, blaring from a HI-FI SYSTEM.  Fat 
           Biker flips through Nolan’s CASSETTE COLLECTION.

           A depressed-looking Nolan sits low on a couch watching TWO 
           GUYS on his floor play HOME PONG on his TV.  With a a BOTTLE 
           OF WHISKEY on his lap, he sits between Brunette Bimbo and 
           Blonde Bimbo, both gossiping about inane shit back and forth.  

           Nolan stares at the TV and the FAMILIAR WHITE BLIP as it 
           drifts monotonously back and forth.  In his mind, the OLD 
           BOOPS echo louder than the party noises.  Nolan snaps out of 
           his daze, takes a swig of whiskey, and gets up.  He gestures 
           to the girls that he’ll be back, walks down his hall, sees...

           A COUPLE OF THE NERDY ENGINEERS clustered in his bathroom, 
           getting instructions on how to snort COCAINE from a YOUNG 
           SLICK GUY with an open shirt and a medallion. 

           INT. NOLAN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Nolan drops onto his WATERBED, his body undulating from the 
           waves.  It’s quiet here, only the muffled sound of MUSIC and 
           VOICES from behind the closed door.  He shuts his eyes.  

                                 DELMA (O.S.)
                        He’s working on nonsense.  Nolan -- 
                        go to work with your father.

           He turns his head, opens his eyes.  He daydreams his parents 
           in the shadows of his room.

                                 DELMA (CONT’D)
                        ...You’re not well, Clarence.  You 
                        need his help.

                                 CLARENCE
                        He is helping me...doing somethin’ 
                        he loves...boy’s gonna change the 
                        goddamn world!  

           Nolan stares back up at the ceiling, then closes his eyes 
           with frustration.  After a beat, Nolan pops up, storms out. 
           INT. NOLAN’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

           ANGLE ON MOOSE standing by the door, looking at ATARI’S 
           RECEPTIONIST sitting by the pool, alone, smoking a cigarette.  
           Moose swigs his Stoli, puts down the glass, and takes a step.

                                 NOLAN
                        Moose.  What are we accomplishing 
                        here?

                                 MOOSE
                        Ah shit.  This again?

           Moose looks over at the receptionist, sees another guy 
           approach her and sit with her.  Moose looks annoyed.  

                                 NOLAN
                        Just tell me what we’re doing... 

                             MOOSE

           A lot...almost too much...
                                                  Nothing.  

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        We have some of the greatest minds

                                 MOOSE
                        Nolan, Nolan, I’m driving a car 
                        that’s got two working gears: first 
                        and reverse.  I’m the vice 
                        president of Atari and I can only 
                        go slowly or backwards.  I would 
                        like to make some money for a 
                        change, wouldn’t you?  

                                 NOLAN
                        Of course!  Problem is...

                        No no no, problem is we’re too 
                        complacent, man.  We’ve got a

                        You know what, man?  The real 
                        problem?  The real problem is 
                        you’re afraid of risk.  That’s

                        ...you know what??  Fuck you, 
                        Nolan.   

           He puts up his arms in a gesture of resignation, and he walks 
           to the parking lot.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (calling out)
                        How much of this Pong shit are we 
                        gonna shove down people’s throats?!  
                        Home Pong???  It’s like a...like a 
                        goddamn hi-fi that only plays one 
                        song.  It’s 1976, man.  People want 
                        variety.  

           He starts pacing around by the pool, rubs his face in 
           frustration, kicks a chair. 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!

           He plops on a lounge chair by the pool, gazes into his 
           apartment across the water, and sees a YOUNG GUY approach the 
           cassette deck.  The guy ejects the tape and puts in a Led 
           Zeppelin tape.  Fat Biker gets pissed: “What are you doing?”  
           “People want to hear Zeppelin, man.”  GIRLS walk over: “Put 
           on some Eagles.”  ANOTHER GUY: “Eagles suck.  Let’s get some 
           Dead going on here.”  

           From afar, Nolan watches several Atarians fight over the next 
           cassette.  In familiar Nolan fashion, thoughts slowly envelop 
           his mind.  We SLOWLY MOVE IN on his face.  He sits in 
           stillness, his eyes darting back and forth until one single 
           thought stops him.  He turns.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)

                        Moose!!!

           He gets up, runs past the pool, past several apartments and 
           into the parking lot. 
           EXT. NOLAN’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

           Nolan stops a red-faced Moose as he slowly reverses out of a 
           parking spot, his tires crunching the gravel below.

                        No, man.  I’m tired of this whole 
                        thing.  I’m tired of you trying to--

                                 NOLAN

                        An external ROM slot...

           The car slows to a stop.  Moose looks annoyed, 
           inconvenienced.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ROMs on cartridges that people have 
                        to buy -- separately.  A consumer 
                        computer that plays games... 
                        hundreds of ‘em! 

           An expressionless Moose stares at Nolan through the opened 
           window.  After a few beats, Moose’s car slowly pulls forward, 
           the tires crunching the gravel again.  He parks.  Moose gets 
           out, slams the door behind him, lowers his head in anguish 
           and puts his thumb and forefinger on his temples as if 
           suffering from a serious migraine.  Agonizingly long pause.

                        This is...c’mon...

           Nolan moves over to Moose and tries to bear-hug him but Moose 
           fights him off.

                                 MOOSE
                        No.  No.  I don’t have to admit

                        clue how much something like that 
                        would cost.  You don’t have a clue. 
                                 NOLAN
                        We’ll get the money.  We’ll get it.

                        money.  A lot of money.     

           Nolan thinks, looks Moose straight in the eyes.

           INT. NEW YORK YACHT CLUB - GRILL ROOM - NIGHT

           “New York Yacht Club, September 7, 1976”

           Like two ignored children at a family dinner, Nolan and Moose 
           sit wedged in between a dozen older WARNER COMMUNICATIONS 
           EXECS in the dining room of this old money gentlemen’s club.  
           Next to Nolan sits Manny Gerard (from the Playboy party).

           Nolan, wearing the leisure suit from his Pong-pitching days, 
           and Moose, stuffed into a threadbare 3-piece suit that might 
           have fit him 10 years and 30 pounds ago, quietly chew their 
           steaks and listen to the execs talk POLITICS.

                                 MANNY
                        ...No no no, the guy doesn’t have 
                        any power...

                        ...gonna bring some of that 
                        California weather with you.

           Nolan smiles politely, chews his steak.  The political 
           discussion carries on.

                                 MOOSE
                                  (sotto voce, to Nolan)
                        Do these people even know why we’re 
                        here?

                                 NOLAN
                        I thought I was pretty clear.

           INT. NEW YORK YACHT CLUB - TAP ROOM - NIGHT

           Nolan speaks privately with Manny Gerard in a corner of this 
           wood-paneled lounge.  A JAZZ BAND plays in the background.  
           The Warner execs sit in green leather chairs, drinking and 
           talking.  Moose is amongst them, looking bored.

                                 MANNY
                        Entertainment, kid.  The only...

                        Can I get a Chardonnay, doll?

           Nolan pulls out his pipe and packs it with tobacco.

                                 NOLAN
                        Well...to push the boundaries -- 
                        having more resources could 
                        certainly...you know...be helpful.

                                 MANNY
                        Helpful?  Monumental.

                        ‘Cause I have a lot more projects I 
                        want to explore, brand new 
                        technologies, new gadgets...

                        Listen -- I’m gonna be honest with 
                        you.  We think this cassette game 
                        is gonna be big.  We looked at the 
                        numbers and we’re prepared to join 
                        forces with you.  We’re offering 25 
                        million in cash and debentures.

           Nolan casually lights his pipe, takes a few puffs.  Manny is 
           surprised by Nolan’s lack of excitement.

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        Now -- this comes directly from 
                        Ross, it’s not our first offer: 
                        it’s our only offer.  So, that’s...

                                 NOLAN
                        Let me...discuss with my associate.

                                 MANNY
                        ‘Cause 25 mil, in this economy?
           Nolan nods, casually walks over to Moose, puffing a little 
           more than he needs to.  He gestures for Moose to step away.  
           They huddle next to the fireplace.  The execs eye them.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (sotto voce)

                        react when I tell you what I’m 
                        about to tell you.  Okay?  They 
                        offered 25 million in cash and 
                        debentures.  Just frown, alright?

                        What are debentures?

                                 NOLAN
                        No fucking clue.  But I think I can 
                        get him to 27.

                        Are you...?  No.  Don’t fuck around

                                 NOLAN
                        You’re right.  I don’t.

                        I know games.

           Nolan saunters back to Manny.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        I discussed with my associate.  
                        We’re passing.

           Manny stares at Nolan for a beat, checking in.

                                 MANNY
                        Okay.  I think you’re making a 
                        mistake, but...good luck.

           Nolan walks back to Moose, subtly shakes his head.  Moose 
           dips his head in exasperation.
                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        Nolan!

           Nolan winks at Moose.

                                  (walks over, quietly)
                        Who are you talking to?  Is it 
                        Disney?

                                 NOLAN
                        I can’t really...

                                 MANNY
                        We’ll give you 28.

                        Deal.

           They shake.  We hear the sound of a PLANE LANDING.

           Camera TRACKS into Nolan and Moose entering the busy factory.

                        means those stock options everyone 
                        thought were bullshit...?  Well, 
                        they’re no longer bullshit...
                                  (workers still confused)
                        ...which means we’re taking the day 
                        off to drink beer!

           The FACTORY WORKERS CHEER as DELIVERY GUYS march in with BEER 
           KEGS and Wild Cherry’s “Play That Funky Music” blasts through 
           the factory’s speakers.  The music bleeds into...

           EXT. LOS GATOS ATARI FACTORY - DAY 

           Nolan exiting the building and rushing toward the nearby 
           STRIP MALL with the familiar fern bar.  He carries a WALL 
           STREET JOURNAL under his arm.
           INT. LOS GATOS FERN BAR - DAY

           He enters the bar and eagerly scans the lunch crowd.  

           Nancy watches him search the room.  She averts her eyes, 
           trying to avoid his.  When she glances up, his eyes catch 
           hers.  He waves.  She smiles weakly and waves back.  

           Nolan saunters to the bar counter.  Nancy avoids him until 
           she has to fill a glass at the beer tap next to him.  

                                 NANCY
                                  (without eye contact)
                        What’s up, Pong Guy?

                                 NOLAN
                        Crazy stuff goin’ on.  You see this 
                        in the, uh...in the Wall Street 
                        Journal?  Not a lot of teen boys 
                        masturbatin’ to this one.

           He puts the newspaper on the bar.  She looks at it.  Headline 
           reads: “WARNER TO BUY ATARI” with a PICTURE OF NOLAN.

                                 NANCY
                                  (sincere)
                        Wow.  Look at you.  That’s big 
                        time, huh?

                                 NOLAN
                        Well, you know, it’s an opportunity 
                        to do things I’ve always wanted to 
                        do...and eventually, you know, make 
                        an impact--

                                 NANCY
                        That’s cool.  That’s cool.  Did 
                        you, um, want a drink, or...?

                                 NOLAN
                        Um...yeah, yeah.  Uhhh...Lowenbrau?
                                  (beat)
                        ...chance to inspire people is, 
                        y’know, what’s it’s all about, 
                        right?

           Nancy nods diplomatically while pouring Nolan’s beer.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        What I really hope people take away 
                        from...when they look at my, what 
                        I’ve done, is that this kind of 
                        success is possible, you know, if 
                        you follow--
           Nancy places the beer mug on NOLAN’S HEAD IN THE PICTURE.  He 
           quickly picks up the mug.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        What’re you doing?

                                 NANCY
                        Well, I just figured your head’s so 
                        big, I could use it as a coaster.

           She pats his hand and walks away to serve other customers.  
           He follows, passing NANCY’S FATHER, the bar’s owner.

                                 NOLAN
                        Listen, go out with me one night.  
                        What do you say?  Let me take you 
                        out one night...

                                 NANCY
                        Nnnn...concentrating on grad school 
                        right now, not really in that 
                        place...but, you know, thanks for 
                        the ego boost.

           She moves on to other customers.

                                 NANCY’S FATHER
                        My daughter -- believe me, you’re 
                        not the only one. 

                                 NOLAN
                        ‘Cause I was just, I was excited.  
                        Big day for me.

           Nolan shows Nancy’s father the newspaper.  He skims it over, 
           sees Nolan’s picture and “$28 MILLION”.

                                 NANCY’S FATHER
                        Holy shit.  

                                 NOLAN
                        Just wanted to share the news...you 
                        know, I love comin’ in here...

                                 NANCY’S FATHER
                        Yeah, of course, yeah.

                                 NOLAN
                        ...bringin’ in the whole company 
                        all the time.

                                 NANCY’S FATHER
                        You know what, lemme talk to her.
                                 NOLAN
                        Nah, I don’t wanna...

                                 NANCY’S FATHER
                        No, no -- I’ll smooth it over.

                                 NOLAN
                        ‘Cause I was thinking your bar 
                        would be a great testing site for 
                        new games, if that’s...

                                 NANCY’S FATHER
                                  (patting Nolan on back)
                        She’ll listen to me.  Trust me. 

           INT. LOS GATOS FERN BAR - LATER

           Nolan’s gone.  Nancy stands with her arms crossed while her 
           father makes drinks.

                                 NANCY
                        No way.  

                                 NANCY’S FATHER
                        One date.  What could be so bad?

                                 NANCY
                        He’s not my type, Dad!

           Nancy’s father looks at the article Nolan left behind.

                                 NANCY’S FATHER
                                  (eyeing “28 million”)
                        He just seems like such a nice boy.

           INT. NOLAN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

           We see a passed-out Nolan and three familiar bimbos entangled 
           in bed together.  Wine bottles, cigarette burns, panties, and  
           and a Home Pong set are strewn about.  An alarm clock softly 
           BUZZES under a pile of clothing.

           EXT. LOS GATOS ATARI FACTORY - MORNING

           The sun burns intensely upon Atari’s EMPTY parking lot.   

           It’s quiet.  We hear only the distant CHIRPING of birds...and 
           the MURMURS of Manny Gerard and SIX OTHER IRRITATED, SUIT-
           WEARING WARNER EXECUTIVES waiting outside the locked factory.

           INT. NOLAN’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           PHONE RINGS.  Nolan’s eyes creak open.  RING.  The girls 
           stir.  Nolan rummages for the phone, groggily answers. 
                                 NOLAN
                        Hello?...
                                  (suddenly awake)
                        Oh, hi -- yeah, no, no -- I’ll be -- 
                        I’ll be right there.

           Nolan immediately springs into action.  He throws on pants 
           and the first clean shirt he can find, a shirt emblazoned 
           with a large MARIJUANA LEAF.

           INT. NOLAN’S DATSUN 240Z - MORNING

           Nolan jumps in, starts the car, throws it in reverse.

                                 NOLAN
                        Shit -- shit -- shit!

           EXT. LOS GATOS ATARI FACTORY - DAY

           Nolan’s Datsun screeches into the parking lot, and he hops 
           out.  The seven businessmen see this wild-haired, unshaven 
           young guy wearing flip-flops and an inappropriate T-shirt -- 
           a guy they’re about to make one of the richest 33-year-olds 
           in the world.  Nolan runs to the door.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (fumbling for the key)
                        Sorry.  Sorry.  Alarm clock 
                        didn’t...don’t you hate that?

           The execs stare at him.  He opens the door.

           INT. LOS GATOS ATARI FACTORY - DAY

           They step inside, see BEER KEGS, PLASTIC CUPS, PIZZA BOXES, 
           ROACH CLIPS.

                                 NOLAN
                        Little partying last night, of 
                        course celebrating...
                                  (gesturing to them)
                        ...the sale.  People are excited.

           They see a BLOW-UP DOLL laying face-down on the factory 
           conveyer belt with the word “WARNER” written on the back of 
           its head and a JOYSTICK shoved up its ass.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                                  (laughing it off, 
                                   pulling out joystick)
                        Great, great sense of humor, the 
                        guys who work here...

           Manny forces a pained smile, steals a look at his cohorts.  
                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, welcome.  Let me show you 
                        around...show you some of the stuff 
                        we’re gonna present at the CES.

           The execs follow Nolan, scrutinizing the factory.   A LAWYER 
           trails behind with a BRIEFCASE.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        We’ve got so many great projects.  
                        We’re working on a controller 
                        that’s operated by brainwaves, a 
                        programmable computer for the 
                        home...we’ve got this carnival-
                        restaurant idea that’s gonna...

                                 MANNY
                                  (catching up to Nolan, 
                                   sotto voce)
                        Nolan.  Nolan.  Just focus on the 
                        games for now.

                                 NOLAN
                        Yeah, yeah, of course.

           He takes the executives to a closed door and unlocks it.  

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Gentlemen, I’d like to introduce 
                        you to a new generation of fun.  

           He opens the door and reveals a METAL CONSOLE about the size 
           of a toaster with exposed wiring and two ribbon cables 
           leading to a pair of PROTOTYPE JOYSTICKS.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                                  (turns on TV)
                        “The Atari Video Computer System” 
                        or what we’re calling “the VCS”.  
                        An endless variety of games...

           Nolan inserts a 2-inch ROM chip into the console.  

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ‘Mommy, can I be a jet pilot for 
                        Christmas?’

           He grabs a JOYSTICK for himself and hands the other to Manny.  

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ‘Well son, maybe Grandpa will stuff 
                        your stocking with..
                                  (flicking switch)
                        Atari’s Combat cartridge.’
           Suddenly, Nolan and Manny are flying FIGHTER JETS and 
           shooting MISSILES at one other.  Manny fires a round of 
           missiles, then subtly shifts his eyes to look at his cohorts’ 
           expressions.  They all look very amused.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ‘And if you’re really good, Johnny, 
                        maybe Uncle Bob will plunk down 
                        another 30 bucks for Street Racer’!

           Nolan replaces the Combat chip with another.  On the screen, 
           Nolan and Manny now control low-res race cars.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Hell -- run a decathlon in Video 
                        Olympics, be a gambler in 
                        Blackjack...master arithmetic with 
                        Basic Math!

           The executives clap:  “They’re gonna go nuts at CES.”  
           “...can milk this thing for years.”  “...huge profit margin.”

           The lawyer opens his briefcase, hands Nolan a pen and 
           gestures for him to sign on some lines.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                                  (while casually signing)
                        Honestly, guys -- seeing your 
                        excitement and knowing how much fun 
                        this is going to bring people...
                                  (finishes signature)
                        ...it’s not so much about the money 
                        for me...

           EXT. NANCY’S HOUSE - DUSK

           Nolan’s brand new blue ROLLS ROYCE SILVER SHADOW drives up 
           swiftly and smashes into a garbage can.  His GUCCI ALLIGATOR 
           SHOES step out.  We TILT UP and see his PLAID PANTS.  He 
           struts up to Nancy’s house.  As we tilt up to his face, we 
           see one final new addition: a PERM.

           INT. NANCY’S HOUSE - DUSK

           Nancy peeks out the window of her second floor bedroom.

                                 NANCY
                        Oh.  My.  God.

                                 NANCY’S FATHER (O.S.)
                        Nancy!

                                 NANCY
                        Tell him I’m sick!
                                 NANCY’S FATHER (O.S.)
                        He’s here!

           Doorbell RINGS.  We CUT to Nancy’s dad answering the door.

                                 NANCY’S FATHER (CONT’D)
                        Heeey!  

           Nolan shakes his hand and warmly brings in his left hand as 
           well.  

                                 NOLAN
                        How are you?  This is a nice place 
                        you have here.

                                 NANCY’S FATHER
                        Thank you.  Been here 25 years. 

           Nancy’s MOM walks in.

                                 NANCY’S MOM
                        Well, hello!  It’s so nice to 
                        finally meet you.  

                                 NOLAN
                        Thank you.  You raised a terrific 
                        daughter there.

                                 NANCY’S MOM
                        Well...she has her moments.

           Nervous laughter across the board, then uncomfortable 
           silence, until...  

                                 NANCY’S FATHER & NANCY’S MOTHER
                        Nancy!!!

                                 NANCY
                                  (walking down stairs)
                        Coming!  I’m coming.  Don’t panic.

           Nolan smiles at her.  She gives a cute smile back.

           EXT. NANCY’S HOUSE - DUSK

           Nolan walks her to his car and reaches to open the passenger 
           side, but Nancy immediately reaches for it herself.

                                 NANCY
                        No no.  I got it.  Thank you. 

           Nancy opens the car for herself and closes the door.  Nolan 
           walks around to the driver’s side with a grin.
           INT. NOLAN’S ROLLS ROYCE - MOVING - DUSK

           Nolan drives.  Nancy has her arms crossed, closed off.  
           Awkward silence.  Desperate to fill the void, Nolan glances 
           down at his new CAR PHONE -- a white, AT&T Princess-style 
           phone, complete with a rotary dial wheel and a coiled cord.

                                 NOLAN
                        Not sure about this thing yet.  
                        Supposed to be for work, but...

                                 NANCY
                        ...I’m noticing you got a...a perm.

                                 NOLAN
                        Yeah...
                                  (picking up phone)
                        ...puts out, like, 25 watts VHF, so 
                        you gotta be pretty close to one of 
                        the towers, so...yeah...

           EXT. WOODED ROADS - DUSK

           The ROLLS ROYCE curves around a tree-lined bend.

           INT. NOLAN’S ROLLS ROYCE - DUSK

                                 NANCY
                        So where are we going for dinner, 
                        anyway?

                                 NOLAN
                        My place.

                                 NANCY
                                  (cringing a bit)
                        No, really?  Your place?  Why, you 
                        cooked something?

                                 NOLAN
                        Well, not exactly.

           EXT. WOODSIDE MANSION - DRIVEWAY - DUSK

           The Rolls pulls up to a MASSIVE GATE.  Behind it is a 15,000 
           square foot MANSION amidst 16 acres of redwood forest.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (into security box)
                        It’s Nolan.

           The gate slowly opens.  Nolan pulls in.  Nancy looks 
           dumbfounded at the colossal home in front of her.
                                 NANCY
                        This is your place.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (acting unemotional)
                        Yup.  Just got it.  Bought it from 
                        Peter Folger, the, uh -- the coffee 
                        guy.  What do you think?

           INT. WOODSIDE MANSION - FOYER - DUSK

           They enter through 12-foot wrought iron double doors.  A 
           massive chandelier hangs above.  The floor is marble.  The 
           house is mostly unfurnished.  Nolan has his hands in his 
           pockets, pretending to be nonchalant about the whole thing. 

                                 NOLAN
                        37 rooms on 16 acres...got a good 
                        deal...needs some work, though.

           EXT. WOOSIDE MANSION - KNOLL OVERLOOKING HOUSE  - DUSK

           Nolan and Nancy stand atop a hillside overlooking the massive 
           home and an adjacent tennis court.  STONE STEPS lead further 
           up the hill to a glade, nestled amongst a forest of trees.

                                 NOLAN
                        Greenhouse, got a pool up there, 
                        tennis court, stable...

                                 NANCY
                                  (dubiously)
                        A stable.  For horses.  You’re 
                        going to have horses.

                                 NOLAN
                        Couple Shetland ponies maybe.  
                        Thinkin’ Clydesdales.  Maybe a 
                        thoroughbred.  My father was into 
                        horses, so...

           Nancy nods, slightly bewildered by all this.  

           INT. WOODSIDE MANSION - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Nolan sits at the head of a 25-foot oak table.  Nancy sits 
           close to him, catty-corner.  They both eat salads.

                                 NANCY
                        I think as early as three I’d kind 
                        of hold court in the house, you 
                        know...outline all kinds of 
                        punishments for my brothers..
                                 NOLAN
                        So that’s when it started...

                                 NANCY
                                  (laughing)
                        Pretty much.  I think that was when 
                        my dad sort of put the idea of 
                        going to law school in my 
                        head...and you know, political 
                        science always interested me, so...

           A BUTLER enters and pours red wine into their glasses.

                                 NOLAN
                        Thanks, man.  

           He exits back to the kitchen.  Nolan sips his wine.  

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s cool...doesn’t seem like 
                        enough women go that route.  I 
                        applaud you for taking...

                        NOLAN (CONT’D)
           ...the initiative...
                                                               NANCY
                                                  What do you mean? 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ...saying as a...as a compliment.  
                        I’m saying I happen to think you’re 
                        smart...
                                  (long, awkward beat)
                        ...I mean, personally -- I just -- 
                        I don’t know that many women into 
                        politics.    

                                 NANCY
                        Well...I don’t know that many men 
                        with their heads so far up their 
                        asses.  

                                 NOLAN
                        Hold on, hold, whoa, whoa.

                                 NANCY
                        I happen to know a lot of women who 
                        are very into politics.  The 
                        National Organization for Women 
                        alone -- which all my friends are 
                        members of -- has over 100,000 
                        women in California alone.  

                                 NOLAN
                        Okay.  Well we should 
                        probably...change the subject.  
           Nancy sips her wine tensely.  Awkward pause. 

                                 NANCY
                        It...it...it just...it boggles my 
                        mind to hear you make statements 
                        about women you know nothing about. 

                                 NOLAN
                        If you walk down the street and ask 
                        the average woman who the Vice 
                        President is -- honestly...

                                 NANCY
                                  (stands up, walks away)
                        Okay.  Okay.  That’s enough. 

                                 NOLAN
                                  (laughing nervously)
                        What?  You don’t think that’s true?

           Nancy is in the other room now.  Nolan holds an insecure 
           grin...waiting for a response.  Long pause.

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        I think I should go home.  This 
                        isn’t--

                                 NOLAN
                        What??  C’mon.  You’re being silly 
                        now.  Why are you taking this 
                        personally?  

                                 NANCY
                                  (re-entering)
                        Because you’re a jackass, okay?

                                 NOLAN
                        C’mon...

                                 NANCY
                        Look, I really tried to come here 
                        with an open mind, I did, but...

                                 NOLAN
                        Hold on, hold on...

           Nolan RINGS the dinner bell.  Nolan’s butler enters with a 
           SILVER PLATTER holding two ROLLED JOINTS.  Nolan takes one of 
           the joints and offers it to Nancy.   

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        C’mon.  I got these for us.
                        Let’s not take things so seriously.
                                 NANCY
                        Honestly.  Thank you for the meal, 
                        but...

                                                               NOLAN
                                                  We didn’t even have the meal.
                        NANCY (CONT’D)
           ...I would appreciate it if 
           you took me home.

                                 NOLAN
                        Come on.  I know you smoke.  

                                 NANCY
                        No, really -- I’m actually really 
                        tired right now and I think I’m 
                        coming down with something anyway.
                                  (off Nolan’s stare)
                        I think it’s just better if I go 
                        home...seriously.

           An awkward moment.  Nancy heads to the front door.  Nolan 
           shakes his head, frustrated with himself.

           EXT. WOODED ROAD - NIGHT

           The Rolls Royce zooms downs the road.

           EXT. NANCY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Nolan pulls up to the house.  She opens the door, steps out.

                                 NOLAN
                        For the record, I get along fine 
                        with other women. 

                                 NANCY
                        That’s ‘cause they’re all on your 
                        payroll.

           DOOR SLAMS.  She walks angrily to her front door.  The father 
           opens the door and lets Nancy in.

                                 NANCY’S FATHER
                                  (waving gleefully)
                        Thank you!!!

           Nolan smiles a pained smile as we hear the amplified sound of 
           a LIVE 70’s ROCK BAND.

           EXT. SANTA CLARA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS - DAY

           FOUR NEEDY BIMBOS “on the payroll” literally hang all over 
           Nolan at a huge Warner-Atari sponsored outdoor concert-picnic 
           event.  As Nolan shakes hands with NEW RECRUITS, he gently 
           tries to shake these girls off him.  One BIMBO WITH BIG BOOBS 
           runs and jumps on his back, demanding a piggyback ride.

                                 NOLAN
                        Girls, please...not...come on...

           The girls respond flirtatiously, slurring: “Uh-oh, are you 
           getting too big for us now?  “Nolan’s changing.”

           A banner reading “ATARI WELCOMES YOU” soars above a stage 
           where the band “Stoneground” jams.  The scene is a miniature 
           Woodstock: mud everywhere, shirtless sweaty guys, glistening 
           girls in wet T-shirts and short-shorts.

           Nolan makes his way through the crowd to THE OLD ENGINEERS 
           who hang out with a half-dozen NEW ENGINEERS, including one 
           BUDDHIST GUY with long greasy hair and a Ho Chi Minh beard.

           The original six, now in CROTCH-HUGGING POLYESTER PANTS, try 
           acting cool in front of their new subordinates.  The engineer 
           who looks like a Q-Tip wears bell bottoms, a half unbuttoned 
           silk shirt and a large medallion.

           Nolan shakes hands with the new engineers until he gets to 
           Buddhist Guy who bows and then looks Nolan in the eyes.  

                                 BUDDHIST GUY
                                  (slow, reverently)
                        Mr. Bushnell.  The spirit in 
                        me...meets the spirit in you. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Yeah yeah, groovy, man...you know 
                        we got hot dogs if any of you--

           Something catches Nolan’s eyes.  Through the dense crowd, 
           Nolan spots a man in a perfectly-tailored, dark THREE-PIECE 
           SUIT slinking his way through the mob of sweaty shirtless 
           hippies.  His name is RAY KASSAR (49).  Nolan watches the man 
           reluctantly step through the muddy grass with his WING TIPPED 
           SHOES.  He’s got perfectly-coiffed gray hair and large 
           designer sunglasses.  Nolan meanders over to him.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                                  (extending his hand)
                        Hi!  Nolan Bushnell.  

                                 RAY
                                  (shaking hands)
                        Ray Kassar.  Great to meet you.    

                                 NOLAN
                        Did you come from New York, or...? 
                                 RAY
                        Yeah, just flew in.  Manny told you 
                        I was coming today, right?

                                 NOLAN
                        I don't remember, but hey -- 
                        welcome.  It's great for you to be 
                        here and celebrate with us.

                                 RAY
                        Thank you.  Yeah.  Excited to dig 
                        in and help us prepare for the...
                                  (starts sniffing)
                        ...prepare for the VCS launch --

                                 NOLAN
                        Oh, ‘cause, yeah, Manny didn’t--

                                 RAY
                                  (sniffs again)
                        Gee, I don't want to alarm you, but 
                        you smell that?  
                                  (worried)
                        I think it’s marijuana.

                                 NOLAN
                        Um...I...I don’t, um...
                                  (big fake smile)
                        How long are you in town for, Ray?  

                                 RAY
                        Well -- from what I understand,   
                        I’m taking an office tomorrow.

                                 NOLAN
                        You’re...you’re taking an office?

                                 RAY
                        I thought -- I’m sorry.  I thought 
                        Manny told you.  I’ve been brought 
                        on as the executive liaison between 
                        Warner and...
                                  (sniffing, sotto voce)
                        ...I definitely think that’s 
                        marijuana, Nolan.
                                  (looking around)
                        ...‘cause, yeah, I think we might 
                        need to be careful here -- this 
                        being, you know, a company event.

           As Nolan watches Ray crane his neck to look for the source of 
           the smell, Nolan smiles nervously with a dawning realization 
           that things might be a’ changing. 
           INT. NOLAN’S PARKED ROLLS ROYCE - MOMENTS LATER 

           With his windows closed, Nolan speaks on his car phone in the 
           parking lot.  The rock concert is muffled in the b.g.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (into phone)
                        Manny,  Manny, I’m telling you, 
                        this guy is not gonna fit in here, 
                        I’m tell--I can’t...I can’t hear 
                        you.  Manny?  Hel--Okay...Right, 
                        but I...no I didn’t realize he was 
                        staying...!

           Through the windshield, we now see the massive scope of this 
           Warner-Atari picnic, about 850 people in all.  

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ...no no, I’m not worried, I just 
                        don’t know why we need a 
                        babysitter...

           Nolan glances over.  TWO YOUNG ATARIANS are having sex in a 
           Volkswagen Beetle. 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                                  (rubs his temples)
                        I heard you.  Observing.  I just 
                        don’t want him interfering, that’s 
                        all... Alright...alright, fine.  

           INT. SANTA CLARA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS - LATER

           His eyes affixed to Ray’s DARK SUIT moving in the distance 
           amongst a sea of sweaty, gyrating flesh, Nolan walks towards 
           a MUD PIT where a BLONDE BIMBO chases kids around.  ALISSA 
           (now 8 1/2) sits by herself on a PICNIC TABLE nearby, making 
           a PLASTIC LANYARD.  Nolan turns from the suit to look at 
           BRITTA (now 6) running in the mud with the other kids.  
           Britta immediately runs up to hug Nolan.

                                 BRITTA
                        Daddy.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (playfully)
                        Aaaaa.  You got mud all over me!

           Britta laughs.  Alissa sees her father and walks up to him.

                                 ALISSA
                        Dad -- this lady says she’s your 
                        girlfriend.
                                 NOLAN
                        No no...no.  Definitely not.

                                 ALISSA
                        ‘Cause she’s really stupid, Dad.  
                        She said she doesn’t believe people 
                        came from monkeys.

                                 NOLAN
                        Well she’s not my girlfriend.   
                        Look, we’re gonna be here for 
                        another half hour and then we’re 
                        gonna go, okay?

           Nolan puts his arm around her.  He then walks on, eyeing Ray 
           in the distance greeting the new engineers.  Nolan marches 
           over to MOOSE who stands awkwardly next to the ATARI 
           RECEPTIONIST.  The two nurse beers, watch the band, and nod 
           their heads to the music.  Nolan taps him.  

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Moose.  They’re putting a Warner 
                        guy in the engineering building.

           Moose doesn’t want to be diverted from the receptionist.  

                                 MOOSE
                        Let’s talk about it later.

           As Moose turns back, TWO DRUNK GIRLS run up to Nolan and jump 
           on him.  “Nolan!”

                                 NOLAN
                                  (peeling them off)
                        Girls, girls...please...there’s a 
                        lot of stuff going on here.  

           They drunkenly prance away, running to another male victim.  

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                                  (tapping Moose again)
                        Moose.  Moose.  

           Moose turns to him again, looking slightly annoyed.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        You think these girls only like me 
                        because I’m paying them?

                                 MOOSE
                        Nolan.  This is the first girl 
                        who’s talking to me in 5 years.  
                        Please.  Don’t ruin it for me.
                                 NOLAN
                        ‘Cause I’m thinking about 
                        transitioning to a new caliber of 
                        women.

           Moose stares at him blankly.  

           INT. LOS GATOS ATARI FACTORY - LOBBY - DAY

           A large 45-year-old WOMAN with short hair, a PIN-STRIPED 
           BUSINESS SUIT, and a LARGE BUTTON reading “E.R.A.” pinned to 
           her lapel, walks up to the RECEPTION DESK.

                                 WOMAN WITH SHORT HAIR
                        Hello, I’m Barbara Rosenfarb with 
                        the National Organization for 
                        Women, here to see Nolan Bushnell.

           INT. NEW ATARI ENGINEERING BLDG. - DAY

           The NEW BUILDING is alive with excitement.  ENGINEERS and 
           their ASSISTANTS scurry about, engrossed in their work.  An 
           exhilarated Nolan walks briskly to the front entrance, 
           passing Ray who stands in the doorway of his new office, 
           instructing MOVING GUYS where to put BOXES and a large PLANT.

                                 RAY
                                  (to a passing Nolan)
                        Nolan.  I noticed when I came in, 
                        there was no security...

                                 NOLAN
                                  (quickly passing him)
                        Yeah, Ray, we don’t --

           He walks over to the main lobby and spots the receptionist 
           escorting Barbara Rosenfarb into the building.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Barbara?  Nolan.  What a pleasure 
                        it is to meet you.

                                 BARBARA
                        Well thank you for inviting me.  

           Ray walks over to them with a big phony smile.  

                                 NOLAN
                        Of course, of course...kind of 
                        nutty around here with all the 
                        stuff we’re trying to do.  If you 
                        want, you know, I can give you a 
                        tour...
                                 RAY
                        Hi.  I’m Ray Kassar.

           Nolan is unnerved that Ray is interfering.

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        You know, I haven’t even had an 
                        opportunity to look around yet.  
                        You mind if I tag along?

           INT. NEW ATARI ENGINEERING BLDG. - MAIN HALLWAY - DAY

           Nolan walks next to Barbara.  Ray is a step behind, holding a 
           CLIPBOARD with a stack of papers clipped to it.  

                                 NOLAN
                        ...just moved in here a few months 
                        ago.  36 engineers working on the 
                        neatest--
                                  (playfully)
                        Watch out, Barbara!

           Barbara almost steps on a ROBOTIC CAT which rolls by, 
           followed by a few NEW ENGINEERS with a remote.  

                                 BARBARA
                        Oh -- that’s adorable.

           They keep walking.  Ray keeps turning back to look at the 
           engineers operating a robotic cat.  He’s very confused.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (gesturing to room)
                        Alright, Barbara -- now you can’t 
                        tell anyone what you’re about to 
                        witness here, okay?  This is the 
                        first consumer product of its kind: 
                        a computer for the home.  

           He opens a door to a COMPUTER LAB.  BUDDHISM GUY, sweaty with 
           long greasy hair stuck to his face, sits before a monitor, 
           laughing hysterically, staring at FLASHING COLORS on the  
           screen.  

           Again, Ray is baffled, consults with papers on his clipboard.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                                  (whispering to Barbara)
                        Yeah...yeah best not to break his 
                        concentration.

           Nolan moves to leave, lets the other two out first, then 
           whispers to Buddhism Guy.
                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        No acid tomorrow, man.

           Nolan joins Barbara and Ray in the hall, and brings them to 
           another lab where several new engineers are working on a 
           TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEVICE.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ...and I can’t wait to play with 
                        this next one -- people are gonna 
                        be able to play video games against 
                        each other over a phone line.

                            BARBARA
                                                                RAY
           How about that.
                                                  Huh.  I’m--

                                 RAY
                        ...Manny said you had some pet 
                        projects, but, gee -- I didn’t 
                        realize the extent of it.  

                                 NOLAN
                        Well, I wouldn’t say they’re ‘pet’ 
                        projects, Ray...

                              RAY
           I didn’t mean...
                                                               NOLAN
                                                  ...they’re major 
                                                  innovations...

                                 RAY
                        Oh yeah, yeah -- no no I’m sure.  
                                  (to Barbara)
                        I’m, I’m sorry...
                                  (to Nolan)
                        Can I see where your guys are 
                        working on the VCS?  ‘Cause I know 
                        that’s the priority.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (feigning patience)
                        Of course you can, Ray.

                                 RAY
                                  (following Nolan)
                        ‘Cause with CES coming up...

           Nolan leads them to a room full of VCS prototypes on 
           workbenches.  No engineers in sight.  Ray looks concerned, 
           gestures toward the benches.

                                 NOLAN
                        They’re in a private strategy 
                        session right now, so they’ll be 
                        back soon.   
                                 RAY
                        I’m sorry, Barbara...
                                  (quietly to Nolan)
                        ...you know, I think it’s best if I 
                        sat in on that, ‘cause you know, 
                        with Warner committing...
                                  (sucking in air, looking 
                                   concerned)
                        ...2 million for the launch... 
                        they’re...understandably...

           Nolan looks at Ray, thinks for a moment, then...

                                 NOLAN
                        Barbara, I’ll be right back. 

           Nolan immediately leads Ray down a particular hallway.  

                                 RAY
                        Yeah, it’s good for me to sit in on 
                        this...’cause this way I can report 
                        to Manny how hard they’re working. 

           INT. ATARI ENGINEERING BLDG. - EMPLOYEE SPA - MOMENTS LATER

           Nolan enters with Ray.  The air is thick with smoke and 
           steam.  Through the haze, they see a bubbling HOT TUB filled 
           with the original engineers and girls in bikinis, all 
           drinking wine and smoking pot.  Ray looks shocked.  Nolan 
           grabs a TOWEL from a rack and tosses it to Ray.  

                                 NOLAN
                        Guys, scoot over. Ray’s sittin’ in.

           Nolan gives Ray a firm smack on the back and then steps out. 

           INT. ATARI ENGINEERING BLDG. - NOLAN’S OFFICE - LATER

           Seated at his desk, Nolan writes a check in the amount of 
           “$10,000” to “The National Organization for Women”.  Barbara 
           sits across from him.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (writing)
                        ...’cause, personally, Barbara, I 
                        can’t think of a worthier cause 
                        than equal rights for women.

           Nolan hands her the check.

                                 BARBARA
                        This is very special, Nolan.  Thank 
                        you.  I mean -- not only are we 
                        grateful to you for the 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        contribution, but, I mean, for you 
                        to open up your estate to us for 
                        the next fund-raiser...we just wish 
                        more men were like you. 

           EXT. WOODSIDE MANSION - DUSK

           On the lawn, a STRING QUARTET practices Vivaldi’s “Spring 
           Concerto”.  A staff of WAITERS (no waitresses) prepare for a 
           party, smoothing out tablecloths and lighting candles.

           INT. NANCY’S FRIEND’S FORD PINTO - DUSK

           Nancy and THREE FEMALE FRIENDS (in their 20’s) drive down a 
           meandering, tree-lined road.  They look for a house.

                                 FRIEND #1
                        If this guy is contributing $10,000 
                        to the organization and we’re 
                        spending $50 a plate, why are we 
                        paying dues?

                                 NANCY
                        Oh my God.  You know who lives in 
                        this neighborhood?  That jerk.

                                 FRIEND #2
                        King Pong lives around here?  

           The car pulls up to NOLAN’S GATE.  Nancy’s face turns white.  

                                 NANCY
                        Um...wait...

           She quickly checks the home address: “3860”, then checks the 
           fund-raiser invitation: “3860”.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                                  (connecting the dots, 
                                   quietly smiling)
                        That son of a bitch.

           EXT. WOODSIDE MANSION - DUSK

           Nancy stands amongst 80 WOMEN of all shapes and sizes.  Nancy 
           pretends to be engaged in a serious conversation, but she’s 
           clearly looking around for Nolan.  

           When she spots him in the crowd, he’s charming a CIRCLE OF 
           WOMEN.  Nolan makes eye contact with Nancy, gives her a wink.  
           She shakes her head, slightly amused.  Touche.
           LATER.  It’s night now.  Outdoor heaters glow.  Lights 
           twinkle in the trees.  The women sit at tables, eating SALADS 
           as Nolan addresses the group.

                                 NOLAN
                        I want to thank you and especially 
                        Barbara Rosenfarb for granting me 
                        the privilege of hosting your 
                        chapter’s fund-raiser tonight.  
                        This is a big step for me.  For 
                        most of my life, I’ve been blinded 
                        by my own outdated ideals...and 
                        while at first I was inspired to do 
                        this in the hopes of winning the 
                        heart of a strong and brilliant 
                        woman...

           The women at Nancy’s table look at her.  She turns red with 
           embarrassment.

                                 NOLAN (CONT'D)
                        ...it is inevitable that the 
                        residual effect of my involvement 
                        with the organization has inspired 
                        me to change my ways.  I also have 
                        two more special reasons to support 
                        your organization, and their names 
                        are Alissa and Britta, my 6-year-
                        old and 8-year old daughters, the 
                        most amazing women in my life.

           The feminists melt.  Nancy gulps her wine.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        And I hope -- no...I demand that my 
                        girls have the opportunity to grow 
                        and thrive in a world in which 
                        every woman is guaranteed equal 
                        rights under the Constitution of 
                        the United States of America.

           The feminists love this guy.

           LATER.  Nancy talks quietly with Nolan.  Guests are leaving.

                                 NANCY
                        You are insane, you know that?

                                 NOLAN
                        It’s a worthy cause.

                                 NANCY
                        What is?  The Equal Rights 
                        Amendment or getting into my pants?
           Nancy’s friends approach.

                                 FRIEND #1
                        Sorry...we’re taking off, but you 
                        guys are talking --

                                 NOLAN
                        I’ll drive her home.

                                 NANCY
                        No no, I’m gonna, Nolan, this was 
                        great.  Thank you.

           Nancy gives Nolan a quick hug, turns, and walks towards her 
           friend’s car.  The girlfriends speak under their breath.

                                 FRIEND #1
                        No.  You are not getting in my car.

                                 FRIEND #2
                        He’s a find.  You’re nuts.

                                 FRIEND #3
                        Jesus Christ, Nancy.  Open your 
                        eyes.  He’s open to changing. 

           The girls get into the car, shut the doors quickly, and wave 
           at Nancy who stands on the driveway before Nolan.  Nancy 
           turns to Nolan and smiles weakly.

                                 NANCY
                        Great.  Well.  You won.  Now what?

           INT. WOODSIDE MANSION - GAME ROOM - DUSK

           Nolan and Nancy turn their steering wheels to maneuver their 
           RACE CARS around a track in the game SPRINT 2.  

                                 NANCY
                        ...out of my way.  

                                 NOLAN
                        Not a chance.  

           Nancy’s car passes Nolan.  Nolan swerves to avoid an oil 
           slick and crashes into the side of the road.  

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           Nolan’s car gets back on the road. 
                                 NANCY
                        You made this game and you just 
                        wiped out.  Do your daughters beat 
                        you at this, too?

                                 NOLAN
                        I was going to tell you about ‘em.

                                 NANCY
                        Really.  When?

                                 NOLAN
                        Well, after you called me a 
                        jackass, there wasn’t exactly a 
                        huge window of time...

           Nolan’s car creeps up to hers.  Nancy swerves and blocks him.

                                 NANCY 
                        What’s it like for them to have a 
                        father who’s probably a lot more 
                        immature then they are.

                                 NOLAN
                        I think they’ve come to terms with 
                        it...
                                  (passing Nancy’s car)
                        ...see ya.

                                 NANCY
                        Oh no...no no no..you’re 
                        goin’...no...

           In a photo finish, Nolan’s car passes hers and wins.

                                 NANCY (CONT'D)
                        Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  You won.  

           With his arm up in victory, Nolan exits the room.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Where you going? 

                                 NOLAN (O.S.)
                        Popping open a bottle of champagne. 
                        Of course.

                                 NANCY
                                  (quietly to herself)
                        Oh, God.
           EXT. WOODSIDE MANSION - POOL - NIGHT

           A beautifully lit pool is nestled amongst surrounding 
           redwoods.  There’s a waterfall and a slide.  It’s quiet.

           Holding glasses of champagne, Nolan and Nancy recline back on 
           adjacent chaise lounges and stare up at the galaxy of stars.

                                 NANCY
                        So is this like your standard 
                        move...take women out here to drink 
                        and stare up at the stars? 

                                 NOLAN
                                  (smiling, staring up)
                        No, no...God...the last time I did 
                        this with anyone...honestly, I 
                        think it was with my dad -- we 
                        spent this whole night once looking 
                        for Sputnik to go by.  That was a 
                        long time ago...  
                                  (remembering clearly)
                        And my mom...she wasn’t thrilled 
                        about us stayin’ out like this -- 
                        but my dad...
                                  (laughing)
                        ...he just -- he grabbed this huge 
                        bag of pretzels and a couple a’ 
                        sleeping bags...and we just marched 
                        out there into the backyard with 
                        this little Pathfinder telescope I 
                        had, and we just stayed out there -- 
                        two guys lyin’ back on a couple a’ 
                        pillows, waitin’ to catch it.  We 
                        never saw it, but, man, we had so 
                        much fun that night.

                                 NANCY
                        Are you still close?

                                 NOLAN
                        He had a heart attack when I was 
                        16.  He was a cement contractor and 
                        I was supposed to go to work with 
                        him that day.  He wasn’t feeling 
                        well, but he insisted I stay back 
                        and work on this stupid invention I 
                        was making.  He just -- you know...
                                  (long pause, Nolan’s 
                                   eyes subtly tear up)
                        ...he really -- he loved me very 
                        very much, my dad.
           With compassionate eyes, Nancy turns to look at Nolan.  She 
           stays focused on him, then slowly puts her hand on top of his 
           and gently squeezes.  After a moment, Nolan eases his hand 
           back, embarrassed to be showing this kind of vulnerability.  
           He wipes his eyes dry.

           Very long pause with both of them having nothing to say.  

                                 NANCY
                        You want to go swimming?

                                 NOLAN
                        You’re gonna need a bathing suit, 
                        right?

           Nancy stands up and strips down to her BRA and PANTIES.   
           Nolan looks at her, exhales a breath that feels like the end 
           of a cry and start of a laugh.  She then jumps into the pool.

                                 NANCY
                        Oh my God!  It’s freezing.

           She crosses her arms and shivers.  She looks at Nolan.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Jump in, you wuss!

           Nolan smiles and springs up.  He takes off his clothes, 
           strips down to his underwear, and jumps in as well.  

                                 NOLAN
                                  (shivering)
                        Jesus Christ!

           They look at one another, shivering, about three feet apart.  
           A few beats.

                                 NANCY
                        I don’t know if this is such a good 
                        idea, Nolan.

                                 NOLAN 
                                  (wading very slowly 
                                   toward her)
                        I know it’s not.

                                 NANCY
                        It might be a mistake if we rush 
                        into this...if we don’t take our 
                        time. 

           They look into each other’s eyes, their faces inches apart. 
                                 NOLAN
                        Albert Einstein said...”Time has 
                        no...

           Nancy shuts him up with a kiss.  Nolan wraps his arms around 
           her, then she wraps her arms around him.  We stay with them 
           for several beats as their kiss grows more and more 
           passionate.

           A dramatic ORCHESTRAL SCORE, full of excitement and energy, 
           builds under the kiss.  Music CRESCENDOES as we cut to:

           “Consumer Electronics Show, Chicago, Illinois, June 1977”

           INT. McCORMICK PLACE CONVENTION CENTER - THEATER - DAY

           Darkness.  The anticipatory BUZZING of the CROWD.  Then, 
           suddenly, a huge, multi-colored ATARI LOGO illuminates above 
           the stage and Nolan steps out from the wings to the CHEERS of 
           1,000 overzealous ELECTRONICS ENTHUSIASTS.

                                 NOLAN
                        Welcome to the new Atari!
                                  (CHEERS intensify)
                        I am here to announce that the 
                        future begins TODAY!

           On ‘today’, a TOWERING SCREEN lights up behind Nolan with an 
           image of the ATARI VCS -- the icon of a generation.  Black 
           console, faux wood front, stocky rubber JOYSTICKS with one 
           red button.  Above the VCS, a TV displays AIR-SEA BATTLE. 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        The Video Computer System -- a 
                        virtual arcade in your very own 
                        living room.  We’ve got 9 game 
                        cartridges ready to go, 90 more in 
                        the works, and, with the 
                        possibility of thousands more to 
                        come, this baby changes everything.

           Graphics reveal GAME BOX COVERS flying out from the VCS.  The 
           audience applauds this electronic river of fun.  Nolan prowls 
           the stage, feeding off the crowd’s energy.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        And guys, believe me, the changes 
                        do not stop here.  
                                  (checking in with Manny 
                                   and Ray in the wings)
                        Games are just the beginning.

                        telecommunications?  Well, today in 
                        our labs, my friends, we are 
                        defining the future! 

           INT. CHICAGO CONRAD HOTEL - MANNY’S HOTEL SUITE - DUSK

           Nolan and Ray sit stiffly in chairs.  Manny is standing.

                                 MANNY
                        Because people are stupid, Nolan.  
                        They’re easily confused.  And when 
                        we spend 80 million dollars...

                        MANNY (CONT’D)
                                                               NOLAN
           ...developing a product...
                                                  Nobody’s gonna be confused.

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        ...the last thing we can afford is 
                        confusion, okay?  You agree.

                                 NOLAN
                        It’s not gonna hurt the VCS.    

                                 MANNY
                        You feed ‘em one thing at a time or 
                        they choke on it, Nolan.  You 
                        launch the product.

                                 NOLAN
                        And -- I’m sorry -- we should plant 
                        seeds, too.  

           Nolan tensely walks over to a bowl of fruit, spears a 
           cantaloupe piece with a toothpick and eats it.  Manny glances 
           at Ray and subtly shakes his head.  Ray matches Manny’s 
           exasperation and subtly shakes his head as well.

           Manny rubs his eyes, then shuts them tightly as if he’s 
           thinking hard.

                                 MANNY
                        Nolan, we bought a brand.  A brand 
                        that means games.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (his back to Manny, 
                                   spearing more fruit)
                        And you knew from day one...

                             MANNY
                                                               NOLAN
           Yes.
                                                  ...that Atari...
                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                                  (turning around)
                        ...was gonna branch into new areas.  
                        That we weren’t just...

                        NOLAN (CONT’D)
                                                               MANNY
           ...gonna be doing games...
                                                  Okay.  

                                 MANNY
                        We didn’t know, though, that you 
                        were gonna burn through your entire 
                        R&D budget in...

                                 RAY
                        ...four months.

                                 NOLAN
                        These are big projects and you’re 
                        gonna thank me.  

                                 MANNY
                        Nolan...we spent 80 million dollars 
                        developing the VCS.  We did that 
                        for you, Nolan.  80 before the 
                        first VCS leaves the factory...and 
                        you’re...you’re asking us to bank 
                        on...on...on...a, a home computer??   
                        Who the fuck’s gonna use a home 
                        computer?  A family of goddamn 
                        mathematicians?  There are 
                        boundaries, Nolan...and the bottom 
                        line is, we have to accept them.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (shuffles to the door)
                        Well.  I’m...I’m gonna...I’m gonna 
                        keep going with them, so...

           Nolan looks at Manny and Ray.  With his hands in his pockets, 
           he subtly nods his head, then saunters out.  We stay inside 
           the room as the heavy door shuts loudly.

           Manny and Ray sit for a beat, neither speaking.

           INT. CHICAGO CONRAD HOTEL - NOLAN’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           A calmer Nolan cradles the phone with his shoulder, lying on 
           his back on a still-made bed.  While wearing his clothing 
           from the presentation, he kicks off his shoes.  He speaks in 
           a playful, intimate tone and fidgets with his wooden pipe.   

                                 NOLAN
                                  (on phone)
                        Of course they’re gonna like you --

                        well, wait, hold on now, this is 
                        important -- how many times can you 
                        sit through the Tiki Birds?...uh-
                        oh, you don’t know the talking 
                        birds?  Okay, well we’ll definitely 
                        have to school you then.  That was 
                        Alissa’s favorite when she was a 
                        baby...

           While listening to her response, he traces his finger along 
           the rounded edge of the pipe.  

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D (CONT’D)
                                  (smiling)
                        ...Okay, well, when are you free?  
                        We’ll put it together.  I think 
                        they’ve got some days off school, 
                        so we could all go then...I’ll miss 
                        work.  No big deal.  

           ESTABLISHING SHOTS:

           -WIDE SHOT across the vast surface of the Silicon Valley.  
           Several large-scale construction projects pepper the city.

           -BEHIND THE ATARI FACTORY, a forklift loads pallets stacked 
           high with VCS BOXES into the back of a SEMI.

           -In FRONT OF THE FACTORY, the semi drives by in the 
           background while a MAN in a dark suit exits a rented Lincoln 
           Continental and walks sternly toward the building.

           EXT. SILICON VALLEY - STREET - DAY

           Nolan’s Rolls Royce drives down a modest suburban street.

           INT. NOLAN’S ROLLS ROYCE - DAY 

           Nolan is driving.  Britta sits in the passenger seat.  Alissa 
           sits in the back.

                                 ALISSA
                        Dad...seriously.  What if I don’t 
                        like her.

                                 NOLAN
                        You’re going to like her.    

                                 ALISSA
                        You’re not going to hold her hand 
                        or anything, are you?

                                 NOLAN
                        No.  I will not hold her hand.
                                 BRITTA

                                 NOLAN
                        Listen, guys.  Don’t talk about the 
                        crazy house I brought you to in Los 
                        Angeles, okay?

                                 ALISSA
                        Why not?  ‘Cause of all those 
                        prostitutes?

                                 NOLAN
                        What??  Who told you that -- your 
                        mother?  I thought we weren’t going 
                        to say anything to Mom about that!

           Pause.  Alissa and Britta look guilty.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Just don’t say anything about it 
                        today,  okay? 
                                  (pause)
                        Okay?

                                 ALISSA
                        Okay.

                                 NOLAN
                        Britta??

                                 BRITTA
                        I have to pee.

           EXT. NANCY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Nolan’s car pulls up.  The windows are down.  Nancy comes out 
           with shades on her head, a T-shirt, shorts, and carrying a 
           small overnight bag.  She has a big smile.

                                 NANCY
                        Hi!!

           Alissa and Britta look skeptical, nervous.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Hi, guys. 

           Nolan steps out.  Alissa and Britta get out as well and stand 
           behind him.

                                 NOLAN
                        This is Alissa and this is Britta.
                                 ALISSA AND BRITTA
                                  (in unison, no emotion)
                        Hi.

                                 NANCY
                        We’re gonna have some fun today.  I 
                        heard this is your second time at 
                        Disneyland...

                                 ALISSA
                        Yeah.  Britta was too small the 
                        first time, though.

                                 NOLAN
                        Well, Britta’s seen pictures, 
                        right?

           Nolan’s interrupted by his ringing CAR PHONE.  

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Um...

                                 BRITTA
                        Can I get it?

                                 NOLAN
                        Let me just, hold on.

           Nolan gets into the car, picks it up quickly.  Nolan, Alissa, 
           and Britta make small talk outside.  Nancy has a nurturing 
           way with them that they respond to positively.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                                  (into phone)
                        Hello?...
                                  (listening)
                        I can’t -- hold on, Moose, Moose, I 
                        can barely...what??
                                  (covers other ear, 
                                   smiles at Nancy, holds 
                                   up a finger)
                        Wait, whoah, whoah, slow down, I 
                        missed the beginning of...Who 
                        did?...what guy??  Just...just 
                        calm...I can’t -- hello?  Moose?  
                        Al, Al...
                                  (phone dies)
                        Shit.

           He hangs up, takes a deep breath, looks at Nancy and his kids 
           laughing together.  

           Nolan gets out of the car.
                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        That was work.

                                 ALISSA
                        No, Dad.  

                                 NOLAN
                        No, no, I’m just gonna, it’s ten 
                        minutes away.  There’s something -- 
                        I don’t know, my partner... 
                        apparently, he needs me to --
                        something.  I’m just gonna run over 
                        real quick.

           The kids are downcast.  Nancy subtly checks her watch.

                                 NOLAN (CONT'D)
                        I’m really sorry.  We’ll leave in 
                        an hour.  Is that...?  Maybe an 
                        hour and a half, tops?

                                 NANCY
                        Do you wanna just use my phone?

                                 NOLAN
                        I should just...let me just find 
                        out -- one hour.

           Nolan runs back to his car, almost forgets his kids.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        And I’ll just, girls -- I’ll take 
                        them, right?  They’ll come with me.  
                        You guys can play some new games.

           Nancy opens the car door for the girls and they reluctantly 
           climb back in.  Nancy feels badly for them.  As Nolan 
           reverses out of the driveway, Nancy smiles at him, taps her 
           watch.  He nods, waves.

           INT. NOLAN’S ROLLS ROYCE - DAY

           Nolan speeds down the San Tomas Expressway with the girls.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (on phone)
                        I don’t understand.  Hold on -- let 
                        me -- hold on -- who exactly?... 
                        Well tell me what you do know...
                                  (listening)
                        No, no, nobody’s, nobody’s, he 
                        can’t just -- tell them not to 
                        leave -- I’ll be there in five 
                        minutes.  Tell them not to leave!
           EXT. LOS GATOS ATARI FACTORY - DAY

           Nolan storms through the parking lot with his two kids behind 
           him.  He sees a couple of ENGINEERS walking out of the 
           Engineering Building, looking shell shocked, each with a box 
           of their personal belongings.

                                 NOLAN
                        Go back inside.  Put your stuff 
                        away.  You still work here.

           Nolan charges on, enters...

           INT. ATARI ENGINEERING BLDG. - DAY

           More dazed ENGINEERS stand around with boxes.

                                 NOLAN
                        No -- no.
                                  (loud)
                        Everybody relax.  Nobody’s been 
                        fired.  This is my problem.  I’m 
                        gonna fix it.

           Nolan rushes through the building.  Alissa and Britta run to 
           keep up.  Nolan looks into his office, sees his secretary.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Have you seen Al?

                                 MOOSE (O.S.)
                        Nolan!

           Nolan turns to see a harried Moose scuttling over.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (to daughters)
                        Guys, why don’t you play some 
                        Starship, okay??

           Nolan nudges them into his office to play.

                                 MOOSE
                                  (whisper, out of breath)
                        ...lawyer, Warner lawyer, comes in, 
                        just walks in, pink slips all the 
                        new engineers.

           Nolan takes a beat, shaking his head slightly -- then 
           spontaneously SMACKS a wall, startling Alissa and Britta.

           He marches to Ray’s office and barges in.  RAY’S SECRETARY, a 
           woman in her 50’s with gray hair in a bun, jumps up.
                                 RAY’S SECRETARY
                        Mr. Kassar’s in New York until 
                        Monday.

           Nolan takes a breath, gathers his cool.

                                 NOLAN
                        Could you possibly get him on the 
                        phone for me?

                                 RAY’S SECRETARY
                        He’s in a meeting now, and tomorrow 
                        he’ll be tied up from...
                                  (checking calendar)
                        ...11am through, looks like most of 
                        the day for a budget meeting at 
                        corporate...Would you like me to 
                        give him a message?

                                 NOLAN
                        No no, I’ll give it to him myself.
                                  (exiting, walking back)
                        Moose, pack your shit and meet me 
                        at the airport in an hour.  We’re 
                        goin’ to New York.

           Nolan pops his head into his office.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Girls...time to go now...
                                  (to secretary, quiet)
                        Please call Nancy Nino.  Her 
                        number’s in my book.  Tell her...I 
                        had to go.  Tell her I’m very 
                        sorry.  And I’ll call her.

           EXT. SILICON VALLEY STREET - DAY

           The Rolls Royce barrels down an upscale suburban street, 
           pulls into the driveway of a large, NEW HOUSE.  An angry 
           Britta gets out, runs to the door, repeatedly rings the bell.

           INT. NOLAN’S ROLLS ROYCE - DAY

           With the car idling, a guilty and rushed-looking Nolan sees 
           Paula open the door for Britta who runs inside.  Paula burns 
           a long look at Nolan, then follows Britta inside.

                                 NOLAN
                        Alis, we’ll do it another time, 
                        okay, honey, I’m sorry, 
                                 ALISSA
                        Whatever.  I don’t care.  
                                  (opening car door)
                        Just don’t miss my birthday, okay?

                                 NOLAN
                        No no...Hey!  What if I have games 
                        delivered here and we can make it 
                        like an arcade party.  Wouldn’t 
                        that be cool?...Bring in Qwak?
                                  (off Alissa’s smile)
                        Right??  Qwak??
                                  (poking her)
                        Space Race??  You love Space Race.

                                 ALISSA
                        Breakout?

                                 NOLAN
                        Absolutely!  Tell your friends... 
                        I’ll bring games for all of ‘em.  

                                 ALISSA
                                  (smiling big now)
                        Okay.  It’ll be an arcade party.

           They hug and she gets out.

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DUSK

           A plane lifts off the tarmac.

           EXT. WARNER COMMUNICATIONS BUILDING - DAY

           The Warner Communications Building stands tall.  Yellow cabs 
           and cars are stuck in gridlock before it.

           INT. WARNER COMMUNICATIONS BUILDING - RECEPTION AREA - DAY

           Brass elevator doors open and two baggy-eyed partners-in-
           crime, Nolan and Moose, step out in their familiar NY suits, 
           carrying TRAVEL BAGS.  They are hopped up on coffee, 
           determined, and walk to the executive reception area where a 
           LADY RECEPTIONIST (60) sits.

                                 NOLAN
                        Hi, I’m Nolan Bushnell, president 
                        of Atari -- here for the budget 
                        meeting.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                                  (checking list)
                        Are they expecting you?
                                 NOLAN
                        Yes.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Okay.  Let me...hold on, sir.

           She jots his name down and walks down the hall.  A few yards 
           behind, Nolan follows.  Moose lags behind.  The receptionist 
           quietly KNOCKS on a door, then partially opens it and 
           whispers.  Through the crack, Nolan sees SEVERAL FAMILIAR 
           EXECUTIVES in their suits...and spots Manny amongst them.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (calling out)
                        Manny!  I’d like to come in please!

           Manny rubs his face in anguish.  Inside, at the head, is the 
           distinguished WARNER CEO STEVE ROSS (50).  He looks at Manny.  
           Ray is there, looking pale.  Mr. Ross awkwardly gestures to 
           the receptionist who then steps aside and motions for Nolan 
           to enter.  Nolan and Moose enter with their bags.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        So, whose idea was it to fire every 
                        guy we need to ensure the future of 
                        the company?

           The executives look extremely uncomfortable.   Mr. Ross 
           stands up, extends his hand and smiles cordially. 

                                 STEVE ROSS
                        Mr. Bushnell.  Steve Ross.  I’ve 
                        heard a lot of wonderful things.

           Nolan stumbles briefly, surprised by the Warner CEO’s 
           presence.  Nolan drops his bag and steps forward to shake Mr. 
           Ross’s hand. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Likewise, Mr. Ross.  And this is Al 
                        Alcorn.  Vice president of Atari. 

                                 STEVE ROSS
                        Mr. Alcorn.  Steve Ross. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Mr. Ross -- I don’t know if you’re 
                        aware or not but most of my 
                        engineers were fired without my 
                        knowledge.

                                 MANNY
                                  (calm, irritated)
                        He’s aware, Nolan.  
           Moose finds a seat in the back and slowly sits down.

                                 NOLAN
                        Well, um, with all due respect, 
                        sir...I don’t know if Manny has 
                        fully explained the extent to 
                        which...’cause it basically, that 
                        act...it essentially kills the 
                        chance of success after the VCS.  
                        You can’t fire these people.

                                 MANNY
                                  (calm, arrogant)
                        Steve.  Steve.  80 million’s been 
                        sunk into the VCS already.  He 
                        burned --

                             NOLAN
                                                               MANNY
           It’s not about the VCS.  
                                                  He burned through...

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        ...his entire year’s R&D budget in 
                        four months, so yes, I did a little 
                        shuffling of resources to stop a 
                        little of the bleeding.

                                 NOLAN
                        It’s not, these projects -- the 
                        VCS, Manny?  Bleeding??  Come on!

                                                               NOLAN
                             MANNY
           Right now?  Yeah.
                                                  These projects are all... 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ...gonna be very successful.  And, 
                        trust me --

                                 MANNY
                        ...coming from a man who has yet to 
                        turn a profit at Atari since he 
                        started the company.

                                 NOLAN
                        Okay.  That’s -- see...that’s -- 
                        what Manny is completely incapable 
                        of understanding is that the 
                        VCS...I’m sorry...it’s already a 
                        dinosaur, okay?

           Mr. Ross shifts uncomfortably hearing this, looks at Manny.  
           Nolan realizes maybe he shouldn’t have said that.
                                 MANNY
                                  (nervous laughing)
                        You’re telling the CEO of Warner...

                             NOLAN
           I’m not -- no, no...
                                                               MANNY
                                                  ...the man who authorized the 
                                                  shipment of...

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        ...400,000 of these goddamn things.

                                 NOLAN
                        ...I’m not, sir, I’m not saying 
                        people won’t be excited by it, I’m 
                        saying that in a couple of years -- 
                        people are gonna want the next 
                        thing and the other products we’re 
                        developing are the next thing... 
                        like, like, Mr. Ross, we’ve got a 
                        personal computer and Atari has the 
                        edge.  If you allow us to develop 
                        it properly...?  Sir, we can put a 
                        computer in every home in America! 

           Mr. Ross looks at everybody in the room.  They don’t quite 
           know what to make of this outlandish prediction.

                                 STEVE ROSS
                        Mr. Bushnell -- I’m confident we’re 
                        going to find a middle ground, 
                        okay?  You flying here shows 
                        tremendous commitment to Atari, and 
                        obviously that goes a long way in 
                        my book.

                                 NOLAN
                        Thank you, Mr. Ross.  Atari is my 
                        life, sir.

                                 STEVE ROSS
                        Of course it is, and don’t worry.  
                        I have no doubt that we’re going to 
                        find a solution here.

           Mr. Ross gets up and extends his hand, indicating Nolan’s 
           time is done.  Nolan gets up and shakes it.  Everyone watches 
           Nolan and Moose pick up their bags and then exit the room.  

           Mr. Ross nods to Manny that he’d like to talk to him alone.

           INT. WARNER COMMUNICATIONS BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

           Manny and Mr. Ross speak privately in the hall.
                                 MANNY
                                  (sotto voce)
                        Look, Atari has never shown a 
                        profit with him running it.  The 
                        kid is all over the map here -- 
                        video phones, computers, robots, 
                        restaurants.  I think for now we 
                        just focus on marketing the VCS -- 
                        that’s it...and personally...
                                  (conspiratorially)
                        ...we bump up the pay of his 
                        original guys, we buy some loyalty.  
                        If Nolan doesn’t step in line...

                                 STEVE ROSS
                        ...he’s out.

                                                                CUT TO BLACK.

           ESTABLISHING SHOTS:

           -LOW, ASHEN CLOUDS roll in over the Valley, blanketing the 
           Santa Cruz Mountain range.

           -In NOLAN’S BACKYARD, a layer of fallen LEAVES drift across 
           the neglected swimming pool.

           INT. ATARI ENGINEERING BLDG. - NOLAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Nolan moves aimlessly around his office, absently adjusting 
           objects.  As he speaks, he periodically walks to the door, 
           checks the hall.  Moose sits on the couch, his leg bouncing.

                                 NOLAN
                        I’ll compromise -- one guy on 
                        telecom, one on the computer...I 
                        mean, look -- it’s not gonna be a 
                        growth scenario but it’ll keep us 
                        breathing here at least.

           Nolan checks the hallway again.

                                 MOOSE
                        They’re still at the bar, Nolan.  
                        They’re gonna be there all day.

           Nolan stops pacing, looks at Moose.

                                 MOOSE (CONT’D)
                        There’s confusion.  Nobody knows 
                        what they’re supposed to be working 
                        on, so they’re not...
                                  (loud DRONING sound 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MOOSE (CONT’D)
                                   outside)
                        ...not motivated to...

           The sound grows to a RUMBLE that can’t be ignored.  Nolan and 
           Moose walk to the window, look out quizzically.  

           Wind whips around the courtyard behind the building.  Several 
           factory employees on their cigarette breaks are pelted by 
           swirling dirt.  Everyone squints up at the sky.  

           EXT. ATARI ENGINEERING BLDG. - DAY

           Nolan and Moose hurry outside.  More employees have gathered 
           now, shielding their eyes from the dust as a HELICOPTER 
           slowly descends onto a vacant FIELD behind the building.

           As the chopper lands, Nolan approaches, holding his hair 
           down.  The helicopter blades slow and Ray climbs out with a 
           team of THREE LACKEYS IN SUITS, all holding CLIPBOARDS.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (calling out)
                        Ray!

           Ray and the three guys walk towards Nolan...

                                 RAY
                        Nolan.

           ...then right past him, heading for the ENGINEERING BUILDING.  
           From the way the guys in suits ignore Nolan, it’s clear 
           they’ve been warned about him.  Nolan stands for a moment.  
           Moose catches up.  They share a look then follow Ray.

                                 NOLAN
                        Ray...Ray!  What is this?

                                 RAY
                        Changes, Nolan.

           Ray pauses at the building’s front door, points above it.

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        A security camera at the entry.

           Lackey #1 writes down information.

                                 NOLAN
                        Wait...no...what??  

                                 RAY
                        If you have a problem, talk to 
                        Manny.
                                                               NOLAN
                              RAY
                   (tapping wall)
           Employee ID card reader...
                                                  Talk to Manny?  Talk to 
                                                  Manny?

           Lackey #1 jots this down.  

                                 NOLAN
                        I’m talking to you, Ray.

           Ray steps aside with Nolan as the rest of the group enters 
           the building.

                                 RAY
                        Listen, I’ve been authorized to 
                        make changes here, and I’m not, you 
                        know, like I said, if you have a 
                        problem, talk to Manny.

           Ray quickly enters the building.  Nolan follows.  

           INT. ATARI ENGINEERING BUILDING - DAY

           It’s quiet, mostly empty.  Ray points to a door.

                                 RAY
                        There’s a hot tub in there that 
                        needs to be drained...

                         RAY (CONT’D)
                                                               NOLAN
           ...It’s a major liability.
                                                  No.  The hot tub’s staying.

           Lackey #2 writes down the note.  Nolan points to what he’s 
           writing.

                                 NOLAN
                        We’re not getting rid of the hot 
                        tub.

           Ray peeks into a specific ENGINEERING LAB.  It’s empty.

                                 RAY
                                  (to Moose, checking his 
                                   watch)
                        Where are the engineers?  It’s 
                        2:30.

                                 MOOSE
                                  (feigning ignorance)
                        The engineers?

                                 RAY
                        Can you please find them?  I’d like 
                        to have a meeting. 
                                 NOLAN
                        What kind of meeting?

                                 RAY
                        We’re outlining some new goals.

                                 NOLAN
                        What goals?

                                 RAY
                        Just please find the engineers.

           Ray continues down the hall with his guys. 

                                 NOLAN
                                  (sotto voce)
                        Look, we gotta talk to them.  Now.

           Nolan enters the bar.  Moose is right behind him.  Nolan 
           spots the six engineers.  He walks to them while glancing 
           around for Nancy.  She’s not around.  Four of the engineers 
           are at a table, drinking.  The other two play DARTS a few 
           feet away.

                                 NOLAN
                        Listen -- guys...guys...

           Nolan pulls up a chair.  Moose sits as well.  The guys 
           playing darts walk over and stand behind the other four.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Guys, guys, everything’s gonna be 
                        fine.  It’s all gonna be good, 
                        alright?  I’m gonna fix it, okay?  
                        Just...listen...Ray wants to meet 
                        with us...  

           “About what?”  “What’s...?”  “We still have jobs?”  

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ...they’re gonna start proposing 
                        things I’m not gonna be happy 
                        about, okay, but, look, we have the 
                        advantage.  They don’t know what 
                        they’re doing...and the way out -- 
                        we band together as a team, as a 
                        tight-knit, single-minded unit.

                        NOLAN (CONT’D)
                                                            ENGINEER #1
           ...They can’t...
                                                  ...but we...
                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ...do anything without us.

                                 ENGINEER #1
                        ...we want to keep our jobs, right?

                                 NOLAN
                        Guys, guys, Ray needs us.  You 
                        think he’s gonna -- 

           Sunlight flashes into the room and Nolan turns to see NANCY 
           walking in.  They make very brief eye contact and she looks 
           away, continues to the bar, puts on an apron.

           Nolan looks to his guys, back at Nancy, torn.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        He can’t -- he doesn’t know...we 
                        have to stick tog--

           Nolan sees Nancy walking over to a nearby table.

                                 NOLAN (CONT'D)
                                  (to engineers)
                        Hold on -- I’m sorry -- one 
                        second...

           He walks to her, gesturing to the guys that he’s coming back.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Nancy.  Nancy.

           She looks up, acknowledges him, then walks away.  He follows.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re angry and I’m, I’m sorry.  I 
                        want to explain everything now, but 
                        I’m in the middle of a crisis with 
                        my company and --

                                 NANCY
                        I didn’t ask you to come over here.

           She walks back to the bar, deals with a CUSTOMER.  Nolan 
           hesitantly returns to his group, speaks to them with a body 
           position indicating he’s going back to Nancy.  

                                 NOLAN
                                  (quickly, intensely)
                        Guys -- together, we have the 
                        power.  We call the shots, alright?  
                        Can I count on you guys that we’re 
                        sticking together?
           “Yeah.”  “Sure, Nolan.”  “I’m in.”

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Okay!  I’ll bring you another round 
                        here...just--
                                  (walking away, gesturing 
                                   a ‘one moment’ to them)
                        I’ll be--

           He goes back to Nancy.  Before he can speak --

                                 NANCY
                        Don’t bother.  I don’t care.  Go 
                        back to your business.

                                 NOLAN
                        Nancy.  Please.  I’m sorry.

                                 NANCY
                        Just...leave.  It was a mistake...

                                                               NOLAN
                             NANCY
           ...and honestly...
                                                  I should have --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        ...it’ not just about me -- the 
                        disrespect -- saying you were 
                        coming back in an hour --

                                 NOLAN
                        My secretary was supposed --

                                 NANCY
                        -- and having your secretary give 
                        me the news.  Or that I haven’t 
                        heard from you in almost a week.  
                        It’s also that you’re just a really 
                        shitty father.

           A beat.  An ashen-faced Nolan suddenly stands up.  He digs 
           his fingers into his hair, stunned.

           He immediately turns and runs out.

           EXT. LOS GATOS FERN BAR - DUSK

           We stay CLOSE on Nolan, sprinting as fast as he can, only the 
           sounds of his HEAVY BREATHING heard, running through the 
           parking lot and over to the Atari parking lot. 

           EXT. PAULA’S NEW HOUSE - DAY 

           Nolan’s Rolls Royce zooms down the street and skids to a halt 
           in front of the house.  No other cars are parked.  Nolan 
           jumps out, passing a poster board on the door that reads 
           “ALISSA’S ARCADE PARTY”. 

           INT. PAULA’S NEW HOUSE - DAY

           Nolan enters, out of breath, discovers the remnants of the 
           party -- half-hanging streamers, torn wrapping paper, low-
           hovering helium balloons.  In the b.g., Paula cleans up trash 
           while Britta watches TV.  Paula sees Nolan and approaches 
           him.  Nolan avoids eye contact.  Long beat of total silence.

                                 PAULA
                        35 kids, all asking your daughter, 
                        ‘Where are the video games you 
                        promised?’  
                                  (beat)
                        I warned her not to get her hopes 
                        up, but she listens to you.

           Nolan nods sheepishly.  He forces a weak smile for Britta, 
           then walks slowly down the hall to Alissa’s room, enters.

           Alissa sits on her bed with her back against the wall, 
           holding Chuck in her lap.  She looks up with red eyes, sees 
           Nolan, immediately looks away.

                                 NOLAN
                        I am so sorry, honey.

           She doesn’t respond, pets Chuck.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ...Chuck doing okay?

           She quickly puts Chuck into his cage then lies on her stomach 
           in bed, her face in her pillow.  Nolan slowly walks over, 
           sits on the bed.  Alissa contracts away from him.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m just so, so sorry about what 
                        I’ve done to you.  I messed 
                        everything up so badly.

           He places his hand on her back and she shakes him off.

                                 ALISSA
                                  (into pillow)
                        Don’t touch me!  Leave me alone!  
                        You’re a liar and I hate you.

                                 PAULA 
                                  (in doorway)
                        Just go.
           Nolan hesitantly reaches to touch Alissa again, then pulls 
           his hand back.  He sits for a moment listening to Alissa 
           sniffle, his own eyes dampening.

                                 NOLAN
                        I know you have no reason to 
                        believe me but I’m gonna make it up 
                        to you, okay?...I love you, okay?

                                 PAULA
                        Go, Nolan.

           He slowly stands and shuffles out in shame.

           EXT. PAULA’S NEW HOUSE - DAY

           Nolan gets into his Rolls, sits for a moment.  Then he starts 
           the car and violently reverses out of the driveway, tires 
           spinning.

           INT. ATARI ENGINEERING BUILDING - DUSK

           Nolan stalks down the hall, enters his office.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (to secretary)
                        Where’s Ray?

           Without waiting for a response, Nolan barrels on, approaches 
           a glass-walled CONFERENCE ROOM.  He halts to witness the 
           scene inside: Ray stands before the six engineers, Moose, and 
           the three guys in suits, all sitting around a long table.  
           Next to Ray is an easel displaying: ‘FUTURE VCS GAME TITLES’.  
           Moose sees Nolan outside the glass.  Moose subtly shakes his 
           head in a resigned fashion.  

           Nolan enters, clearly on edge.  Ray pauses the meeting.

                                 RAY
                        Nolan, we’ve been going over some 
                        of the goals that Warner has set 
                        out for us...

           While slowly sitting down, a sweating Nolan squints with 
           displeasure while reading the game titles: BASKETBALL, 
           FOOTBALL, HOME RUN, ROCK FIGHT, CANYON BOMBER, SHOPPING.

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        ...and these are the next six 
                        titles we’re going to be producing 
                        for the --

                                 NOLAN
                        What’s ‘Shopping’?
           Ray takes a breath, ready for a confrontation.

                                 RAY
                        As I’ve been telling your coworkers 
                        here, these titles have all been 
                        thoroughly market-tested to appeal 
                        to specific demographics.  Females 
                        responded well to ‘Shopping’.

                                 NOLAN
                        But what’s the game?

                                 RAY
                                  (patronizing)
                        Well, Warner’s come up with the 
                        titles.  It’s gonna be your job to 
                        come up with the games.  ‘Shopping’ 
                        is a vast arena from which you can 
                        draw inspiration.  Now as I was 
                        saying before, each of you will be 
                        assigned a title and you’ll have 3 
                        months to produce the game.  We’re 
                        estimating --

                                 NOLAN
                                  (nervously laughing)
                        No -- no.  First of all, you can’t 
                        make a good game in 3 months.  
                        That’s first of all... 

                                 RAY
                        Well, we’ll just have to --

                                 NOLAN
                        You can make a piece of shit, if 
                        that’s what you’re shooting for.

                                 RAY
                        Okay.  This isn’t going to be a 
                        debate.  We will make the best 
                        games we can in 3 months and we 
                        will stay on schedule.  Enough.

           Ray turns around to flip to the next page on his easel.

                                 NOLAN
                        When you say ‘we’, what exactly do 
                        you mean, Ray?  Was I somehow...

                                                                RAY
                        NOLAN (CONT’D)
           ...not aware of your 
           engineering background?
                                                  Look, you can be in these 
                                                  meetings, or...
                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cause it seems to me you don’t 
                        have a fucking clue what you’re...

                        NOLAN (CONT’D)
                                                                RAY
           ...talking about...
                                                  Alright, you need to leave.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        ...and none of us are going to 
                        sacrifice the quality of Atari’s 
                        games so that we can keep to some 
                        idiotic schedule.  None of us.

           Ray is practically vibrating with anger and embarrassment.  
           He pulls it together.

                                 RAY
                        Let’s get some air, Nolan.  Shall 
                        we?  Excuse us, please.

           Ray opens the door and gestures for Nolan to step out.  It’s 
           very uncomfortable.  Moose buries his head in his hands.  A 
           red-faced Nolan steps out, gesturing to the guys like he’ll 
           take care of this.  Ray follows him.

           EXT. ATARI ENGINEERING BUILDING - DUSK

           Door opens.  Nolan and Ray walk out.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (exiting the building)
                        I’m trying to help you, Ray.  I’m 
                        trying to help you do your job.

           Employees standing outside watch this with great discomfort.

                                 RAY
                                  (under his breath)
                        You talk to me away from the 
                        building.  

           Ray walks quickly around the side of the building, stepping 
           on the grass.  In the background, a putrid, mosquito-infested 
           drainage ditch buzzes and shimmers in the afternoon heat.

                                 NOLAN
                        ‘Cause we’ve been doing this for 
                        awhile, you know, and --

                                 RAY
                                  (suddenly turning to 
                                   face Nolan)
                        You are a child, Nolan.  A child.  
                         RAY (CONT’D)
                                                               NOLAN
           Stomping around here...
                                                  Right, because I...

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        ...so outraged that anything’s 
                        changed like you had nothing to do 
                        with this...

                                 NOLAN
                        ...because I actually care about 
                        the quality?

                                 RAY
                        Because this isn’t a hippie 
                        commune, Nolan.  Because it’s a 
                        place of business now.  And every 
                        employee has to do their job or 
                        they lose their job.  Every 
                        employee.

                                 NOLAN
                        You think you can run this place 
                        without me?  

                                 RAY
                        If I have to.

                                 NOLAN
                        You think you can run this place 
                        without any of us?  Because we act 
                        as a team, Ray, and if I go --

                                 RAY
                        If I have to, I will.  If I have 
                        to.  I’d rather not.  But anyone 
                        who refuses...

                         RAY (CONT’D)
           ...to do their job...
                                                               NOLAN
                                                  You need us, Ray.

                                 NOLAN
                        What’re you gonna tell Steve Ross?  
                        “Hey, I fired every single guy who 
                        knows how to...”

                                 RAY
                        Try me, Nolan.  Test it.  See how 
                        your friends feel about losing 
                        their $35,000 paychecks.  See if I 
                        can’t find guys to replace them.  
                        Roll the dice.

           A tense beat.  Only the buzz of insects.  Nolan laughs 
           nervously at the absurdity of his predicament.
                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        Atari, Nolan.

                                 NOLAN
                        What?

                                 RAY
                        You know what it means.

           Ray stares Nolan down for a moment, waiting for a response.  
           Nolan has none.  He stands there, considering his dwindling 
           options, as Ray walks back to the building.

           Nolan gazes out for a few beats, his eyes lingering on the 
           stagnant canal, the unthinkable endgame becoming a reality in 
           his mind.  He subtly wilts, takes a deep breath, plods back.

           INT. ATARI ENGINEERING BUILDING - DUSK

           Nolan walks slowly down the hall, stops outside the glass-
           walled conference room, looking at Moose and the engineers.

           Nolan enters.  He rubs his temples with this forefinger and 
           thumb.  Ray waits anxiously.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (still looking down)
                        I’m gonna go...I’m sorry, guys... 

           Everyone in the room, including Ray, is taken aback.  Nolan 
           smiles wistfully at his guys, exits.

           LONG SHOT of Nolan resignedly walking towards the fading 
           daylight at the building’s exit.  At the door, he looks back 
           one last time, then goes.

                                                               FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. WOODSIDE MANSION - DINING ROOM - DAY

           WIDE on Nolan, all alone, humbly collating papers on the 
           massive dining room table while wearing a white terry cloth 
           cabana set.  He tries to staple the papers, finds the stapler 
           empty.

           SEVERAL SHOTS of the former president of Atari starting to 
           rush around the house in search of staples.  He becomes 
           slightly frantic and nervously looks out a window.

           NOLAN’S POV: Moose, the six engineers, and all their 
           GIRLFRIENDS partying in the pool and hot tub.
           Nolan rummages through drawers, doesn’t find staples, and 
           just shoves the papers into FOLDERS.  He quickly checks a 
           mirror, adjusts his lapel.

           EXT. WOODSIDE MANSION - POOL - DAY

           He steps out of the house with the folders, all smiles now.

                                 NOLAN
                        Hey!

           The engineers and their girlfriends turn and shout greetings 
           back to him.  “There he is!”  “Looking good, man!”

           LATER.  Nolan sits at a table with Moose and the engineers.  
           In the b.g., the women frolic drunkenly in the pool.  There’s 
           an uneasy dynamic at the table.  The guys glance nervously at 
           Nolan’s folders.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I gotta say, in the end, I 
                        think it was the best thing that’s 
                        ever happened to me.

           Anxiously: “Right on, Nolan”  “Sure.”  “...for the best.”

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        It just feels so good to be free.  
                        And what I’ve got here, guys...
                                  (taps folders)
                        ...is an escape plan for all of 
                        you, too.

           The engineers subtly squirm.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Alright, check it out: in the game 
                        of Go, there is only --

                                 GIRLFRIEND #1
                        Watch this!

           The girl tries to do a handstand on the bottom of the pool.  
           In her inebriated state, her exposed legs flop over.  The 
           engineers clap and holler, thrilled by the interruption.

           “Very impressive!”  “Try it again!”

           Nolan waits a beat for the guys to settle.  Then, smiling...

                                 NOLAN
                        In Go, there’s only one move that 
                        can overtake an Atari, and it’s 
                        called...Sente.
           Nolan dramatically spreads the folders across the table like 
           a hand of cards.  On their covers: “Sente Technologies”.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        The player who has ‘sente’ controls 
                        the game.  And that’s exactly what 
                        we’re gonna do.  But I don’t wanna 
                        just beat ‘em -- I wanna punish 
                        ‘em, you understand?  Sente is 
                        gonna be what Atari was supposed to 
                        be.  We’ll do it right this time.  
                        And we’ll do it together...

           The guys are politely enthusiastic, nodding and feigning 
           interest.  A few of the engineers glance towards the pool, 
           hoping for another exhibition.  The others look to Moose.

                                 MOOSE
                        Ray told us there was a non-compete 
                        agreement...in your contract?  Is 
                        that...I mean, is that gonna 
                        conflict...or...have you...?

           Nolan stares at Moose, not expecting to hear that.  He 
           recovers with a nervous, pathetic laugh.

                                 NOLAN
                        Wait, is that...?  Guys, forget 
                        about it.  I’ll call my lawyer, 
                        work out a deal.  Let me worry 
                        about that.  No no, Sente is gonna 
                        happen.  It is definitely gonna 
                        happen.  

           One of the engineers looks guiltily at his cohorts.

                                 ENGINEER #2
                        Cool.  So...how far along are you 
                        on the, uh, the plan, you know, the 
                        funding?

                                 NOLAN
                        I’ve already -- it looks like -- is 
                        that what this is about?  Money?  
                        Guys, this is me here --

           Right then, an engineer is bonked in the head by a wet beach 
           ball.  Water sprays on some of Nolan’s folders.  He wipes 
           them with his shirt.  The provoked engineer uses the 
           opportunity to get up and jump in the pool to exact revenge.

           Other engineers stand and offer Nolan perfunctory 
           acknowledgments.  “It’s interesting, man.”  “We should keep 
           talking about it.”  They all head over to the pool.
           Nolan looks bewildered.  Moose waits a while before speaking.

                                 MOOSE
                        You should know...Ray offered us 
                        raises.  Ten grand extra a year.

           A few women, now topless, come flying down the hill on a 120 
           foot water slide, splashing into the pool.  Nolan watches 
           helplessly as the party he created goes on without him.

           EXT. WOODSIDE MANSION - DRIVEWAY - LATER

           Nolan stands in the driveway waving weakly as his old team 
           drives off in their cars -- Porsches, Ferraris, Aston 
           Martins.  Moose hasn’t left, puts a hand on Nolan’s shoulder.

                                 MOOSE
                        We’re taking off.

           Moose gestures to the ATARI RECEPTIONIST who waits next to 
           his ‘65 Shelby AC Cobra.  There’s an awkward moment between 
           Nolan and Moose.

                                 MOOSE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about...
                                  (gestures to pool)

           Nolan gives a gracious wave -- Don’t worry about it.

                                 MOOSE (CONT’D)
                        Ya know I wish I was more like you, 
                        Nolan...to move on and just -- I 
                        don’t know...but, like...you know 
                        me, Nolan.  Right?  I...
                                  (almost embarrassed)
                        I like stability...and...

                                 NOLAN
                        I get it.  It’s not for you.  
                        Things are good for you right now.
                                  (looks over at the girl 
                                   and the car)
                        Right?

                                 MOOSE
                                  (smiling shyly)
                        Yeah. 

                                 NOLAN
                        I just want you to be happy.  

           Nolan reaches to shake Moose’s hand.  Instead, Moose gives 
           Nolan a tight hug.  Nolan hugs him back.    
                                 MOOSE
                        You gonna be alright?

                                 NOLAN
                                  (ending the hug)
                        Get outta here.  I’ll be fine.  
                        I’ll figure it out.

                                 MOOSE
                        Of course you will.  You always do.

           Moose pats him affectionately on the shoulder and walks back 
           to his car.  He and the receptionist get inside.  Moose 
           salutes Nolan then drives away. 

           Alone, Nolan stands in front of his mansion and watches the 
           car disappear down the road.

           INT. WOODSIDE MANSION - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           CLOSE on typed words on paper: “EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, entered 
           into and effective as of between Warner Communications...”  
           The pages flip by and we reveal...

           Nolan sitting on the couch, digging through the document.  He 
           stops, reads a page...then flings the contract away and falls 
           back onto the couch.  He’s totally still for a few beats.  

           A WIDE SHOT reveals that the enormous room is basically empty 
           besides the couch and a 6-foot projection TV.  Nolan leans 
           over and picks up the phone off the floor. Dials. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Hi.  Is, um -- hi...how are you?... 
                        I’m okay...Is Alissa around?...I’d 
                        love to talk to her if...still?  
                        Okay...well, when she’s, you know, 
                        when she’s ready, I’d love to talk 
                        to her, so...okay.  Thanks...

           He hangs up...lies back, depressed, dials again...waits, 
           fidgety.  Through the receiver, we hear Nancy’s voice and the 
           BEEP of an answering machine.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Hi.  It's Nolan.  I’d love to be 
                        able to...to talk to you...and, um, 
                        you know -- explain some things --
                                  (long beat, not knowing 
                                   what to say)

           After a while, he just hangs up slowly.  The house is dead 
           silent. 
           EXT. WOODSIDE MANSION - POOL - NIGHT

           In total darkness, we see a LIT MATCH make contact with the 
           BURNING ASHES of a pipe.  Nolan lies back on a chaise lounge, 
           smoking, gazing into the infinity of space.

           INT. WOODSIDE MANSION - GAME ROOM - NIGHT

           WIDE ANGLE on a completely dark game room.  At the far end, 
           we see Nolan’s silhouette against a flickering glow, the only 
           light in this vast room of a dozen unplugged arcade games.  

           CLOSE on Nolan’s face.  In his eyes, we see the reflection of 
           the hypnotic NIGHT DRIVER game -- a first-person view 
           careening down a pitch-black road with only the roadside 
           reflectors marking the twisting path ahead.

           INT. WOODSIDE MANSION - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Nolan is sprawled on the couch in a bathrobe with a two-week-
           old beard and matted, greasy hair.  Food wrappers, beer cans, 
           and random trash are piled on the floor before him.

           He’s motionless except for the occasional blink and thumb-
           click of the remote.  He stops on a channel.  On the 6-foot 
           TV, RONALD REAGAN delivers a speech promising the coming of a 
           new era.

                                 RONALD REAGAN
                        ...the time has come...

           The phone RINGS.  Nolan doesn’t move to pick it up.

                                 RONALD REAGAN (CONT'D)
                        ...to start acting to bring about 
                        the great conservative majority 
                        party we know is waiting to be 
                        created...

           As Reagan continues, we barely hear the BEEP of Nolan’s 
           answering machine pick up, and then...a WEAK, LITTLE VOICE.  
           Nolan lowers the TV volume slightly.

                                 ALISSA (ON MACHINE)
                                  (crying)
                        ...wanted to talk to you...

           Nolan drops to the floor to scramble for the phone amongst 
           his trash.  He hits it, picks it up.

                                 NOLAN
                        Heeey.  What’s wrong??  
                                  (his expression shifting 
                                   to concern)
                                 (MORE)
                                 NOLAN (CONT'D)
                        ...Oh no -- I’m...I’m sorry. 
                                  (listening)
                        I’m so sorry, honey.  When did that 
                        -- of course I can...you want me to 
                        come over?  

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           Under a tree, Nolan crouches with an arm around Alissa while 
           she holds onto him tightly, sniffling into his shoulder.  His 
           hands are dirty.  Before them, a shoebox rests in a freshly 
           dug hole.

                                 NOLAN
                        You want to say anything before...?

           She turns and looks at the box, can’t do it, shakes her head.  
           She looks to Nolan to say something.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Okay...um...
                                  (beat)
                        I don’t think that anyone has ever 
                        loved a pet more than Alissa loved 
                        you.  She’s told me how special you 
                        were to her, and...How old was he?

           Alissa holds up six fingers.

                                 NOLAN (CONT'D)
                                  (quiet)
                        ...Six years...
                                  (contemplates)
                        I regret that I let those years 
                        slip by without being part of your 
                        life...and I can’t get them 
                        back...but you will not be 
                        forgotten.  

           Nolan gently pushes the dirt over the box.  Alissa helps him, 
           still clinging to him with her other arm.

           EXT. PARK - PARKING LOT - DAY

           They stroll back to Nolan’s car.  Nolan opens the door for 
           her, then gets into the driver’s seat, takes out his keys.

                                 NOLAN
                        I’d like to take you out to dinner 
                        tonight -- you and Britta...if 
                        you’re not, you know, if you’re not 
                        busy.
                                 ALISSA
                        Where’s Nancy?  

                                 NOLAN
                        Nancy?  

                                 ALISSA
                        You should tell her to come with 
                        us.

                                 NOLAN
                        Oh, yeah, I don’t, I don’t think 
                        she wants to talk to me.

                                 ALISSA
                        Why, because she didn’t get to go 
                        to Disneyland?

                                 NOLAN
                        Well, that’s part of it, and she 
                        also wasn’t too happy with the way 
                        I let you guys down.

                                 ALISSA
                        Well she’s not gonna be mad if I 
                        asked her to come.

           Nolan looks at her.

                                 ALISSA (CONT’D)
                        Dad -- just call her.  Trust me.

           Nolan smiles at her, then hesitantly picks up the phone.

                                 NOLAN
                        Okay.  Fine.  
                                  (he dials, waits for the 
                                   BEEP, looks at Alissa)
                        Hi Nancy...it’s Nolan...I’m...I’m 
                        here with Alissa under her 
                        surveillance.  She asked to see 
                        you...and...of course, you know, 
                        I’d...I’d like to see you, 
                        too...and, so-- 
                                  (putting his hand on 
                                   Alissa’s hand)
                        ...we were thinking of going out to 
                        dinner tonight and we wanted to 
                        know--
                                  (Nancy picks up)
                        ...heeey -- how are you?  I’m -- 
                        well, no, I’m...what?  She’s -- 
                        yeah, she’s right here.  Okay.
           With a curious smile, Nolan gives the phone to Alissa.

                                 ALISSA
                        Hello?  Hi.  I’m good.  We... 
                        yeah...we were going to dinner and 
                        we wanted to know if you wanted to 
                        come with us...
                                  (listening for a few 
                                   beats, smiling)
                        Okay...
                                  (to Nolan)
                        She’s only going to come with us 
                        because I asked her.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (smiling)
                        Okay.  Fine.  

                                 ALISSA
                                  (on phone)
                        I don’t know.  Do you like pizza?

           INT. NEIGHBORHOOD PIZZA PLACE - NIGHT

           A typical family dive.  Wooden booths, filthy carpet, cracked 
           plastic pitchers of Coke.  A group of RAMBUNCTIOUS LITTLE 
           LEAGUE PLAYERS run around the room while their MOTHERS yell.

           Nolan, Nancy, Alissa, and Britta sit in one of the booths.  
           Nolan sits next to Nancy.  They all eat pepperoni pizza, 
           except for Britta, who has her arms crossed.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (while picking 
                                   pepperonis off a slice)
                        ...I guess the upside here is that 
                        I won’t have any secrets, right?

                                 ALISSA
                                  (to Nancy)
                        ‘Alissa, I need your room to build 
                        my game.  Let’s make a deal.’

           Nancy laughs and shakes her head at Nolan.

                                 NOLAN
                        I was hoping you’d forget this 
                        stuff by now.
                                  (gives slice to Britta)
                        Here you go.  Not a pepperoni to be 
                        found, okay?

           Britta inspects the slice.  
                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Did I miss anything?

                                 ALISSA
                        Here’s, okay -- this is what he --

                        ALISSA (CONT’D)
           -- doesn’t know -- 
                                                               BRITTA
                                                     (taking a bite)
                                                  Thanks, Daddy.

                                 ALISSA (CONT’D)
                        -- the deal, I didn’t really care 
                        about my room.  I just wanted a 
                        pet.

                                 NOLAN
                        Nicely played.

                                 NANCY
                        Sounds like you had a really good 
                        friend there, Alissa.

                                 ALISSA
                        Well, life, you know...it’s hard.

           Nolan takes Alissa’s hand to comfort her.  Nancy witnesses 
           this quiet gesture.  Out of the corner of his eye, Nolan sees 
           Nancy smiling at him.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (touching his face)
                        ...do I have...is there cheese?

           Nancy shakes her head, still smiling at him.  The two of them 
           gaze at each other for a beat, then they’re distracted by the 
           sound of a kid singing.

           A couple Little Leaguers have hopped up onto a raised 
           platform and they’re using it as a stage.  An aggravated mom 
           hurries over, pulls her kid down.  The kid leaves the stage 
           with mock surprise, as if he’s being yanked off with a hook.

           Britta and Alissa laugh.  Nolan looks at his daughters and 
           Nancy.  He takes a beat to enjoy the warmth of the moment.

           With that feeling, Nolan turns and glances around the 
           restaurant.  Near the door, a group of kids SMACK on the 
           glass of a CLAW PRIZE MACHINE...other kids bang knives and 
           forks on their table, chanting -- “We want food!”

           We MOVE IN SLOWLY on Nolan’s face.  The sound begins to drop 
           out as his eyes dart back and forth, watching all these kids 
           desperately trying to pass the time before the pizza arrives.
           Nolan’s eyes stop.

           EXT. LOS GATOS ATARI FACTORY - DAY

           With a determined expression, Nolan gets out of his car 
           holding a MANILA ENVELOPE and walks with purpose through the 
           Atari parking lot.  

           INT. ATARI ENGINEERING BUILDING - RECEPTION AREA - DAY

           A HALF DOZEN YOUNG MEN IN SUITS with briefcases wait in the 
           reception area.  Nolan storms in, walks past a DOWDY 
           RECEPTIONIST and is stopped by a SECURITY DOOR which he tries 
           to open with no luck.

                                 NOLAN
                        I need to see Ray.

                                 DOWDY RECEPTIONIST
                        Um, excuse me, is Mr. Kassar 
                        expecting you?

                                 NOLAN
                        It’s Nolan.

                                 DOWDY RECEPTIONIST
                                  (sing-songy, trying to 
                                   get a last name)
                        Nolan...?

                                 NOLAN
                                  (impatiently handing her 
                                   folder)
                        Here.  Just give this to him.  
                        He’ll see me.  

           Nolan plops down in a seat amongst the GQ poster boys.  Upon 
           seeing a sign that reads ‘NO SMOKING’, he takes out his PIPE 
           and lights up.  Flustered by this rebel, the dowdy 
           receptionist hastily uses her MAGNETIC ID CARD to open the 
           security door, and walks with Nolan’s envelope down the hall.  

           INT. ATARI ENGINEERING BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

           The receptionist walks past rows of NEW CUBICLES.  It’s like 
           a morgue in here.  Everyone is wearing SUITS and communicates 
           in a hushed tone.  The receptionist KNOCKS softly on Ray’s 
           office door.  Ray looks up from his desk.

                                 DOWDY RECEPTIONIST
                        Sir?  I’m sorry to bother you but a 
                        man named ‘Nolan’ wanted me to give 
                        this to you...
           A concerned-looking Ray stands up, takes the envelope, peeks 
           down the hall.

                                 RAY
                        He’s...here?  In the building?

                                 DOWDY RECEPTIONIST
                        Yes.  And he’s smoking.

           The receptionist stands with her arms crossed.  Ray opens the 
           envelope.

           INT. ATARI ENGINEERING BUILDING - RECEPTION AREA - DAY

           Puffing repeatedly on his pipe, Nolan sits there with no 
           expression.  The young suits around him shift uncomfortably 
           from the smoke.

           INT. ATARI ENGINEERING BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY

           Ray and a FEW SUITED LAWYERS huddle together in an office, 
           speaking conspiratorially about the situation.

                                 LAWYER #1
                                  (looking at the papers)
                        He wants this restaurant idea??

                        LAWYER #2
                                                             LAWYER #3
           He wants what??
                                                  Guy’s losing his mind.     

           INT. ENGINEERING BUILDING - RECEPTION AREA - DAY

           While waiting, Nolan spots Buddhism Guy enter the building, 
           now completely bald and wearing an orange Tibetan robe.  
           Buddhism Guy walks to the receptionist.  Nolan watches with 
           wry amusement.

                                 BUDDHISM GUY
                                  (in businesslike tone)
                        Hi.  I used to work here and I 
                        still haven’t gotten --
                                  (surprised to see Nolan)
                        Mr. Bushnell!  

           With the pipe clenched between his teeth, Nolan offers a 
           cursory salute.  Buddhism Guy interprets that as an 
           invitation to walk over and sit right next to him. 

                                 BUDDHISM GUY (CONT’D)

                        have no idea, man.  None.  I want 
                        you to know you’ve inspired me.  
                        I’m starting my own company, and

                        we’re gonna make computers.  We’re 
                        looking for investors.  You 
                        interested?

                                 NOLAN
                        Got this 7-year non-compete thing 
                        with these jerk-offs, so...

                                 BUDDHISM GUY
                        Jesus.  Wow.  That sucks.  
                                  (gives him card)
                        Well here’s my card, man.  Call me 
                        anytime, alright?

           Nolan takes the card.  For the first time we see Buddhist 
           Guy’s name: “STEVE JOBS”.  Nolan looks at it.

                                 NOLAN
                                  (nonchalant)
                        Cool.  Well -- carry the torch, Mr. 
                        Jobs.

           As Nolan and Steve shake hands, the phone rings.  The 
           receptionist picks it up.  

                                 DOWDY RECEPTIONIST
                        Mr. Bushnell, he’s ready for you.  

           INT. ATARI BUILDING - KASSAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           It’s Nolan’s old office, but now sterile and virtually empty 
           except for expensive furniture.  

           Seated before Ray, Nolan looks like a lowlife bad-ass as he 
           stares emotionless at the new president of Atari, enveloped 
           in a cloud of pipe smoke.  Kassar pretends to read the 
           document again.

                                 KASSAR
                                  (nervous laugh)
                        Nolan.  Nolan.  We’re, um...we’re -- 
                        yeah, we’re gonna let you have your 
                        carnival-restaurant, okay?  But can 
                        I-- can I give you some advice...?

           Nolan raises his eyebrows subtly.

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        Before you lose your shirt on this 
                        thing, do yourself a favor, will 
                        ya?  Do your homework.  Market 
                        analysis.  Sales projections.  
                        Consumer testing.  Don’t just jump

                        into something simply because you 
                        think it’s “cool”.

           Nolan just stares at Kassar.  Kassar looks back at Nolan.  A 
           stalemate until Kassar breaks the awkwardness and signs the 
           document, dropping it in front of Nolan.

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                                  (sympathetically)
                        Well.  Good luck to you.

                                                                      CUT TO:

           TWO SPOTLIGHTS swirl around a RED VELVET CURTAIN.   

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                                  (overly excited)
                        And now...drumroll...please...

           CUE DRUMROLL.  

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, it’s Alissa’s 
                        10th birthday, so put your hands 
                        together for everybody’s favorite 
                        party animal!  Chuck...

           The RED CURTAINS part swiftly.  

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...E...Cheese!

           A derby-wearing RAT stands center stage, holding a mic, 
           singing the Beatles’ “Birthday”, backed by his ANIMATRONIC 
           ROCK BAND of a hillbilly hound, a big-moustachioed Italian 
           guy, and a purple monster.

           “You say it’s your birthday...It’s my birthday, too, yeah!”

           We PULL BACK to see ALISSA with 30 of her friends.  They’re 
           celebrating: eating pizza, dancing in their seats, boys 
           tapping on girls and running away, others mesmerized by the 
           band.  Alissa laughs hysterically at a hammy boy who pulls up 
           his red sweatpants to his chin and swings his hips around.  

           The place is packed with parents and their kids.  In the b.g. 
           we see an indoor carnival: kids playing video games, going on 
           rides, redeeming tickets at a prize booth.

           Sitting in the middle of the celebration, we find

           NOLAN,
           the quiet center, the brains behind it all, surveying his 
           latest vision with a peaceful grin.  NANCY sits next to him, 
           holding their INFANT SON.  BRITTA sits on the other side of 
           Nancy, clapping the baby’s hands to the beat. 

           We MOVE IN on Nolan’s face, now lost in thought...

           ...dreaming of the next...big...thing.

                                                                CUT TO BLACK.

           “Birthday” continues as the EPILOGUE FADES IN:

           “Under Ray’s leadership, Atari stayed exclusively with the 
           VCS, abandoning development of nearly all new products.  When 
           Space Invaders was released on the VCS, the console became a 
           worldwide phenomenon.  In 1982, Atari accounted for 70% of 
           Warner’s income and controlled 80% of the video game 
           business.”

           “By the next year, exactly as Nolan predicted, consumers 
           wearied of the outdated system and the company hit a wall.  
           Atari lost $536 million in less than a year.  6 million VCS 
           cartridges were buried in a New Mexico landfill, and the 
           company dropped from 10,000 employees to 200.”

           “Amidst the devastation, 23 minutes before Warner announced 
           their losses, Ray Kassar sold 5,000 shares of his Warner 
           stock.  By the next day, the stock dropped 33%.  Kassar was 
           charged with insider trading and he resigned his post as 
           CEO.”

           “In 1983, as a result of Warner’s losses, the entire video 
           game industry crashed, and Warner sold off what was left of 
           Atari.  This left the door wide open for the Japanese to 
           enter the market and dominate from that point forward.”

           “Since the huge success of Chuck E. Cheese, Nolan has been 
           responsible for the development of automobile navigation 
           systems, high-definition monitors, and online shopping, and 
           this year, with their 6 children by their side, he and his 
           wife Nancy celebrate their 30-year anniversary.”
