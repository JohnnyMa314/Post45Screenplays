           EXT. WASHINGTON DC (ABOVE) - NIGHT

           WE MOVE over America’s Capitol.  It most definitely “Tis 
           the Season”.  CHRISTMAS LIGHTS are everywhere.  Tinsel 
           and decorations gleam--monuments are bathed in green and 
           red flood lights.  

           Sidewalks are crowded with PEDESTRIANS--”Christmas Sale” 
           bags in hand.  Smiles abound.  Goodwill easy to come by.  
           Unless you’re trying to drive in this furball.  The 
           streets are crowded.  Cars as far as the eye can see--one 
           of them is a piece of shit 1979 Bonneville.  

           GRAPHIC: DECEMBER 26th, 2011. 6:58 P.M. EST.

           And right about now, it has half the cops in DC on its 
           tail.

           EXT. STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           TRACKING WITH BONNEVILLE: It bounces over a curb--cruises 
           up a sidewalk.  Mailboxes.  Cafe tables.  HORN HONKING 
           and plowing over everything in its way...

           EXT. CAFE - NIGHT

           An OLD LADY gives the BLOWN BULB on a strand of Christmas 
           lights over the awning the skunk eye.

                                      OLD LADY
                        Abner!  Abner..!  Hurry up.  It’s 
                        cold out here.

           ABNER, the long-suffering husband comes out--ladder in 
           hand. He squares the SANTA HAT on his head--climbs up.

                                      OLD LADY (CONT’D)
                        That bulb ain’t gonna change 
                        itself.  What’s taking so long?  
                        Are you doing it right?  I’m going 
                        to catch my death waiting on you.  
                        Is that what you want?

                                      ABNER
                        Dear Santa...

                                      OLD LADY
                        What?  What did you say?
                              (BEAT)
                        What is that racket..?

           VROOM!  The Bonneville roars up the street, right by that 
           cantankerous old hussy, and nails the ladder--an UNGODLY 
           melody of SIRENS in pursuit.  In a blink, they’re gone.

           So is Abner.
                                      OLD LADY
                        Abner!  

           INT. BONNEVILLE - CONTINUOUS

           THUMP--Abner lands on the hood.  He’s staring directly 
           into the crazy eyes of the guy behind the wheel--JAMES 
           SMITH.  

           He’s a man who just looks like he’s had 2,555 bad days in 
           a row.  A JAGGED SCAR runs from his forehead, over an 
           eye, down the cheek, and disappears into his shirt--like 
           something you’d get from trying to french kiss a 
           Wolverine...successfully.  A large BACK PACK lays next to 
           him on the seat, next to that, a FUTURISTIC ASSAULT 
           RIFLE.  

           Riding shotgun is a pretty girl trying really hard to not 
           freak out--RILEY HOLLAND.  She has no scars.  But, she 
           does have a TINY CAMCORDER.

           She records everything.

                                      RILEY
                        Smith...there’s a guy on the 
                        windshield.

           Santa hat blowing in the wind, Abner SCREAMS his head off 
           like a freaked out suction cup Garfield.

                                      SMITH
                        I wish he’d stop doing that.

           He does it again.   

                                      RILEY
                        Shouldn’t you do something about 
                        this?

           Smith flips on the wipers.

                                      RILEY (CONT’D)
                        Something else...

           Pointing the Assault Rifle at Abner’s face through the 
           windshield...

                                      SMITH
                        Do you mind?

           Abner climbs onto the roof as Smith glances at his watch:  
           A TIMER COUNTS DOWN: 01:02:22.

                                      RILEY
                        Gonna be close, isn’t it?
                                      SMITH
                        Every time.

           A SPOTTER watches the car chase below--The White House 
           visible in the distance.

                                      SPOTTER

                        He might be headed for the White 
                        House...

           INT. BONNEVILLE - CONTINUOUS

           Riley consults a “cartoon” tourist map, as Abner screams.

                                      ABNER (O.C.)
                        Oh my God!  

                                      SMITH
                        This the right street?

                                      RILEY
                        Uh...

                                      ABNER (O.C.)
                        I don’t wanna die..!

           Smith pounds on the roof.

                                      SMITH
                        Knock it off!
                              (to Riley)
                        Tonight, Riley...

                        It’s a fast food tourist map.  If 
                        you’re in the mood for McMuffin-y 
                        goodness, we’re golden.  But it 
                        doesn’t say back door to the White 
                        House “This Way”.  

           A Police Car careens out of a side street just ahead--
           Smith sheers the front bumper off with the tank of a 
           Bonneville.

                        Looks like he’s aiming for 
                        President Park...

           EXT. PRESIDENT PARK - NIGHT

           Secret Service GUARDS swarm the lush grass of President 
           Park--SWAT ready and manning reinforced barricades.

           Tourists snap photos--this kind of shit doesn’t happen 
           back in Spokane.  DC METRO COPS scream at them to go be 
           somewhere else.

           INT. BONNEVILLE - NIGHT

           Smith rockets towards the road block at President Park--
           dozens of rifles pointed in his direction.

                                      SMITH
                        On the floor board.  Hang on.

                                      RILEY
                        You’re not gonna...

           Smith stomps the gas.

                                      RILEY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, crap.  You’re gonna.

           The first bullet cracks the windshield.  It has friends.

           ON ROOF:

           Abner goes bug-eyed, staring down 100 gun barrels.

                                      ABNER
                        Aw, nuts...

           He let’s go and sails like one of Santa’s reindeer into 
           the night.

           EXT. PRESIDENT PARK - CONTINUOUS

           The guns open up on the Bonneville.  About now, it’s 
           obvious that big assed hunk of Detroit was chosen for 
           this moment.  Engine steaming, tires flattened, the 
           Bonneville SLAMS into the police cruisers.

           They part like the Red Sea.

           INT. BONNEVILLE - CONTINUOUS

           Smith lays in the seat, to the tune of Riley’s screams.  
           Glass showers.  Bullets pound Morse Code into the car.

           Still going...
           EXT. PRESIDENT PARK - CONTINUOUS

           The weight and momentum of the charging Bonneville, 
           combined with that of the Cruisers, snaps the concrete 
           drive barriers.  The shot to shit car lumbers across the 
           perfectly manicured grounds, fishtailing towards the 
           White House two blocks away.

           Until, out of nowhere, a black SUV nails it squarely at 
           the rear axle.  The Bonneville spins violently on the 
           grass--tireless rims dig in.  It flips.

           INT. BONNEVILLE - CONTINUOUS

           Hands drag Smith and Riley out before the car has even 
           stopped moving.

           EXT. BONNEVILLE - CONTINUOUS

           Tactical Boots step on their necks.

                                      SMITH
                        The trunk...

                        Look in the trunk.

                        I want a perimeter five blocks 
                        out.  There might be others.

                                      RILEY
                        Open the damned trunk, Barney..!

           Guards stop cold, eyeing the trunk of the destroyed 
           Bonneville for a BEAT.

           As he and Riley are dragged away...

                                      SMITH
                        Just open it!  Just look inside...
           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Pissed and bleeding, Smith sits in a chair in a painfully 
           bright room.  ARMED GUARDS stand post inside the door, as 
           the cold eyes of Marine COLONEL “BO” BODETTE stare into 
           Smith’s soul and out the other side.  

           Bodette sets Smith’s futuristic assault rifle on the 
           table--scarred and scratched, this thing has been around.  
           Next to it, Smith’s back pack and six mags of ammo.

                                      COLONEL BODETTE
                        We’re gonna play a little game, 
                        Son.  I’m gonna ask questions.  If 
                        your answers fill me with an 
                        overwhelming compulsion to yell 
                        bullshit in an unbelieving 
                        fashion, I’m gonna stomp you in 
                        places you don’t want to be 
                        stomped.  Are we clear?

                                      SMITH
                        Tell you anything you wanna 
                        know...after you look in the 
                        trunk.

                                      COLONEL BODETTE
                        That gun set off radiological 
                        sensors all over town.  But it 
                        ain’t the low level Alpha 
                        radiation emitted from this weapon 
                        that has got me buffaloed.  No, 
                        it’s how you came across such a 
                        very classified, depleted uranium 
                        round firing, assault weapon 
                        prototype.  This is the XM-97, 
                        Mark One, Mod One.  And, there’s 
                        only one of these in the world.  

                                      SMITH
                        Layin’ all over the ground where I 
                        come from.  And, any minute now, 
                        you’re gonna experience a whole 
                        new level of “Oh Shit”.  Stop.  
                        Wasting. Time.

           Bodette shakes a DEVICE twice the size of a BLACKBERRY at 
           Smith--it looks old and is peppered with buttons 
           inscribed with foreign characters.

           A BOMB ROBOT eases towards the rear of the Bonneville, 
           its arm slowly extending towards the trunk.  A block 
           away, a blast proof EOD truck idles.

           INT. EOD TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Two EOD COPS watch a small Black & White monitor--the

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Colonel Bodette steps out of the Interrogation Room--a 
           POLICE LIEUTENANT waiting for him.  Pale as a ghost, the 
           Police Lt. gives Bodette a folder--he peruses.

                        And?

                                      POLICE LT.
                        And, Colonel, the son of bitch is 
                        still there.

           EXT. PRESIDENT PARK - NIGHT

           The Bomb Robot’s arm grasps the edge of the warped trunk 
           lid.

           INT. EOD TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           EOD Cop #1 hesitates, his eyes on the monitors.

           EXT. PRESIDENT PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Slowly, inch by creeping inch, the Bomb Robot lifts the 
           trunk lid...

           INT. OVAL OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

           PRESIDENT MALLOY, fifty years of political animal in a 
           suit, sits behind his desk sipping scotch.  Dark circles 
           under his eyes.  This is a SAD, SAD MAN.    

           SECRETARY OF DEFENSE KRONAU, a man who has the perpetual 
           look of a viper ready to strike, strolls in.  He takes in 
           Malloy and his drink--pours himself one.

                                      KRONAU
                        No salvation at the bottom of this 
                        bottle, Mr. President.  I should 
                        know.  

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        How did you get through it?  How 
                        does anybody get through this?

           Kronau drains his glass in one pass.

                                      KRONAU
                        Who says I have?  

           He pours another and has a seat opposite Malloy.

                                      KRONAU (CONT’D)
                        Twelve years and every morning I 
                        still expect to wake up next to 
                        her.  

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Thanks for coming to their 
                        funeral.    

                                      KRONAU
                        Don’t.  I was just there for the 
                        photo op.

           AGENT DAWES, a walking recruitment poster, and the 
           President’s personal Agent, enters--pale as a ghost.

                                      AGENT DAWES
                        Mr. President...there’s something 
                        you have to see.
           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #2 - NIGHT

           In a room similar to Smith’s, Riley waits--TWO GUARDS as 
           well.  She eyes their guns.

                                      RILEY
                        I really hope those are loaded.

           Bodette storms in--slaps the folder on the table.  

                                      COLONEL BODETTE
                        James Thomas Smith is in a jail 
                        cell five miles from here.  He’s 
                        also sitting in a room thirty feet 
                        from where I’m standing.  How?

                                      RILEY
                        They’re coming.   

                                      COLONEL BODETTE
                        Who’s coming?

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #1 - CONTINUOUS

           The table flipped over.  The chair across the room.  
           Hands now tied behind his back, Smith kicks at the door.

                                      SMITH
                        Do something now!  Time is running 
                        out.  It’s always running out...

           HALLWAY OUTSIDE

           The Guards, now outside the door, trade a look.  They can 
           sense it in their bones--something about this guy.

           EXT. PRESIDENT PARK - NIGHT

           The Bonneville wreck is surrounded by six-foot tall men 
           in black suits, armed to the teeth--SECRET SERVICE 
           AGENTS.

           EXT. BONNEVILLE - CONTINUOUS

           The Bomb Robot is still there--mechanical arm aimed into 
           the trunk’s darkness.  President Malloy, Kronau, Agent 
           Dawes, and Colonel Bodette stare inside--thunderstruck.  
           Whatever they’re seeing simply does not compute.  

                                      KRONAU
                        What the hell is that?

                                      COLONEL BODETTE
                        Better question...where the hell 
                        does that come from?
                                      KRONAU
                        Is that a...head?

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                              (to Kronau)
                        Recall the Joint Chiefs.  Space 
                        Command.  NASA.  

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #1 - NIGHT

           Smith drinks coffee from a PRESIDENTIAL COFFEE MUG.  
           President Malloy, Colonel Bodette, Sec Def Kronau, and 
           Agent Dawes stare at him across the table.  Complete 
           silence.  Complete shock.   Complete horror.

           Smith gestures to his face with the Mug.

                                      SMITH 
                        Think I got this shavin’?  We 
                        don’t got time to go over all this 
                        again.  

                                      COLONEL BODETTE
                        What do we do?

           BEEP--Smith’s wrist WATCH ALARM goes off.  BLINKING: 
           00:00:00.  

           As he RESETS HIS COUNTDOWN TIMER FOR 24 HOURS...

                                      SMITH
                        What yer gonna do is panic, and 
                        die screaming.  
                              (to Malloy)
                        Where were you forty-eight hours 
                        ago?

           Malloy shakes so bad, he fades.  Smith SLAPS the table in 
           front of him--scaring the shit out of all.

                                      SMITH
                        Where were you?

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #2 - CONTINUOUS

           Riley sits quietly alone, her foot tapping like a jack 
           hammer--eyes glued to a clock on the wall: 8:00 PM.

           Then, A SOUND--like groaning metal, but not quite.  
           Almost sorrowful.  Louder...

                                      RILEY
                        Oh...crap.
           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #1 - CONTINUOUS

           Just as loud in here.  Where is it coming from?  Growing 
           ever louder, the answer is as unsettling as it is 
           apparent--EVERYWHERE.

           Eyes are wide--blood turns to ice water before our eyes.  
           But, not Smith--he just sighs.

                                      AGENT DAWES
                        Mr. President, we have to get you 
                        out of the area.  Now.

           Dawes drags Malloy to the door, Bodette and Kronau on 
           their heels.  Smith yanks Malloy back by the collar.

                                      SMITH
                        Answer me!

           Agent Dawes pulls Malloy free and shoves Smith across the 
           room, knocking over chairs.

           By the time Smith gets up, Malloy is gone.  He runs for 
           the door as it closes on it’s own...right in his face.  
           Locked.  

           INT. EOD TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           The truck may be empty, but the Black & White monitors of 
           the Bomb Robot are still zoomed in on...

           A CLOUDY DEAD EYE as big as your fist.  And it, most 
           definitely, ain’t human.  

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #1 - NIGHT

           Church mouse quiet, Smith hunches against a wall.  
           GUNFIRE in the hallway.  Screams.  WHAM--someone bounces 
           off the door.  

           The BODY OF A GUARD CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL just over 
           his head--hanging through the sheet rock, bent at the 
           waist.  Dead eyes stare at Smith upside down--terror 
           forever frozen on the face.  Suddenly, the body is JERKED 
           out of the hole in the wall.

           As horns, gunshots, screams, explosions, and chaos 
           outside crescendo into audio focus, a shadow oozes over 
           Smith.  Something just stuck its head through that hole.  
           Something big...  

           CLOSE ON SMITH:

           He doesn’t even move his eyes.  A SNIFF.  Another.  
           Inches above his head.  Something reddish drips onto him.  
           Saliva.  BLOODY SALIVA.
           It’s a moment of hell that won’t stop.  Then, the shadow 
           disappears.  IT, whatever IT is, has left.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #2 - CONTINUOUS

           Empty.  Only a ceiling tile a little off kilter...

           INT. CEILING - CONTINUOUS

           Riley lays in the dark--a single sliver of fluorescent 
           light carves across her face.

           Gunshots.  Close.  Someone screams.  Silence.  Right 
           outside her door.  

           A CREAK--the door of her room opens!  Something is moving 
           down there, just under her.  She tries like hell to hold 
           her breath, but it escapes in quiet little whimpers.

           The tile in front of her moves--Riley vaporlocks in wide-
           eyed horror as the tile slides back ever so slowly.  
           There’s nothing she can do.  Nowhere to go.

           Just as her heart is about to burst in her chest, Smith’s 
           head pokes through the ceiling.  

                                      RILEY
                              (hissing)
                        Asshole.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #2 - CONTINUOUS

           Smith motions for Riley to climb down, gesturing that 
           he’ll catch her, and...

           ...giving her the “SHHH” sign.  He points--something is 
           in the hallway.  Carefully, she dangles her legs down.  
           The ceiling gives way!  Tiles CRASH down as she falls 
           onto Smith--they slam into the table, causing it to 
           SCREECH across the tiled floor.  

           They leap up, hearts pounding--staring at the door in a 
           panic.  Waiting.  

           But, nothing happens.

           EXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Smith and Riley ease along a destroyed hallway.  Bullet 
           holes.  BLOOD.  Shattered sheet rock.

                                      RILEY
                              (whispers)
                        Running away...  
                                      SMITH
                        Huh?

                                      RILEY
                        See how good it sounds?    

                                      SMITH
                        We can’t.

                                      RILEY
                        We’ll try again tomorrow...or, the 
                        day before.  Whatever.  Let’s just 
                        go...go all...Poof.  Please?  

                                      SMITH
                        They took the The Thing.  We can’t 
                        go.    

                                      RILEY
                        The Thing..?

                                      SMITH
                        The Thing.  The clicker.  The...

           She slaps him in the back of the head Grandma style.

                                      RILEY
                        Oh my God, you let them take The 
                        Thingy?

                                      SMITH
                        What have I told you about hitting 
                        me?  It’s gotta be in one of these 
                        offices, OK?  

           Riley picks up a discarded M4.

                                      SMITH
                              (re: gun)
                        Those just piss them off.

           Screw you--Riley hangs onto the M4.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Guns spray the hallway, as Agent Dawes, Colonel Bodette, 
           Kronau, and President Malloy run for their lives--half a 
           dozen SECRET SERVICE AGENTS cover them.

           The lights flicker OFF.

           Men scream in the dark.  Faces of agony and terror are 
           briefly illuminated by strobe light staccato muzzle 
           flashes.  

           The lights flicker back ON.
           Only Malloy, Kronau, and Bodette are left, and now 
           they’re streaked in blood.  It isn’t theirs.

           Bodette empties an MP5 down the hall--grabs another off 
           the floor, and slams it into the President’s hand.

                                      COLONEL BODETTE
                        Move your Presidential ass, Sir.

           Kronau is already beating feet down the hall--Malloy 
           follows.  While, Bodette stands and delivers--firing at 
           whatever it is coming down the dark hall.

           TRACKING WITH MALLOY & KRONAU:

           Running for their lives from God knows what down White 
           House hallways.  Somewhere behind them, the last ROAR of 
           a warrior--Bodette goes down. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #1 - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON TABLE:

           The Presidential Mug Smith drank from.  A shadow appears 
           on the table, thrown from the flickering overhead lights.   *

           A MASSIVE ARMOR TALON reaches into the frame, and picks 
           up the coffee mug...

           INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

           Smith kicks open the door of an office--more blood on the 
           floor and massive holes in the walls.

           On a desk are his belongings--his back pack, the XM-97, 
           and the BLACKBERRY.  It’s POWERED ON now.  Buttons 
           glowing.  The dark screen DANCING WITH INFORMATION in an 
           indecipherable language.    

           Smith plunders his back pack for a CAMCORDER, which he 
           hands to Riley.

                                      SMITH
                        Film it.

                                      RILEY
                        Where are the bodies?

           Come to think of it, we haven’t seen a single dead body.  
           Smith shoots her a look--she knows the answer.

                                      SMITH
                        The President.  Nothing else 
                        matters.  No matter what you see.  
                        No matter what you hear.  OK?
           Scared shitless, she nods.

                                      SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Don’t lose sight of me.  Keep your 
                        hand on my shoulder.  And, for the 
                        love of God, tell me if you see 
                        him.

                                      RILEY
                        Him who?

           Smith covers one of his eyes with a hand.

                                      SMITH
                        Him, him.

           Whatever that means, it scares the shit out of her.  

                                      SMITH
                        I won’t let it happen again.  I 
                        promise.  

           He locks and loads.

                                      SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Ready?

                                      RILEY
                        Hell no.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE COMPOUND - NIGHT

           There’s a flaming helicopter wreck smoking on the ground.  
           Cars are flipped.  Fires in the distance.  Sirens.  
           Sporadic gunfire.

           Smith exits one of the buildings, Riley glued to his back-
           -they make for the White House across the lawn.  As they 
           do, they’re greeted by BONE CHILLING SOUNDS emanating 
           from the darkness of night.  Engines screech overhead--
           aircraft of some kind.  And the screams.  Primal and 
           petrified.  It’s as if everyone in the entire city of 
           Washington DC is screaming...

           Because they are.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

           President Malloy and Kronau make it to an underground 
           safe room.  No dice.  The metal blast door has been 
           ripped off the hinges.  Blood is everywhere--no bodies.

                                      KRONAU
                        There’s no one left.  Oh, 
                        God...there’s no one left!
           Malloy is in obvious shock.

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        They’ll come for me.  We’re under 
                        attack, and they’ll come for me...

                                      KRONAU
                        There’s no them left.  

           Kronau rips the MP5 out of Malloy’s hand and runs.

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Kronau!  Don’t leave me here..! 

           A BEAT later, Kronau runs back into sight--chased.  
           Something grabs him from behind.  He falls to the floor 
           screaming bloody murder--his body tenses, squeezing off 
           the MP5.  The rounds nail Malloy in the chest.

           The President drops to his knees, while Kronau is dragged 
           screaming God knows where, by God knows what.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           Smith and Riley head in the direction of Kronau’s 
           screams.

           INT. HALLWAY AT SAFE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Malloy reaches out to Smith and Riley as they approach.

                                      SMITH
                              (to Riley)
                        You recording?

           She nods.  Smith kneels next to the dying man.

                                      SMITH
                        Mr. President, where were you 
                        forty-eight hours ago?

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Help me...

           Smith shakes him by the collar.

                                      SMITH
                        Listen to me!  Where have you been 
                        for the last forty-eight hours?   

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        I’m dying.

                                      SMITH
                        Who isn’t?  Where were you?  Did 
                        you have a distress code?  
                                      (MORE)
                                      SMITH (CONT'D)
                        A password?  Some security phrase?  
                        I need you to tell me everything.  
                        Do you understand?  Every detail.

           FURTHER DOWN THE HALL:

           Something is coming.  Something big...

           SOMETHING POV:  Nine feet off the ground--moving towards 
           the three people at the end of the hall.

           WITH SMITH & RILEY:

           She sees it.

                                      RILEY
                        Smith...

           Malloy is dead.  Smith reaches into the dead man’s shirt 
           and retrieves a RED PLASTIC CARD, sealed in a plastic 
           case.  Then, he retrieves a pair of CUTTERS from his 
           backpack--places Malloy’s fingers between the blades...

                                      RILEY
                        Smith!

           Smith whips around--grabs Riley and throws her into the 
           doorless saferoom.  He raises the XM-97, and...CLICK.

                                      SMITH
                        Damn, friggin’..!

           Jammed.  He tries like hell to clear the weapon--stepping 
           back to put distance between him and the SNARLING death 
           coming from the shadows.  He fuckin’ trips over the dead 
           President--flat on his back.

           SOMETHING POV: It’s almost on top of him.  A few feet 
           away.  Then...

           Riley empties that M4 on full Auto from the safe room.  
           Smith was right--from the METTALIC TINGED SNARLING that 
           just pissed it off.  She drops the M4 and yanks a loose 
           PIPE out of a broken wall--leaps over Smith and charges 
           towards the shadows...

           Smith is up--yanks her back by the collar.  BOOM BOOM.  
           THUMP.  Weapon cleared, he drops the “IT” that we never 
           see before Riley gets to it.  

                                      SMITH
                        Don’t ever do that again.

                                      RILEY
                        Hello, gratitude...
                                      SMITH
                        Never take one of them on alone.  
                        Ever.  You run next time.  Far and 
                        fast.  If you don’t have this 
                        weapon, you run.  I swear to God, 
                        Riley.  I can’t watch you die 
                        again.  I can’t...

           A tired smile bends her lips.  

                                      RILEY
                        I love you, too.  Can we go now?

           No sooner is the question asked...

           The wall behind Riley EXPLODES in a cloud of sheet rock!  
           SOMETHING drags her through it.  Screaming bloody murder.

           Smith blasts into the wall with the XM-97, killing 
           whatever it was.  He pulls Riley back through, but she’s 
           in a bad, bad way.  Her legs bleed heavily--shredded.

           Smith rips her shirt for a bandage--feverishly trying to 
           stop the blood loss.

                                      RILEY
                        Let it bleed.  Let’s just go.

           He locks eyes with her--she’s already going pale.      

                                      RILEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m OK.  I can do it.

           Her legs all but useless, and leaving a river of a blood 
           trail, Smith pulls her down the hall.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

           They exit the White House, Smith’s arms around a lifeless 
           Riley.  Still, he drags her for several steps, refusing 
           the truth.  

           But, the weight of his pack, the XM-97, and her weight 
           are too much.  Smith lays her down in the grass.  No 
           words.  No tears.  Just weariness. 

           Smith takes the CAMCORDER from her hand and aims it at 
           himself, as he heads across the lawn towards President 
           Park--the BLACKBERRY in his other hand.

                                      SMITH
                              (to camcorder)
                        December 26th, 2011. Failure.  
           He tosses a baleful glance back at Riley.  Then, his 
           attention is seized by a PECULIAR SNARL from the dark.  A 
           METALLIC RING to it.  Almost...mechanized?  

           Smith is TERRIFIED.  Like he expects The Devil himself to 
           appear.  

           Not far behind him, backlit by a flaming building, is a 
           SILHOUETTE--just the outline is enough to scare you 
           stupid.  An “IT”.  

                                      SMITH
                        You again.  

           Something sails out of the shadows, and lands at Smith’s 
           feet--a broken COFFEE MUG, The Presidential Seal looking 
           back at him.  Smith steps back.  IT steps forward. That 
           PECULIAR SNARL once more.

                                      SMITH
                        Yeah...not tonight, Cyclops.       

           Smith flashes a Fuck You grin and holds up The 
           Blackberry.  Presses buttons, and...    

           NOTHING.  Tries again.  Nada.  He stares at the gadget in 
           horror.  The Silhouette lunges!

                                      SMITH
                        Ah, shit.

           Smith hauls ass, running for all he’s worth--pounding the 
           buttons on the Blackberry.  Then...something SCREAMS from 
           the sky.

           An F-18, flaming and broken in half, falling directly 
           towards him.  

                                      SMITH
                        Come on.  Come on!  You piece 
                        of...

           WHAM--the jet hits the WHITE HOUSE a hundred feet behind 
           him, EXPLODING into a jet fuel fireball.  

           He jackhammers the buttons on the device.  Running at a 
           full gallop, the air around him begins to fracture--the 
           relentless fireball overtakes him...

           EXT. PRESIDENT PARK - 48 HOURS EARLIER

           Smith APPEARS OUT OF THIN AIR.  His clothes smoking in 
           the Christmas Lights--blackened from fire, covered in 
           dried blood.  Smoke and debris from the inferno he just 
           escaped falls around him.  He coughs.
           But, all is quiet.  Tourists.  The white noise of 
           traffic.  There’s nothing out of the ordinary at all. 
           It’s as if the preceding had never happened.  

           Because it hasn’t yet.

           GRAPHIC: DECEMBER 24th, 2011.  8:14 P.M. EST

           Smith tucks the XM-97 under his jacket and blends into 
           the holiday bustle of DC.

           INT. BUS STATION - NIGHT

           Smith staggers through the joint and sits on a bench with 
           the REDEYE TRAVELERS and HOMELESS soaking up some warmth.

           A man who has just been through what he has been through 
           should be a shaking mess by now.  He isn’t.  He’s just 
           exhausted.  He eyes the big assed clock on the wall, and 
           pulls his jacket over himself.

           Really, really exhausted...

                                                            FADE TO:

           INT. BUS STATION - MORNING

           With the exception of opening his mouth and drooling all 
           over himself, Smith hasn’t moved an inch.  Asleep.

           He wakes with a START, scaring the living hell out of 
           everyone around him.  Eyes darting.  Head swiveling.  
           Sighs deeply.  No danger.  Not here.  Not yet.

           A LITTLE GIRL sitting next to him, all of seven, nods.

                                      LITTLE GIRL
                        Bad dreams.  

                                      SMITH
                        What?

                                      LITTLE GIRL
                        Bad dreams.  I have them, too.  
                        They suck.  They say it’s your 
                        subconscious.

                                      SMITH
                        I don’t dream.

                                      LITTLE GIRL
                        Everybody dreams.  

           Smith checks his COUNTDOWN TIMER: 12:24:02. 
                                      SMITH
                        Not for much longer.

                                      LITTLE GIRL
                        It’s Christmas morning.  Are you 
                        going home, too?  I’m going to my 
                        mom’s...  

           Smith could give a shit.  She tries again, as lonely 
           children are prone to do.

                                      LITTLE GIRL 
                        I’m gonna to be a psychiatrist.  
                        When I grow up.

                                      SMITH
                        Me, too.

                                      LITTLE GIRL
                              (whispers)
                        Then, I’m gonna help my dad stop 
                        drinking.

           Smith eyes the LUSH passed out on the other side of her--
           a bottle of OLD CROW peeking out of his coat.  

                                      LITTLE GIRL (CONT’D)
                        So he and mom will get back 
                        together.  I asked Santa for that 
                        last year, but I didn’t get it.  
                        So, I’m gonna do it myself.  
                        That’s a good plan, right?

                                      SMITH
                        Good plan.

           INT. BUS STOP RESTROOMS - LATER

           The Little Girl enters the Ladies’ Room, leaving her Lush 
           father swaying against the wall.  Smith approaches.

                                      SMITH
                        Cute kid.  Your daughter?

                                      LUSH
                        What’s it to ya?

           Smith shoves the XM-97 into the Lush’s ample gut.

                                      LUSH
                        I don’t have any money, man.  I 
                        don’t have any...

           Smith slaps him--yanks the Old Crow out of his jacket.
                                      SMITH
                        You’re not going to drink any more 
                        of this today.

                        What..?

                                      SMITH
                        You’re going to do anything your 
                        daughter wants to do.  You’re 
                        gonna treat today like it was her 
                        last day on Earth.  You’re going 
                        to spoil her rotten.  You’re gonna 
                        tell her you love her a hundred 
                        times, and you’re gonna be sober 
                        for it.  Right?

                                      LUSH
                        Yeah...yeah...whatever you say.

                                      SMITH
                        Or, I’ll come down your chimney 
                        tonight, and break things you 
                        didn’t know could be broken.  You 
                        readin’ me, Prancer?

           Smith walks away, swiggin’ the hooch.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

           Riley delivers a steaming cup of coffee to a PATRON, and 
           retreats behind the counter to talk smack with her friend 
           JOY--the EMO lady at the register, who is entirely too 
           old to be EMO.

                                      JOY
                              (re: patron)
                        Look at ‘em.  He makes me sick.

                                      RILEY
                        Everybody makes you sick, Joy.

                                      JOY
                        Workin’ on Christmas, of course 
                        everyone makes me sick.  But this 
                        guy...this guy deserves something 
                        awful on general principle.  Truly 
                        awful.  

                                      RILEY
                        I went Llama in his coffee.

                                      JOY
                        You spit in it?
                                      RILEY
                        I did.

                                      JOY
                        You are so lying.

                                      RILEY
                        OK, I’m lying.  But, I wanted to.  
                        Bad, Joy.  Real bad.

           Smith enters.  Joy pings him with the bitch radar.

                                      JOY
                        Look at this winner. 

           INT. SMITH’S TABLE - CONTINUOUS

           Riley approaches--NOT A HINT OF RECOGNITION on her face.  
           She has no idea who he is.

                                      RILEY
                        Hi.  What can I get for you?

                                      SMITH
                        I’m sorry.  

                                      RILEY
                        I’m Riley.

                                      SMITH
                        It was my fault.  I swear to God, 
                        I won’t let it happen to you 
                        again.

                                      RILEY
                        Do I know you?

           Smith brushes hair out of her face...

                                      SMITH
                        Not yet.

           ...and walks out.

           EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETARY - DAY

           DC POLICE and SECRET SERVICE cover the area.  Security is 
           ridiculously tight.  

           A small crowd of PEOPLE IN BLACK are gathered...

           EXT. GRAVESIDE - CONTINUOUS

           President Malloy stands stone-faced before two caskets--
           one of them a child’s.  
           MILITARY COLOR GUARD are at attention, as DIGNITARIES and 
           GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS look on.  The familiar faces of 
           Kronau and Agent Dawes aren’t too far away...

           EXT. OUTSIDE CEMETERY - CONTINUOUS

           A REPORTER speaks into a camera, the cemetery in the far 
           background.

                                      REPORTER
                        ...since the tragic helicopter 
                        crash two days ago that took the 
                        lives of the First Lady, and their 
                        daughter Sophia.  On this sad 
                        Christmas Day, Flags are at half 
                        mast across the country, and 
                        across the world, as government 
                        leaders have expressed their 
                        condolences...

           ACROSS THE STREET:

           More DC COPS ensure that no one in crowd comes too close.  
           There aren’t many people--a couple of dozen mourners with 
           signs and banners of support for the President...

           Among them, Smith--keeping his eye on the gates of the 
           cemetery, waiting...

           EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY

           The President enters the PRESIDENTIAL LIMO--Agent Dawes 
           holds the door open for him.

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMO - MOMENTS LATER

           Malloy stares out the window blankly, his face creased 
           with sadness--Agent Dawes rides shotgun with a DRIVER.

           EXT. DC STREETS (ABOVE) - DAY

           Some asshole in a Taxi is ripping off bumpers, 
           sideswiping buses, and causing all kinds of hell and 
           mayhem at 75 MPH.

           INT. TAXI CAB - CONTINUOUS

           Smith drives it like he stole it, glancing at his watch.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           The Taxi SCREECHES to a halt at the sidewalk.  Smith 
           leaps out and retrieves a Styrofoam Cooler, a jug of gas, 
           a paint brush, a bucket, and a coil of rope from the 
           trunk.
           He disappears into a nearby tenement.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Smith crushes up the Styrofoam and mixes it with the gas 
           in the bucket--the mixture turns into a jellied poor 
           man’s napalm.

           He ties the rope around his waist, the other end to a 
           pipe, and over the edge he goes.

           WITH SMITH ON SIDE OF TENEMENT

           Smith smears the gas jelly in large strokes across the 
           brick face with the paint brush.

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMO - CONTINUOUS

           President Malloy gazes out the window--lost in thought as 
           the city passes by...

           EXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Smith ditches the bucket and pats himself down.  Whatever 
           he’s looking for, he can’t find.

                                      SMITH
                        Son of a...

           A LITTLE BOY pokes his head out of a window, not five 
           feet from where Smith dangles by the rope.

                                      LITTLE BOY
                        Hi.

                                      SMITH
                        Hi...

                                      LITTLE BOY
                        Are you an Elf?

                                      SMITH
                        Yeah...yeah, I’m an Elf.  You got 
                        a match, Kid?  

                                      LITTLE BOY
                        Why do elves need matches?

                                      SMITH
                        I’m...would ya just get me a 
                        friggin’ match.

           The Little Boy starts to cry.

                                      SMITH (CONT’D)
                        I’m tryin’ to signal Santa.  
                                      LITTLE BOY
                        Really?

                                      SMITH
                        Yeah.  He left me behind.  So, 
                        unless you want me to tell him 
                        what an uncooperative little 
                        bastard you are, you’ll make with 
                        a match.  You don’t wanna get on 
                        Santa’s shit list, Munchkin...  

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMO - DAY

           Something catches President Malloy’s eye as he gazes out 
           the window.  Something he can’t believe he’s seeing.  

           Dawes turns to the President--just as stunned. 

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Stop the car.

           EXT. STREETS (ABOVE) - CONTINUOUS

           The whole motorcade comes to a stop in the middle of the 
           street.  Secret Service AGENTS pour out of SUV’s, 
           establishing an immediate perimeter--scaring the shit out 
           of everyone on the sidewalks.

           EXT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMO - CONTINUOUS

           Malloy, Kronau, Agent Dawes, and the Driver stare--a 
           block away, three foot tall FLAMING LETTERS on the side 
           of a brick building.  A fiery message reads:  “RAZOR RED. 
           6BRAVO.”

                                      DRIVER
                        What does it mean?

           Dawes retrieves a red sealed plastic card from his 
           jacket, exactly like the one Smith took from Malloy 
           earlier.  Cracks it open...

                                      AGENT DAWES
                        It’s the President’s personal 
                        distress code...

           ...the card inside reads simply: “6BRAVO”.

                                      AGENT DAWES (CONT’D)
                        Authenticated.

           INT. DC STATION (DARK ROOM) - DAY

           Malloy watches Smith sitting in the interrogation room 
           through a two way mirror.  Agent Dawes enters...
                                      AGENT DAWES
                        Blood samples in his backpack.  
                        And a finger...they’re both yours.

           Malloy looks at his hands--all ten are there.

                                      AGENT DAWES (CONT’D)
                        Gets better.  Bone and tissue 
                        samples that are unidentifiable.  
                        Not human.  Not animal.  They’re 
                        either from an as of yet 
                        undiscovered species on Earth.  
                        Or, an as of yet undiscovered 
                        species...from some place else.

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Some place else...

                                      AGENT DAWES
                        See the videos?

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Manipulated?

           Dawes shakes his head--hands the President a tiny piece 
           of plastic.

                                      AGENT DAWES
                        The hard drive out of one of his 
                        video cameras.  DC Metro eggheads 
                        say it can hold three hundred 
                        terabytes of data.

           It’s no larger than a quarter.

                                      AGENT DAWES (CONT’D)
                        That technology does not exist 
                        today.  Not even in Japan.  
                        They’re still reviewing it, but it 
                        looks like he has years’ worth.  
                        He’s been documenting something. 

           Kronau enters with our old salty friend Colonel Bodette.

                                      KRONAU
                        This is Colonel Bodette, he’s in 
                        charge of the XM-97 program at the 
                        Pentagon.  I thought...

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Your prototype is accounted for.

                                      COLONEL BODETTE
                        Disassembled.  Non-functioning for 
                        the last three months.
           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Smith sits on one side of the table, President Malloy, 
           Kronau, and Bodette on the other.  Agent Dawes stands 
           over the President--a DOZEN DC OFFICERS keep an eye on 
           Smith, who sighs like he’s done this a few times before.  

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        What are they?

                                      SMITH
                        Really, really hungry.  

           He reaches under his shirt, pulls off a leather strap 
           necklace, and tosses it on the table--several HUGE FANG-
           LIKE TEETH and pieces of esoteric metal hang from it.  

                                      SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Galactically speaking...turns out, 
                        Earth is the other white meat.  A 
                        never ending food supply...   

           Uncomfortable glances fill the room.

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Never ending...

                                      SMITH
                        They arrive.  Death.  Destruction.  
                        Mayhem.  Oh God, oh God, oh, God.  
                        Then...they feed.  Travel 
                        backwards in time, and do it over 
                        again. They jump back forty-eight 
                        hours, spend about twenty-four 
                        taking us out, and do it again.  
                        And again.  All life on Earth... 

           Smith’s trembling hand grabs a paper coffee cup, as 
           Malloy taps the BLACKBERRY--screen blank and off.

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        This is how you stay ahead of 
                        them?

                        They show up, I haul ass, man.   
                        Back forty-eight hours.  The 
                        twenty-four hours they spend 
                        taking us out in the future, I 
                        usually spend trying to get to you 
                        in the past.  Before they show up 
                        again.  
                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        Let me make sure I got this.  
                        Tomorrow night, you jumped to last 
                        night, fell asleep in a bus 
                        station, and now you’re here.  

                                      SMITH
                        Ta-da.

           BEAT as the crazy sets in.

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Why do you wait for them to show 
                        up?  Why not just leave now...

                                      SMITH 
                        ‘Cause this gizmo is powered by 
                        their ships somehow.  Don’t work 
                        till they get here.  Comes on by 
                        itself.  Useless till then.  They 
                        all have ‘em.  It’s what they use.  

                                      AGENT DAWES
                        Why not give yourself more time?  
                        Go back further than forty-eighty 
                        hours...

           Smith points at the HUNDRED BUTTONS of indecipherable 
           language.

                                      SMITH
                        Can you read that?  All I know is 
                        press five buttons in sequence, 
                        and I go back.  You wouldn’t screw 
                        with it either.  It’s impossible 
                        to get one of these from them and 
                        live.  They make sure of that.  
                        They’re...wired.  Implanted.  When 
                        they die, they disappear...  

                                      KRONAU
                        This is ridiculous...

                                      SMITH
                        Still diving for your wife in a 
                        bottle of scotch?

           Kronau lunges for Smith--is held back.

                                      SMITH (CONT’D)
                        This is the ninth time we’ve had 
                        this conversation.  Punchline’s 
                        always the same.
                              (to Kronau)
                        And you’re always an asshole.  
                                      (MORE)
                                      SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Kill them, their bodies go back to 
                        the Harvester ships, and they take 
                        anyone within ten feet with them.  
                        Keeps us cows from getting their 
                        technology.       

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        How did you get this one?

                                      SMITH
                        This Old Man caught me stealin’ a 
                        car seven years from now.  Gave me 
                        that thing and the gun.  Showed me 
                        the buttons to press.  Said he 
                        couldn’t do it anymore, and that 
                        I’d figure it out from there.  I 
                        thought he was nuts.  

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        Who was he?

                                      SMITH
                        Jumped in front of a bus before I 
                        could ask him.  Two minutes later, 
                        they came.   

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Seven years?  You’ve been doing 
                        this for seven years?

           Despite the evidence, they struggle to believe.  Smith 
           notices--leans over the table to Malloy.

                                      SMITH
                        You’re wearing green boxers with 
                        white stripes.  Your wife bought 
                        them for you on your last trip to 
                        France.  You had a bagel and two 
                        eggs, over easy, for breakfast 
                        this morning.  And you cried 
                        yourself to sleep last night 
                        reading old love letters from your 
                        wife’s college days.  That’s what 
                        you told me when you died in my 
                        arms...tomorrow night.  And right 
                        now, you really need to find Dr. 
                        Constantine Oro.

           Speechless comes to mind.

                                      SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Can I have my gun back?

           EXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

                        You explain it.  Forget for the 
                        moment we have one individual in 
                        two places at the same time...

                        What do we tell the American 
                        people?  Hell, what do we tell the 
                        governments of the world?  

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        The Truth.

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        I’m panicking.  Do what he says.  
                        I want this Dr. Oro located  ASAP.  

                                      KRONAU
                        Sir, do you know who Oro is?

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Highest IQ in the world, or 
                        something, right?  Shouldn’t be 
                        hard to find. 

                                      KRONAU
                        That’s not exactly it...

           Malibu.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Our Malibu buzzing F-18 joins TWENTY OTHER FIGHTERS

           APACHE ATTACK HELICOPTERS cruise in pairs just over 
           rooftops, as F-16 Eagles and F-22 Raptors roar overhead.

           PEDESTRIANS gawk.  

           Then, the M1A ABRAMS TANKS roll by, followed by SOLDIERS 
           tricked out in full battle gear and armed to the teeth.  
           MONTAGE: 

           Atlanta.  Houston.  Chicago.  Over and over.  Every major 
           city in America.

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           Smith sits across from Bodette and TWENTY LAPTOPS, on 
           which are TWENTY GENERALS AND ADMIRALS VIA VIDEO.  

                                      SMITH
                        Heavy weapons are key.  Depleted 
                        Uranium ideal.  You can kill ‘em.  
                        But, they don’t go down easy...

                                      ADMIRAL #1
                        Any other strengths besides their 
                        armor?

                                      SMITH
                        Are you listenin’?  Imagine the 
                        perfect killing machine.  Make it 
                        nine-foot tall.  Armor plate it.  
                        Fast as all hell.  Strong as ten 
                        men.  Fangs.  talons.  Zero 
                        emotion.  Amazing intelligence.  
                        Got that?  Now give the unpleasant 
                        son of a bitch technology a 
                        thousand years beyond anything we 
                        have.  Repeat a billion times or 
                        so... 

                                      GENERAL #1
                        They must have a weakness.

                                      SMITH
                        Well...they do smell really, 
                        really bad.

                                      COLONEL BODETTE
                        And, you’re sure they always come 
                        at the same time?  I don’t want 
                        these things showin’ up for the 
                        big dance while we’re still in the

                                      SMITH
                        Once in a blue moon they come a 
                        bit early.  But, you can usually 
                        set your watch by ‘em.

           A REPORTER cuts him off.

                                      REPORTER
                        Can you give us any particulars?  
                        What’s the nature of the threat?

           Riley climbs into the back.  She’s greeted by the weirdo 
           smile of a KID who can’t be a day over nineteen, and from 
           the looks of him, has never had a date in his life.  

           Meet DR. CONSTANTINE ORO.  

                                      DR. ORO
                              (RE: Riley)
                        Whoa.

                                      RILEY
                        Huh?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Hi.

                                      RILEY
                        What..?
           He extends a hand.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Oro.  Dr. Constantine Oro.

                                      RILEY
                        Doctor of what?  You’re twelve.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Hey, I’m legal.  And settin’ 
                        phasers to meow, if you know what 
                        I mean...

                                      RILEY
                        You’ve never been this close to a 
                        girl, have you?

                                      DR. ORO
                        A real one? 

           Riley leans over the seat to the Agents.

                                      RILEY
                        Look, unless this has something to 
                        do with unpaid parking tickets, 
                        and believe me, I feel bad about 
                        those...

                                      DR. ORO
                        Gotta Twitter this.  
                              (as he types on cell)
                        Stone cold fox.  Wants me...

           Riley yanks the cell phone out of his hand. 

                                      RILEY
                              (to Agents)
                        Is Doogie here right in the head?  
                        I didn’t bring my pepper spray 
                        with me.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Not that kind of Doctor.

                                      MAN IN BLACK #1
                        Please sit back, Ms. Holland.

                                      RILEY
                        Not till you tell me where you’re 
                        taking me.

                                      MAN IN BLACK #2
                        That’s classified, Ma’am.
                                      DR. ORO
                        Don’t sweat it.  We super geniuses 
                        deal with this kinda stuff all the 
                        time.  Did you know you’re really 
                        pretty when you’re confused?

           Riley throws his cell phone out the window.

           INT. UNDISCLOSED FACILITY - AFTERNOON

           Kronau, President Malloy, and Colonel Bodette stride down 
           a hallway hewn from underground rock.  

                                      KRONAU
                        Most of your aides and advisors 
                        left DC after the funeral.  They 
                        were still in the air when...

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Were?

           They stop in front of door labeled AUDITORIUM.

                                      KRONAU
                        We grounded all air traffic as 
                        part of the increased threat 
                        level.

                                      COLONEL BODETTE
                        On Christmas Day.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Riley sits across from Smith--eyeing him like he’s trying 
           to sell her the Brooklyn Bridge.

                                      RILEY
                        The future.  

           He nods.

                                      RILEY (CONT’D)
                        And...we’re...

                                      SMITH
                        Married, yeah.

                                      RILEY
                        In the future.  Where you’re from.

           Smith lays a hand on hers. 

                                      SMITH 
                        I know it’s hard to get your mind 
                        around.
                                      RILEY
                        This is not my day...

           She yanks her paw back.

                                      RILEY (CONT’D)
                        I kiss every frog in DC looking 
                        for my prince, and you’re the guy 
                        I end up with?  No offense, but 
                        you’re so not in my league.  OK, 
                        Mr. Car Stealer Person..?  

                                      SMITH
                        Honey, there’s a big picture goin’ 
                        on here I think you’re missin’.

           Agent Dawes enters.

                                      AGENT DAWES
                        The President would like you to 
                        join us.

           INT. WAR ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The President and his entourage are seated, as Smith and 
           Riley enter.  The former still stinging.

                                      RILEY
                        Look, I just thought I’d end up 
                        with a Lawyer or something.  And 
                        if you don’t mind, I’m in denial 
                        right now.  And shock.  Shocking 
                        denial...

                                      SMITH
                        Or something?  I’m not even a 
                        something?

           TECHNICIANS work at several stations scrutinizing the 
           video footage that Smith has shot.  Various moments of 
           his travels are “freeze framed” on large monitors, while 
           other monitors run loops of frightening footage.

           At a table are seated various MILITARY and GOVERNMENT 
           personnel, along with DR. ORO.  The Kid couldn’t look 
           more out of place if he tried.

                                      RILEY
                        You’re making a scene.

                                      SMITH
                        You get fat.

           She GASPS like he just slapped a kitten.  Malloy 
           interrupts before she counter strikes, as he looks Oro up 
           and down.
                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Young Man, you’ll forgive me if 
                        I’ve ruined your Christmas.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Trust me, whatever this is about 
                        is better than the Mom’s “special” 
                        Santa Sauce.  Puttin’ the funk in 
                        dysfunctional...

           Kronau motions for Smith to join him outside.

           EXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Kronau leads Smith to a quiet corner--speaks in hushed 
           tones.

                                      KRONAU
                        Mr. Smith, I’d like to ask you 
                        some questions.

                                      SMITH
                        I told the guys with the pocket 
                        protectors everything I know...

                                      KRONAU
                        No, not about that.  
                              (BEAT)
                        Who led the Nation? In the future.  
                        In your time.  Who was...is the 
                        President?  

           Smith looks at him like he has three heads.

                                      KRONAU (CONT’D)
                        Is it me?

           Something about the question.  The man asking it.  Makes 
           the skin crawl.  Smith shakes his head.  

                                      KRONAU
                        Mr. Smith, when we have defeated 
                        this threat, or prevented it from 
                        happening, life will go on.  
                        You’ve lived every day for the 
                        last seven years twice.  Your 
                        knowledge of the future could 
                        be...is...beneficial to a man of 
                        my political aspirations.

                                      SMITH
                        You just don’t get it, do ya?  
                        None of that shit matters anymore; 
                        we don’t have a future.  They 
                        erased it, and all the guys like 
                        you.  
                                      (MORE)
                                      SMITH (CONT'D)
                              (BEAT)
                        Which ain’t all bad, now that I 
                        think of it...

           Kronau leans into Smith’s face.

                                      KRONAU
                        James...I am not a man you want to 
                        anger.    

           And heads back into the War Room.

           INT. WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Oro stares at THE BLACKBERRY--face a whiter shade of 
           pale.  Slack-jawed.

           Then, he tries to run away.  Bodette pulls him back by 
           the collar.

                                      DR. ORO 
                        You guys have any idea of the 
                        energy necessary to move anything 
                        of mass significant through time? 
                        We’re not even sure it’s possible.

           Smith returns--yoinks the Blackberry back.

                                      SMITH
                        You’re kibbles-n-bits tonight.  
                        Trust me, it’s possible.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Wait.  Dude, you’re the one from 
                        the future?  

                                      SMITH
                        You got it, Poindexter.

                                      DR. ORO
                        No. Way.  Really?  The Guy who 
                        braved the end of the world a 
                        thousand times... 

                                      SMITH
                        Geez, what is it with you people?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Wormholes.  They’re using 
                        wormholes, aren’t they?

                                      COLONEL BODETTE
                        Worm holes?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Tunnels through space and/or time.
                                      RILEY
                        It’s like they could be standing 
                        right here, you know?  They’re 
                        just not standing right here right 
                        now.  They’re standing right here 
                        tomorrow.  Same space, different 
                        time.  Bend ‘em together, or make 
                        a passage from there to here.  Ta-
                        da.

           The room goes quiet.

                                      RILEY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and you’ve never seen an 
                        episode of Star Trek?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Wow.  Are you seeing anyone?

           Smith grabs Riley’s hand and pulls her close.

                          RILEY
                                                     SMITH
           No.
                                           Yes.

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        OK.  Can we stop these wormholes?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Right.  We just got digital 
                        watches thirty years ago.

                                      SMITH
                        Tell ‘em ‘bout your first project.

           EXT. MIDDLE-CLASS TOWNHOUSE - AFTERNOON

           A quaint little place in a quaint little neighborhood. 
           MARINE ONE, the President’s Helicopter, is parked in the 
           street.  Hovering APACHE GUNSHIPS blow wind chimes...

           INT. BASEMENT STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

           Oro leads Malloy, Dawes, Smith, and Riley down.  ORO’S 
           MOM yells sweetness from somewhere above.

                                      ORO’S MOM (O.C.)
                        Honey?  Do your friends want 
                        cookies?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Mom!  I’m with the President!

                                      ORO’S MOM (O.C.)
                        Does he want a juice box?
           Oro raises an eyebrow at Malloy.  He declines, as they 
           enter a large basement room--Oro hits the lights...

                                      DR. ORO
                        Alright, look.  You gotta 
                        remember, I built this when I was 
                        like twelve...

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - CONTINUOUS

           Electrical conduits and massive water cooling pipes run 
           across the ceiling.  In the center of the room is a 
           MASSIVE CONTRAPTION--at the heart of which are several 
           small angled mirrors.  

           A toy BATMAN FIGURINE serves as a lever.  SCOOBY DOO 
           stickers stuck here and there.  But, it’s the SPICE GIRLS 
           POSTER on the wall that really ties the place together.  

                                      DR. ORO
                        God, this is embarrassing.  

           Oro flips half a dozen breakers.  The contraption HUMS to 
           life like a 1976 Pinto that’s been sitting in a barn for 
           a decade.  Thin beams of LASERS bounce of the mirrors, 
           creating a small cube of empty space between them.

                                      RILEY
                        What is it?

                                      DR. ORO
                        I call her Bertha.

           A fuse POPS.  Sparks.  A small fire ensues. Oro sprays it 
           with a fire extinguisher.

                                      DR. ORO (CONT’D)
                        I was playin’ with my Pokeman...I 
                        mean watching NYPD Blue one day, 
                        and it hits me.  Be pretty 
                        freakin’ sweet to send messages a 
                        few minutes back in time on the 
                        battlefield, huh?

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        This...is a time machine?  Is that 
                        what I’m supposed to believe?

                                      KRONAU
                        Sir, he’s been trying to get a 
                        DARPA review of this thing for 
                        years.  We’ve rejected it every 
                        time.  What does that tell you?  
                                      DR. ORO
                        That you don’t mind emotionally 
                        scarring young children.  

                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        You built this when you were 
                        twelve, and you’re telling me it 
                        works?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Well, duh.  I can send a message 
                        with sub-atomic particles.  But, 
                        only a fraction of second forwards 
                        or backwards.  Energy is the pooch 
                        screw.  Remember that big New York 
                        City black out...

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Yeah.

                                      DR. ORO
                        My bad.  

                                      SMITH
                        If energy wasn’t a problem, you 
                        could send a message back as far 
                        as you wanted, right?  

                                      DR. ORO
                        If energy wasn’t a problem, you 
                        could send anything back.  
                        Messages.  Hot Pockets.  
                        Elephants.  The whole planet if 
                        you were feelin’ really froggy.  
                        But, we’re talkin’ like infinite 
                        power here.  We can’t even...

                                      SMITH
                        They can.

           Smith holds up the Blackberry as he peruses the innards 
           of the Time machine.

                                      SMITH (CONT’D)
                        This gizmo draws its power from 
                        their ships.  Don’t work till they 
                        appear, but when they do, it 
                        powers up.  Feeds directly from 
                        their energy source somehow.  
                        There’s a billion of them and a 
                        million big ass ships.  If your 
                        lookin’ for infinite power, 
                        Junior...they got it.  

           Something shiny catches Smith’s eye--A TRIANGULAR LASER 
           MIRROR in the Time Machine.  He touches it...
                                      DR. ORO
                        Hack that and tap into their 
                        power..?

           The friggin’ MIRROR SNAPS OFF IN SMITH’S HAND.  He sticks 
           sticks it back in place, trying to play it cool.

                                      SMITH
                        Huh?  Yeah, it was your idea.  
                        We’ve met.  Had this chat a month 
                        ago...from now.  Whatever.

                                      DR. ORO
                        That is so freakin’ cool.

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                              (to Oro)
                        A message with particles?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Zeroes and ones.  Binary.  Not to 
                        go all theoretical and stuff on 
                        ya, but I could only send it back 
                        as far as the moment I first 
                        turned it on seven years ago...

                                      SMITH
                        Imagine if we’d spent the last 
                        seven years preparing for this.

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Son, I need you to be absolutely 
                        honest with me.  Is this possible?  
                        Could you do this?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Are you cereal?  If I had a genie 
                        wearing a tuxedo of shamrocks, I 
                        couldn’t...

           Smith grabs Oro by the front of the shirt.  

                                      SMITH
                        Every. Body. Dies.  Understand?  
                        You.  Me.  All of us.  Dead.  It’s 
                        time to take the grown up pill.  
                        Because, there is only one person 
                        on Earth that might stop this.     

           He lets him go.

                                      SMITH (CONT’D)
                        And, that’s you, Kid.   

           Oro digs in a pocket for an ASTHMA INHALER--takes a tug.  
           Smith throws up his hands.
                                      SMITH
                        Of course...

           Oro gasps for air.  Hyper-ventilating.  Riley punches 
           Smith in the shoulder.

                                      RILEY
                        Oh, that’s great.  Kill the nerd 
                        that’s mankind’s only hope. 

           Riley yanks the Blackberry out of Smith’s hand--hands it 
           Oro.  Pats him on the head.  

                                      RILEY
                        Can you try?  Ask yourself 
                        this...what would Captain Kirk do?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Kirk..?

                                      RILEY
                        I love Kirk...

                                      DR. ORO
                        Oh, mama.  I’m in.  I am so in.

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        You’ll have every resource of the 
                        United States of America at your 
                        disposal... 

           He checks his watch: 3:00 PM.

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY (CONT’D)
                        For the next five hours, Son.

                                      DR. ORO
                        OK.  If it works.  If we find out 
                        seven years ago, that the world is 
                        going to end on a specific day in 
                        the future...I can’t even 
                        speculate what the result will be.  
                        We’ll be changing the past...

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        To prepare for now.

                                      DR. ORO
                        But who knows the ramifications?   
                        Change anything in the past and we 
                        might not have the same present.  
                        You may not even be President.  

           BEAT.
                                      SMITH
                              (to Malloy)
                        What color undies were you wearing 
                        two days ago? 

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - LATER

           Buzzing with activity and the sputtering of that piece of 
           junk Oro calls a Time Machine.  Dozens of TECHNICIANS and 
           SCIENTISTS work--more arrive every minute.  

           Malloy sits quietly--a picture of his family in his hand.   *
           Lost in wallet sized memories.  Agent Dawes approaches.

                                      AGENT DAWES
                        Air Force One is ready.  You can 
                        broadcast your address en route to 
                        the bunker.

           Malloy nods towards Smith across the room, standing over 
           Riley--guarding her like a like a pit bull.  She steals 
           glances at Smith on the sly, a smile on her lips when he 
           ain’t lookin’--X-ray eyes of death when he is.

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY  
                              (re: Smith)
                        He told me he’s watched her die 
                        one hundred and nine times.  Can 
                        you imagine that?  Watching this 
                        happen to who you love over and 
                        over?  I’m not sure I’ll make it 
                        through this once.

           A TECHNICIAN at a laptop transcribes notes/details, as a 
           program converts the data to BINARY CODE--”001001100...”

           Kronau watches this process intently--wheels turning 
           behind his eyes.

           WITH SMITH:

           Dawes pulls him aside--Riley eavesdrops.  

                                      AGENT DAWES
                        I want to ask you a favor, because 
                        he would never do it.  If there’s 
                        any way...if none of this works...

                                      SMITH
                        His wife and daughter?

                                      AGENT DAWES
                        Don’t let ‘em get on that 
                        helicopter.  For him, promise me.
                                      SMITH
                        Do what I can.  

           Oro announces to the room excitedly.

                                      DR. ORO
                        You guys gotta see this.

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - MOMENTS LATER

           All are gathered around Oro, who rewinds VIDEO FOOTAGE 
           from Smith--Alien Ships and countless failed attacks by 
           American Forces against them.

           Oro stops on a stormy night.  Lightening.  The sky 
           covered with ships...  

                                      DR. ORO
                        Based on the density of the craft 
                        over DC,  OK?  And applying the 
                        same ratio to population 
                        dispersion globally, there are 
                        roughly 1.2 Million of these 
                        Harvester ships...

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        There’s gotta be a Command Ship...

           CLOSE ON VIDEO: Ever so slightly, one ship moves in 
           formation.  A fraction of a second later, every other 
           ship makes the same move in perfect unison.

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        That one.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Not so fast, El Presidente.  

           The exact thing happens once more, only this time, a

                        Truckin’ all that hardware through 
                        space/time, what happens to the 
                        other ships if your command ride 
                        gets a flat?  Scientific term for 
                        that?  Boned.  And, you sure as 
                        hell wouldn’t want a million 
                        individuals controlling a million 
                        ships.  Simple probability.  
                        Somebody is bound to screw the 
                        pooch eventually.  No, these 
                        things move as one.

                        Gotta be operating on some hive-
                        like communication platform.   
                        Autonomous.  Any one ship makes a 
                        change, they all make the same 
                        change automatically.  Safest way 
                        to move through space/time, if ya 
                        think about it.  Now, here’s 
                        somethin’ I didn’t see comin’...

           Oro pulls up more video.

                                      DR. ORO (CONT’D)
                        Which was like...a totally foreign 
                        experience for me...

           REVERSE ON FACES: 

           We don’t have to see what they’re seeing--we’ll see that 
           soon enough.  But, the horrified reactions on the faces 
           of all watching says plenty.  

           Except for Smith.  He’s just bored. 

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Is that..?

                                      SMITH
                        Yup.

                                      DR. ORO 
                        Look past that.  Spaceship leaps 
                        to mind, right?  They’re not. Not 
                        even pressurized.  No shielding.  
                        You can see there, they’re wide 
                        open as the...uh, that 
                        horrendously awful thing is 
                        happening.

                        would’ve thought it possible.  The

                        Somewhere in all this video...
                              (to Smith)
                        Somewhere in what you remember.  
                        Some detail.  Some little thing 
                        like this, is something that’ll 
                        help us beat them.  We need more 
                        time.

                        We have to send the video back.

                        Dude, ain’t like I can stick a 
                        stamp on it.  You know how long it 
                        would take to compress, convert, 
                        and upload all this?  Even if we 
                        did, I have zero idea what the 
                        transfer rate would be given the 
                        variables of the theoretical 
                        quantum framework inherent in 
                        the...

                        Son!  In as few words as possible.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Dunno how long it would take to 
                        upload to the past.  Seconds?  
                        Days?  Years?

                                      SMITH
                        Can’t even start sending till 
                        they’re already here.

                        Playback, encode, and send in 
                        multiple streams.  Real time.  Am 
                        I the only one with a webcam here?

                        Wait...you have a webcam?

                        Curious about that myself.

           INT. HOUSE - DAY

           A FAMILY stares, stunned, at the TV--watching President 
           Malloy address the nation.

           MONTAGE:
           Families in different homes across America. 

           HOLIDAY SHOPPERS stare slack-jawed at a bank of TV’s in 
           an electronics store...

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY 
                              (on TV)
                        The militaries of the world are 
                        dedicated to engaging this threat, 
                        and protecting our species.  But, 
                        you must understand, if you call 
                        for help, there will be none.  If 
                        you are hurt, there will be no 
                        rescue.  When the lights go out, 
                        they won’t come back on...

           TV’s across the world play the address.  Families in 
           Japan.  Russia.  China. Etc. His words translated into a 
           dozen languages on the TV screens...

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY (CONT’D)
                              (on TV)
                        You must band together.  Do not, 
                        under any circumstances, get 
                        caught alone.  Do not attempt to 
                        engage one on your own.  Run.  
                        Fight back only in numbers.

           INT. AIRFORCE ONE - CONTINUOUS

           The President sits behind a desk before a small VIDEO 
           CAMERA...

                        If you are a member of the Armed

                        your nearest airport.  A transport 
                        and orders are awaiting.  If you 
                        have any combat, or law 
                        enforcement training, please 
                        report to your local city hall.  
                        Weapons and ammunition will be 
                        provided to you.  

           INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           An ANCHOR stares at her monitor--dumbfounded 

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve instructed all networks to 
                        broadcast footage of what we’re 
                        facing.  It’s graphic and 
                        disheartening.  But, it is the 
                        reality we will all soon face.   
           The monitor plays the VIDEO CLIPS we have seen before--
           glimpses.  Screams.  Shaky.  Disorienting and terrifying.

           INT. ELECTRONICS STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Holiday Shoppers in shock and horror, as the Clips are 
           played on the bank of TV’s.  

           EXT. VARIOUS NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS AMERICA - AFTERNOON

           Houses are boarded up--make shift defenses against an 
           enemy one cannot defend against.

           INT. GUN STORE - DAY

           The PROPRIETOR is just handing out bullets and firearms 
           to desperate PEOPLE.  

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - AFTERNOON

           All present stare, jaws on the floor and horrified, at 
           the terrifying footage played on a TV.  The ambient 
           sounds picked up in the video turn blood to ice.  
           SCREAMS. GROWLS.  A cacophony of death.

           Riley grabs Smith’s his arm.  He turns off the TV.  When 
           she looks at Smith again, it’s with new eyes.  

           EXT. SKY - AFTERNOON

           Air Force One cruises through the clouds--SIX F-22 
           RAPTORS flying guard...

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - AFTERNOON

           Oro is one of ten faces on ten small monitors on the wall 
           of the Air Force One office.  The others are MILITARY and 
           WORLD LEADERS...

                                      DR. ORO (ON VID)
                        Well, like theoretically? 
                        Depending on what is done with the 
                        information seven years ago.  If 
                        the time is spent preparing, 
                        instantly, from our point of view, 
                        things should change.  Weapons we 
                        devise in the past, based on the 
                        data we send should...well...just 
                        kinda...Poof.

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - CONTINUOUS

           Dr. Oro speaks into a LAPTOP VIDCAM...
                                      DR. ORO  (CONT’D)
                        But, we’re screwing around with a 
                        time line, man.  There could be 
                        any of a number of outcomes.  
                        Absolute, soul-crushing “no, I 
                        won’t go with you to the prom” 
                        failure being one of them.

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY (ON VID)
                        How much more time will you need, 
                        Son?

           Oro glances at the rat’s nest of gear behind him.

                                      DR. ORO
                        All of it.

           Next to him, A DOZEN TECHNICIANS work with TWO DOZEN 
           LAPTOPS--each of Smith’s VIDEO CAMERAS is hacked into 
           each.  VIDEO play back.  Graphics tell us ENCODING is 
           taking place, and READY TO UPLOAD PERCENTAGES...

           AT TIME MACHINE:

           Another TECHNICIAN at a laptop, this one with THE MESSAGE-
           -as she types transcribed notes, data is converted.  
           Binary computer code dances across the screen.

           Next to her is Smith--looking at the Blackberry like a 
           kid staring at a squished puppy.  It’s in three pieces.

           Before he breaks down sobbing, he notices KRONAU AT THE 
           MESSAGE LAPTOP.  The Technician’s back is turned--he’s 
           typing something into the message.

                                      SMITH
                        What are you doin’?

           Kronau turns with an unnerving smile.  Doesn’t reply.  He 
           just slithers away.  The bastard is up to something, and 
           Smith knows it.  But, before he can beat it out of him...

                                      RILEY (O.C.)
                        I usually can’t find a guy who’ll 
                        hold a door open for me...

           Smith finds Riley behind him, looking like she has to get 
           to third period Algebra in two minutes.  He sucks in the 
           gut--stands a little straighter.

                                      RILEY (CONT’D)
                        I guess I should thank you.

                                      SMITH
                        Be a refreshing change.
           She touches the scar on his face.

                                      RILEY
                        I’d hate to see the other guy.

                                      SMITH
                        You have no idea how right you 
                        are.  

           She fidgets--trying to find her way to someplace without 
           a map.

                                      RILEY
                        How did we meet?  In the future I 
                        mean.

                                      SMITH 
                        I ran over your cat.

                                      RILEY
                        You ran over my cat?

                                      SMITH
                        It’s not my fault.  That thing 
                        wasn’t all there...

                                      RILEY
                        Not the nuptial inducing moment I 
                        was hoping for.  I married you 
                        after that?

                                      SMITH
                        Not the next day or anything.

           She wraps her arms around herself.  Smith lifts her face 
           to his, a gentle finger under her chin.

                                      SMITH (CONT’D)
                        You wouldn’t believe the things 
                        I’ve seen you do.  Hate to tell 
                        you this, Cupcake...you’re 
                        actually as tough as you think you 
                        are.

                                      RILEY
                        Stop calling me that.

           She catches herself gazing into his eyes.  Turns away--
           damnit.  He noticed.  She knows he noticed.  That wise 
           ass “I’m under your skin” smirk broadcasts it.

           She levels a finger at him, ready to give him both 
           barrels.  But, something kills the words on her tongue...
           In a shower of disassembled SPARKS, THE BLACKBERRY HUMS 
           TO LIFE.  Then...THAT SOUND.  Like groaning metal, but 
           not quite--It stops everyone in their tracks.

                                      RILEY
                        Oh, my God.  What the hell is 
                        that?

           The blood drains from Smith’s face, as he checks his 
           COUNTDOWN TIMER: 02:03:03.

                                      SMITH
                        Oh, shit.  They’re early.

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - AFTERNOON

           Through the windows we can see the sun low on the 
           horizon, as Kronau, Dawes, President Malloy, and other 
           AIDES vaporlock at the SOUND...

           Malloy looks out the window.

                                      PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Oh...Dear God.

           EXT. SKY - CONTINUOUS

           Against the bleeding sunset--THOUSANDS OF CRAFT.  
           Shimmering black, all.  The HARVESTERS.  And, still they 
           come, appearing out of shimmering holes of atmosphere.

           It isn’t the size of them that’s bone chilling.  It’s the 
           sheer number.  They blot out the sky.

           Out of the HARVESTERS, pour tens of thousands angular “M-
           SHAPED FIGHTERS”--just the HELLISH SCREECH of the engines 
           is enough to send anyone cowering.

           The F-22 RAPTORS escorting Air Force One engage the M-
           SHIPS.  They last exactly three seconds.

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - AFTERNOON

           On the streets, the air warps and THEY appear.  We 
           finally see them, and they are Legion.

           Easily nine-foot tall, glistening, bio-mechanoid and 
           bonelike creatures.  All covered in armor fused directly 
           into powerful bodies, revealing only glimpses of 
           something horrendous underneath.  Bi-pedal and upright, 
           with knees that bend the wrong way--gives them a 
           disturbing gait and an ability to leap distances that 
           means your ass.  We’ll call them REAPERS.

           Snarling and methodical, razor sharp talons fire wrist 
           mounted weapons that PARALYZE all they hit.  
           SCREAMING PEOPLE, running for their lives, drop to the 
           sidewalks--awake and conscious, but unable to move.

           Then, The Paralyzed RISE...

           EXT. DC SKYLINE - CONTINUOUS

           The Paralyzed rise into the air.  Tens of thousands.  The 
           air full of frozen bodies--awake and SCREAMING IN HORROR, 
           as they float up into the Harvester ships.

           EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - AFTERNOON

           A CARRIER BATTLE GROUP engages Reaper Craft.  We follow 
           one as it streaks through air-to-air and sea-to-air fire, 
           effortlessly dodging everything.

           The Reaper ship dives into the water.  A BEAT later, the 
           ocean lights up with a FLASH--a meek and muffled PFF.

           Fish float to the surface.  Hundreds.  Thousands.  ALL OF 
           THEM.  Whales.  Squid. Sharks.  EVERYTHING.  

           EXT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER FLIGHT DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Horrified SEAMEN watch HUMPBACK WHALES float into the 
           sky...  

           EXT. EVERYTOWN, USA - CONTINUOUS

           People.  Animals.  Fish.  Birds.  All life...

           EXT. MIDDLE-CLASS TOWNHOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Colonel Bodette fights alongside DELTA FORCE TROOPERS 
           protecting the basement lab of Dr. Oro. .50 Cal. Guns 
           tear into the Reapers. They bleed black blood, but they 
           bleed.  

           Bodette, firing a belt-fed SQUAD AUTOMATIC WEAPON from 
           the hip, retreats into the building...

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - MOMENTS LATER

           Smith damned near blows Bodette away as he careens in.  

                                      COLONEL BODETTE
                              (to Oro)
                        You might wanna consider gettin’ 
                        the lead out.

           Oro hits his inhaler.
                                      DR. ORO
                        Hey!  It’s only six o’clock!  
                        Somebody told us we’d have another 
                        two hours.  

                                      SMITH
                        It’s not my fault...

           AN EXPLOSION shakes the building.  A distant SNARL from a 
           hallway somewhere above.

                                      RILEY
                        OK.  Gun.  I don’t have one.  Why?

                                      DR. ORO
                        I think it’s ready.

                                      SMITH
                        Then call Christmas Past already.  
                        And tell ‘em they came two hours 
                        early!

           Oro connects the laptop with the information in it to his 
           Time Machine.  Hits ENTER on all the Video Laptops.

                                      DR. ORO
                        In three...two...one!

           CLACK--the power goes out.  PITCH BLACK.

                                      DR. ORO (O.C.)
                        Well...Spock’s balls, man.

           A meek little emergency bulb flickers on.

                                      DR. ORO
                        I think I tripped a breaker.

                                      RILEY
                        You said it drew power from 
                        the...the...

                                      SMITH
                        Things that eat us.

                                      RILEY
                        Aw, man...

                                      DR. ORO
                        But the laptops are plugged into 
                        the wall.  

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        Yeah, this is definitely a 
                        government operation...
                                      DR. ORO
                        Musta created some kind of 
                        feedback surge.  Somebody’s gotta 
                        fix the breaker.

           Smith looks at Bodette.  Bodette looks at Smith.  They 
           raise the Rock, Paper, Scissor fists-- One, Two...

                                                             CUT TO:

           INT. MIDDLE-CLASS TOWNHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Smith runs like hell down a hallway, kicks open a closet 
           door, and ducks in...

                                      SMITH
                        Shit.  Shit.  Shit...

           INT. CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER

           Smith finds the BREAKER BOX--he spots the tripped 
           breaker.  With a CLACK, life oozes back into the place.

           INT. TOWNHOUSE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Smith pokes his head out of the closet door meerkat 
           style.  Nothing.  A smile creeps over his lips.

           He creeps into the hallway--smile a little bigger with 
           each step.  Till, the heavy CLICK of talons on tile 
           behind him...

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - AFTERNOON

           Oro, Riley, and Bodette hear the muffled firing of the XM-
           97, and Smith’s screams of profanity.  Bodette charges up 
           the steps.

           Riley bounces from foot to foot.

                                      RILEY
                        Ohmigod, ohmigod, ohmigod...  

           She grabs Oro by the shirt.

                                      RILEY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t die now.  I just met a 
                        decent guy.  Get this...this time 
                        thingy to do its timey thing!  

                                      DR. ORO
                        What?

                                      RILEY
                        Don’t make me go Chick Norris on 
                        you!
                                      DR. ORO
                        I’m waiting for the computers to 
                        boot up...

           Yeah...Windows Start Up Screens.

           At the top of the steps, Bodette cuts loose with the SAW--
           it’s deafening.  We can’t see him from down here, but the 
           hot brass is plinking down the steps.  

           A BEAT later, BODETTE’S HEAD TUMBLES DOWN THE STAIRS!  

                                      RILEY
                        Holy crap!

           Oro screams like a white woman--Riley yoinks his inhaler 
           and hits it, as Smith slides down the stairs on his back, 
           head first, firing the XM-97 wildly up the stairwell.

           He staggers to his feet, speckled with blood, and panting-
           -retrieves Boddette’s SAW and hands it to a trembling 
           Riley.  It’s almost as big as she is.

                                      SMITH
                        Point that end at anything not us 
                        and pull the trigger.

                                      RILEY
                        Not us, right...

           BAM-BAM-BAM.  She squeezes off a few rounds, damned near 
           taking off Smith’s head--he gingerly pushes her barrel 
           vaguely in the direction of the stairs.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Data uploaded.  Ready to stream.  
                        In three...two...one.

           Oro hits the transmit button--a small swirling ball of 
           atmosphere appears in the empty space between a series of 
           intersecting lasers.

           BOOM--the entire building shakes.  An explosion far away, 
           but close enough to shake the foundation and dislodge 
           pipes from the ceiling.  

           One of them, spewing hot steam, falls directly onto the 
           time machine, laptops, and all of Smith’s Video Cameras.

           In a shower of sparks, the lights go out again--the time 
           machine goes dead.

                                      SMITH
                        Did it send?
                                      DR. ORO
                        I don’t know...

                                      RILEY
                        Immediately!  You said 
                        Immediately...

                                      DR. ORO
                        Well...change the past, it should 
                        change the present!  Pretty much 
                        the scientific consensus 
                        since...ever...

                                      SMITH
                        You just discovered germs a 
                        hundred years ago.  Maybe you 
                        mathletes don’t have a real firm 
                        grip on time travel.

           BANG BANG--the door at the top of the steps has a 
           visitor.  Something big.  Something strong.  

           Riley cuts loose with the SAW--the muzzle strobe-flashing 
           in the near dark basement.

           Smith grabs up the pieces of THE BLACKBERRY.

                                      SMITH
                        You got about thirty seconds to 
                        put this back together, Junior.

           Riley grabs Smith by the shoulders.

                                      RILEY 
                        If they’re gonna get me, you kill 
                        me.  I’ll do the same for you.  
                        Promise, OK?

                                      SMITH
                        They’re not going to get you.

                                      RILEY
                        Don’t let me die like that.  
                        Promise me.  If you love me as 
                        much as you say, you’ll promise 
                        me.

                                      SMITH
                        I promise.  

           EXT. MIDDLE-CLASS TOWNHOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Smith, Riley, and Dr. Oro slide out a shattered window, 
           and run like hell.
           DC is eerily quiet under a SETTING SUN.  No more jets.  
           Just an occasional scream or gunshot.  Something wet 
           drips onto Riley.  

                                      SMITH
                        Do not look up.

           Red stuff drips onto Smith as he speaks.  Riley’s eyes go 
           wide with realization--she looks up.

           Blood.  From a MILLION WOUNDS of a MILLION BODIES 
           floating into the harvesters and blotting out the sky.

           Riley hits her knees.  Dr. Oro falls against a wall.  
           Overwhelming horror--the magnitude of what’s happening.  
           The end of the human race.  No...

           The end of EVERYTHING.  Humans, animals...earth.  Life as 
           we’ve known it is over.

                                      SMITH
                        Get up.

           They don’t.  Smith shakes Riley.

                                      SMITH (CONT’D)
                        You’ve done it before.  Get 
                        up...get up!  You can do this

           Riley struggles through the terror to her feet--not Oro.  

                                      DR. ORO
                        It’s pointless...

                                      SMITH
                        Doc?  Kid..?

           Nobody’s home.  Smith yanks the Blackberry out of his 
           limp hands and slides the last piece into place...  

                                      RILEY
                        We can’t just leave him...

                                      SMITH
                        He’ll be there tomorrow.

                                      RILEY
                        Yesterday.

                                      SMITH
                        Whatever!

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - CONTINUOUS

           A PECULIAR SNARL echoes--the Silhouetted Reaper from 
           earlier!  And, he is one sinister looking hombre.
           Taller than the others, his armor deeply dented and 
           scorched.  Missing half the armor where his face is--long 
           ago blown away.  Revealing a MISSING EYE healed over.

           We’ll call him the THE ONE-EYED REAPER.    

           He SNIFFS the air--hunting.  Something glints, catching 
           its eye--THE TRIANGULAR LASER MIRROR.  He touches it--
           damned thing breaks off just like it did with Smith.

           He eyes it with intelligence--fondles some of the other 
           parts with a knowing growl.  This damned thing is 
           figuring out what Oro’s machine is...

           EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

           Smith pulls Riley close, presses the button sequence on 
           the Blackberry and...

                                      SMITH
                        Ready?

           NOTHING.  He shakes the damned thing.  

                                      RILEY
                        Well!

           Smith feverishly takes the Blackberry back apart and puts 
           it back together, dropping a piece in the process...

           He grabs it off the ground.  When he stands back up, 
           Riley has the SAW pointed at his head--BAM!  Smith slaps 
           the barrel away at the last instant.

                                      SMITH
                        What the hell!

                                      RILEY
                        We had an agreement...

                                      SMITH
                        Well, Damn!  You wanna give me 
                        half a chance to...

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - CONTINUOUS

           Riley’s ECHOING GUNSHOT grabs The One-Eyed Reaper’s 
           attention.  With a angry SNARL and another SNIFF of the 
           air, he takes off...

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Smith looks at one component of the Blackberry cross-
           eyed, flips it upside down, and plugs it back in.  Bingo!  
           It powers on.
           Reapers are everywhere--they’ll be all over them in 
           seconds if this doesn’t work.  

           The PECULIAR SNARL.  Smith Freezes in terror.  The One-
           Eyed Reaper on a nearby rooftop.  

           Riley slaps the shit out of him.  

                                      RILEY
                        Hello!

           Smith hits buttons while Riley fires from the hip.  
           Gunfire be damned, THE ONE-EYED REAPER leaps off the roof 
           after them.

           Smith and Riley dive for safety--the air warps...

           EXT. STREET - 48 HOURS EARLIER

           GRAPHIC: DECEMBER 23nd, 2011. 6:13 P.M. EST.

           Screaming bloody murder, Smith and Riley fall flat on 
           their faces out of thin air--Riley staring at the 
           TRIANGULAR MIRROR on the ground in front of her face.  

                                      SOLDIER #1 (O.C.)
                        Drop your weapons!

           SOLDIERS in futuristic “HALO Style” body armor and 
           uniforms have XM-97 style guns leveled at them.

                                      SOLDIER #2
                              (on radio)
                        Sector seven, we found them.  

           Before Smith and Riley can de-freak, fifty more SOLDIERS 
           converge--FUTURISTIC HELICOPTERS soar overhead.

           The wall of Soldiers parts--from their midst emerges...

                                      KRONAU
                        Mr. Smith, we’ve been expecting 
                        you.

           He’s surrounded by a dozen SOLDIERS IN BLOOD RED 
           UNIFORMS.  One of them is DAWES.

                                      DAWES
                        The President is addressing you, 
                        Citizen.

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

           Decay.  This is not the DC we know.  This is Sarajevo 
           1995 without the bomb craters...yet.  Vines creep up the 
           sides of broken windowed buildings.  Disrepair.
           The CAPITOL BUILDING.  The WASHINGTON MONUMENT.  All the 
           familiar landmarks are overgrown and unused.  

           FUTURISTIC FIGHTERS AND ARMORED HELICOPTERS soar above 
           MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS and ARTILLERY PLATFORMS perched 
           atop the tallest buildings.  Soldiers behind the scanning 
           cannons of ANTI-AIR GUNS.

           EXT. DC STREETS - NIGHT

           SOLDIERS are everywhere.  Every corner.  TRENCHES cut 
           into the streets.  All manner of Hi-Tech weaponry is on 
           display--futuristic TANKS and APC’s.  

           On the side of every building is a LARGE MONITOR counting 
           down--23:11:05 and falling...

           You know what happens when it hits zero.

           INT. ARMORED SUV - NIGHT

           Smith and Riley stare aghast at the decaying city.   
           Across from them is Bodette--here a GENERAL.  His face is 
           heavily creased with sorrow.  This ain’t the same man.

                                      SMITH
                        Where are the Civilians?

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        Hundred and forty million people 
                        all over the world died in the 
                        riots when the message went 
                        public.  I’m curious, what exactly 
                        did you think would happen when 
                        you sent that message back?  Ain’t 
                        no more Civilians.  

           EXT. COMMAND AND CONTROL - NIGHT

           A BLACK FORTRESS takes up an entire city block. Fort Knox 
           was never this secure.  This is the hub of power now--
           COMMAND AND CONTROL.

           INT. COMMAND AND CONTROL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           PRESIDENT KRONAU strides down the hallway with a squad of 
           his RED GUARD, including Dawes.  With him is MALLOY--here 
           a VICE ADMIRAL.

                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        So, it’s working...

                                      ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        She hasn’t been through the 
                        process yet.  But, Smith is a gold 
                        mine of intel.
                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        It’s been almost eight hours, 
                        Admiral.  I was told a full 
                        debrief would be available by now.

                                      ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        Sir...the machine hijacks all 
                        higher brain functions to record 
                        the memories.  The process can be 
                        fatal if we don’t...

                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        I am not concerned with one man’s 
                        well being, General.  Our fate 
                        depends on what he knows.

           Metal doors open--WE CAN HEAR SMITH SCREAMING.

           INT. HI-TECH LAB - CONTINUOUS

           TEN FOOT VIDEO MONITORS across the wall.  SCIENTISTS and 
           TECHNICIANS man HOLOGRAPHIC COMPUTER DISPLAYS--faces 
           bathed in the green glow.

           Strapped to a dastardly looking metal chair, we find 
           Smith.  He convulses--screams through clenched teeth.  
           His body is covered in electrodes and sweat--the top of 
           his head covered by a round metal device.

           Smith’s MEMORIES are played on the large monitors.  
           Hundreds of encounters with the Reapers.  A thousand “end 
           of the world” moments, from his POV.

           Each memory video is processed in real time by software 
           that calculates speed, distance, tensile strength, weapon 
           power, etc.  Impressive.  

                                      DR. ORO (O.C.)
                        No...no...no...

           Dr. Oro comes out of a darkened corner waving like a 
           pissed chimp.  Here he is all Emo.  Complete with the 
           haircut you get to piss off your parents.

           He bitches out the Technicians at Smith’s side.

                                      DR. ORO 
                        Dude.  You got the cortex feedback 
                        loop bleeding into the neural 
                        mapping threshold inhibitor, man.     

           Riley is dragged kicking and screaming towards a similar 
           chair.  Her turn.

           A monitor catches her eye...
           SMITH’S MEMORIES OF HER.  A hundred versions of her, in 
           various states of disarray.  In various states of love.  
           She sees herself kissing Smith.  She sees herself dying 
           before his eyes.

           Over and over...and over...and over.  Suddenly, the 
           images vanish.

                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU (O.C.)
                              (Intercom)
                        Everything not of tactical 
                        importance is irrelevant.  Delete 
                        it all.  

           INT. ROOM - NIGHT

           Riley sits, holding her aching head.  TWO SOLDIERS enter 
           and lay Smith on the cot--the clock on the wall reads 
           3:30 A.M. as they exit.

           Riley cradles Smith’s head.  He ain’t lookin’ too frisky.  

                                      SMITH
                        Well...can’t say I never take ya 
                        anywhere.

           Kronau, Admiral Malloy, and Dawes enter.  

                                      RILEY
                        I oughta scratch your eyes out.

           Smith sits up--bad idea. 

                                      ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        You’ll recover from the effects in 
                        a few hours...

                                      SMITH
                        Says you...

                                      ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        We built it specifically for you 
                        and Ms. Holland, Mr. Smith.  Spent 
                        three years testing it on both of 
                        you.  The You’s from this time...

                                      RILEY
                        Where are we?  They...us... 

                                      ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        It took a while to perfect.

           Riley winces.
                                      ADMIRAL MALLOY (CONT’D)
                        Some of the information in the 
                        original message was 
                        indecipherable, as was most of the 
                        video that made it through.  I’m 
                        sure you understand this was 
                        necessary.  Every detail you...

                                      SMITH
                        Coulda asked.

                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        Trust the fate of mankind to your 
                        recollection?

                                      SMITH
                        How ‘bout ya just gimme back 
                        The...the, uh...

                                      RILEY
                        Thingy.

                                      SMITH
                        And we’ll be on our way.  

                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        We are at the pinnacle of what 
                        mankind can accomplish, Mr. Smith.  
                        We’ll never be this capable again.  
                        These aliens, or whatever they 
                        are, are going to walk into ambush 
                        the likes of which they can’t 
                        imagine.  It will end today, I 
                        assure you.  Your device...that 
                        technology, was an intolerable 
                        threat to our global security.

                                      SMITH
                        Was?

                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        Its been destroyed.  

                                      SMITH
                        You trapped us here?

           Smith lunges for the bastard--Dawes rifle butts him back 
           into Riley’s arms.

                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU
                              (to Malloy)
                        Place them under General Bodette’s 
                        command.

           Kronau exits with Dawes.
                                      RILEY
                        OK, the sound of that?  I’m not 
                        likin’ it...

                                      ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        You’re going to the front lines. 

                                      SMITH
                        The hell we are.  

                                      ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        There are seven billion people on 
                        planet Earth.  Maybe half of them 
                        are in any shape to fight back.  
                        At best, we’ll outnumber them 
                        three, maybe four, to one.  
                        Everyone fights.  Or, we’re dead 
                        before they get here.  You’ve been 
                        trying to save the world for seven 
                        years.  Here’s your chance.

           Smith wipes the blood from a split lip--looks at Riley.

                                      SMITH
                        Ain’t the world I was trying to 
                        save.

                                      ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        I truly am sorry.  

           INT. HI-TECH LAB - NIGHT

           Oro reviews footage from Smith’s memories--the moments 
           before the message was sent.  He isolates a particular 
           scene--Smith busting Kronau with the Laptop that was 
           translating data into Binary.

           He ZOOMS IN on the data Kronau typed...

                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU (O.C.)
                        The time when this mattered, Son, 
                        has long passed.

           Oro leaps a foot--finds Kronau behind him.  

                                      DR. ORO
                        Dude, you told us you were the man 
                        who could save us all...

                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        I didn’t ask for this.  

                                      DR. ORO
                        You sent yourself enough knowledge 
                        of the future to grab control...
                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        We are at the cusp of 
                        annihilation, Doctor.  A Young Man 
                        of your intellect should know how 
                        important it is that my authority, 
                        for the sake of mankind, not be 
                        undermined.  

           Oro backs away--bumps into DAWES oozing from the shadows.  

                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU (CONT’D)
                        If I’m not mistaken, your 
                        expertise here is no longer 
                        required.  Is it?

           EXT. DC SKYLINE - NIGHT

           Spotlights cut through the night sky, while ridiculously 
           powerful flood lights make daylight on streets.  ATTACK 
           AIRCRAFT circle like sharks.  

           A Chinook-style TROOP HELICOPTER rises over buildings...

           INT. TROOP HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

           Smith and Riley sit with half a dozen STEELY-EYED 
           SOLDIERS.  You can see the wheels spinning behind Smith’s 
           eyes.  Riley gives him the dreaded “Disapproving 
           Girlfriend Glare”.  

                                      RILEY
                        Good thing you came along, or I 
                        could be in real trouble, huh?

                                      SMITH
                        And, just what the hell does that 
                        mean?

                                      RILEY
                        Uh.  Hello?  

                                      SMITH
                        How about thanks, Smith?  Thank 
                        you that I’m not Riley-chow.  
                        Thank you...for the distinct, and 
                        very noticeable, lack of fangs 
                        stuck in my neck right now.

           Riley’s nerves go into overdrive.  She pulls something 
           out of her pocket and toys with it.  Tapping it.  Shaking 
           it.  Annoying as hell.  

                                      SMITH
                        I’m tryin’ to think of a way outta 
                        this.  Please stop doing that.
                                      RILEY
                        I’m nervous, OK?  When I’m gonna 
                        be killed and eaten, and not 
                        necessarily in that order, I 
                        fidget.  Deal with it.

           Smith catches a glimpse of what she’s toying with--it’s 
           the TRIANGLE LASER MIRROR.  He snatches it away.  

                                      SMITH
                        Where did you get this?

                                      RILEY
                        That cyclops growly thing dropped 
                        it when he went all “GRRRR”.  

                                      SMITH
                        The Reaper with the one eye had 
                        this?

                                      RILEY
                        Isn’t that what I said?

                                      SMITH
                        Are you sure?

                                      RILEY
                        Does he have an evil twin?

           Smith races to the cockpit--a GUARD stops him.

                                      SMITH
                        Turn this tub around.

                                      GUARD
                        Sit down, Citizen.

                                      SMITH
                        Listen Lurch, he’s on to us. 

           Riley leaps up.

                                      RILEY
                        On to us?  Who’s on to us?

                                      SMITH
                        That one-eyed...whatever the hell 
                        it is.  He’s been tryin’ to get 
                        the Thing back for years.  This 
                        was part of Oro’s Machine.  You 
                        think he can’t figure out what it 
                        was, and what we did with it?  
                        They travel through time every 
                        friggin’ day...
                                      GUARD
                        My orders are to transport this 
                        platoon to...

                                      SMITH
                        Just gimme the radio!

           Smith shoves him to get to the Pilot.  That brings the 
           SOLDIERS into the fray--they pull Smith back, which gets 
           Riley involved.

                                      RILEY
                        Hey, hey!  Don’t get shove-y.

                                      SMITH
                        You jack-booted morons, I’m tryin’ 
                        to save your...

           The Guard clocks Smith, who slugs him back and dives for 
           the cockpit--only to get dragged out by the feet.  Riley 
           bashes a Soldier in the melon with the butt of her XM-97.

           Which gets her shoved on her ass--HARD.  

           So hard, HER WEAPON GOES OFF--BAM!  Eyes go wide.  Fists 
           stop in mid-air.  Everyone freezes for TENSE BEAT.  
           No...no one is shot.  

           Till, the PILOT FALLS OUT OF THE COCKPIT, a bullet hole 
           in his helmet.  All eyes go to Riley.

                                      RILEY
                        That so wasn’t my fault.

           EXT. PENTAGON (STREETS) - NIGHT

           TANKS rumble down the street, as Soldiers take position 
           in WWI style trenches.  A familiar voice floats over the 
           noise--Bodette barking at an OFFICER.

                                      GENERAL BODETTE 
                        ...cleared to fire for effect at 
                        will.  We only got twelve hours, 
                        and we’re behind schedule! 

           Something catches his attention--AN OUT OF CONTROL TROOP 
           HELICOPTER careens wildly through the air.  Over the 
           nearby area known as CRYSTAL CITY--a garden of fifteen to 
           twenty story hotels and office buildings on the banks of 
           the Potomac River.

           The helicopter SLAMS into the top of the buildings, pin 
           wheels off...
           INT. TROOP HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

           Alarms scream.  Men scream.  The collision with the 
           building has ripped a hunk of bulkhead away--sparks and 
           exposed wiring.  

           The centrifugal forces sling Riley towards to breach--out 
           she goes, hanging on by her fingertips.

                                      SMITH
                        Riley..!

           Smith watches in horror as a Solider is thrown directly 
           into her.  She disappears, as...

           EXT. ROOF #1- CONTINUOUS

           The Troop Helicopter slams into an Antenna atop a tall 
           building--skips and hits another building...

           EXT. ROOF #2 - CONTINUOUS

           The mangled bird slides across the roof, throwing Smith 
           out.  He claws at the roof, momentum sending him towards 
           the edge.  

           JUST manages to stop himself, as the Helicopter topples 
           fifteen stories below.  Freaked the fuck out, he staggers 
           to his feet--calls out in a panic.

                                      SMITH
                        Riley..!  Riley..!

                                      RILEY (O.C.)
                        Oh man, could this suck any more?  
                        Help me, damnit...

           Her voice echoes down the street from Roof #1.  It’s five 
           stories above Smith.  He can hear her complaining, but he 
           can’t see her.

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           A silhouette ascends the stairs--the unmistakable cut of 
           a Soldier in BATTLE ARMOR.  Hands rip cobwebs away...

           EXT. ROOF #1 - CONTINUOUS

           The stairwell door creeps open, and out steps...

           Oro sporting the world’s most ill-fitting armor.  It’s 
           way too big for him--the helmet is over his eyes.  He 
           drags an XM-97 by the barrel.  

           He meanders to the edge--the tallest building around.
                                      DR. ORO
                        Front row seat for the end of the 
                        world.  

           He hits his asthma inhaler.

                                      DR. ORO (CONT’D)
                        I’m so screwed.

                                      RILEY (O.C.)
                        Hey, Chess Club.

           Oro grabs his head.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Voices.  Aw, man.  Mom said this 
                        would happen one day...

                                      RILEY (O.C.)
                        Oh my God.  Look up, Doogie.  

           Oro looks skyward.  

           There’s Riley, hanging from a rat’s nest of wires that 
           are tangled around the Antenna atop the building.  The 
           whole damned thing is bent about 45 degrees--she hangs 
           like a wind chime from the waist.

                                      DR. ORO
                        What are you doin’ up there?

                                      RILEY
                        Get me down, you idiot!

           EXT. STREET (CRASH SITE) - PREDAWN

           We find the wreckage of the Troop Helicopter burning.  
           SOLDIERS tend to survivors.  Smith picks up an XM-97.  
           Bodette looks at the TRIANGULAR MIRROR now in his hand.

           Smith yoinks another gun from a Soldier’s hands and 
           straps it to his back.

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        We don’t stand a chance ‘cause you 
                        found a mirror?

           Smith wrestles ANOTHER XM-97 out of a Soldier’s hands--
           grabs Bodette by the armor.

                                      SMITH
                        No, we don’t stand a chance 
                        because they found Oro’s machine.  
                        If you knew what I did.  All of 
                        this.  If you figured out we sent 
                        a message.  What would you do?  
           “Oh Shit” gut punches Bodette.

                                      SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Exactly.  Now, if ya don’t mind, I 
                        gotta find the woman I love before 
                        the intergalactic man-eating 
                        whatever they are’s come.  

           Smith hops in a HUMVEE and takes off.  Bodette glances up 
           at one of the COUNTDOWN MONITORS on the side of a 
           building: 12:10:02.

           He grabs THE NEAREST OFFICER.

                                      GENERAL BODETTE (CONT’D)
                        Get Command and Control on the 
                        horn.  Tell ‘em they’ll be comin’ 
                        early.  Expect the invasion 
                        immediately!

           INT. COMMAND & CONTROL HQ - PREDAWN

           Voices and radio chatter.  A kaleidoscope of HOLO-
           TERMINALS and MONITORS.  A HUNDRED SOLDIERS work.  Panic 
           in the air.  

           Standing over a Hologram of Planet Earth, Admiral Malloy 
           zooms in to DC.  Speaks with a HOLOGRAM OF KRONAU...

           INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Malloy’s Hologram appears on Kronau’s desk.

                                      ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        Our entire battle plan is based on 
                        them walking into a coordinated 
                        global attack.  Catch them off 
                        guard.  If we don’t have the 
                        element of surprise, if they’re 
                        anticipating this...basic tactics, 
                        Sir.  If you get wind of an 
                        ambush, you attack first.

                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        How far from ready are we?

                                      ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        For the original scenario?  Hours.  
                        For the possibility, that at any 
                        second, we’ll be on the receiving 
                        end of a global pre-emptive 
                        assault?  We wouldn’t...

           THAT SOUND kills the words on his tongue.  Like the 
           groaning of metal, but not quite...
           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - CONTINUOUS

           The SOUND echoes through the concrete canyons.  Blood 
           turns to ice.  Soldiers stop in the their tracks. Fingers 
           tighten on triggers.  Hearts POUND.  Waiting for it...

           EXT. STREET (CRASH SITE) - CONTINUOUS

           Every eye wide.  The momentary paralysis terror brings.  
           THAT SOUND ebbs into silence.  Then...

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        Contact!  Contact!  Contact! Fire 
                        at will..!

           And all Hell breaks loose on Planet Earth once more.

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - PREDAWN

           M-Fighters appear first this time.  Tight formations--
           WWII bombing run style.  THE BOMBARDMENT BEGINS.  

           En masse, they drop SHIMMERING BLUE ORBS on the city.  
           PARALYSIS BOMBS drop Soldiers by the hundreds with every 
           blast.  Dresden style.    

           SAM MISSILES streak skyward. TRACERS arc from Anti-Air 
           Batteries atop buildings into the inky night.  Reaper 
           ships come down in flames, crashing into the city’s 
           buildings.  Entire blocks destroyed in seconds.

           ON THE STREETS:

           The REAPERS appear--UP ARMORED.  The battle gear they 
           wore previously has nothing on this--damned near an EXO-
           SKELETON, already blackened from old battles.  Ain’t the 
           first time they’ve been to a dance like this.   

           The Exo-Skeletons make them even stronger.  Talons tear 
           into concrete and brick.  Some scamper up the sides of 
           buildings.  Paralysis Weapons traded for rifle-like 
           PLASMA WEAPONS that burn through flesh, steel, and any 
           damned thing else they’re aimed at...

           INT. COMMAND & CONTROL HQ - PREDAWN

           Digitized and terrified voices radio in from the field, 
           as Admiral Malloy stares at the DC HOLOGRAM before him--
           Green Dots for Human Forces, Red Dots for Reapers.  

           The whole fucking thing is turning red.  He ZOOMS out--
           all of America.  Further--Europe.  Further...the planet 
           swims in red... 

                                      ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        Oh, Jesus...
           Mankind’s surprise attack just got rammed down its 
           throat.

           EXT. ROOF #1 - PREDAWN

           Oro creeps along the erector set construction of the bent 
           Antenna, inch by inch closer to Riley, as an areial 
           battle rages above them.  His helmet falls over his eyes.  
           Again.

           The Antenna GROANS uncomfortably--Oro gets a good look 
           down.  A REAL good look...

                                      RILEY 
                        Are you looking down my shirt?

           Yes.

                                      DR. ORO
                        No. 

                                      RILEY
                        Could this day get any worse?  

           The Antenna shudders.  Groans.  Sways.

                                      RILEY (CONT’D)
                        I take it back!  I take it back..!

           EXT. STREETS (WITH BODETTE) - PREDAWN

           Bodette and his Soldiers pour the fire down a street from 
           their trench.  Reapers keep coming.  When they’re mowed 
           down, the air wavers around their corpses as they 
           DISAPPEAR, taking everything within ten feet with them.

           A Reaper APPEARS IN THE TRENCH WITH BODETTE!  Right 
           between two soldiers--talons rip them to shreds.  

           Bodette blows the thing away, but it staggers into a 
           TERRIFIED SOLDER.  In seconds, the dead Reaper is gone, 
           disappearing to keep us from getting its technology...and 
           taking the Terrified Soldier with it.  Got too close. 

           More Reapers appear out of thin air in the trench.  

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        Fall back!

           Bodette climbs out the trench--seeks cover behind a FLAME 
           THROWING TANK.  

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                              (On Radio)
                        Sector Seven, falling back to 
                        Rally Point Alpha Twelve...
           The Flame Tank spews fiery napalm, engulfing Reapers, as 
           Bodette catches the eye of another STEELY-EYED SOLDIER.

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        Think it’s too late to join the 
                        Navy?

           About then, an ENTIRE CARRIER BATTLE GROUP FALLS OUT OF 
           THE SKY--Carrier, Subs, Frigates, Cruisers...decimating 
           blocks behind them.

           EXT. ROOF #1 - PREDAWN

           The Carrier Group’s impact shakes half the city--rattling 
           the building HARD.  

           The Antenna gives way!  Toppling over--the top twenty 
           feet protruding over the edge.  That’s where we find 
           Riley and Oro, 200 FEET OVER the street below...

           And hanging directly in the path of an M FIGHTER swooping 
           between buildings, a Human Fighter hot on its tail and 
           firing.  Cannon rounds ZIP through the air past their 
           heads--the Dog Fight STREAKS just below dangling feet.

           They’ve barely got their hearts started again, when 
           another M Fighter comes--chasing the Human Fighter.

           It breaks off--comes directly for Riley and Oro.

                                      RILEY
                        Ohmigod, Shoot it...Oh. My. God.  
                        Shoot it..!

           Oro goes for the XM-97 on his back, fumbling like he’s 
           got hooves for hands--HE DROPS IT!

           Riley grabs the thing as it falls, and blasts the 
           approaching M Fighter cockpit full of depleted Uranium, 
           screaming like a banshee.

           The ship careens out of control, spinning wildly by just 
           feet over their heads.  It clips the Antenna, severing 
           the portion that Oro and Riley are on from the rest of 
           the structure.

           The whole ball of wax falls fifty feet, till cables and 
           wires go taut, SLAMMING them into the concrete building, 
           bouncing them outward, and back towards the building like 
           a pendulum...

           INT. BUILDING #1 19TH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Riley and Oro CRASH through windows, tumbling ass over 
           tea kettle across the floor.  
           BEAT.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Ow.

           EXT. STREET (CRASH SITE) - PREDAWN

           A familiar hideous face and a PECULIAR SNARL emerges from 
           the night into the midst of the battle.  Completely 
           disregarding the battle around him, THE ONE-EYED REAPER 
           rolls the Troop Helicopter wreckage over with one 
           powerful hand.  He peers inside, SNIFFING the air.  

           The One-Eyed Reaper takes off, killing anyone in his way 
           savagely, swiftly, and with his bare talons.

           INT. COMMAND AND CONTROL - PREDAWN

           A din of TERRIFIED BATTLEFIELD VOICES--transmissions from 
           the field.  Admiral Malloy commands from the DC Hologram.

           An ASHEN MAJOR delivers bad news...

                                      ASHEN MAJOR
                        Admiral, we just lost LA, Houston, 
                        and Detroit.  Miami and Atlanta 
                        are falling... 

           A PETRIFIED SOLDIER adds to it.

                                      PETRIFIED SOLDIER
                        So are Moscow and London. Berlin 
                        is off grid...

                                      ASHEN MAJOR
                        Admiral...what do we do?

                                      PETRIFIED SOLDIER
                        Sir?

           All eyes turn to Malloy.  Hope.  An order that will help.  
           Something.  Anything.  A moment hangs for an hour.  

           His reply is a pained look--nothing we can do.  XM-97 
           FIRE from a hallway reverberates--SOMEONE SHOUTS.

                                      SOMEONE (O.C.)
                        Bogies in the wire!

           Metal doors slam shut, only to be dented from the other 
           side almost instantly.  BAM. BAM. BAM...relentless.

           CLOSE ON MALLOY: The Hologram reflects in his eyes.  WE 
           HEAR Reapers bust in.  WE HEAR the guns.  The SCREAMS.  
           The GROWLS.  Blood splatters across Malloy’s face...
           CLOSE ON HOLOGRAM: Blood oozes along green holographic 
           streets, all the way to the holo representation of Old 
           Townhouse/Command & Control... 

           INT. BUILDING #1 19TH FLOOR - PREDAWN

           Riley is in a panic.

                                      RILEY
                        I yelled at him.  Everything he’s 
                        done and I yelled at him.  Now 
                        he’s out there with those things.  

           The elevator DINGS.  Oro shoves the gun into Riley’s 
           hands.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Um...I’m a bleeder.

           Riley aims the gun at the doors.  Heart pounding.  They 
           open, she cuts loose a REBEL YELL and...  

           Finds Smith, looking like he was frisked by a mountain 
           lion, yelling right back--gun aimed.  

           It takes a BEAT for it to sink it.

           Smith grabs her and lays a zinger of a kiss on her.  He 
           pours his heart and soul into that kiss.  Her knees 
           actually buckle, as they gaze into each other’s eyes.  

           She smiles.  Then, she slaps him in the back of the head.

                                      RILEY
                        Where the hell have you been?

                                      SMITH
                        I...

                                      RILEY
                        You didn’t even come after me.

                                      SMITH
                        You fell out of a helicopter.

                                      RILEY
                        Oh, so it’s my fault? 

                                      SMITH
                        But...

                                      RILEY
                        I don’t wanna hear it.

           Oro puckers up for his turn with Riley.  Smith grabs him 
           by the ear.
                                      DR. ORO
                        Ow...ow...that’s attached.

                                      SMITH
                        Remember our little stroll down 
                        memory lane?

                                      DR. ORO
                        That wasn’t my idea!  You don’t 
                        tell Kronau no.  Not more than 
                        once anyway. 

                                      RILEY
                        Can you get slappy with the muppet 
                        later?  What are we gonna do?

           Their eyes drift to the horrific view framed in the floor 
           to ceiling windows--DC AFLAME.  Arma-friggin-geddon.  

           Hearts sink.  They’re trapped.  It’s over.  They’re going 
           to die and know it.

           Smith holds Riley’s face.

                                      SMITH
                        I tried, Cupcake.  I tried so 
                        hard...

           She puts a finger on his lips--a tear falls from her eye.

                                      RILEY
                        I’m sorry.  I’m sorry for 
                        everything.  I would’ve been proud 
                        to marry a man like you, James 
                        Smith.

                                      SMITH
                        Riley...I have to tell you 
                        something.

           She goes doe-eyed.

                                      RILEY
                        Yes..?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Aw, for Kirk’s sake.  Let’s go!

                                      RILEY
                        Shut it, ya little Ewok!

                                      SMITH
                        I may look like an Ewok, but I’m 
                        all Wookie where it counts.
                                      RILEY
                              (to Smith)
                        You were saying?

                                      SMITH
                        It’s over, Kid.  No place to go.  

                                      RILEY
                        Hello?  You were about to say 
                        something...

                                      DR. ORO
                        What about catching Kronau before 
                        he jumps back?

                                      SMITH
                        How many times has she hit you in 
                        the head tonight?  He destroyed 
                        The Thing...

                                      DR. ORO
                        No he didn’t.

           Lights flicker.  Sporadic gunfire reverberates.  Kronau 
           strides down the hallway with DAWES.

                                      DAWES

           Kronau jacks Dawes up against a wall.

                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU

                        Is my message ready?

                        Matter of minutes, Sir.

           EXT. STREET - PREDAWN

           Smith, Oro, and Riley creep along an alley.  

                                      DR. ORO
                        What?  Kronau lied?  Gasp.  Oh, 
                        horror of horrors...

                                      RILEY
                              (to Smith)
                        Can I hit him?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Of course he lied!  That thing is 
                        a threat to his power.  Had me 
                        connect it to Bertha as soon as 
                        you two got here to send another 
                        message.

                                      RILEY
                        What, did he forget to oppress 
                        somebody?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Intel.  Send back what worked and 
                        what didn’t if things...went the 
                        way they went.  With his ideas on 
                        how to not lose again, of course.  
                        You think property values blow 
                        now, imagine what life’ll be like 
                        after he sends that message.  

                                      SMITH
                        And we’ll jump into the middle of 
                        it.

                                      DR. ORO
                        If we get to him before he 
                        finishes sending it.  ‘Cause I 
                        promise you, two seconds after 
                        that...POOF.  Hasta la see ya.

                                      SMITH
                        We’ll never run that far, that 
                        fast.
                                      RILEY
                        Aren’t you supposed to be a car 
                        thief? So thief something! 

           Smith shoots a look around a corner--nothing but burned 
           out cars.  But, there is an old Firehouse across the 
           street...

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - PREDAWN

           Data flickers across a computer display with lightening 
           speed.  Kronau watches impatiently.

                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        How much longer?

                                      TECHNICIAN
                        It’s a lot of data, Sir...  

           Kronau slings a backpack on.  Arms himself with an XM-97.  
           Right about now, he looks like the Anti-Smith.

           EXT. FIRESTATION - PREDAWN

           A dusty, cobweb covered RED FIRE ENGINE smashes through 
           the Fire Station’s metal doors--SIRENS BLARING and LIGHTS 
           FLASHING...

           INT. FIRE ENGINE - CONTINUOUS

           Smith drives.  Riley freaks.  Oro flips switches.

                                      SMITH
                        Turn it off!  Turn it off!

                                      RILEY
                        I didn’t turn it on.

                                      DR. ORO
                        It was an accident!

                                      RILEY
                        Wonder what this does? Sound 
                        familiar?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Yelling at me is just making me 
                        nervous.

           Oro flips a more switches.

                                      SMITH
                        Off, Kid.  Off!

                                      DR. ORO
                        That was off.  
                                      SMITH
                        Well find the frickin’ fuse box, 
                        before...

           FA-BOOM--Reaper plasma cannon rounds explode into the 
           street just ahead of the Fire Engine.

                                      SMITH
                        Never mind.

           EXT. STREET (ABOVE) - CONTINUOUS

           A Reaper on a rooftop leaps onto the passing Fire Engine.  
           He has friends.  Lots and lots of friends...

           INT. FIRE ENGINE - CONTINUOUS

           The windshield is full of Reaper, as one leans over the 
           cab and punches through the glass--reaching for Smith.  

           Riley and Oro are too busy leaning out the side windows--
           shooting at two on the back to notice.

                                      SMITH
                        Gun...

                                      RILEY
                        What?

                                      SMITH
                        Gun!

           Riley tosses him her rifle--Smith, steering with one 
           hand, shoves the rifle into the Reaper’s face and 
           unloads.  A moment later, the headless Reaper disappears--
           TAKING THE ENTIRE ROOF WITH IT.

           Oro and Riley, hair blowing in the wind, glare at him.

                                      SMITH
                        Whoops.

           The Fire Engine SHUTTERS--Plasma rounds slam into the ass 
           end just one block from COMMAND AND CONTROL.

           It topples onto its side, sliding down the street.  Oro, 
           Riley, and Smith holding on for dear life to avoid being 
           thrown out the open top.  

           EXT. COMMAND AND CONTROL (ENTRANCE) - MORNING

           Red Guard Soldiers manning the defenses run for it as the 
           Fire Engine CRASHES THROUGH FRONT OF THE BUILDING.

           Most of them avoid being squished.  Most.
           Two seconds later, they’re defending the perimeter, guns 
           blazing, against the Reapers’s hot on Smith, Riley, and 
           Oro’s collective asses.

           INT. COMMAND AND CONTROL - CONTINUOUS

           Smith, Oro, and Riley run along hallways--grabbing XM-
           97’s off the floor.  

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - MOMENTS LATER

           Smith, Riley, and Oro storm in.  They catch the two 
           TECHNICIANS by surprise, but not Dawes and Kronau.

                                      DAWES
                        Drop your weapons!

                                      RILEY
                        Drop dead!

           A Mexican stand off in cramped quarters.

                                      SMITH
                        Step away from the gizmo, Asshole.        

                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        You’re proving to be an 
                        astonishingly irritating man, Mr. 
                        Smith.  

                                      SMITH
                        Look, Pal...I got a bitch of a 
                        headache, and it’s been a really 
                        bad day.  So, I’m just gonna shoot 
                        you in the head in about three 
                        seconds, OK?  One...

                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        Mr. Dawes.

           Dawes aims at Riley.  Smith winces.

                                      PRESIDENT KRONAU (CONT’D)
                        Two.

           On the beat of three, BLOOD SPLATTERS.  The heads of the 
           Technicians hit the floor!

           A PECULIAR SNARL.  Dawes aims--Smith knocks his gun up 
           just as he FIRES...

                                      SMITH
                        Don’t!

           The rounds go wild into the ceiling--bursting a WATER 
           PIPE.  
           As a rain of water falls, THE ONE-EYED REAPER leers from 
           a shadowy corner--A talon WRAPPED AROUND RILEY’S THROAT.  
           It was waiting.  

           Another SMALLER REAPER emerges from the shadows across 
           the lab.  They’re surrounded.

           The One-Eyed Bastard tightens the grip on Riley--she 
           gasps.

                                      SMITH
                              (to all)
                        Put ‘em down. 

                                      DAWES
                        Like hell..

           Smith BASHES Dawes in the face with the butt of his 
           rifle.  Did the trick.  

           Blood trickles down Riley’s neck as a talon breaks the 
           skin.  The One-Eyed Reaper points at Oro’s Time Machine.  
           Then, in a gravely, guttural voice...

                                      ONE-EYED REAPER
                        Un...do...

           It squeezes tighter.

                                      RILEY
                        Oh God..!

                                      SMITH
                        I don’t understand!

                                      ONE EYED REAPER
                        Un...do...

                                      DR. ORO
                        It doesn’t want us fighting 
                        back...

                                      SMITH
                        What?

                                      DR. ORO
                        I think it wants us to undo what 
                        we’ve done.  

                                      SMITH
                        Undo what?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Send a message to disregard all 
                        previous messages.  If I never 
                        show the first one to anybody.  
                                      (MORE)
                                      DR. ORO (CONT'D)
                        None of this ever happens.  Their 
                        next jump, it’ll be like it was.  
                        Back to normal.  

           Holding his broken nose...

                                      DAWES
                        No!  We’ll never see it coming.  
                        We’ll never stand a chance..!

           THWACK--Dawes is silenced mid-sentence by a sinister 
           black blade fired from Smaller Reaper’s wrist.  

                                      ONE EYED REAPER
                        Un...do...

           It yanks Riley by the neck hard.

                                      SMITH
                        Do it, Junior.

           Oro raises his hands--eases to the Time Machine.  The One-
           Eyed Reaper walks to Smith, dragging Riley.  It shoves a 
           talon under his chin--raises his face.  Snarls.

           Riley’s eyes lock with Smith’s.  

                                      SMITH
                        I love you.

           She tries to say it back, but the grip is too tight.  

                                      DR. ORO
                        Ready to send.  In 
                        three...two...one...

           Bertha CRACKLES TO LIFE.  HUMMING.  Electricity arcs.  
           Lights flicker.

           CLOSE ON SMITH:  

           He looks at the arcing electricity.  He looks at the 
           water collecting on the floor from the shot water pipe.  
           He looks back at Riley.  She saw.  She nods...

           Smith makes his move--goes for an electrical conduit... 

           THWACK--The Smaller Reaper fires another blade.  Smith’s 
           hand is impaled to the wall.  He takes it.  Refusing to 
           scream. 

           And, if you didn’t know better, you’d swear The One-Eyed 
           Reaper was laughing.  Till...

           Someone whistles.
                                      GENERAL BODETTE (O.C.)
                        Hey, Gruesome...

           Bodette at the top of the stairs!  He is tore up.  
           Shredded armor.  Wounded.  And aiming an XM-97 at The One-
           Eyed Reaper.

           Who has exactly enough time to widen that one eye in 
           surprise, before...

           BAM!  One-Eye drops Riley and dives for cover--he’s hit, 
           but not fatally.  

           SAME INSTANT:  Smith pulls the blade from his hand, grabs 
           Oro and leaps onto a table, as Riley yanks an ELECTRICAL 
           CONDUIT FULL OF SPARKING WIRES out of the wall...

           She and Kronau dive onto a table the exact instant the 
           wires hit the water...

           But, the Reapers catch on just in time.  The Smaller 
           Reaper leaps to the ceiling, but One-Eye is too slow...

           ZAP!  Sparks and arcs of electricity dance across the 
           water, as The One-Eyed Reaper is DEEP FRIED--growling and 
           convulsing where it stands.  Finally, something burns out-
           -the charred splashes into the water.  

           The air wavers around it, as we’ve seen happen when they 
           die and disappear.  But this time...

           The wavering air dances with ELECTRICAL ARCS--expanding 
           to ten feet quickly...and still going.  Smith grabs The 
           Blackberry, and hauls ass with the others.  

           The overloaded One-Eyed Reaper’s dead body still hasn’t 
           returned to a ship like it’s supposed to--the energy 
           field around it continues to vibrate and flash with 
           electricity. Till...

           KA-BOOM.  It disappears in an EXPLOSION that damned near 
           collapses the entire basement, and sends the Smaller 
           Reaper CRASHING through solid concrete.

           A BEAT later, Smith and Company poke their heads back 
           into the basement.

                                      SMITH
                        Well...that’s new.  

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        Great, they explode now?

                                      SMITH
                        Beats me.  Dead one’s usually just 
                        go back to the ships...
                                      DR. ORO
                        It overloaded.  I...I think all 
                        that electricity overloaded its 
                        implant.

           Smith spots the SMALLER REAPER, half encased in a 
           concrete wall.  He climbs over rubble and pulls the 
           BLACKBERRY off its chest--it’s destroyed.  

                                      SMITH
                        Damnit...

           He shoves his gun against the unconscious thing’s head.

                                      DR. ORO
                        That’s a living specimen...

                                      RILEY
                        You’re a living specimen.  Kill 
                        it.  Kill it till it’s dead from 
                        it.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Wait!  Oh, man.  I just totally 
                        got an idea...

                                      KRONAU
                        No!  You will get this machine 
                        back in working order this 
                        instant!

           Everyone glares at Kronau.

           EXT. COMMAND AND CONTROL - MOMENTS LATER

           Kronau is tied and gagged to the front doors.  A hand 
           scribbled sign around his neck reads--”BON APPETIT”.

           INT. HI-TECH LAB - MORNING

           Smith, Oro, Bodette, and Riley drag the Smaller Reaper 
           across the place--huffing and puffing.  They wrestle the 
           beast into the steel chair of the MEMORY MACHINE Smith 
           was subjected to earlier.

                                      SMITH
                        You really think this is gonna 
                        work.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Has a brain.  Nervous system.  
                        Higher functions.  We’re bound to 
                        get something.  Maybe something 
                        that’ll help us beat ‘em.
           Oro tugs on the half-destroyed armor over the Reaper’s 
           face and head.  It doesn’t want to give.  

           Riley is fascinated by the various lights and digital 
           minutia on the Reaper’s armor.  She touches one...

           BUZZ--they leap back.  Tiny motors buzz in the armor, 
           disengaging locks.  The face and helmet opens--falls 
           away.  Revealing...

           A nightmare inducing face.  No one speaks.  No wise 
           cracks.  This fucking thing is just too scary.

           Bodette pokes it with his rifle.

                                      SMITH
                        If it sneezes...

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        Don’t you worry.

           Oro cranks the Memory Machine into gear.  The Reaper 
           JERKS--body goes rigid.  

           All eyes go to the monitors filling the place--The 
           Reaper’s memories fill the screens...

           CLOSE ON SCREEN: The Reaper’s POV--a memory of Smith!  He 
           runs by us, chased by The One-Eyed Reaper--screaming like 
           a little girl.  Looks like Richard Simmons running from 
           Freddie Kruger.

           The others stare at him.  

                                      SMITH
                        I was trying to distract it...

           They each move to watch various screens--a different 
           memory on each.  Madness. Static.  Quick cut images that 
           make no sense.  HORRIFIC moments.  The mind of a monster.

           Riley stares at one with rapt attention.

                        I...I think its their planet...

           EXT. REAPER PLANET - VIDEO MEMORY

           Through the Reaper’s POV:  Fire and ice.  A wasteland of 
           tundra, desert, and fire spewing volcanos.

           Glaciers and lava.
           INTERCUT WITH GROUP IN LAB:

           They watch in amazement.  An alien world...

                                      DR. ORO
                        It’s a wasteland...

           The creepy decay of a Reaper City in the distance.  At 
           the bottom of what appears to have once been an ocean.

                                      DR. ORO (CONT’D)
                        That place can’t sustain life.  No 
                        wonder they came...

           THOUSANDS OF HARVESTER SHIPS on the ground.  Millions of 
           Reapers enter.  Preparing for the invasion, no doubt.

           The Reaper’s POV moves up an ice encrusted hill, towards 
           an awaiting Harvester.  A glacier passes by in a blur as 
           it turns away...

           WITH GROUP:

                                      SMITH
                        Whoa...wait.  Can you rewind this?  
                        Are you recording?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Where?

                                      SMITH
                        Back it up.

           Oro runs a few seconds back--replays.

                                      SMITH
                        There.  Stop...is that..?

           Whatever they’re looking at is so far off the 
           reservation, it sucks the air out of their lungs.

                                      RILEY
                        Can’t be...

           REVERSE ON SCREEN:

           A glacier.  Dirty ice.  Fuzzy, but visible is...

           A sign.

           In English...

           “HOLLYWOOD”.
           INT. HI-TECH LAB - MOMENTS LATER

                                      SMITH
                        This is Planet Grr.

                        Don’t tell me that.  I’m trying to 
                        be in denial here.  Please, don’t 
                        tell me that...

                        How is that even possible?

                        Nuclear war?  Global warming?  
                        Biological weapons?  Take your 
                        pick.  We must’ve wiped ourselves

                        Either way...

           BAM--he executes the Reaper.

           INT. COMMAND AND CONTROL - MORNING

           Smith has his arms full of weapons.  The others look on.

                                      RILEY
                        You wanna do what?  Let’s just go!  
                        We got The Thingy.
                                      SMITH
                        Then what?  Ain’t like we’ll ever 
                        kick their asses and send ‘em 
                        running back to their own planet.  
                        Changes things a little, don’t ya 
                        think?

           Smith drops the guns on a table.

                                      SMITH (CONT’D)
                        You saw the future.  They got no 
                        where to go.  Neither do we.

                                      RILEY
                        You’re suddenly gonna change 
                        that...

                                      SMITH 
                        Doc said their ships communicate 
                        on some kind of hive-like 
                        platform...

                                      DR. ORO
                        I did?

                        Move as one through space and 
                        time.  One makes a change...

                                      DR. ORO
                        They’d all make the same change.  

           Smith nabs duct tape--tapes mags together 2 x 2.

                                      SMITH
                        You saw what happened to that One-
                        Eyed bastard.  220 volts 
                        overloaded that critter’s implant 
                        so much, it exploded before it 
                        disappeared.  Those ships gotta be 
                        producing nearly infinite power to 
                        move through time, right?  We 
                        overload one of their ships like 
                        that... 

                                      DR. ORO
                              (dawning)
                        And all the other ships would make 
                        the same change.  They’d all 
                        overload...

                                      SMITH
                        Pop the cork on whatever that 
                        power source is, it spreads to the 
                        other ships.  And...Ka-boom.  Or, 
                        somethin’.
                                      DR. ORO
                        There’s more than a million 
                        ships...

                                      SMITH
                        OK.  Big friggin’ ka-boom.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Each one opening an uncontrolled 
                        wormhole God only knows how big?

                                      SMITH
                        Whatever that means.  Yes.

                                      DR. ORO
                        It means ripping a million or so 
                        ginormous tears in space and time.  

                                      RILEY
                        See?  That’s like really, really 
                        bad.

                        It could rip the planet apart bad.

                        Hello?  Have you ever even been in 
                        one?  Do you even know what to do?

           INT. HI-TECH LAB - MORNING

           Riley sits on a table, PISSED.  Oro monkeys with 
           computers with Bodette over his shoulder.

                        We threw up every kinda bird we 
                        could think of for recon and real 
                        time intel...all the good it did.

           SATELLITE IMAGERY appears on cracked screens.  

                                      DR. ORO
                        X-ray.  Broad spectrum.  Infrared.  
                        Thermal.  Penetrating Sonar.

           Every kind of Satellite Imagery you can imagine.  The 
           Harvester ships are easily visible.  Oro picks one and 
           zooms.  In seconds, he’s created a composite of a 
           Harvester using all the data.  A fuzzy and jagged 3-D 
           model--inside and out.  It looks like it was made by a 
           three-year old and a box of crayolas, but it works.

           A glowing UPSIDEDOWN PYRAMID SHAPE pulses in the center 
           of the ship.  Looks are traded.  Has to be it.  

                                      DR. ORO
                        That space above it?  Heat and a 
                        ridiculous electromagnetic 
                        signature coming from there.

                        Some kind of control computer?

                        Whatever their version of that is.  
                        Get in there, shut the fail safes 
                        off.

                        OK, Science Lesson.  Those ships 
                        are a few thousand feet up.  They 
                        won’t be there yesterday.  The 
                        scientific term for that is splat.
                                      SMITH
                        Not a problem...

                                      DR. ORO
                        It’s just as likely we’ll be 
                        instantly ripped apart, and sent 
                        God knows where into space.  Trust 
                        me, that’s a problem.  

                                      SMITH
                        Only if you plan on livin’ through 
                        this.

           Smith tosses the BLACKBERRY to Oro.

                                      SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Get her outta here, Doc.  

                                      RILEY
                        What...

                                      SMITH
                        Take the thing.  Go back.  I don’t 
                        pull it off, you guys keep 
                        tryin’...  
                              (to Bodette)
                        General, you too...

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        Like hell, Son.

           Bodette’s eyes--there will be no arguing.

                                      RILEY
                        This some kind of man thing?  Send 
                        the kid and the woman back?  This 
                        is suicide!

                                      SMITH
                        Way its gotta be, Cupcake.  

           Riley storms out.  

           INT. BASEMENT LAB STIARS- MOMENTS LATER

           Riley sits on the steps and fumes.  Smith approaches--
           neither speaks for a moment.

                                      RILEY
                        Ever feel like somebody stole 
                        somethin’ outta your house, and 
                        you don’t know what?  Just a 
                        feeling somethin’ is missing...  

           She turns on him.
                                      RILEY (CONT’D)
                        You’re not gonna make me feel 
                        better about this.  What if it 
                        doesn’t work?  Come back with me.  
                        I don’t care if we have to run 
                        forever...

                                      SMITH
                        It has to stop.

                                      RILEY
                        Then, I’m stayin’.

                                      SMITH
                        Riley...

                                      RILEY
                        Would you leave me, right now?

                                      SMITH
                        Everything I’ve been through, you 
                        think I’m gonna let them get you 
                        now?

           She yanks the XM-97 out of his hand.

                                      RILEY
                        I could say the same thing.

           He relents.  No way she’s going to back down.  With a 
           tired smile, Smith hugs her.  She rests her head on his 
           chest for a moment of happiness.

                                      SMITH
                        I’m sorry.

           He SHOVES HER down the stairs.

           CLOSE ON RILEY’S BACK:

           The Blackberry is duct-taped to her--ACTIVATED.  The air 
           around wavers--fractures...

                                      RILEY
                        No...

                                      SMITH
                        I’ll find a way.  Somehow.  I 
                        swear I’ll find a way back to you.

           She reaches for Smith, who steps back.  The shock of 
           what’s happening seeps in, as disappears into thin air.
           INT. BASEMENT LAB - 48 HOURS EARLIER

           Riley appears out of thin air, staring at that Spice 
           Girls poster...

                                      RILEY
                        No...no...no!

           TRACKING WITH RILEY:

           She runs through the Townhouse.  No one is home, but all 
           is normal and homey.  

           She runs out the front door...

           EXT. MIDDLE-CLASS TOWNHOUSE (SIDEWALK) - MOMENTS LATER

           Riley stumbles into a Winter Wonderland.  EARLY MORNING 
           SHOPPERS STROLL BY with packages.  Christmas decorations 
           hang.  

           GRAPHIC: DECEMBER 22, 2011. 7:20 A.M. EST

           She staggers into the street in disbelief.  A CAR SKIDS 
           to a stop.  The DRIVER yells...

                                      DRIVER
                        Are ya nuts?  What the hell is 
                        wrong with you?

           It’s one of The Technicians we saw die earlier.

           EXT. COMMAND AND CONTROL (ROOF) - MORNING

           It’s hell on earth.  Ships.  Bodies floating.  Blood rain 
           falling.  Growls.  Screams.

           Smith, Oro, and Bodette gaze over the destruction--
           bloodied and looking like the Wrong Stuff.  

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        So, what’s the plan, Ghengis?

                                      SMITH
                        Kill them all.

           Smith LEAPS OFF THE ROOF!  

           A BEAT--he floats back up, KNEELING ON A FLOATING BODY.  
           It carries him up, up, up towards a Harvester Ship.  

           Bodette and Oro watch...

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        Wish I could say this is the 
                        weirdest thing I’ve done today.
           ...and do likewise.

           TRACKING WITH SMITH:

           Rising above DC, it begins to snow.  Smith steels himself 
           up...disappears into the Harvester.

           EXT. OLD TOWNHOUSE (PAST) - MORNING

           Riley grabs a PASSERBY by the jacket.  She looks 
           absolutely insane.

                                      RILEY
                        What day is it..?

           The Passerby jerks away--runs.  

                                      RILEY
                              (to anyone)
                        What day is it...why won’t you 
                        tell me what day it is?

           She already knows.  Drops to her knees on the sidewalk.

                                      RILEY
                        Please, God...

           INT. REAPER HARVESTER - MORNING

           Huge.  Old.  The bodies enter via a LARGE OPENING into a 
           cavernous INVERTED PYRAMID SHAPED BAY bathed in blue 
           PULSING light.  Five-hundred yards across at the top--
           walls slant steeply down to the opening outside.  

           Just as immediately obvious as the size, is the INVERTED 
           PYRAMID STRUCTURE hanging from the top.

           The source of the Blue Glow--ENERGY CRACKLES.  Bands of 
           SHIMMERING BLUE PLASMA encircle it.  The very air around 
           it warped like heat coming off hot asphalt.  A rail thin 
           tornadic vortex extends from the tip.

           Smith floats past it with a thousand other souls.  

           The only ways to the Inverted Pyramid structure are two 
           catwalks on opposite sides of the craft--both way the 
           hell to Smith’s right and left.  

           He leaps off onto a platform at the mouth of a DARK 
           CORRIDOR...

           INT. REAPER HARVESTER CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           Smith creeps along a wall to a shadow--pauses for a 
           second, eyes adjusting.  Oro puts his hand on Smith’s 
           shoulder...
           He jumps a foot--threatens to slap Oro stupid.

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        Any ideas on how to get up there?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Don’t say the scary dark corridor.  
                        Please don’t say the scary dark 
                        corridor...

           Smith peers down the dark corridor.  A GROWL echoes 
           somewhere down there.

           With a sigh, Smith heads in, the others following--
           disappearing into the dark.

           INT. REAPER HARVESTER GARBAGE BAY - MORNING

           A massive area full of Earthly debris.  Some of this junk 
           looks familiar--like perhaps the now missing hunk of the 
           Basement Lab.

           A RECOVERY REAPER tosses debris aside--drags the CHARRED 
           REMAINS OF THE ONE-EYED Reaper out.  He tosses the body 
           on a steel table that floats by...

           INT. REAPER MEDICAL BAY - CONTINUOUS

           It looks like its ten thousand years old.  

           Reaper limbs are suspended in RED GOO.  Instruments, 
           sharp and pointy, lay everywhere.  REAPERS are strewn all 
           over, in one form of “surgery” or another.

           A WOUNDED REAPER SCREAMS as it is cut open by ROBOTIC 
           ARMS hanging from the ceiling--looking for all the world 
           like an octopus with elbows. 

           The One-Eyed Reaper floats in.  Robot Arms go to work 
           putting the body back together.  Organs are replaced with 
           biomechanics.  Armor takes the place of burned flesh.  A 
           dozen SPIKES are shoved into various parts of its body.  
           KA-THUMP, it convulses--the Reaper equivalent of a 
           defibrillator.  Once.  Twice.  Three times.  

           A foot long needle is shoved into its skull--RED GOO is 
           pumped in.  All the pointy things are pulled out.  A BEAT 
           passes.  

           The One-Eyed Reaper sits up. Pissed off, it leaps off the 
           table, cocking its head suddenly and...  

           ...SNIFFING THE AIR.
           INT. REAPER HARVESTER CORRIDOR - MORNING

           The occasional SNARL echoes with a metallic ring, sending 
           chills up the spines of Smith, Oro, and Bodette.  When, 
           suddenly...

           CLANG!  CLANG!  Hearts leap into throats--Smith and 
           Bodette whip their guns around...

           To find Oro sheepishly looking at them--XM-97 on the 
           floor.

                                      DR. ORO
                              (mouths silently)
                        I dropped it.

                                      SMITH
                              (mouths silently)
                        No shit.

           Bodette squints in the dark.  Nods.

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        Stairs.  

           INT. DIFFERENT REAPER CORRIDOR - MORNING

           The One-Eyed Reaper races down the corridor in a rage--
           SNARLING and SNIFFING the air.  

           A PASSING REAPER gets too close.  The One-Eyed behemoth 
           jerks the PLASMA WEAPON out of the other’s hand 
           furiously, and sends it slamming into a wall.

           Talons load and prep the weapon.  

           INT. REAPER HARVESTER CATWALK CORRIDOR - MORNING

           Smith, Bodette, and Oro creep off the stairs into a 
           corridor that is blue-tinged with ambient light.  No 
           doubt, that way leads back to the Inverted Pyramid...

           INT. REAPER HARVESTER CATWALK - MOMENTS LATER

           Our heroes peek out of the corridor leading to the 
           catwalk.  No handles--just a flat grate a couple hundred 
           yards long and six feet wide.  Straight to the Inverted 
           Pyramid.

           CLICK CLICK CLICK...talons on metal.  Behind them.  A 
           Reaper is coming this way.

                                      SMITH
                        That’s not good.

           Closer.  It’s running.  They can’t retreat.  
                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        Too far.  Never make it...

                                      DR. ORO
                        Oh, crap.  Oh, crap!  What do we 
                        do?

           Good question.  There’s no where else to go.  Two 
           options, forward or down.

           INT. REAPER HARVESTER CATWALK CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           The One-Eyed Reaper runs towards the blue glow, 
           practically foaming at the mouth with rage.  

           INT. REAPER HARVESTER CATWALK - CONTINUOUS

           It runs down the catwalk--stops halfway along the length.   *

           No Smith.  No Oro.  No Bodette in sight.

           CLOSE ON CATWALK:

           Fingers.  

           UNDER CATWALK:

           We find our boys dangling--fingers hanging onto the 
           grating for dear life.  It’s a long way down.

           ON CATWALK:

           The One-Eyed Reaper SNIFFS the air.  His eye narrows--
           walks forward...

           UNDER CATWALK:

           ...and steps on Smith’s fingers.  

           Smith makes the worst “O face” mankind has ever 
           witnessed.  Screaming silently.  Gritting his teeth.  
           Bodette and Oro watch in horror, pleading with eyes for 
           him to not make a peep.

           He keeps silent.  But he’s kickin’ the hell out of his 
           feet.  

           ON CATWALK:

           The One-Eyed Reaper heads back the way it came.  Slowly.

           TRACKING WITH IT:

           Over its shoulder WE SEE Smith, Bodette, and Oro climb 
           back onto the catwalk.  
           Smith shakes his fingers in a silent pain dance.  They 
           unsling weapons quietly--raise their guns...

           The Reaper cuts that one eye sharply to the side.  IT 
           KNOWS!  

           SAME INSTANT: Our boys FIRE as The One-Eyed Reaper swings 
           under the catwalk.  Bullets ricochet.  Sparks fly from 
           the metal.

           Ridiculously agile.  It crawls along the bottom of the 
           catwalk towards them just as fast as you can run, and our 
           Boys can’t hit it...

                                      DR. ORO
                        Run!

           They do.  Beating feet for the Inverted Pyramid.

           INT. INVERTED PYRAMID - CONTINUOUS

           Scared shitless, Smith, Oro, and Bodette run in.  Reeling 
           where they stand as they look down.  The floor is like 
           glass.  Completely TRANSPARENT.  A mesmerizing view into 
           the swirling energy inside that Inverted Pyramid below.

           A PLASMA BLAST jerks them back to reality.  Controls near 
           the entrance--Smith and Oro press buttons, as Bodette 
           drops to a knee and FIRES down the catwalk...

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        Hurry up!

           He unloads down the gangway--PLASMA ROUNDS rip through 
           the air in reply.  Bodette drops the mag--swaps out 
           another...

                                      GENERAL BODETTE
                        Now would be nice..!

           He sprays another burst down the catwalk, as somebody 
           FINALLY hits the right button.  A DOOR ROLLS DOWN...

           But, one more Plasma Blast makes it in.  That is the one 
           that General Bodette takes to the chest, knocking him 
           across that room.

           SLAM.  The door closes.  

                                      SMITH
                        That thing is really startin’ to 
                        piss me off!

                                      DR. ORO
                        Oh, God.  Is he dead?
           Smith drops to his knees next to Bodette--nods sadly.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Oh, man.  Oh, man.  You know what 
                        this means, don’t ya?  I’m gonna 
                        get it next.  Sweet flamin’ Elvis, 
                        man...I’m a Red Shirt.

                                      SMITH
                        Pull it together...  

                                      DR. ORO
                        You’re not the science wienie with 
                        zero Kung Fu!  I am so 
                        unbelievably screwed.  

           WHAM!  The One-Eyed Reaper is knocking.  Smith and Oro 
           turn their attention to the room.

           Representations of the SOLAR SYSTEM flicker in mid-air.  
           Earth in a different place in each.  Past, present, 
           future.  Coordinates.  Tracking.

           They look at swirling energy below their feet.

                                      SMITH
                        What now?

                                      DR. ORO
                        I have no idea.

           Smith grabs him.

                                      SMITH
                        Listen, Kid.  This is it.  You 
                        figured out their technology.  You 
                        figured out how send messages 
                        through time.  It’s up to you.  
                        Think!  You know how to do this...

                                      DR. ORO
                        I know how to do this...

           Oro nods nervously.  Shaking.  Thinking as he looks down.

                                      DR. ORO (CONT’D)
                        OK...OK, it’s a simple containment 
                        field.  Turn off the containment 
                        and the power should flow into the 
                        circuitry and overload.  

           They turn to the computer control station behind them.  A 
           disorienting kaleidoscope of about ten KA-BILLION 
           buttons.  Levers.  Dials.

           All labeled in Reaper Language.
                                      SMITH
                        Um.  

                                      DR. ORO
                        The blinking one.

                                      SMITH
                        They’re all blinking, Nimrod.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Well, hell, I don’t know.

                                      SMITH
                        You’re the friggin’ scientist.  
                        So...science, already.

           EXT. MIDDLE-CLASS TOWNHOUSE (PAST) - MORNING

           Riley runs up and down the sidewalk.  Shivering.  Wet.  
           Snow stuck to her hair.  She doesn’t care.   A trembling 
           nervous wreck.  

           She looks like just another crazy person on the streets 
           of DC about now.

           Searching the faces of everyone she passes--looking for 
           the man she loves.  Grabbing people.  Turning them 
           around.  Pushing others out of the way.    

           Desperate powerlessness.  Praying.  

           Trying to will a miracle out of thin air with hope alone.   *

           INT. INVERTED PYRAMID - MORNING

           Oro runs his hands through his hair.

                                      SMITH
                        You just said you could figure 
                        this out!

                                      DR. ORO
                        No, I said I knew how to do it.  
                        Not, you know...how to do it!

           Smith paces.  The BANGS on the door are relentless.  
           GROWLS from outside.  Oro looks down again, and points 
           all those buttons.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Any breach in the field should do 
                        it.  But, I can’t read that!

                                      SMITH
                        Just breach that field down there?
                                      DR. ORO
                        I think...

           SMITH FIRES HIS XM-97 into the transparent floor--
           emptying the magazine into it.  It splinters and cracks 
           where the rounds impact.  He stomps the area.  Over and 
           over, till he stomps a hole into the floor.  

                                      DR. ORO
                        What the hell are you doing!

           Smith drags Bodette’s body over to the hole--drops it in.   *
           The corpse drops like a stone, punching a General sized 
           hole through the containment field.  

           Immediately, the controls behind them light up--
           screeching alarms.  Below, the breach grows, as dancing 
           snakes of energy Arc.  Spreading. 

           The floating representations of the Solar System begin to 
           move.  Chaotically.  One spins backwards.

                                      DR. ORO
                        It’s loosing it’s place in space 
                        and time...

           A SCREECHING ALARM blares behind them.  A representation 
           of the ship appears in the air, a blue orb surrounds it.  
           GROWING.  What must be Reaper Numbers tick next to it--go 
           red and blink.  

           The floating Solar Systems flicker on and off.  Planets.  
           Saturn.  Mercury.  Earth.  Mars...

           Smith smiles the world’s greatest self-satisfied grin.  
           Till, Oro taps him on the shoulder--points down. 

           The glass-like floor is cracking--spider webbing beneath 
           their feet.  Pieces fall into the swirling energy below.

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - MORNING

           The air around Smith’s Harvester Ship WARPS.  A growing 
           blue iridescent sphere emanates.  Then, as far as the eye 
           can see, the same thing happens to the other ships. 

           Cascading.  Spreading like a wave.

           The very fabric of empty space bends around them...

           INT. INVERTED PYRAMID - MORNING

           The floor falls apart--the hole spreading out from the 
           middle.  We find Smith and Oro with their backs against a 
           wall.
                                      SMITH
                        This gonna hurt?

                                      DR. ORO
                        Having every atom in your body 
                        ripped apart and sent through 
                        space?

                                      SMITH
                        Damnit.  Know how hard I’ve worked 
                        to not die on one of these damned 
                        ships?

           BEAT.

                                      DR. ORO
                              (dawning)
                        We’re on one of their ships...

           He excitedly shakes Smith silly.

                                      DR. ORO (CONT’D)
                        We’re already on a ship!

                                      SMITH
                        Highest IQ in the world, huh?

                                      DR. ORO
                        How do they keep us from gettin’ 
                        their technology?

           DING--we have a winner.

                                      SMITH
                        Kill one here, it aint’ goin’ 
                        anywhere.  We can take its Device!

                                      DR. ORO
                        We’re gonna live!  Spock be 
                        praised, I’m gonna live!

           Smith grabs his rifle and pounds on the door controls, 
           Oro right behind him, rifle in hand.

           KA-THUNK--the door opens four inches and stops as a 
           POWERFUL SHUTTER shakes through the ship, knocking it off 
           its track.

           Suddenly, the door is thrown up with a FURIOUS GROWL--
           screeching on the rails.  Smith and Oro find themselves 
           staring at the The One-Eyed Reaper.

           It knocks the XM-97 out of Smith’s hands with a 
           lightening quick swipe.  
           Oro opens fire, saving Smith’s ass.  He hits The One-Eyed 
           Reaper.  The wall.  The floor.  The ceiling.  When the 
           DEAFENING BLASTS subside, the One-Eyed Reaper is gone.

           Just a trail of black blood...

                                      DR. ORO 
                        That’s right!  I’m goin’ Master 
                        Chief on your asses now!  

                                      SMITH
                        Come on!

           They make for the door--the ship shaking itself apart...

           INT. REAPER CATWALK (PYRAMID ENTRANCE) - CONTINUOUS

           Oro is out first.

                                      DR. ORO
                        Let’s go!  I...

           THWACK--a sinister black blade slams into Oro’s chest.

                                      SMITH
                        Kid!

                                      DR. ORO (CONT’D)
                        I...

           He drops to his knees.

                                      DR. ORO (CONT’D)
                        ...really hate being right all the 
                        time.

           Oro tumbles over the edge, as a PECULIAR SNARL turns 
           Smith’s blood to ice.  The One-Eyed Reaper didn’t run 
           away--it’s perched over the Pyramid doorway.  Waiting.

           Smith raises his weapon...

                                      SMITH
                        Sleep in heavenly peace, you ugly 
                        son of a...

           CLICK--empty.

                                      SMITH (CONT’D)
                        ...oh shit.

           INT. REAPER HARVESTER CATWALK - CONTINUOUS

           The ship shakes.  Pieces fall.  The blue light of the 
           Pyramid is a BLINDING STROBE, as Smith runs for his 
           fucking life.  
           The One-Eyed Reaper LEAPS, tackles Smith...

           They tumble off the catwalk!  Falling...

           INT. REAPER HARVESTER BAY - MORNING

           Smith and The One-Eyed Reaper SLAM into the downward 
           slanted walls.  And slide--The Reaper tries to claw 
           itself to a stop.  

           Smith ain’t havin’ it.  He rolls onto the thing’s back, 
           grabs its head and BASHES ITS FACE repeatedly into the 
           wall as they slide downward...

           EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS

           The curves of a million iridescent blue orbs break the 
           edge of the atmosphere.  And they’re still growing--
           bending the space around them...  

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - CONTINUOUS

           The orbs extend DEEP below ground.  They’re beginning to 
           overlap.  Bending.  Concrete and asphalt on the ground 
           start to crack...

           Buildings are torn in half.  The GROUND SHAKES 
           VIOLENTLY...

           And, for once, The Reapers are running around in a panic.   *

           INT. REAPER HARVESTER BAY - CONTINUOUS

           Smith tumbles ass over tea kettle down the wall--a dozen 
           new bloody wounds.  The edge is coming.  He can’t stop 
           himself... 

           He slides over the edge of the opening!

           EXT. REAPER HARVESTER (UNDERNEATH) - CONTINUOUS

           Smith hangs from the edge with one hand, dangling under 
           the ship--struggles to pull himself up...

           But, The One-Eyed Reaper falls out, raking RAZOR TALONS 
           DOWN SMITH’S BACK--deep and horrendous wounds, before it 
           tumbles out of sight.

           Smith SCREAMS.  His grips slips.

           Down he falls...

           EXT. SKY OVER DC - CONTINUOUS

           Tumbling ass over tea kettle, Smith lands on one of the 
           floating bodies.  In agony, and bloody from his wounds.  
           Weakening by the second.  He falls--just manages to hang 
           on to the body’s belt.  Dangling.

           The One-Eyed Reaper is twenty feet below him on another 
           floating body--ROARING white hot fury at Smith.  It jumps 
           from body to body, till it’s standing on the one Smith 
           hangs from.  

           It leans in--sticks its hideous face to within an inch of 
           Smith’s with a SNARL.  

           A death inducing fall below.  A murderous Reaper in his 
           face above.  Then, something catches his eye...

           A PISTOL.  The body they’re on is a Soldier!  And, his 
           sidearm less than a foot from Smith’s hand.  

           The sneering One-Eyed Reaper lifts Smith up to its face 
           by the back of the shirt.  The damned thing actually 
           laughs.  Gutteral.  Croaking.  Demonic.  Pale as a ghost 
           and bleeding out, Smith chuckles with it.

           Then, he wraps his arms around the son of a bitch’s head, 
           and SHOVES THE PISTOL into its eye.

                                      SMITH 
                        Didn’t see that comin’.  Did ya, 
                        Gomer?

           BOOM!  He blows half the Reaper’s head off.  Dropping the 
           gun, Smith grabs The Blackberry strapped its chest and 
           falls...

           TRACKING WITH HIS FALL:

           Smith’s bloody fingers press the Sequence...

           Plummeting towards the ground.  Coming fast.  The air 
           around him begins to warp...

           He vanishes into thin air--four feet from the ground.

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - CONTINUOUS

           At the same moment, the first Harvester ship disappears 
           with a MASSIVE EXPLOSION--TAKING WITH IT A MILES AND 
           MILES DEEP HUNK OF EARTH...

           Molten rock SPEWS.  

           MOVING OVER THE PLANET:

           Over and over.  Ship after ship.  Again and again.  
           Deeper and deeper.  The Earth shakes.  Fissures, miles 
           wide and deep, appear as the planet rips itself apart...
           EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS

           Planet Earth comes apart.  Ripped in half by the rending 
           of space itself.  Then, suddenly, half of it VANISHES...

           The remainder tumbles out of orbit.  Oceans freezing as 
           they float away.  The molten core hardening.  The blue 
           atmosphere fading away in wisps like so much smoke...

           EXT. SATURN - CONTINUOUS

           The rest of Earth appears silently out of bending space.  

           A debris trail following it for millions of miles.  Dead 
           Reapers and their Ships tumble with it.  

           EXT. MIDDLE-CLASS TOWNHOUSE - MORNING

           A crowd is gathered around something on a sidewalk.  
           Riley shoves her way through, smiling from ear to ear.

                                      RILEY
                        Smith?  I knew it!  I knew 
                        you’d...

           She breaks past the crowd, and finds our boy Smith laying 
           in a pool of his own blood--pale as a sheet. 

           Riley drops to her knees--cradles his head.  

                                      RILEY 
                        Please.  You gotta be OK.  Marry 
                        me.  It’s over.  I just want to be 
                        Mrs. Smith.  Just be OK...

           Smith gives her a weak smile.  

                                      SMITH
                        I...I...

                                      RILEY
                        Yes?

                                      SMITH
                        I...couldn’t even get you to go 
                        out with me

                                      RILEY
                        What..?

                                      SMITH
                        You wouldn’t even give me the time 
                        of day, Riley.  You never married 
                        me.

           He touches her face, goes on with labored breath.
                                      SMITH (CONT’D)
                        But, I fell in love with you the 
                        moment I saw you.  
                              (fading)
                        Couldn’t let anything happen to 
                        you.  Even if...even if you never 
                        loved me back... 

           Smith goes still.

                                      RILEY
                        Smith?  James..!

           She shakes him.  Screams at the crowd.

                                      RILEY 
                        What are you lookin’ at?  Call an 
                        ambulance!
                              (to Smith)
                        No..wake up.  Wake up!

           He’s dead.  It takes her till this moment to accept it.

           Tears running down her face, she takes the watch off his 
           wrist--clutches it tightly.  

                                      RILEY
                        Merry Christmas, James Smith.

           Filthy.  Crying.  Shivering.  Riley disappears into the 
           crowd...

                                                            FADE TO:

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC (ABOVE) - NIGHT

           WE MOVE over America’s Capitol.  It most definitely “Tis 
           the Season”.  CHRISTMAS LIGHTS are everywhere.  Tinsel 
           and decoration gleam--monuments are bathed in green and 
           red flood lights.

           INT. CAFE - NIGHT

           Riley sits alone at a table--the cafe empty.  Her wounds 
           are bandaged.  Her clothes clean.

           A TV IS ON.  

           CLOSE ON TV: PRESIDENT MALLOY at a Press Conference.  The 
           FIRST LADY and their DAUGHTER look on.
                                      REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Though the Secret Service wasn’t 
                        able to identify the source of the 
                        anonymous tip, sources have 
                        confirmed that there was an 
                        unknown mechanical problem found 
                        with the helicopter the First Lady 
                        and their daughter were due to fly 
                        on.  Word is, a catastrophic 
                        failure was avoided...    

           Riley picks up her coffee and heads for the door with a 
           smile.

                                      RILEY
                        Don’t mention it.

           EXT. CAFE - CONTINUOUS

           There’s something familiar about this cafe.  Maybe it’s 
           that blown bulb in the strand of Christmas lights.

           Riley exits--stares at the stars.  SOMEONE approaches, 
           waving a note.  

           It’s SMITH.  The Smith from this day.  

                                      SMITH
                        You the one that bailed me out?

           She smiles.

                                      SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Do I know you?

                                      RILEY
                        Not yet.

           The OLD LADY from the beginning of our story comes out of 
           the cafe, and lays the skunk eye on that blown bulb.

                                      OLD LADY
                        Abner?  Abner?  Abner!  

           Abner comes out, sporting his Santa hat and carrying a 
           ladder.

                                      OLD LADY (CONT’D)
                        There’s a light out.  Didn’t you 
                        hear me yelling for you?   

                                      ABNER
                        France could hear you yelling for 
                        me.

           As the Old Lady bitches at Abner...
                                      RILEY
                              (to Smith)
                        How about a walk?

           He’s smitten.

                                      SMITH
                        Where we goin’?

           The watch on Riley’s wrist, Dead Smith’s watch, BEEPS.

           She freezes.  Listening.  Waiting.  Looking around, as 
           ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENS.  She cracks a mile wide 
           smile.  

                                      RILEY
                        Any where we want.

           They head off down the sidewalk.  

           Riley tosses The Blackberry into a trash can, wraps an 
           arm around Smith’s arm, and lays her head on his 
           shoulder.

                                      SMITH
                        You gonna tell me who you are?

                                      RILEY
                        James...we’ve got all the time in 
                        the world to get to that.

           Picture perfect.  Arm and arm, they stroll down the 
           sidewalk, as a gentle flutter of snow falls.  The lights 
           and decorations blink.  They pass other smiling couples.  
           Norman Rockwell couldn’t have painted this ending...  

                                                             CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON TRASH CAN:

           The Blackberry among empty coffee cups and newspapers.  
           As the Christmas Carols play in the background...

           ...it POWERS ON.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK.
