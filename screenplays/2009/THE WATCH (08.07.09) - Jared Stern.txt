                     outer space would say I want to see the manager.”

           A starry sky hangs over a giant

           COSTCO

           It’s three a.m. in suburbia. Flood lights drench an empty 
           football field of a parking lot. The ‘T’ in the sign blinks 
           on and off.

           INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE STORE

           A humongous 72-PACK OF TOILET PAPER slides along the concrete 
           floor. It’s pushed by a middle-aged Latino SECURITY GUARD, 
           who edges it up against a matching package, then collapses 
           atop his makeshift bed. Ahhhh. He shuts his eyes. Just then, 
           a distant...THUD. Muttering. The guard opens an eye...

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Hector, you ain’t done cleaning up 
                        yet? I know you don’t wanna see 
                        your wife, but damn...

           No answer. Then a SKITTERING noise. The guard sits up.

           BEVERAGE AISLE - MOMENTS LATER

           The guard tiptoes past oversized soda boxes. It’s a little 
           unsettling in here at night--one man dwarfed amidst the huge 
           stacks. He spots an overturned case of CAPRI SUN juices. The 
           guard shakes his head, heaves the box back onto the shelf...

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        New kid can’t stack for--

           But something on the floor catches his eye...LIQUID. Leading 
           off down the aisle. The guard follows the trail. It ends at 
           the foot of a towering PILE OF MICHELINS up against a wall. 
           That’s weird. The guard shakes his head, leaning on the stack 
           of tires which suddenly SLIDES ASIDE, revealing an entry to a

           DARK PASSAGE

           The guard’s shaking hand clicks on his flashlight as he 
           follows the liquid trail down narrow metal steps into a 
           hallway. A tangle of mechanized panels and cords. Blinking 
           lights. 

           Something drips down onto the guard’s hat. He spoons a bit 
           off and inspects--PHOSPHORESCENT GOOP. What the--? CUT TO:

           A THUMB AND FOREFINGER

           But they’re unlike any we’ve seen before. Not human. Between 
           them is a tiny DRINKING STRAW.

                                 UNASSUMING VOICE (O.S.)
                        Damnit.
                         Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    2.

           The fingers struggle to jab the straw into a CAPRI SUN POUCH.

                                 UNASSUMING VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Why do they have to make it so--?

           The creature stops, sensing something, drops the juice.

           THE GUARD

           nervously inches through a doorway. Steps on something. It’s 
           the CAPRI SUN AND THE STRAW. He picks them up, easily jabs 
           the straw in. Takes a sip. From above, a frustrated SNARL.

           The guard glances up at the darkened rafters, a look of sheer 
           terror crossing his face. He drops the juice and races out...

           COSTCO AISLES - MOMENTS LATER

           The guard runs for his life. We can hear the creature gaining 
           behind. The guard reaches the FRONT DOOR. Desperately fishes 
           for his keys. Finally produces the right one.

           PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           The guard stumbles out. Rushes across the dark pavement.

           CREATURE’S POV

           Stalking his prey as the guard reaches his car.

           IN THE SUBCOMPACT

           The guard turns the ignition but it won’t start. WHUMP! We 
           hear the creature land on the roof. Finally the engine 
           rumbles, when--SCREEEEEE!--the car’s roof is PEELED OPEN like 
           a can of sardines by two INHUMAN HANDS. As the creature’s 
           BLACK TONGUE reaches down, licking the guard’s stubbly face 
           like a popsicle, his scream echoes and we SMASH TO BLACK.

           INT. SUNLIT UPPER EAST SIDE BEDROOM - MORNING

           MARV the Boston Terrier licks the kind face of the peacefully 
           sleeping EVAN TRAUTWIG (30s).

                                 EVAN
                                 (awakens, hushed)
                        Later today, Marv, when you’re 
                        napping, I’m gonna lick your face. 
                        Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

           Evan slides out of bed, gently patting his sleeping wife.

           ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Our opening credits run as Evan waits, the iPod buds in his 
           ears playing an indie cover of Walking on Sunshine. 
                         Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    3.

           He wears the city uniform--black tee, black jeans, black 
           Chucks. An ASIAN JOGGER enters, iPod buds of his own. They 
           give each other only the tiniest hint of acknowledgment. 

           LEXINGTON AVENUE - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan walks Marv through a sea of rush hour pedestrians. Each 
           in their own little bubble. Quick strides, no eye contact. 
           Evan is at peace--this is just how he likes the world to be. 

           Evan plunks down change and takes a paper at A NEWSSTAND 
           without even looking at the GUY behind the counter. Nearing 
           his building, Evan puts a bill in the change cup of a 
           HOMELESS DUDE who wears a tinfoil hat and murmurs to himself.

           LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan sits at his drawing desk, finishing a POLITICAL CARTOON. 
           His wife, ABBY (early-30s, warm but no pushover, business 
           suit), leans in from behind and wraps her arms around him. 

                                 ABBY
                                 (re: cartoon)
                        It’s funny.

                                 EVAN
                        No it’s not.

                                 ABBY
                        What? There’s a donkey and an 
                        elephant and they’re the two 
                        parties and--

                                 EVAN
                        You are a terrible liar.

                                 ABBY
                        I hate you.

                                 EVAN
                                 (smiles)
                        Again, terrible.

           She kisses him sweetly. Outside, a JACKHAMMER pounds away.

                                 ABBY
                                 (slams the window shut)
                        How does that not drive you crazy?

                                 EVAN
                        I can’t hear it over the sirens.
                                 (off her look)
                        We’re gonna have the talk again, 
                        aren’t we?
                         Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    4.

                                 ABBY
                        There’s no point.
                                 (unable to help herself)
                        Although...we wouldn’t have any of 
                        this in the suburbs.

                                 EVAN
                        You’re right. We wouldn’t have any 
                        of “this”. We wouldn’t have the 
                        entire world at our doorstep. 
                        No...arthouse films, no...opera, 
                        no...Ethiopian food.

                                 ABBY
                        We eat pizza, sit at home, and 
                        watch movies with explosions.

                                 EVAN
                        True, but it’s nice knowing all 
                        that other stuff is out there.

                                 ABBY
                        Evan, haven’t you noticed we’re 
                        alone here? All our friends’ve 
                        moved somewhere with a front lawn.

                                 EVAN
                        They haven’t all moved.
                                 (searching)
                        What about...Asian Jogger Elevator 
                        Man. Oh, and there’s Riley!
                                 (off her look)
                        The homeless guy with the tinfoil 
                        hat.
                                 (then)
                        You really think we’re gonna make 
                        friends in the suburbs? Those 
                        people are like Walmart-super-sized 
                        annoying. Worse than that, they’re 
                        dangerous. In the city you can rest 
                        easy knowing a guy just wants to 
                        mug you at gunpoint for your 
                        wallet. But in the suburbs there’s 
                        weird stuff. Serial killers. 
                        Dateline people, Abby.
                                 (she sighs, slumps; he 
                                  sees, softens)
                        You used to love it here.

                                 ABBY
                                 (frustrated at herself)
                        I know. I was always the cool one! 
                        But something’s changed. Did you 
                        know I want a linen closet? I woke 
                        up the other day desperately 
                        wishing I had a closet.

                        For my linens. Ugh. I’ve become 
                        that cliched woman who wants a 
                        white picket fence and I don’t care 
                        who knows it. They can mock me but 
                        I’ll shiv ‘em with a piece of white 
                        picket and throw ‘em in my linen 
                        closet.

                                 EVAN
                        See. I told you there were crazy 
                        killers in the suburbs.

                                 ABBY
                                 (softens)
                        Evan, I don’t want to raise our kid 
                        in the city. 

           Now we’re really getting to it...

                                 EVAN
                        Whoa, kid? Did it work? Did you pee 
                        on something plastic?

                                 ABBY
                                 (smiles)
                        Not yet. But when it happens, 
                        wouldn’t it be nice for you to 
                        teach our son how to throw a spiral 
                        in our own backyard?
                                 (off his look)
                        Wouldn’t it be nice for our son to 
                        teach you how to throw a spiral in 
                        our own backyard?

                                 EVAN
                        I’m gonna have to learn baseball.

                                 ABBY
                        That’s football, Evan.
                                 (then, gently)
                        We’re growing up.

                                 EVAN
                                 (nods, then)
                        Just promise me that growing up 
                        doesn’t mean we’re gonna lose the 
                        us I like, okay? Tell me that 
                        moving out to Sameville isn’t gonna 
                        turn me into one of those guys in 
                        the mall parking lot chirping his 
                        alarm over and over because he 
                        can’t tell his tan mini van from 
                        the other thousand tan mini vans.

                                 ABBY
                        Evan, I like you how you are. Lord 
                        knows why, but I do. And I promise 
                        nothing’s gonna change you. 

                                 EVAN
                        Not even a house in the suburbs?

           She looks at him. Holds out her little finger...

                                 ABBY
                        Pinky swear.

           He looks at her. Really wants to believe that’s true. Links 
           pinkies.

                                 EVAN
                        Not even that little Cape Cod you 
                        loved? 

                                 ABBY
                        Not even that one.

                                 EVAN
                        The one with the red door...

                                 ABBY
                        Mm hmm.

           He takes a deep breath, reaches into his pocket...

                                 EVAN
                        With both a top and a bottom 
                        lock...

           He removes a set of HOUSE KEYS, which dangle on his finger.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        We don’t go into a Chili’s. Ever.

           She gasps, realizing those keys belong to her dream house.

                                 ABBY
                        Shut up! The one with the red 
                        door?!

                                 EVAN
                        And a huge linen closet.
                                 (then)
                        The 8th or 9th time you have the 
                        conversation it starts to sink in.

                                 (leaps into his arms)
                        I love you.

                                 (she kisses him; he pulls 
                                  back to add...)
                        No TCBY. No fro-yo of any kind.

                        I shall wear no khaki pants. No 
                        chinos. No Dockers. No--

           She finally kisses his mouth shut.

           EXT. TURNPIKE - DAY

           The Trautwigs’ brand new PRIUS drags a U-HAUL trailer past A 
           SIGN welcoming them to TEPPERTOWN: America’s First Suburb. 

           TEPPERTOWN STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           Abby happily drives while Evan looks out the window, on edge. 
           We hear Walking on Sunshine again...only now at a WARPED 
           SPEED. EVAN’S POV--a freak show in slow motion. Everything 
           too clean, too perfect, too nice. A groundskeeper with A 
           CHAINSAW trims a topiary at TOWN HALL. A MASSIVE HUMMER pulls 
           alongside, breathing down on him. 

           EXT. THE TRAUTWIGS’ NEW BLOCK - MOMENTS LATER

           A sweltering Indian Summer afternoon in this beautifully 
           manicured planned community, similar style houses repeating 
           to infinity. The U-Haul’d Prius pulls into the drive of a 
           Cape Cod with a lovely red door. Abby hops out, runs to the 
           mailbox, psyched...

                                 ABBY
                        We have a mailbox!
                                 (playing with the flag)
                        And it has one of these things!

           IN THE LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan and Abby unpack candlesticks. He tosses the wadded 
           newspaper in the trash. She fishes it out.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)

                                 (shakes his head)
                        That did it. The planet is now 
                        officially saved.

                        Y’gotta start somewhere.

           Offscreen, Marv GROWLS.

           TRAUTWIGS’ FRONT LAWN - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan pops out to see Marv snarling at their next-door 
           neighbor, GARY--a small, creepy man in an old military jacket 
           who waters his plants, drinking coffee.

                                 EVAN
                        Marv, stop that.

           Gary GROWLS back. Marv whimpers away. Evan continues to the  
           U-Haul. He gives a look back at Gary, who sips his coffee and 
           stares. That was weird. 

           Evan grabs a fancy-ish lamp from the trailer. Heads back to 
           the front door, when...FSK! FSK! FSK! The sprinklers snap to 
           life. Evan is soaked.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Abby...?
                                 (struggles)
                        Baby, can you turn off the--?

           He tumbles to the ground. The lamp cracks into a million 
           pieces. The sprinklers come to a stop.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Whatup, CBGB?

           At the foot of the walk, BOB FINNERTY has just turned off the 
           sprinklers. His tricked-out SUV still running nearby. He is 
           as comfortable in suburbia as Evan is not. Not cheesy though--
           Bob really makes the Tommy Bahama thing work. Evan struggles 
           to his feet, squishes his way to Bob.

                                 BOB
                        Bob Finnerty. Welcome to the nabe!

                                 EVAN
                        Evan Trautwig. Thanks, man.

           In the passenger seat of the Jeep sits Bob’s daughter 
           CHELSEA. Fourteen. She’s blossomed into a Megan Fox 
           overnight. She points out a neighboring home...

                                 CHELSEA
                        Dad, that’s Amberly’s house. Can I 
                        go say hi?
                         Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    9.

                                 BOB
                        Just stay put, okay, Pumpkin? 
                        Daddy’s almost done talking to his 
                        new friend.

                                 CHELSEA
                        Friend? Really? Because when we 
                        were driving by and he fell you 
                        laughed and called him a hipster 
                        douche--

                                 BOB
                        You and Amberly wear helmets if you 
                        ride bikes, okay, Sugar Bear?

           Chelsea ROLLS HER EYES as she hops out of the car. Bob sighs 
           as she goes, still his little baby...

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Angels live in a child’s smile.

                                 EVAN
                        Well. I should probably go dry off.

           Evan turns towards home. As Bob returns to his truck...

                                 BOB
                        Hey, about the lamp, I’m the 
                        General Manager down at the Costco 
                        on Old Country. Come by, I’ll give 
                        you the friends and family and 
                        ladies-with-no-bra discount.

                                 EVAN
                        That lamp is Design Within Reach.

                                 BOB
                        That lamp is crap on your lawn. 
                        Think about it.

                                 EVAN
                        Thanks again for the sprinklers.

           Bob pops open his trunk, grabs a LAWN SIGN...

                                 BOB
                        No problem, Skinny Jeans. It’s my 
                        sworn duty.

           ...plunges it into the edge of Evan’s front yard. It’s the 
           iconic NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH SIGN. The silhouetted burglar 
           warned that he’s being observed.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)

                        Do you really?

           Bob turns to see Chelsea and AMBERLY in a neighboring yard 
           with two slightly older jock boys. Sweet quarterback JASON 
           and cocky lineman SCOTTIE...

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Tomorrow’s Hell Night. We drive 
                        around and mess stuff up. It’s 
                        gonna be off the chizzain.

           Chelsea’s not so sure. Jason sees, whispers...

                                 JASON
                        We can sit in the backseat and make 
                        fun of how lame it is.

           She can’t suppress a smile just as her father storms over.

                                 BOB
                        Howdy, gentlemen. I’m Chelsea’s 
                        daddy. Sorry to break up the party 
                        but little Chels has to get home 
                        right away. To take her Herpes 
                        medication. For the raging case of 
                        Herpes she has. On her lady parts.

           Chelsea gives a look back at Jason as Bob drags her off. Abby 
           opens the door to find a soggy Evan as Bob’s truck peels off.

                        Maybe you should join. It’d be a 
                        way to meet the neighbors, make

                        Okay. Fine. You actually moved

                                 (lifts a box)
                        Phew...gonna sleep well tonight.

           INT. THE TRAUTWIGS’ BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Quiet. Peaceful. Abby and Marv sleep soundly. But EVAN 
           is...WIDE AWAKE, staring at the ceiling. Flips the pillow. 
           The silence is broken by the sound of male voices. Outside.

           Evan tiptoes to the window, spies GARY and a HEAVYSET MAN 
           struggling to carry A LARGE WOODEN CRATE to Gary’s cellar 
           door.

                                 HEAVYSET MAN
                        Is it the good stuff?

                                 GARY
                        Oh yeah. This’ll do some damage.

           Sensing something, Gary turns towards Evan...who recedes into 
           the shadows, just avoiding being seen. Evan looks at Abby, 
           then back to that window. Do some damage? That’s weird. 

           He shakes Abby, whisper-shouts...

                                 EVAN
                        C’mere. The neighbor. He’s got this 
                        crate--!

                                 ABBY
                                 (half-awake)
                        I was having the linen dream.

           He drags her to the window, carefully peers out to see... 
           nothing. They’re gone.

                                 EVAN
                        There was a-- Abby, I-- 

           She looks at him, concerned.

                                 ABBY
                        Are you gonna be okay here?

                                 EVAN
                        I’m sorry. I guess I’m just getting 
                        used to it.

           She kisses him on the cheek and climbs back in bed. He goes 
           to shut the blinds, only to see GARY staring at him from his 
           bedroom window across the way. No way Evan’s sleeping 
           tonight.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - THE NEXT DAY

           The Prius drives through town. Pulls up in front of the Post 
           Office. Moments later, Abby puts a dime in the meter...

                                 ABBY
                        Go get some quarters while I do the 
                        change of address?

                                 EVAN
                        That’s final, isn’t it? Change of 
                        address.

                                 ABBY
                        I know. Exciting!

           She runs off. Evan pops his iPod buds in, trying to tune out 
           the world, as he hustles towards a CONVENIENCE STORE. A trio 
           of pert MILF-y HOUSEWIVES POWERWALK BY, enthusiastically 
           waving hello, smiling creepily perfect white-stripped smiles. 
           Evan avoids eye contact. A NICE OLD MAN holds the store’s 
           door open for him.

                                 NICE OLD MAN
                        Whatcha listening to?

                                 EVAN
                        Music.

           IN THE STORE

           Evan plops a NEWSPAPER down. The CLERK (an odd, deadpan dude 
           with a nametag which reads LINUS) rings him up...

                                 LINUS
                        Good story on B7. Cow exploded in 
                        Ronkonkoma.

                                 EVAN
                        Guess I don’t have to read it then.

           INT. POST OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           As Abby pops some letters in the mail she catches sight of a 
           sign-up sheet for a speech on GLOBAL WARMING. Hmm. As she 
           reaches for the pen, she bumps into a man who reaches at the 
           same time. Middle age becomes him. This is PAUL SLOAN.

                        Yes, but it’s organic corn...
                                 (reads her name)
                        Abby with a Y Trautwig.

                                 ABBY
                                 (struggles to read his 
                                  signature)
                        Great to meet you, Paul...Svlerm.

                                 PAUL

                                 ABBY
                        Oh? So what are you...studying up 
                        on the enemy?

                                 PAUL
                        Actually most of our business is 
                        recycling now. Our company is 
                        incredibly green.

                                 ABBY
                        And my face is a little red. Maybe 
                        I’ll see you at the professor’s 
                        talk, Mr. Svlerm.

                                 PAUL
                        I’ll be in front, by the mosh pit. 

           She smiles, shakes her head as she walks off.

           INT. COSTCO - LATER

           Evan finishes filling out the membership form. The EMPLOYEE 
           hands him his card and a little KEYCHAIN. It’s a potato with 
           the Costco logo emblazoned on it.

                                 EMPLOYEE
                        Here’s your new member gift!

                                 EVAN
                        A potato.

                                 EMPLOYEE
                        Our Costco is built at the heart of 
                        Teppertown. Right where the old 
                        potato farm once stood--

           Evan tunes her out as Abby bounces over, mouth full...

                                 ABBY
                        I just had eight samples of 
                        Tillamook cheese and I’m gonna be 
                        sick. This place rocks.
                                 (he smiles politely)

                        After this I have to drop my resume 
                        at the school. Oh! And there’s this 
                        lecture...

           As she continues, Evan notices some WORKERS moving AN 
           IDENTICAL LARGE WOODEN CRATE, reminded of last night.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        ...tomorrow on global warming. 
                        Think of how much less guilty 
                        you’ll feel about ruining the 
                        planet after you’ve sat through a 
                        boring speech.
                                 (is he listening?)
                        Evan?

                                 EVAN
                        Hmm? Yeah. Sounds like a very 
                        inconvenient truth.

                                 ABBY
                        Are you alright?

                                 EVAN
                        Uh huh. I’ve just...never been in a 
                        Costco before.

                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        Once you go bulk you never go back.

           Reveal Bob, carrying the ugliest lamp you’ve ever seen.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Glad you took me up on the offer, 
                        Traut. This is a genuine Tiffany 
                        reproduction.

                                 EVAN
                        Actually, we’re just here to--

           The workers with THE CRATE accidentally BUMP EVAN. It’s 
           filled with harmless lettuce. A head falls to the floor.

                                 BOB
                        Guys, watch where you’re going! 
                        There’s no “I” in focus, but there 
                        is an “us”.

           Bob lowers the microphone on his standard-issue Costco 
           HEADSET broadcasting himself over the PA SYSTEM...

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        We’ve got a green head down in 
                        sector 33.
                                 (back to the Trautwigs)
                        Sorry you had to see that.

                                 ABBY
                        That’s right! You know, Evan did a 
                        little neighborhood watching of his 
                        own last night--

                                 BOB
                        Whoa. Ev-dog. What you oughta do is 
                        come and roll with the pros for a 
                        night. You definitely shouldn’t go 
                        rogue. 

                                 EVAN
                        I’m not sure if the Neighborhood 
                        Watch is really right for--

                                 BOB
                        I feel you. Not everybody has what 
                        it takes to be a Watchman. But you 
                        can certainly stop by for a night. 
                        Unless you’re allergic to 
                        awesomeness...?

           Bob reaches out for a fist pound. Evan turns to Abby, who 
           looks on hopefully. Reluctantly, Evan pounds Bob--he’s in.

                                 EVAN
                        I’ll take a Claritin.

                        And try the Tillamook! It’s to die.

           Bob flicks on his headset once again...

           Bob low-fives CUSTOMERS who wait in line for a SAMPLE STATION 
           where a woman makes cookies. He then dunks his hands into the 
           woman’s baking flour and claps them over his head ala LeBron.

                                 (off his look)
                        And, as another incentive, I find 
                        the idea of you doing something 
                        suburban extremely sexy.

                        Really? Because when we get home I 
                        was gonna mow the lawn. And rake 
                        the leaves. Maybe even...grout the 
                        bathroom.

                                 ABBY
                        You don’t know what grout is.

                                 EVAN
                        Nope. But it sounds hot. Grout.

           He shoves the cart. Hops on the back. She chases after.

           EXT. FINNERTY HOME - THAT NIGHT

           Evan rings the bell. Chelsea opens the door. Turns back...

                                 CHELSEA
                        It’s the Greenwich Village pussy.

           Chelsea skulks off. Bob’s wife BONNIE smiles warmly.

                                 BONNIE
                        Hi. Bonnie. Bob’s told us all about 
                        you. They’re ‘round back.

           IN THE BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           A cement hatch with a metal door--Bob’s 1950s FALLOUT 
           SHELTER. Evan knocks. CLANK CLANK. Bob swings the door open.

                                 BOB
                        ‘Sup, Lou Reed!

                        Is this a fallout shelter?

                                 BOB
                        It’s more than that, Evan.

                        This is the Neighborhood Watch HQ. 

                                 EVAN
                        Right. So I don’t exactly know how 
                        this works but I saw something last 
                        night. My neighbor? He was moving 
                        this big crate, and it just seemed 
                        weird.

                                 BOB
                                 (super serious)
                        Details. Describe the perps.

                                 EVAN
                        Uh, a couple white guys--

                        Two unidentified Caucasians. What 
                        kind of crate are we talking? Wood?

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah.

                                 BOB
                        Box shaped?

                                 EVAN
                        Yes.

                                 BOB
                        This is big. Get inside. We’ll need 
                        to dissect with the team.

           Bob hurries down into to the shelter. Evan follows, shocked 
           to find not a simple meeting room but a Cribs-worthy...

           MAN CAVE. Sweet stereo. Videogames. Foosball. A humongous 
           flat-screen currently displays Monday Night Football. 
           JAMARCUS (30s, African-American, bone-dry wit) and FRANKLIN 
           (30s, sweet, couldn’t hurt a fly) sit on the couch, watching 
           their beloved Jets. Bob grabs a coozied beer...

                        Hey, team! I’ve got a friend I’d 
                        like you to meet. Evan Troutlips, 
                        this is Jamarcus.

                        And this is Franklin.

                        I know you. You ever ride crotch 
                        rockets with the 17th Street Crips?

                                 EVAN
                                 (beat, then)
                        No. So...about my neighbor? We were 
                        gonna dissect?

                                 BOB
                        Whoa. Let’s get acclimated first.
                                 (goes behind bar, points

                        You look like a wine aficionado so 
                        I’m sure you’ll love this.

                        load off.

           Evan sits in a leather recliner. The malfunctioning footrest 
           pops out on its own, surprising him. He notices it still has 
           its giant Costco tag attached.

                                 EVAN
                        New chair, huh?

                        Evan, everything you see here is 
                        defective in some way.

           Evan looks at the three of them...you don’t say...

                                 EVAN
                        Really?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Go, Thomas!

           Bob raises the volume. We hear the announcer excitedly call 
           the play...in Spanish.

                                 PLAY-BY-PLAY SEÑOR (ON TV)
                        Tomas Jones con la pelota...

                                 BOB
                                 (shouting over the din)
                        Take the TV for example! It’s stuck 
                        in SAP! But who can complain, 
                        right? That baby’s sesenta inches!

                                 PLAY-BY-PLAY SENOR (ON TV)
                        El veinte, diez, cinco...

           Thomas Jones somersaults over the goal line. Touchdown! 

                                 BOB, JAMARCUS, & FRANKLIN
                        Gooooooooalll!

                                 EVAN
                        Listen, I don’t mean to overstep my 
                        bounds here, but shouldn’t you guys 
                        be, I don’t know...watching the 
                        neighborhood?
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    19.

           Silence.

                                 BOB
                        You know what, Evan, you’re 
                        absolutely right. I’m ashamed. I’ve 
                        got the red face of a drunken Injun 
                        here. We should absolutely be 
                        watching the neighborhood.

           Bob opens the door. A beat. Then he swings it back shut.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        All clear. ‘Marcus, Jaeger Squirt!

           Jamarcus shoots a neon orange SUPERSOAKER at Bob, who catches 
           the shot in his mouth. Finally telling Evan the truth...

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        We used to be like you, Rook. Out 
                        for justice. Patrolled this burgh 
                        every night. And then it hit 
                        us...nothing happens here.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Ever.

                                 BOB
                        We were gonna cut our losses and 
                        disband until we realized what we 
                        really loved is what you’re looking 
                        at right now. This. Our ‘me’ time. 
                        Away from our wives, our kids.

           Franklin smiles sweetly as always...

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Before I got married, I was a bad 
                        man, Ev. I rolled deep and I rolled 
                        hard. Now I install air 
                        conditioning and change diapers. I 
                        need this.

                                 BOB
                                 (pats Evan on the back)
                        Your neighbor Gary isn’t a 
                        dangerous man. He’s the manager at 
                        Chili’s. Forget the crate. Settle 
                        in. All you gotta worry about 
                        watching tonight is the Jets. And 
                        maybe some Skinamax en Espanol.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Si se puede!

           In no mood to settle, Evan struggles out of the recliner.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    20.

                                 EVAN
                        Sorry to miss all that but I, uh, 
                        should be getting home. Thanks for 
                        the...brew dog. And let’s...roll 
                        again soon.

           Evan hustles up the steps. Bob is STUNG BY THE REJECTION. 
           Offscreen, we hear Evan turn the knob, struggle to push open 
           the heavy lead door. He leans his head back down...

                                 EVAN(CONT’D)
                        A little help?

           Bob sees him there. Doesn’t want to let him go. Rises...

                                 BOB
                        Attention, Watchmen! This week’s 
                        ride-around has been moved to now 
                        o’clock.

                                 EVAN
                        Wait. Really? You’re gonna go check 
                        on things?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Yeah, really? It’s the 4th quarter--

           Bob eyes the other guys--go with me.

                                 BOB
                        Really.

           I/E. TERCEL (MOVING) - LATER

           A shitty old Toyota with Neighborhood Watch magnets stuck to 
           the side. Evan in the backseat beside Franklin. Jamarcus in 
           the driver seat. Bob rides shotgun.

                                 BOB
                        Punch it, Lando.

           Jamarcus hits the gas to a roaring twenty five MPH.

                                 EVAN
                                 (looks back)
                        Uh...that was my block.

                                 BOB
                        We’ll get there, Easy E. This is a 
                        ride-around. It’s a chance for you 
                        to see us in action.

           Evan looks back at his block as it recedes into the distance, 
           now even more frustrated...
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    21.

                                 EVAN
                        What action? I thought you guys 
                        don’t do anything.

                                 BOB
                        We do mad things, Evan. Mad things.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        We drive around once a week.

                                 BOB
                        Let the old bags in town think 
                        we’re still doing our jobs.

                                 FRANKLIN
                                 (whispers to Evan)
                        I used to get in bar fights. Just 
                        for fun. Still got a piece of PBR 
                        shrapnel in my left skull.

                                 BOB
                        Ooh, slow down. The Donnellys...

           They slow to a crawl and kill the headlights.

                                 EVAN
                        Who are the Donnellys?

                                 BOB
                        John and Tara. John owns a 
                        landscape company, and Tara is a 
                        slut.

                                 EVAN
                        How do you know this?

                                 BOB
                        I run a Costco, Evan. I know 
                        everything.
                                 (then)
                        See John bought a hot water bottle 
                        last year after his vasectomy but 
                        Tara bought a 36-pack of Shared 
                        Sensation Trojans last week. Which 
                        means an affair with a non-snipped 
                        man. One Alex Berger. That’s his 
                        van parked discreetly up the block. 
                        I know this because we sold him the 
                        replica bull testicles hanging from 
                        his rear fender.

           In an upstairs window TARA DONNELLY, silhouetted, removes her 
           bra, then...dims the light so they can’t see. Aw, man.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    22.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        The Luetro Maestro light dimmer. 
                        $8.95.

           Unseen by the guys, A DARK FIGURE whooshes by the car.

           EXT. JOSEPH MCCARTHY HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           A group of high school BURNOUTS (Debarge, Tuber, Robyn) lie 
           at midfield staring up at the night sky. 

                                 ROBYN
                        I want waffles.

           A SHOOTING STAR zips across the cosmos.

                                 DEBARGE
                        Ooh! Shooting star. Make a wish.

                                 ROBYN
                        I wish we had waffles.

           That same DARK FIGURE now whooshes past the kids.

                                 TUBER
                        What the hell was that?

                                 ROBYN
                        Waffles with gravy.

           Tuber sees the door to the school swinging open.

           I/E. NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Bob, Franklin and Jamarcus sing along badly to Bon Jovi’s 
           Wanted Dead or Alive on the radio... 

                                 EVAN
                        Could we maybe turn it down a bit?

           Wounded, Bob lowers the volume, turns back to Evan.

                                 BOB
                        Sorry it’s not something more 
                        depressing.

                                 EVAN
                        Oh, no, this is pretty depressing.

                                 BOB
                        It’ll grow on you.

                                 EVAN
                        I’ve been listening to this CD for  
                        a while now.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    23.

                                 BOB
                        Exactly. You’ve been listening. But 
                        you haven’t been hearing. You will.
                                 (jumping right back in)
                        --on a steel horse I ride!

           Evan looks down at the DISCO BALL which sits on the seat 
           between he and Franklin.

                                 EVAN
                        What’s up with the disco ball?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        It’s for my job.

                                 BOB
                        Don’t be modest. You can’t have a 
                        Bar Mitzvah in the Mid-Island area 
                        without DJ Schvartza on the ones 
                        and twos.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        They come to a Schvartz Mitzvah 
                        boys, but they leave men.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        What do you do, Evan?

                                 EVAN
                        I’m a cartoonist. Actually I should 
                        be getting back. I, uh...have a big 
                        meeting tomorrow.

                                 BOB
                        Who’s the meeting with, Ziggy?

                                 EVAN
                        They’re political cartoons.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        I believe Ziggy’s a Republican.

           INT. JOSEPH MCCARTHY HIGH HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The burnouts tiptoe past the locker rooms.

                                 TUBER
                        I’m telling you I saw something.

           The kids turn a corner. Their eyes widen. We see, IN 
           SILHOUETTE on the hallway wall...A LARGE ALIEN CREATURE. The 
           shadow runs at them and they SCREAM!
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    24.

           I/E. NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH CAR (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           A cop car zips by our guys, lights flashing, SIRENS BLARING. 
           The guys share a look. Jamarcus swings a u-turn...

                                 EVAN
                        I thought nothing ever happens.

                                 BOB
                        It doesn’t.

           EXT. JOSEPH MCCARTHY HIGH - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           The Tercel screeches to a halt. THE WATCH GUYS rush to find a 
           junior cop, BRUSSELS, questioning the freaked burnouts.

                                 BOB
                        What’s goin’ down?

                                 FRANKLIN
                                 (hopeful)
                        A murder?

                                 TUBER
                        There was like this gnarly giant 
                        thing from outer space.

           A second cop approaches, the IMPOSING POLICEMAN who shined 
           the flashlight on Evan. This is CAPTAIN MORGAN (30s).

                                 MORGAN
                        Or from the Equipment Room.

           Morgan holds up a MASCOT SUIT for the McCarthy Rhinos.

                                 MORGAN (CONT’D)
                        Found this in the hallway.

                                 BOB
                        Probably a little prick from East 
                        Meadow trying to steal our mascot 
                        suit. Homecoming game’s this 
                        Saturday.

                                 MORGAN
                        Genius analysis from the 
                        Neighborhood Watch. Or maybe, since 
                        you were nowhere to be found, I 
                        should call you the Neighborhood 
                        Don’t Watch?

                                 BOB
                        That’s very clever.

                                 MORGAN
                        Thank you.

                        I think he was being sarcastic.

                                 MORGAN
                        Oh really? Were you being sarcastic 
                        with me, Finnerty?

                                 BOB
                                 (uber-sarcastic)
                        Nooo.

           Morgan squints, pissed, tosses the Rhino head at Bob.

                                 MORGAN
                                 (needling Bob)
                        You remember our East Meadow game, 
                        don’t you, Bob?

                                 BOB
                                 (explains to Evan)
                        Career ending knee injury.

                                 MORGAN
                        That he got in the hallway.

                                 BOB
                        That floor was over-polished!

                                 MORGAN
                                 (re: Evan)
                        Who’s this nozzle?

           Bob rests his hand proudly on Evan’s shoulder.

                                 BOB
                        This is Evan. The new guy. Evan, 
                        this is Captain Morgan. You know, 
                        like the gay pirate on the rum 
                        bottle.

                                 MORGAN
                                 (narrows eyes at Evan)
                        You find that funny, New Guy?

                                 EVAN
                        What? No. And New Guy isn’t really--
                        because-- I’m not one of them.

           Bob removes his hand, disappointed.

                                 MORGAN
                        Smart. Because these are not men. 
                        These are walking vaginas.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        That explains why you’re not 
                        remotely interested in us.

           Morgan takes out his nightstick. Brussels holds him back.

                                 BRUSSELS
                        You don’t wanna lose any more 
                        vacation days.

                                 MORGAN
                        You’re lucky. Now, if you’ll excuse 
                        me, we have actual policework to 
                        attend to.

           Robyn PUKES all over Morgan’s shoes.

                                 BOB
                        Go right ahead.

           Our guys return to the car, giving Evan the cold shoulder. 
           Evan leans in the passenger side window to Bob...

                                 EVAN
                        Bob--

                                 BOB
                        I’d tell you to talk to the hand 
                        but I don’t even want you talking 
                        to my hand. That’s where I’m at 
                        emotionally right now.

           Jamarcus turns the key in the ignition, but the engine 
           SPUTTERS. Bob looks to Jamarcus: that really ruined my 
           dramatic parting shot. Then, determined to get it right...

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        That’s where I’m at emotionally 
                        right now.

           Again, Jamarcus turns the ignition. VROOM. Evan sighs, 
           reaches for the backdoor. Bob leans back and LOCKS IT. The 
           car SQUEALS OFF. Left alone, Evan begins the long trudge 
           home.

           INT. TRAUTWIGS’ KITCHEN - THE NEXT DAY

           Evan hooks up a CORDLESS PHONE. The phone cradle powers on. 
           Evan hits ‘Talk’ on the headset. Static. Changes the channel. 
           Fuzz. Changes channel again. Now somebody is talking...

                                 NASAL VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        Yeah, it’s in the cellar...

           Evan sees GARY pacing next door. He snickers...
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    27.

                                 GARY (ON PHONE)
                        Far from the boiler. Otherwise... 
                        kaboom!

                                 DEEP VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        That stuff is definitely gonna put 
                        some people out of commission.

                                 ABBY (O.S.)
                        Ev-dog!

           Evan leaps, shuts off his phone, shaken. Abby’s popped in 
           carrying laundry. She ribs him...

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        You got home late. What went down? 
                        You take a bite out of crime?

                                 EVAN
                                 (distracted)
                        I’d...rather not talk about it.

                                 ABBY
                        Aha. Bro code. Don’t wanna snitch 
                        on your new boys. I get it.
                                 (then, getting real)
                        Did it at least set your mind at 
                        ease a little bit?

                                 EVAN
                                 (sneaks a look at Gary)
                        Uh huh...

                                 ABBY
                                 (sensing his reluctance)
                        Evan...
                                 (he’s still distracted)
                        Hello?

           Evan turns back.

                                 EVAN
                        Huh?

                                 ABBY
                        Evan, please tell me you’re giving 
                        this place a fair shot. That’s all 
                        I ask.

                                 EVAN
                                 (forces a smile)
                        Yeah. Of course. We’re here. We’re 
                        doing it.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    28.

                                 ABBY
                        Good. ‘Cause you’re looking at the 
                        new, hot...science teacher! I’m 
                        Mrs. Trautwig!

                                 EVAN
                        You got the job. Wow! Just. Wow!

           He hugs her, looking back out at Gary’s house.

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - LATER THAT MORNING

           YOUNG GIRLS warm up. Bob sits on the sidelines in a track 
           suit, drinking a can of beer. Nods a toast to a few SOCCER 
           MOMS (our powerwalking MILFs from earlier) who force smiles, 
           unamused. Evan hustles over, determined.

                                 EVAN
                        Bonnie said--

                                 BOB
                        Oh, look who’s here. You gonna join 
                        these ladies for one game, then 
                        quit on them, too? Because I won’t 
                        let it happen. Their season has 
                        already been a roller-coaster ride 
                        since Sanchez got the Measles.

                                 EVAN
                        I never actually joined-- 
                                 (catches himself)
                        Look, I’m sorry, but I need--

                                 BOB
                        Game’s starting. You want action?

                                 EVAN
                        What?

                                 BOB
                        Action. I’m laying seven to one on 
                        Teppertown United.

                                 EVAN
                        You’re gambling on your daughter’s 
                        soccer game?

                                 BOB
                        My daughter’s currently... 
                        sidelined. In the meantime I stay 
                        hungry.

           Bob takes a big swig of beer. Evan focuses...
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    29.

                                 EVAN
                        Bob, I think my neighbor has a 
                        bomb.

                                 BOB
                        Sounds like a job for the 
                        Neighborhood Watch. An organization 
                        with which you are not affiliated.
                                 (re: soccer mom)
                        You see Juicy Couture over there? 
                        My first kiss. Fifth grade dance. 
                        The song was Broken Wings.

                                 EVAN
                        Bob, I’m talking about a possible 
                        Oklahoma City situation! In the 
                        house right next to mine!

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, I get it. You want me to do 
                        you a favor. Now I’m no Dionne 
                        Warwick, but I believe that’s the 
                        sort of thing that friends are for.

                                 EVAN
                        Please...

                                 BOB
                        Yep, sure is nice to have peeps 
                        who’ve got your back, isn’t it? To 
                        not always go it alone. Guess 
                        that’s just one of the perks when 
                        you...become a Watchman.

           Bob smiles. Evan hesitates. Then rips off the Band-Aid...

                                 EVAN
                        Okay. I’m in. I am a Watch...man.

                                 BOB
                                 (big bro-hug)
                        I knew it. I felt it. You just 
                        needed to get there on your own.
                                 (then)
                        We’ll dig up that crate tonight and 
                        put all your silly fears to rest. 
                        This is a respectable town, 
                        Trautwig. With respectable people.

           Bob unzips his track suit, revealing that he is wearing a 
           REFEREE’S UNIFORM. He blows a whistle...

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Okay Juniors, get ready to rumble!
                                 (then, poorly feigned)
                                 (MORE)
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    30.
                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Uh oh. Looks like Teppertown’s one 
                        short. Yulshenko, suit up!

           Bob tosses a jersey to an Eastern European girl who looks 
           seventeen, with a little moustache on her upper lip. She 
           flips the ball up in the air and scissor kicks it to Bob.

           EXT. BOB’S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

           We can hear Bob singing in falsetto...

                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        Take these broken wings, and learn 
                        to fly again, learn to live so 
                        free.

           IN THE KITCHEN

           Bonnie washes dishes. Bob dries. Chelsea rumbles through. 
           Grabs ice cream from the freezer.

                        Hey, Kiddo! I was thinking we could 
                        play a game of Uno later when I get 
                        back from the old Watch?

                                 CHELSEA
                        Yeah, that’s exactly what I want to 
                        do tonight!

           Chelsea holds back tears, rumbles up the steps. Her bedroom 
           door SLAMS. Bob calls up...

                                 BOB
                        Parcheesi?!

           Bonnie looks at her husband, direct...

                                 BONNIE
                        There’s a boy.

                                 BOB
                        No. Not yet. She’s a child.

                                 BONNIE
                        Bob, she’s fourteen. And I read her 
                        text messages.

                                 BOB
                        That’s an invasion of privacy. I 
                        like it.

                                 BONNIE
                        I had to. She won’t talk to me. 
                        I’ve tried ten times. But you...

                                 BOB
                        No. No no no. And that last no was 
                        in Spanish for emphasis.

                                 BONNIE
                        She’s always been Daddy’s little 
                        girl. You can relate to her...

                                 BOB
                        Not anymore. Not about this. 
                        Because this isn’t happening.

                                 BONNIE
                        It is, Bob. And would you rather 
                        have this talk or the one you’re 
                        gonna have if you don’t have this 
                        one?

           INT. CHELSEA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Chelsea is IMing on her MacBook (amberlayd: ur not allowed 2 
           date? chels96: no! i can’t even leave the house. amberlayd: 
           that sux. this is ur shot with jason.) when Bob knocks.

                                 CHELSEA
                        What?

           She slams the computer shut as her father edges through the 
           door. Sees a stuffed animal.

                                 BOB
                        Hey, Teddy, how ya doin’?

           He picks the bear up to see it hangs from a noose.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        When did this happen?

                                 CHELSEA
                        On his birthday. Can you believe 
                        it? He didn’t even leave a note.

           Bob smiles as he sits uncomfortably beside her. Takes a deep 
           breath. Manages to find a good tone...

                                 BOB
                        Remember when that goon Shermer 
                        kept hogging the ball? You were 
                        hurting pretty bad, right? Maybe 
                        even cried a little? So what did 
                        you do to fix it? You came to the 
                        old man. And what’d I tell you?

                        Kick her in the hamstring.

                                 BOB
                        My girl.
                                 (then)
                        That doesn’t have to change, you 
                        know. You can always come to me. 

           She looks at him. Pleasantly surprised. It’s not easy, but...

                                 CHELSEA
                        Okay. Fine. There’s this boy--

                                 BOB
                                 (slowly unraveling)
                        Cool. Sweet. Did he touch you? I 
                        know people. He won’t see the dawn.

                                 CHELSEA
                        Ugh. Forget it. I can’t talk to you 
                        about this...

                                 BOB

                        No. Wait. I’m sorry. Okay. There’s 
                        a boy. You like this kid?
                                 (she nods, he searches)
                        Alright. Love advice. I know about 
                        love. It’s tough. Sooo tough...
                                 (those words spark an 
                                  idea)
                        You know, when I was younger there 
                        was this couple. Tommy and Gina. 
                        Now, Tommy...Tommy used to work on 
                        the docks...the union went on 
                        strike...and he was down on his 
                        luck. And Gina, she worked at the 
                        diner...all day--

                                 CHELSEA
                        Are you serious?

                        What?

                                 CHELSEA
                        That’s a Bon Jovi song, Dad.

                        How do you know Bon Jovi? That’s 
                        like oldies for you.

                                 CHELSEA

                        Chels, okay. That was stupid. I’ll 
                        be honest with you. In reality I 
                        did have these friends. Good 
                        friends.

                                 CHELSEA
                        Get out.

           He leaves. She slams the door, then strides to her window, 
           views THE TRELLIS below.

           INT. TRAUTWIGS’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Evan peeks out the window when Abby brushes by.

                                 ABBY
                        You sure you don’t wanna come see 
                        the global warming genius? He’s got 
                        elbow pads on his blazer. They 
                        don’t just give those to anybody.

                                 EVAN
                        Can’t. Got...work to do.

           She sees him, distracted again. Leans in...

                                 ABBY
                        You got something on your cheek.

                                 EVAN
                        Where?

                                 ABBY
                        Here.

           She kisses his cheek. He smiles as she hurries out. The 
           second she’s gone, Evan whips out his iPhone, dials. 

                                 EVAN (INTO PHONE)
                        Bob, she’s gone.

           Evan hangs up, keeping an eye out the window...

           INT. RADISSON MEETING ROOM - LATER

           The PROFESSOR drones on. His POWERPOINT SLIDE reads: Global 
           WarNing and shows a graph in which the average temperature 
           takes a huge spike upward from 1947 until today. ABBY sits in 
           back, trying to stay awake, when PAUL slides next to her.

                        What do you think?

                                 ABBY
                        He’s so boring he’s actually making 
                        me happy the world is ending.

                                 PAUL
                        Coffee break?

           She nods appreciatively.

           HOTEL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Abby and Paul sip lattes.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        So is there a Mr. Trautwig?
                                 (she smiles, nods)
                        Any little Trautwigs?

                                 ABBY
                        We’re trying. You? 

                                 PAUL
                        A son. Jason. His mother left a few 
                        years back...

                                 ABBY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 PAUL
                        I was up for the job here and it 
                        was hard to say no. But my wife-- 
                        ex-wife. I keep doing that. My ex-
                        wife never wanted to move to this 
                        neck of the woods.

                                 ABBY
                        Sounds like someone else I know.

                                 PAUL
                        It starts slow, the resentment. 
                        They get quiet. Moody. Like they’re 
                        not really there anymore.

           Abby nods with a bit of concern.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I have a bachelor party later 
                        tonight and part of me wants to 
                        grab the guy and say “don’t do it!” 
                        Because we all start out with good 
                        intentions, sure we’ll spend 
                        eternity together, but people grow

                        A few years go by and you’re not 
                        the same two idiots who got 
                        married. 

           She really doesn’t want to believe that’s true.

                                 ABBY
                        Yeah, but sometimes a couple can 
                        grow together.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to turn 
                        this into a therapy session.

                                 ABBY
                        It’s all your parents’ fault. Take 
                        a lot of pills. That’ll be two 
                        hundred dollars.

                        You two need to get out in the 
                        community. Make some friends. Have 
                        you been to the country club yet?

                        No, we spent most of the week on 
                        our yacht.

                                 PAUL
                        It’s not that fancy. After all, 
                        they let this guy in. Tomorrow at 
                        ten. I won’t take no for an answer.

           INT. TRAUTWIGS’ FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           A KNOCK. Evan swings open the front door but there’s nobody 
           there. Another KNOCK. It’s at the back door. Evan hurries 
           over, opens it to reveal the Watch guys in all black with ski 
           hats on. Bob and Franklin have painted their faces black. 
           Jamarcus has not. Evan gestures back to the front door...

                                 EVAN
                        Why didn’t you--?

           Bob peers out to see...Gary in his kitchen, searching his 
           freezer. Bob nods to the others and...dives to the ground. 
           Does a MILITARY CRAWL across the grass towards Gary’s place.

                        Is that really--?

           Franklin dives as well, knocking Evan down. He crawls now, 
           miserable. Jamarcus follows. Gary grabs a box from the 
           freezer and spins back just as...the guys make it up against 
           his house, out of his line of sight. Phew. Bob pulls out a 
           MAKEUP COMPACT, flips it open. Angles it to see Gary remove a 
           Hot Pocket. Snaps it shut.

                        Hot Pocket! The Barbecue Beef takes 
                        a minute-forty-five to cook. 
                                 (to Jamarcus)
                        Sundown, you’re running lookout. 
                        High sign when he hits start.

           Jamarcus stays under the window. The other three guys slink 
           along the house to the CELLAR DOOR.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Franklin, scalpel.

           Frank hands Bob giant BOLT CUTTERS. Bob struggles to snap the 
           big padlock, loses his grip. CLUNK. Gary hears! Looks out the 
           window. The guys lean against the wall, holding their breath, 
           Jamarcus right below him. Gary...shrugs, turns back. 

           Gary hits START, stares at the Hot Pocket as it rotates in 
           the microwave, the loud FAN NOISE audible. Jamarcus gives a 
           ‘hang loose’ sign. Evan lifts the lock--it wasn’t even 
           threaded through the handle. The door’s unlocked. Franklin 
           heaves it open. The three guys run down into the...

           CELLAR

           A typical cluttered basement. Everyone searches. Bob gives 
           TACTICAL HANDSIGNS. Some look CIA. Others might be from a 
           third base coach. Or Carol Burnett. Directs at Franklin...

                                 FRANKLIN
                        I don’t understand!

                                 BOB
                                 (frustrated)
                        Beer me!

           Franklin stands beside the basement icebox. Pops it open and 
           grabs a Light. Bob tugs his ear, then brushes his arm...

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Regular, not Light.
                                 (cracks the beer, drinks)
                        Agh, it’s warm. Okay, let’s find 
                        this thing.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    37.

           Franklin accidentally triggers a BIG MOUTH BILLY BASS which 
           sings Don’t Worry Be Happy, struggles to silence it. They’ve 
           looked everywhere, but there’s definitely NO CRATE.

                                 EVAN
                        Damnit, he must’ve known I was onto 
                        him and moved it.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        I’m missing Intimate Deceptions for 
                        this?

                                 BOB
                        Easy. Evan was just doing what any 
                        of us would do. Trying to protect 
                        his family. But, Ev, if this guy 
                        was a Unibomber we’d’ve found 
                        something down here beside this...

           Bob points to Gary’s Chili’s Employee of the Month plaque.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        I think you’re safe.

           THWAKK! A loud noise outside. Followed by LAUGHTER. They 
           share a look--what the hell?!

           EXT. TRAUTWIGS’ FRONT LAWN - MOMENTS LATER

           The guys rush up to see A MUSTANG screech by Evan’s house. 
           SCOTTIE leans out and DECAPITATES EVAN’S MAILBOX with a 
           Louisville Slugger. Teenage laughter pours out of the car.

                                 EVAN
                        Our mailbox! It has a thing.

           BEEP. In his kitchen, Gary removes his Hot Pocket from the 
           microwave. Takes a bite. It’s really hot. Bob stares after 
           the Mustang, eyes squinted...

                                 BOB
                        Not on my watch.

           I/E. TERCEL (MOVING) - MOMENTS LATER

           Speeding after, Jamarcus turns back to Evan...

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Hang on, Miss Daisy.

                                 EVAN
                        This is crazy! Just let them go.

                                 BOB
                        What are you, French?!
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    38.

           The Mustang hops a curb, cutting across a corner house’s 
           yard. Jamarcus follows, the Tercel not nearly as agile, 
           barely avoiding a ceramic LAWN JOCKEY. Back on the street, 
           Bob leans his head out the window...

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Pull over, hooligans!

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Says who?

                                 BOB
                        The Neighborhood Watch!

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Uh oh, guys! It’s...not the police.

           As they pass a sign for a SPEED BUMP, a teenage couple laughs 
           in the backseat, the guy’s arm around the girl. They turn 
           back and we see that it’s CHELSEA AND JASON! Bob’s eyes fill 
           with rage. Chelsea’s with panic.

                             CHELSEA
                                                                  BOB
           Floor it!
                                                    Floor it!

           The Mustang guns it, flying Starsky-style over the speed 
           bump. Bob pounds on Jamarcus’ leg, sending the Tercel 
           hurtling at the bump. They BOTTOM OUT, losing control. Skid 
           onto the sidewalk, taking out a row of mailboxes as the 
           Mustang screams off. Franklin cheers--that was awesome! The 
           Tercel stalls. Jamarcus fires the ignition but it sputters.

                                 EVAN
                        Lemme guess. That battery came  
                        from--

                                 BOB
                                 (steely)
                        Don’t go there.

           EXT. BOB’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The Mustang pulls up. Jason walks Chelsea to the trellis...

                                 CHELSEA
                        I’m sorry my dad’s such a tool.

                                 JASON
                        I dunno. If you were my daughter, 
                        I’d be pretty careful, too.

                                 CHELSEA
                        Wow. You really are a nice guy.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    39.

                                 JASON
                        It’s just an act so I can get you 
                        to take your clothes off?

                                 CHELSEA
                        Don’t worry. I won’t ruin your rep.

           She’s the aggressor, kissing him a sweet, innocent first 
           kiss. She ascends. He grins, walks away. She calls back.

                                 CHELSEA (CONT’D)
                        God, you didn’t even look up my 
                        skirt. Wuss.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - CONTINUOUS

           We can see the Costco, it’s light blinking as always, on the 
           main drag behind this batch of houses. Bob lifts a broken 
           mailbox in a quiet fury. Jamarcus sees the family name on it: 
           ‘STAINTON’.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        This night keeps getting better.

                                 EVAN
                        What?

           The odd CLERK from the convenience store emerges from the 
           front door. Lethargic. Unshaven. Sweatpants. A man who does 
           not give a shit. This is LINUS STAINTON.

                                 BOB
                                 (hushed)
                        Linus Stainton. Played ball with 
                        me. Solid tight end.

           Linus stares up into the sky. For far too long. For no 
           apparent reason.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Son must’ve taken one too many 
                        hits.

                                 BOB
                                 (hushed)
                        Maybe. Alls I know is at the 
                        Homecoming game he ran out on the 
                        field wearing only a jock strap and 
                        talking about little green men. 
                        Became a total laughingstock. Just 
                        smile and nod.

           Evan smiles and nods as they reach the front stoop.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    40.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Hey Linus, we got your mailbox for 
                        ya!

                                 LINUS
                                 (always deadpan)
                        Thank god. I’ve been so worried. 
                                 (touches the mailbox 
                                  tenderly)
                        It just said it was going out for a 
                        pack of cigarettes.

                                 JAMARCUS
                                 (holding cables)
                        Mind if we get a jump?

           Linus shrugs, tosses his keys to Franklin. Bob reattaches the 
           mailbox to its post.

                                 LINUS
                        Good to see ya, Bobby. Did you get 
                        the copy of my book? 

                                 BOB
                        Yes. I did receive it. About 
                        seventeen years ago. Alien 
                        abductions, right? How’d that go 
                        over?

                                 LINUS
                        Huge. It’s a best seller on Venus.

           Jamarcus is in the Tercel, Frank in Linus’ shitbox. Evan has 
           been left with the cables, looking uncertain.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        You got that, E? Positive goes to 
                        positive--

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah yeah. 

           Evan clamps the positives. Then negative on Linus’ and 
           negative on the Tercel battery which EXPLODES. Evan SCREAMS.

                                 BOB
                        You gotta ground it to the block, 
                        genius. Otherwise there’s a power 
                        surge in the wrong direction and it 
                        blows the battery.

                                 EVAN
                        So negative goes to negative and 
                        positive goes to something else?!
                                 (they nod)
                        Well...that’s just...stupid.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    41.

           Evan shrugs a sheepish apology. They begin to push the car. 
           Evan looks back at Linus, who offers a low-energy wave.

           INT. GARY’S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Whistling, Gary saunters downstairs, slides his Employee of 
           the Month plaque aside. It triggers a false wall to open up, 
           revealing THE CRATE in a secret crawlspace.

           INT. TRAUTWIGS’ BEDROOM - LATER

           Exhausted, Evan limps into the bedroom to find candles lit, 
           Seal playing on the stereo. Abby, wearing her version of 
           sexy, slinks up to him, whispers in his ear...

                                 ABBY
                        The test kit says I’m ovulating.

           He smiles; she’s his refuge. Pulls her in for a kiss. But 
           just as they get into it Evan hears a DOOR SHUT. He opens one 
           eye. Sees through the window--Gary and Heavyset Guy as they 
           LOAD THE CRATE into a dry cleaning VAN. Evan pulls away.

                                 EVAN
                        I...gotta pee.

                                 ABBY
                        I’ll hit pause on my uterus.

           Evan rushes into the bathroom, opens the window to hear...

                                 HEAVYSET GUY
                        It’s gonna be some night, huh?

                                 GARY
                        I’m just glad Marc’s the one 
                        throwing his life away and not me.

           The men go in the house. Eyes wide, Evan’s rushes out...

                                 EVAN
                        I...just got a text. Looks like the 
                        Watch boys need my help. 
                        Something’s going down.

                                 ABBY
                        You’re serious?

                                 EVAN
                        I thought you wanted me to do this.

                                 ABBY
                                 (frustrated)
                        Isn’t it late? We only have a short 
                        window for--
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    42.

                                 EVAN
                        I know. I promise it won’t take 
                        long.

                                 ABBY
                        The guys or the sex?
                                 (sighs, then)
                        Ugh. Just. Hurry.

           EXT. GARY’S DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan jumps up into the van. But before he can open the crate, 
           Gary and Heavyset Guy return. Evan ducks behind a rack of 
           clothes. The men close the doors. Evan in darkness.

           VAN (MOVING) - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan pulls out his cellphone, uses its screen glow to see. 
           Pries open the crate to reveal...dozens of jugs. Lifts one. 
           It’s labeled Nitromethane: HIGHLY FLAMMABLE. Evan panics. 
           Loses his grip. Barely catches it just before it hits the 
           floor. Phew. Evan carefully returns the jug to the crate. 
           Flips the phone over and Googles ‘nitromethane’, reading...

                                 EVAN
                        Used in dry cleaning or to remove 
                        super glue. 
                                 (then)
                        That’s not so bad. 
                                 (then)
                        Combined with ammonium nitrate, 
                        forms ANNM, a highly explosive 
                        mixture most famously used in the 
                        destruction of the Murrah Federal 
                        Building in Oklahoma City...!

           The van lurches to a stop. Evan DROPS THE PHONE in the crate. 
           Shit! Before he can grab it, he hears the guys coming. 
           Returns the lid and hides back behind the clothes.

           EXT. ALLEY BEHIND SUBURBAN STORES - MOMENTS LATER

           The van doors swing open. Heavyset Guy and Gary remove the 
           crate and carry it up a loading dock. Once they’re gone, Evan 
           creeps out. Races around the corner to the storefront of...

           EZ-CLEAN DRY CLEANERS

           Evan peers through the slats in the blinds to see...some 
           dudes hanging out. Bright-eyed MARC and PAUL. Gary and 
           Heavyset Guy (NEAL, this is his shop) join them. They drink 
           vodka, smoke cigars. A blow-up doll rotates by on the dry-
           cleaning rack. Gary pats Marc’s back...

                                 GARY
                        There’s the dead man!
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    43.

                                 PAUL
                                 (a toast)
                        Marc, I know you and Missy have 
                        been doing the long distance thing 
                        a while now--

                                 NEAL
                        It’s better that way. You can’t 
                        hear the nagging!

                                 PAUL
                                 (laughs)
                        Seriously, we’re happy that you and 
                        your bride-to-be will soon be 
                        together at last. But tonight... 
                        you’re still single!

           TWO STRIPPERS emerge through the clothes wrappers and dance 
           for the guys. Their BODYGUARD hits play on a boombox. Evan 
           shakes his head. It’s just a stupid stag party. Turns to go.

                                 NEAL
                        Can’t they take it all off, Paul?

                                 GARY
                        Yeah, take it all off!

                                 PAUL
                        No. Not in public. We can’t get 
                        complacent now. Not when Moving Day 
                        is so close.

           Evan spins back. Moving Day?

                                 GARY
                        Exactly. His wife’s almost here. 
                        Let ‘im get the real deal!

           Gary refills his glass...with NITROMETHANE from one of the 
           jars. They’re all drinking it. WTF?

                                 PAUL
                        Ah, what the hell. We’re alone. Go 
                        ahead, Cinnamon, Tiffanique. Show 
                        ‘im what your mamas gave you.

           What happens next is a blur. The strippers’ EYES ROTATE 180 
           DEGREES, now a GLOWING SILVER. As one dances, from behind, we 
           can see a strange ALIEN APPENDAGE drop from within her mini 
           skirt. The impetuous Gary reaches out to cop a feel...

                                 BODYGUARD
                        Whoa, you can’t touch her tail but 
                        her tail can touch you...
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    44.

           Evan stumbles. THUMP. Paul hears. Crosses to the 
           window...there’s nobody there. Shuts the blinds. Evan leans 
           against the wall in shock. Fishes for his cell, remembering 
           he DROPPED IT IN THE CRATE.

                                 EVAN
                        My phone--? Shit!

           INT. TRAUTWIGS’ KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan bursts in to find Abby eating ice cream in her sweats.

                                 ABBY 
                                 (mouth full)
                        I couldn’t stay sexy that long.

                                 EVAN
                        Get dressed!

           EXT. DRY CLEANERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan drags Abby from the Prius, parked a ways down, hushed.

                                 ABBY
                        An alien?!

                                 EVAN
                        Yes! Maybe! I don’t know! 
                        Something...not human.

           They arrive at the window. The blinds are now open and inside 
           is...A BORING DRY CLEANERS. No aliens. No people.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        It was--! They were--! It happened, 
                        I swear.
                                 (off her look)
                        You think I’m making this up?

                                 ABBY
                        I think you don’t wanna be here.

                                 EVAN
                        What?

                                 ABBY
                                 (sighs, resigned)
                        Let’s go home. To the city. Let’s 
                        just pack up and go.

                                 EVAN
                        Abby, c’mon. I didn’t--

                                 ABBY
                        This whole thing was a big mistake. 
                        I should’ve never pushed you--
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    45.

           He sees her disappointment. Can’t stand it...

                                 EVAN
                        No. We’re not going anywhere.

                                 ABBY
                        You don’t want this, Evan.

                                 EVAN
                        I do.

                                 ABBY
                        Really? 
                                 (re: dry cleaners)
                        Then what is all this?

                                 EVAN
                        I must...just be seeing things. I 
                        haven’t been sleeping.
                                 (deep breath)
                        Abby, this is our home.

                                 ABBY
                                 (touched)
                        Okay.
                                 (then, no nonsense)
                        But that’s it. No more crates. No 
                        more aliens. Alright?

                                 EVAN
                        I promise. 

           It’s a deal. He checks his watch, touches her belly...

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Your uterus still has an hour 
                        left...

           She smiles, takes his hand.

           I/E. PRIUS (MOVING) - THE NEXT MORNING

           Abby and Evan drive through town. He smiles, really making a 
           go of it.

                                 EVAN
                        So you met this country club guy at 
                        the talk?

                                 ABBY
                        I know what you’re thinking. But I 
                        swear he’s totally down to Earth.

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan and Abby ring the doorbell. The door swings open. Evan’s 
           face drops. PAUL greets them with open arms, his son Jason 
           (Chelsea’s sweet jock) by his side.

                                 PAUL
                        There they are! Teppertown’s new it 
                        couple! Relax, we shooed off the 
                        paparazzi! 

           Evan tries to hold it together as Paul kisses Abby’s cheek.

                                 EVAN
                        Oh my god.

                                 PAUL
                                 (off Evan’s awed 
                                  expression)
                        I know. Not too shabby, right? Jack 
                        Nicklaus designed the carpeting.
                                 (then)
                        C’mere, big man...
                                 (pulls Evan into a tight 
                                  embrace)
                        You’re one of the good ones. I can 
                        tell already.

                                 EVAN
                        You know what, I’m not feeling so 
                        well. 

                                 ABBY
                        What’s wrong, Honey?

                                 EVAN
                                 (edging to the door)
                        I...ate some yogurt before that was 
                        expiring tomorrow and you really 
                        can’t chance that, so maybe Abby 
                        and I should just--

                                 PAUL
                        Bitters and soda. Calm that tum tum 
                        right down.

                                 JASON
                        I’ll get it, Dad.
                                 (shaking Evan’s hand)
                        Nice to meet you, Mr. Trautwig.

           As Jason hustles off...

                                 PAUL
                        My son. You just shook an All-
                        County arm there, Evan.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    47.

                                 EVAN
                        When I was in high school my right 
                        arm was pretty prolific as well.
                                 (awkward silence)
                        Abby, I seriously think we should--

           The waving MILF-y HOUSEWIVES from earlier approach. Bob’s 
           first tongue-kiss, MEG COLLINS, is the leader.

                                 PAUL
                        Ladies, these are the Trautwigs.

                                 MEG
                        We’ve got our book club this 
                        afternoon. Have you read The Story 
                        of Edgar Sawtelle?

                                 ABBY
                        No.

                                 MEG
                        Perfect, neither have we.

           As the ladies DRAG HER OFF...

                                 EVAN
                        Wait--!

                                 ABBY
                        Evan, are you gonna--?

                                 PAUL
                        Don’t worry! I’ll take care of him.
                                 (looks at Evan’s feet)
                        What size are you? Like a five?

                                 EVAN
                                 (eeked out)
                        Eight and a half.

           GOLF COURSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan (now dressed uncomfortably in the cheesiest Greg Norman 
           Shark Couture) swings and misses completely. Paul watches 
           from the cart. Evan swings again, hitting himself on the 
           backswing, wincing in pain. Paul enjoys it. Finally saunters 
           over. 

                                 PAUL
                        Evan--

           Evan spins and SCREAMS, wielding the golf club like a weapon.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Whoa. Just thought I’d give you a 
                        little hand there, killer.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Looks like Big Bertha’s swinging 
                        you. Here, let me...

           Paul gently lowers the club and sidles up behind Evan, like a 
           man might do to a woman.

                                 EVAN
                        Oh, no, I don’t--

           Paul reaches around and grips the club over Evan’s shaking 
           hands. A position normally associated with flirtation now 
           pure menace.

                                 PAUL
                                 (whispers in his ear)
                        Keep your head down. But I’m sure 
                        you’ve heard that before.
                                 (knees Evan’s leg)
                        Knee bends, sister. And swing.

           They swing and hit the ball solidly. Evan squirms free.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t this fun?!

           INT. GAME ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The ladies hang out. Abby, Meg, STELLA and JUDY, who bounces 
           a BABY in her lap. Stella’s KIDS play with Transformers on 
           the floor. Stella catches Abby eyeing them.

                                 STELLA
                        You and Evan?

                                 ABBY
                        Workin’ on it.

                                 STELLA
                        That’s the fun part, believe me.

           Paul enters, looking as fresh as before. Evan, limping way 
           behind, is disheveled, dripping with sweat, freaked.

                                 PAUL
                                 (hushed)
                        He seems like a...good guy.

                                 ABBY
                                 (hushed)
                        Well. He’s been a little on edge 
                        lately. Last night he thought he 
                        saw an alien.

                                 PAUL
                                 (chuckles)
                        That old suburban legend.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    49.

           Evan finally reaches them.

                                 ABBY
                        So...did you have fun?

                                 EVAN
                                 (quickly)
                        A lot. I love it here. We should 
                        go.

           Paul runs to the kids...

                                 PAUL
                        Look out for the big...scary... 
                        monster! 

           Evan’s heart skips a beat. The kids laugh and scream. Paul 
           lets them tackle him to the floor, wrestles with them.

                                 JUDY
                        Paul’s great with kids.
                                 (then, re: her baby)
                        How ‘bout you, Evan? Wanna hold 
                        her?

                                 EVAN
                        Oh, no, we really have to be--

                                 ABBY
                        Go for it. It’d be good to get some 
                        practice.

                                 STELLA
                        She won’t bite.

           Reluctantly, Evan takes the baby in his hands, arms fully 
           extended. Couldn’t look less comfortable.

                                 JUDY
                        Hold her close.

           Evan pulls the baby in tight. Hey, that’s not so bad. The 
           baby smiles at him. He doesn’t see Paul slink up beside him.

                                 PAUL
                        Ah-Boo!

           Evan nearly drops the baby. Paul grabs it, continuing his 
           baby talk...

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Ah boo boo boo boo boo. Uncle Paul 
                        sees you.

                                 EVAN
                        Okay, we’re leaving.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    50.

                                 ABBY
                        This was really lovely. All of you. 
                        Thank you so much for having us.

                                 PAUL
                        It was our pleasure.
                                 (hands Evan a piece of 
                                  paper, hushed)
                        The bill for the threads. You can 
                        pay on the way out.
                                 (as Evan goes)
                        Oh, Ev!

           Paul holds up EVAN’S iPHONE. Evan’s eyes grow wide.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I think you dropped this. On the 
                        course.

           Paul hands him the phone, looking him right in the eye...

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Remember...keep your head down.

           Evan goes, giving a nervous look back at the smiling Paul.

           EXT. BOB’S HOUSE - LATER

           Still in his golf clothes, Evan waits anxiously when Bob 
           answers, eyeing the new duds...

                                 BOB
                        Is that Greg Norman’s Shark line? 
                        Color me impressed. 

                                 EVAN
                        Bob, there are aliens living in 
                        this town.

                                 BOB
                        Sure. And as long as it only costs 
                        ten bucks to get my yard done I’m 
                        not asking for green cards.

                                 EVAN
                        Not illegal aliens! Outer-freaking-
                        space aliens! And one of them is 
                        friends with my wife!

                                 BOB
                        It’s true. You city people get the 
                        best pharmaceuticals.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    51.

                                 EVAN
                        I’m not high, Bob. Look, what if 
                        I’m right?! Think about your 
                        daughter!

                                 BOB
                        My daughter will be plenty safe 
                        since she’s grounded forever!
                                 (calling back inside)
                        Isn’t that right?!

                                 CHELSEA (O.S.)
                        What lame song is that from?!

                                 EVAN
                        Bob, we’re going to check this guy 
                        out! Tonight! It’s not up for 
                        discussion!

                                 BOB
                                 (impressed)
                        I like this Evan with the Huevos 
                        Rancheros. Okay. See you at eight.

           INT. PAUL’S LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Paul cleans a plate in the sink with a scrubby brush.

           THE WATCH sit enshrouded in darkness a safe distance up the 
           block. Evan watches intently through binoculars. The rest of 
           the guys are bored. Franklin eats Reese’s Pieces.

                                 BOB
                        Dishwashing. Classic alien 
                        behavior.

                                 EVAN
                        Shut up.

           Paul heads toward another room, out of their line of sight.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        He’s moving. C’mon.

           Evan pops out of the car. Bob goes along.

                                 BOB
                        This oughta be good.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        We’ll stay here in case the 
                        Predator gets in his spaceship.

           Evan and Bob take cover behind bushes. Paul collapses on the 
           couch, flips on Grey’s Anatomy, petting his ROTTWEILER. Bob 
           sees Evan, shakes his head at his paranoia...
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    52.

                                 BOB
                        Hey, Evstevez. Why does this place 
                        freak you out so much?

                                 EVAN
                        I dunno. Maybe it’s the aliens?

                                 BOB
                        I’m serious, buddy. What’re you 
                        really afraid of? C’mon...
                                 (knocks on Evan’s heart)
                        Knock knock.

           Bob keeps knocking. Finally, to stop him...

                                 EVAN
                        I guess I don’t want to become just 
                        another...ordinary suburban drone.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, I feel that. Those guys are 
                        the worst.

           Bob grabs the binocs. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Lemme take a gander...
                                 (sees Paul on couch)
                        Thrilling.

           Bob continues to scan the house. Upstairs in his bedroom, 
           JASON, shirtless, talks to someone. Jason brushes his hair 
           back. When he moves his arm we can now see that he’s video 
           iChatting with CHELSEA! Bob snaps...

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Oh no she didn’t!

           Dials his cell...

                                 JASON
                        Where would you get the tattoo?

                                 CHELSEA
                                 (flirtatiously pulls her 
                                  shorts down just a bit)
                        I was thinking right here so my dad  
                        couldn’t see.
                                 (answers her cell)
                        What do you want?

                                 BOB
                        Get off the computer now!

                                 CHELSEA
                        I’m not on the computer.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    53.

                                 BOB
                        I know you are! And you’re sexting!

           Chelsea looks around, trying to figure out how he sees her.

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        You are officially banned from the 
                        internet!

           Chelsea hangs up. Back to Jason onscreen...

                                 CHELSEA
                        I gotta go.

           As Jason closes his laptop, Evan turns to the still-fuming 
           Bob. His chance to prod back...

                                 EVAN
                        Your daughter isn’t “sidelined”, is 
                        she? She just doesn’t wanna play 
                        pee-wee soccer anymore.
                                 (then)
                        Maybe you have to let her grow up? 

                                 BOB
                                 (shakes his head)
                        You don’t get it yet.
                                 (then)
                        I still remember the day she was 
                        born. No need for the videotape, I 
                        play it every day in here...
                                 (points to his head)
                        ...on a loop. 
                                 (Evan reacts...ew)
                        See, for me, there’s the time B.C.--
                        Before Chelsea--and the time A.D.--
                        After Delivery. Before, I lived for 
                        myself. Jaunt with the boys to 
                        Titty City? Done. B Joel at the 
                        Coliseum? Whatevs. But after you 
                        have a kid...everything changes. 
                        You change. That old dude is gone.

           Evan reacts. This is just what he was afraid of.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        And it’s the best thing in the 
                        world. Because B.C. life wasn’t 
                        really living. When you start 
                        living for more than you...that’s 
                        the special sauce.

           Upstairs, Jason shuts his window. Bob’s eyes narrow...

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        And when I get home, she’s dead.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    54.

           Paul’s PHONE RINGS. He answers. Nods. Heads out.

                                 EVAN
                        He’s on the move. Let’s go!

           ANOTHER STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul’s car turns off into a less developed area--woods on the 
           edge of town. The Neighborhood Watch car follows...

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Where is he going?

                                 BOB
                        There’s nothing out here but a 
                        bunch of old farms. Oh, and there’s 
                        that giant meteor crater.

                                 EVAN
                        Really?

                                 BOB
                        Nope. This is fun.

           Paul turns into a long driveway. Our guys pull over.

           EXT. FARM - MOMENTS LATER

           As the Watch guys tiptoe through pine trees, there’s a dull 
           noise--vvt vvt vvt vvt.

                                 BOB
                        What is that?

           They stop. The noise stops. They take a few more steps. Again 
           vvt vvt vvt. Bob stops, listens as Evan takes a few more 
           steps in his rather tight jeans...

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        You wore hipster pants to a 
                        stakeout. 

                                 JAMARCUS
                        And are those dress shoes?

           Evan wears fancy dress-shoe-like black kicks.

                                 EVAN
                        They’re sneakers. By Prada.

           Bob shakes his head and continues on. Evan tries to keep his 
           legs apart as they approach the farmhouse. Paul’s car is 
           parked alongside several others. In a field, a truck’s 
           headlights shine...on nothing but a couple old COWS.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    55.

           Paul helps a very pregnant woman (CAROLYN) out from one of 
           the other cars. Her husband DAN gets out of the car and helps 
           as well. They head towards the field. A few other people have 
           gathered, what appears to be their extended FAMILY.

                                 BOB
                        That’s the whole Novack family. 
                        They buy a lot of chicken. Get 
                        their photos developed with us and 
                        not the Photomat. Good people. 

           The guys huddle behind the barn to get a better look.

                                 PAUL
                        Carolyn, let’s get you ready...

           Carolyn sits down on the ground. Spreads her legs. 

                                 EVAN
                        That’s great. But what are they 
                        doing out here?

           Paul pulls up her dress and removes...A FAKE BELLY. Dan drags 
           the cow nearby. 

                                 DAN
                        Here you go, Paul.

                                 PAUL
                        Just relax, Papa.
                                 (touches the cow’s belly)
                        Mm hmm. It’s time.
                                 (then)
                        Let’s hold hands.

           Paul and Dan join the family. The cow stands there. The Watch 
           guys share a look. A beat. And then the cow...EXPLODES! Cow 
           guts shoot everywhere. Some even land on our guys.

                                 BOB
                        That just happened.

           Bob, the guts cleared away, finally sees Evan’s face 
           paralyzed with fear. Bob turns now to see...

           AN ALIEN CREATURE

           hatch out of the cattle remains. It unfurls really, our first 
           chance to glimpse an alien head on. Baby size. And it’s not 
           pretty. Jaws gnashing. Ooze dripping.

                                 BOB
                        Okay, maybe they’re aliens.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Holy--!
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    56.

           Jamarcus covers Franklin’s mouth. Paul calmly steps over and 
           the baby alien, cradling it. He clears its mouth and it 
           begins to cry--really horrid shrieking noises--thrashing 
           about violently.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Oh, Dan, he has your fangs.

                                 DAN
                        Mine are not that big.

           The Watch guys are horrified.

                                 EVAN
                        In there!

           They rush into THE BARN. Latch the big doors behind them. 
           Take cover behind some bales of hay. Catch their breath.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        This is not good. This is not good.

           Evan collapses in the hay, not noticing that he is right 
           beside A SLEEPING BABY ALIEN, which stirs a tiny bit. A wider 
           shot reveals A DOZEN SLEEPING BABIES spread throughout the 
           barn. But our guys don’t see them...

                                 BOB
                        What the hell are they, Evan?!

                                 EVAN
                        I don’t know but I’m pretty sure 
                        it’s not good!
                                 (Bob & Jamarcus stare at 
                                  him, eyes wide)
                        What is it now?

                                 BOB
                                 (hushed)
                        Nothing. Chill. Whatever you 
                        do...don’t turn around.

           Evan turns. Behind him, the nearest BABY ALIEN has just 
           awakened from its slumber.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Just be cool. It’s only a baby.

                                 EVAN
                                 (through his teeth)
                        I’m terrible with babies.

           Slowly, we see all the other babies awaken, quite cranky...

                                 BOB
                        I think we’re in their nursery.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    57.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        And it’s feeding time.

                                 EVAN
                        Plan? Anyone?

                                 BOB
                        I’m gonna go with scream like a 
                        girl and run for my life. 

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Second.

           And they do just that, the babies chasing after. They throw 
           open the rear barn door, rumbling out into A FIELD.

           Lying against the barn are a few kids’ DIRT BIKES. The guys 
           hop on, pedal away from the gang of HUNGRY PIRANHA ALIEN 
           BABIES. Evan struggles to keep up--his bike packing a pair of 
           training wheels, his gripless kicks slipping off the pedals.

           A SCREECH. Evan spins back to find an alien baby hanging on 
           his leg, teeth bared. It tries to bite at his ankle.

                                 EVAN
                        Ahh!! There’s one on me!

           Evan turns to Bob, who has THREE ALIENS stuck to his back. He 
           manages to swat two free. The remaining one BITES HIS NECK. 
           Yowww! Bob hits a bump and the baby bounces loose. 

           Evan kicks away his alien. It flies and lands on Jamarcus. 
           Evan shrugs sorry to Jamarcus, who throws it off.

           Another jumps up into Franklin’s basket. Franklin SCREAMS. 
           The alien baby screams back. Leaps onto Franklin, chewing 
           through his shirt pocket, eating the bag of REESE’S PIECES. 
           Slumps down in the basket calmly, burps. Then projectile 
           vomits orange, yellow and brown all over Franklin.

           They approach A DRAINAGE DITCH, a long way down. A herd of 
           baby aliens chasing behind. Nowhere else to turn.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Pissballs.

           Franklin looks at the baby in his basket, the empty bag of 
           Reese’s. An idea, farfetched, but what the hell...

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Um, Mr. Alien Baby. Excuse me. Not 
                        sure if you can do this but could 
                        you please make us fly?

           The baby alien turns, sees the nearing cliff, and...BAILS, 
           leaping to the ground. Our guys running out of room.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    58.

           Bob makes a decision, pedals faster, right at the ravine...

                                 BOB
                        Jump it!

                                 EVAN
                        Are you serious?

           He is, charging at full speed. No other choice, the others 
           follow, SCREAMING...

                                 BOB
                        Shiiiiiiiiit!

           To John Williams’ moving Theme from E.T., the men surge off 
           the cliff, a huge moon behind them as they...fall straight 
           down into a drainage ditch. SPLOOSH! SPLOOSH! SPLOOSH! They 
           land in a river of murky water below.

           One by one, the guys pop up, gasping for air, grabbing a hold 
           of floating jetsam as the current carries them away.

           The baby aliens stop short at the precipice, their shrieks 
           echoing in the night. Paul joins them, our guys long gone, 
           gently patting an alien baby’s head.

                                 PAUL
                        Shhh. It’s okay. The scary humans 
                        are gone now...

           EXT. DOWNSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER

           The soggy guys struggle to climb out of the ditch.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Is everyone okay?

                                 FRANKLIN
                        No! I’m not okay! I’m not okay!
                                 (Bob SLAPS him across the 
                                  face)
                        What was that for?!

                                 BOB
                        I was trying to calm you down!
                                 (Franklin SLAPS him back)
                        Ow. You’re not supposed to hit me 
                        back in those circumstances.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        We just saw a bunch of goddamn 
                        aliens! There are no more rules!
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    59.

                                 EVAN
                        Look, everybody hold it together! 
                        Let’s just-- we’ll go get help, 
                        okay?!

           Evan marches up the hill.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        And who exactly is gonna help us?

                                 EVAN
                        The police.

                                 BOB
                        Oh hell no. Those jabronis?

                                 EVAN
                        Anyone have a better idea?

                                 BOB
                        Yes. We can handle this ourselves.

                                 EVAN
                        I said a better idea.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - LATER

           Soggy, the guys sit in the car. Evan swings his door open. 
           Bob stays put. Eyes Franklin and ‘Marcus, who nod their 
           acquiescence. Evan goes alone.

           INT. POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan enters to find Brussels doing Sudoku.

                                 EVAN
                        I need to see the Captain, please.

                                 BRUSSELS
                        Have a seat.

           Brussels exits. Evan sits. SNIFFS at the air, smelling 
           something. Sees A MUG on Morgan’s desk. Leans over, gets a 
           good whiff. His eyes start to water.

                                 MORGAN (O.S.)
                        You again.

           Evan slams the mug down as Morgan enters, causing a bit of 
           the liquid to splash onto a newspaper, which sizzles, leaving 
           a hole. It’s nitromethane! Morgan sits. Grabs his mug. Takes 
           a long, knowing sip. Ahhhh.

                                 MORGAN (CONT’D)
                        You wanted to see me?
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    60.

                                 EVAN
                                 (rises)
                        Actually, I’m gonna go.

                                 MORGAN
                        What’s the rush?

                                 EVAN
                        No, really, I--

                                 MORGAN
                        Sit down.

           Brussels pushes Evan back down into the chair.

                                 MORGAN (CONT’D)
                        My home is your home.

                                 EVAN
                        Apparently.

                                 MORGAN
                        I assume you’re here to file a 
                        report. So go ahead. Tell me 
                        everything you know. That way I’ll 
                        know the best way to...handle the 
                        situation.

                                 EVAN
                        Okay. Some...kids...knocked over my 
                        mailbox.

                                 MORGAN
                        Uh huh. You know, youngsters can be 
                        pretty vicious sometimes. But grown-
                        ups are even scarier.

                                 EVAN
                        Yes. So why don’t we just...let it 
                        go?

                                 MORGAN
                        I think that’d be wise.

           Evan stands. Run-walks the hell out of there. Morgan watches 
           through the window as Evan hustles to the Tercel. The cop and 
           Bob lock eyes. Bob gives him the finger. As the car pulls 
           away, Morgan and Brussels’ eyes morph into an alien shape, 
           their facial skin becoming more transparent, revealing a bit 
           of the extraterrestrial shape beneath. This isn’t over.

                                 BOB
                        That’s just perfect. As if they 
                        weren’t pricks enough.

           Evan furiously dials his iPhone...

                                 EVAN
                        We gotta go beyond this town. I’m 
                        calling the Feds.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Don’t, uh, mention my name, okay? 
                        It wasn’t even my gun.

                                 EVAN
                        Yes, I’d like to report an alien 
                        sighting. Uh huh...right... 
                                 (long pause)
                        Yes, I have the internet.

           Evan hangs up, defeated.

                        What now?

           INT. LINUS’ HOUSE - LATER

           Linus sits in a ratty old chair, wearing a wife-beater and 
           Kang and Kodos boxer shorts, his legs spread wide.

                                 BOB
                        ...so what do you think...?

                                 LINUS
                                 (beat, then)
                        That sounds crazy.

           The Watch guys are crammed together on Linus’ couch, trying 
           to avert their eyes from his crotch.

                                 BOB
                        Linus, a cow really exploded and--

                                 (was fucking with them)
                        I know, Mary. Alien birth and 
                        cattle mutilation. But you remember 
                        that. From Chapter 7 of my book.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    62.

                                 BOB
                        I didn’t...entirely read it. I’m 
                        sorry, okay?

                                 LINUS
                                 (shrugs)
                        You guys mind if I smoke a pipe?

                                 BOB
                        No, go right ahead.

                                 LINUS
                        Cool. 
                                 (then)
                        Do any of you guys have a pipe?

           Awkward silence, then...

                                 EVAN
                        So they really...take you?

                                 LINUS
                        Every third Thursday.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        That’s tonight!

           Linus indicates his ratty clothes, dripping with sarcasm...

                                 LINUS
                        Why do you think I’m all dolled up?

                                 EVAN
                        That’s horrible.

                                 LINUS
                        I know. I have no idea what 
                        happened on one out of every four 
                        episodes of The Office. Did Jim and 
                        Pam make it?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        What...do you know about them?

                                 LINUS
                        Well I know Pam was moving to New 
                        York--

                                 JAMARCUS
                        No, the--

           INT. DARK SHED - MOMENTS LATER

           A garage door rolls up. Linus pulls a chain to illuminate his 
           conspiracy room, its centerpiece a MAKESHIFT SPACESHIP. 
           Coated with a thick layer of dust. Like an old Trans-Am 
           somebody would keep up on blocks in their yard, tinkering 
           with it but never getting it to start. 

                                 EVAN
                        You have a--?

                                 LINUS
                        Shed? I know. Creepsville, right?
                                 (then, re: ship)
                        These guys crash all the time. Very 
                        lax drunk flying laws. The wrecks 
                        leave spare parts.

                                 BOB
                        Does it work?

                                 LINUS
                        Not in the technical sense.
                                 (Jamarcus touches gun 
                                  glued on the side)
                        That’s an ion cannon from an X-
                        Wing. I just thought it looked rad.

                                 EVAN
                        So why did you build this thing?

                                 LINUS
                        I always dreamed I’d fly up in the 
                        sky--

                                 FRANKLIN
                        And be free like a bird.

                                 LINUS
                        No. I was gonna abduct them and 
                        make them pay bitterly for what 
                        they’d done to me.

           The walls of the shed are covered with conspiracy-laden book 
           shelves and alien-related news clippings. Evan spies one...

           THE FRONT PAGE of the Roswell Daily Record. A black and white 
           photo in which A FARMER poses in front of tin-foil remnants.

                                 EVAN

                                 BOB
                        That was real? The whack jobs have 
                        been claiming that for years.

                                 LINUS
                        Yup. But only the real quality 
                        whack jobs know about this.

           Linus points to another clipping: New York Newsday. A B&W 
           photo. An OLDER MAN and his middle-aged SONS hold SHOVELS and 
           smile, farmland behind them. TEPPERTOWN BREAKS GROUND!

                                 FRANKLIN
                        That’s the same date.

                                 EVAN
                        --Alexander Tepper and Sons 
                        announce their plan to build 2,000 
                        homes on an old potato farm on Long 
                        Island, thus creating the world’s 
                        first suburb.

                                 LINUS
                        The Roswell ship crashed before it 
                        could reach its destination on the 
                        West Coast. But the Teppertown one 
                        landed safely right here. 

                                 BOB
                        You’re saying our town was actually 
                        created by aliens...

                                 LINUS
                        The first of many.

           Linus has tacked AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS of suburban communities 
           to the wall: AGOURA HILLS, CA. COLUMBIA, MD. BELLEVUE, WA. 
           GARLAND, TX. All identical. This is getting creepy...

                                 EVAN
                        It makes sense. The same planned 
                        communities. Laid out the exact 
                        same way...

                                 BOB
                        But why?

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Maybe they’re looking for 
                        something.

                                 LINUS
                        Dunno, Frankie. But if it was in me 
                        they’d’ve found it a long time ago.

           Linus points to a larger map of the US, the suburbs all 
           colored in...

                                 LINUS (CONT’D)
                        What’s clear is that they’re 
                        surrounding our cities. And that’s 
                        the perfect staging area for an 
                        attack.

                                 EVAN
                                 (holy shit...)
                        Paul said something about Moving 
                        Day...said it was coming soon...

           Linus shrugs.

                                 BOB
                        Like hell it is. These alien 
                        bitches wanna move in here they’re 
                        gonna have to move me.
                                 (looks up at the map)
                        We’re gonna stop it.

                        The Neighborhood Watch. That’s who.

           INT. LINUS’ HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob heads in the back door, moving through the house with 
           purpose, the others trailing.

                                 EVAN
                        Bob, that’s ridiculous.

                                 BOB
                        You got a better idea?

                                 (resigned)

                        I’m in. First thing we should do 
                        get matching tats. I’m thinking a 
                        panther. Riding a shark.

           DING! The guys all jump.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    66.

                                 EVAN
                        What the hell was that?!

           Linus crosses to the kitchen, grabs a tray...

                                 LINUS
                        I’m making ‘em nachos. Whole 
                        thing’s over a lot quicker when 
                        they’ve got a snack waiting.

           Jamarcus grabs a nacho, takes a bite.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Blech! There’s no cheese!

                                 LINUS
                        Yeah, just beans and guac. Don’t 
                        know why but the aliens hate 
                        cheese. I once made ‘em dripping 
                        with Velveeta. That was a rough 
                        night. I can still hear his angry 
                        voice echoing through my brain.

           An awkward beat. Bob pats Linus on the shoulder.

                                 BOB
                        Good luck with uh...the um...

                                 LINUS
                                 (matter-of-fact)
                        The probing?

                                 BOB
                        Yes, that. Good luck.

           LINUS’ FRONT YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob strides to the car...

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Bob, what exactly are we gonna do? 
                        We’re just a bunch of dudes with 
                        car magnets.

                                 BOB
                        It’s simple. First we find out who 
                        they are, then we destroy them.

           As they reach the curb, unnoticed by the guys, a WHITE LIGHT 
           surges down on LINUS’ BACKYARD. Our team has no idea as 
           Linus’ little silhouetted body drifts up...

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Now, what do we know about these 
                        things?
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    67.

                                 EVAN
                                 (dismissively)
                        They don’t like cheese.
                                 (then, an idea)
                        They don’t like cheese.

           INT. TRAUTWIGS’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Evan crawls into bed, cuddles up beside the sleeping Abby.

                                 ABBY
                        It’s late. Is everything alright?

                                 EVAN
                        Yes, ma’am.

                                 ABBY
                        What were you doing?

                                 EVAN
                        Making plans.

                                 ABBY
                        For what?

                                 EVAN
                        A barbeque.

                                 ABBY
                        Where?

                                 EVAN
                        Here. 
                                 (she smiles)
                        Thought we could invite all our new 
                        neighbors over for some 
                        cheeseburgers. Maybe some fondue...

                                 ABBY
                        Are you just doing this for me?

                                 EVAN
                        For us.

           She kisses him sweetly.

           EXT. TRAUTWIGS’S BACKYARD - THE NEXT DAY

           Another oppressively hot day. Evan presses down a piece of 
           cheese on a patty with a spatula. He looks up over the grill 
           lid, nods to...Bob who walks with Bonnie, carrying a huge 
           CHEESE TRAY. Bob spots JASON laughing with Scottie. As he 
           leaves Bonnie with CHELSEA, he whispers to his wife...

                                 BOB
                        Don’t let her out of your sight.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    68.

           Bob ambles past Morgan and Gary.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Have you guys ever had Bonnie’s 
                        torte? Three types of cheese. 
                        Gorgonzola, Mascarpone, and she 
                        tops it off with a layer of Cheese 
                        Whiz. It’s like eating Jesus.

                                 MORGAN
                        No thanks, Finnerty. I’m not a big 
                        cheese guy.

                                 BOB
                        Oh really?

                                 GARY
                        Good. More for me.

           Gary gobbles a cheese-laden cracker down. Bob and Evan 
           exchange a look. They know Gary is an alien. Evan turns to 
           Paul, who chuckles with Neal. They both eat CHEESEBURGERS, 
           heavy on the cheese. Bob continues over to Evan...

                                 BOB
                        What the hell’s going on here, E?

                                 EVAN
                        I don’t know! The ones we already 
                        know are eating cheese!

           PAUL sneaks up on them...

                                 PAUL
                        Evbo! So glad I could come over for 
                        a meal. 

                                 EVAN
                        Of course.

                                 PAUL
                                 (with a wink)
                        I’ll have to have you sometime.

                                 EVAN
                        Excuse me?

                                 PAUL
                        You boys up for a little exercise?

                                                                      SMASH TO:
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    69.

           A SILVER DISC, SPINNING THROUGH THE AIR

           WHOMP! The FRISBEE nails Franklin in the face. The Watch guys 
           and alien dudes have gathered on the front lawn. Paul picks 
           up the Frisbee, smiles at Evan.

                                 PAUL
                        Ultimate Frisbee. It’s like 
                        football only with one of these... 
                        flying discs. 

           Evan and he share a tense look.

                                 EVAN
                        Huh. Yeah. Never heard it called 
                        that before.

                                 PAUL
                        So? How ‘bout a...friendly little 
                        game?

                                 EVAN
                        Bring it on.

           Moments later, Team Martian (Paul, Morgan, Brussels, and 
           Neal) executes a perfect first drive. They have amazing 
           skills, no doubt heightened by the fact that they are aliens. 
           They can jump higher, run faster and are incredibly strong. 
           But they also have the dexterity of a hippie with years of 
           Frisbee tossing experience. Finger spins, behind the back, 
           the pop off the top of the hand and catch move. The end 
           result is a touchdown, which Morgan catches over Bob.

                                 MORGAN
                        You protect that end zone about as 
                        well as you protect this town!

                                 BOB
                        You’re totally gay!

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Good one.

           The Watch guys huddle up. Bob sweats profusely.

                                 EVAN
                        Dude, you’re soaked.

                                 BOB
                        I know. It’s October. Freakin’ 
                        global warming.

                                 EVAN
                                 (sees the aliens)
                        They haven’t even broken a sweat.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    70.

           Something changes in Evan’s face. He scans the rest of the 
           party. Abby fans herself. Bonnie puts a cold drink against 
           her forehead. But Gary doesn’t sweat at all. He turns back to 
           the other team...completely sweat-free.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        They’re not sweating! 

                                 BOB
                        No shit, they’re kicking our asses.

                                 EVAN
                        No! That’s how we can tell who’s an 
                        alien! They don’t sweat.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Jamarcus isn’t sweating.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        I’m descended from Africans. This 
                        is like winter for me.

                                 BOB
                        Okay, boys, time to show these 
                        extra testicles what we humans are 
                        made of. Shake their confidence.

           Break! Now it’s our guys’ drive. Not so easy. Paul and Evan 
           tussle for position, tense...

                                 PAUL
                        Getting the hang of it?

                                 EVAN
                        Yup. No sweat.

                                 PAUL
                        Hey, a little marriage advice?

                                 EVAN
                        From the divorced guy?

                                 PAUL
                        Exactly. Unless you want to end up 
                        like me, I’d suggest you act like 
                        you like it here.

           Bob’s pass zips right at Evan and he...holds on. Evan 
           celebrates...just as Paul gives him a bone-crunching hit. 
           Little Gary WHOOPS on the sidelines.

           ABBY, BONNIE, and CHELSEA watch happily from afar.

                                 ABBY
                        Oh, how cute is this. Manly men.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    71.

                                 CHELSEA
                        Mom, I’m gonna grab a water. You 
                        want anything?

                                 BONNIE
                        No, thanks, sweetheart.

           Chelsea gives a tiny nod to JASON to follow her.

           BACK TO THE GAME. Paul tracks Evan in tight man-to-man.

                                 EVAN
                        A little advice? I’d keep your head 
                        down. ‘Cause we’re onto your asses.

           Paul grinds his teeth, perhaps stung.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Chelsea slams the door behind Jason. Pushes him against the 
           shower curtain, which he grasps onto.

                                 JASON
                        I don’t think this is such a good 
                        idea.
                                 (she kisses him)
                        God, you taste good.

           Her eyes closed, she doesn’t see his skin start to become see-
           through, his eyes morphing to an alien shape...

                                 CHELSEA
                        It’s peach Lipsmackers.

           EXT. YARD - CONTINUOUS

           The Watch guys huddle

                                 BOB
                        Okay, Ev, the Great Gazoo over 
                        there is jumping every route. Stop 
                        n’ go, I’ll pump fake, and you’re 
                        free for the score. Break!

           At the line. Hike! Evan runs the route. Paul bites hard on 
           the pump fake, leaving Evan wide open for the touchdown. Bob 
           hurls it beautifully just before he’s slammed to the turf by 
           Morgan. Paul turns on the jets. Just as Evan’s about to make 
           the catch...Paul cheap shots Evan, ELBOWING him in the jaw. 
           Evan collapses to the ground. Paul intercepts the Frisbee, 
           glancing back...

                                 PAUL
                        Enjoy your last thirty-six hours.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    72.

           Thirty-six hours?! Paul wings the dics to Morgan, who catches 
           it for a final score. Team Alien celebrates. 

           Bob sees Bonnie...alone. His brow furrows...

                                 BOB
                        Where is she?!

           INT. TRAUTWIGS’ HOUSE - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob throws open the door to see Chelsea and Jason making out.

                                 BOB
                        Out!

           Jason runs. Bob grabs Chelsea and pulls her outside.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        You’re now grounded for your 
                        afterlife!

                                 CHELSEA
                        Dad!

           I/E. PAUL’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul and Jason sit, tense.

                                 PAUL
                        You’ve gotta learn to control 
                        yourself.

                                 JASON
                        I wasn’t gonna kill her.

                                 PAUL
                        The way your hormones are raging 
                        right now? You get in a compromised 
                        position like that, who knows what 
                        could happen. Play it smart. The 
                        day after tomorrow, you can do 
                        whatever you want.

           INT. COSTCO - LATER

           Bruised and battered, the guys hobble through the store 
           pushing a cart filled with supplies (posterboard, markers). 

                                 BOB (O.S., PRELAP)
                        Alright, gentlemen. I think it’s 
                        safe to say we rattled them.

           Bob grabs rolls of RECEIPTS from a register cubby.

                                 BOB (O.S., PRELAP) (CONT’D)
                        So, what have we learned thus far? 
                        One, aliens do not sweat.

           INT. VIDEO STORE - LATER

           The guys grab movies off the shelves.

                                 BOB (O.S., PRELAP)
                        Two, something called Moving Day is 
                        coming in 36, well it was 36, now 
                        it’s 34 hours.

           INT. FALLOUT SHELTER - LATER

           The place has been turned into a shabby version of a police 
           station. A detailed pyramid of alien coconspirators. Evan 
           tapes a photo of Paul at its apex. Bob stands before them 
           with a laser pointer, which he shines in Evan’s eyes.

                                 BOB
                        And, three, Evan overcooked the 
                        burgers.

                                 EVAN
                        Sorry, it was my first time.

                                 BOB
                        Let’s put this jigsaw together. 
                        Franklin, what’ve you learned?

           Franklin ejects a video. Places it atop a stack of others 
           (Aliens, The Day the Earth Stood Still, ID4, Star Wars, Meet 
           Dave). He and Jamarcus wear headphones, have been studying.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Seems the classic move is for all 
                        the peoples of Earth to come 
                        together and forget our differences 
                        in order to defeat a common enemy.

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, that’s not gonna happen.

                                 BOB
                        Anything else?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        If they look like Eddie Murphy, 
                        they’re an alien.

                                 EVAN
                        What about you, Bob? Anything?

           Bob sorts through the long Costco receipts.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    74.

                                 BOB
                        Okay, I took all the 
                        deodorant/antiperspirant purchases  
                        for the past eight years. Cross 
                        checked against all our regular 
                        customers. Anybody who didn’t buy a 
                        roll-on is...

                        ...a Martian.

                                 EVAN
                        Doesn’t it feel nice to use your 
                        powers for good?

                                 BOB
                        Eh.
                                 (then, reading)
                        Huh. Ellen Clayton is an alien. 
                        That explains prom night.
                                 (typing on calculator)
                        So, out of all of our shoppers... 
                                 (holy shit)
                        Fifty seven point four percent of 
                        Teppertowners are aliens.

                                 EVAN
                                 (shocked)
                        They’re everywhere.

                                 BOB
                        Don’t panic. This is good, okay? We 
                        know who they are. Now it’s time to 
                        find out how they plan to destroy 
                        life as we know it.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Great. And how do we do that?

                                 FRANKLIN
                        When Darth Vader wants to know the

                        kidnaps Princess Leia and questions

                                 BOB
                        Yes! Perfect. We capture one and go 
                        Dick Cheney on his ass.

                                 EVAN
                        Right. Just grab an alien. We’re 
                        talking about the same monsters who 
                        just beat our asses, right?

                        Those were the big guys. But what 
                        about a little one?

           INT. CHILI’S - LATER

           The Watch guys sit at a table, when Evan’s creepy little 
           neighbor GARY drops off an AWESOME BLOSSOM.

                                 GARY
                                 (dickishly)
                        Nice game today, gentlemen.
                                 (then, as he goes)
                        Pretty tough to suck at a hippie 
                        sport.

                                 BOB
                        Once this place closes we jump the 
                        little prick.

           Franklin rips a piece of fried onion off, dunks it in super-
           fattening mayo sauce and tosses it back. Evan winces.

                                 FRANKLIN
                                 (mouth full)
                        Wha?

                                 EVAN
                        Nothing.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        You’ve never had an Awesome 
                        Blossom, have you?

                                 EVAN
                        No. It’s disgusting.

                                 BOB
                        I bet if it was served on a bed of 
                        micro-greens and called an heirloom 
                        onion tempura with a tomahto aioli 
                        you’d love it.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Just try it, man.

                                 EVAN
                        No, thank you.

                                 BOB
                        C’mon. We got an hour ‘til closing. 
                        If you don’t eat, you’re gonna 
                        arouse suspicion from the target.

                                 EVAN
                        Alright, fine. One bite if it’ll 
                        shut you freakin’ people up.

           Evan grabs a hunk. Blanches at the grease on his fingers. 
           Gingerly dabs it in the sauce. Takes a queasy bite. Chews. 
           And then something changes in his face.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        So...?

                                 EVAN
                                 (is he telling the truth?)
                        Uch.

           The guys all shake their heads and dig back in. Evan’s greasy 
           hands wrestle with his napkin under the table. Finally, he 
           cracks, reaches out and grabs a huge handful.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Damnit, it’s actually awesome!

                                 BOB
                        And so it begins...

                                 EVAN
                                 (mouth full, in ecstasy)
                        It’s like eating Jesus.

           INT. TRAUTWIGS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The bell rings and Abby answers to find Paul.

                                 PAUL
                        I left my casserole dish.

                                 ABBY
                        Man, it’s a nice one. I was hoping 
                        you’d forget. Come on in.

           INT. CHILI’S - LATER

           The restaurant’s empty. The Watch guys are stuffed.

                        They don’t show you this part in

                        and singing the whole time.

                        Oh, I’ve seen it. It’s on like five 
                        times every episode of Idol.

                                 EVAN
                        Only to mock it.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Please. You just called it Idol. 
                        That’s some fan shit.

           The only remaining patrons, A COUPLE, head for the door. 

                                 BOB
                        That’s the last of ‘em.

           As Bob’s gaze follows them, he catches sight of some photos 
           on the wall of the local pee-wee soccer champs: CHELSEA AGE 
           11, CHELSEA AGE 12, CHELSEA AGE 13, doting Coach Bob always 
           right beside her. Evan sees...

                                 EVAN
                        You alright, Bob?

                        They don’t make shin pads for your 
                        heart.

           Gary interrupts, dropping their check.

                                 GARY
                        No rush. Really. I don’t wanna get 
                        home at all.

           As Gary slogs his way to the kitchen...

                                 FRANKLIN
                        It’s go time.

                        About what?

                        Let’s cut to the chase, alien. Tell 
                        us what the plan is.

                                 GARY
                        Oh, okay. No.

                                 EVAN
                        Just tell us what Moving Day is and 
                        nobody gets hurt.

                                 GARY
                        Trust me, plenty of people will get 
                        hurt.

           Little Gary kicks Franklin in the chest, sending him flying 
           into a sink. Motions for the others to bring it. Gary throws 
           Evan, who skids along the tile floor. Smashes Bob’s head into 
           a hanging frying pan. Headbutts Jamarcus, who crashes through 
           the pantry. Finally, Gary executes a perfect BACKFLIP, 
           landing right back where he started. As they recover...

                        They have to have a weakness. Some 
                        kind of Achilles Heel.

                        I knew that ending was too 
                        convenient.

                        It stayed true to the book.

           Gary wipes his face, even more pissed now. Stalks Franklin, 
           his alien arm popping loose from his human shell, about to 
           strike with his vicious claws when...Jamarcus pinches Gary’s 
           neck from behind with one hand. Gary collapses, out cold.

                        Vulcan nerve pinch. We just watched 
                        it in the Wrath of Khan.

           Moments later, Gary comes to, tied down to the counter with 
           an absurd amount of rope, duct tape, twist-ties.

                                 BOB
                        What’s Moving Day?

                                 GARY
                                 (laughs)
                        You’ll find out soon enough!

                                 EVAN
                        Tell us!

                                 GARY
                                 (dripping with sarcasm)
                        Oh, okay! Sure. Actually, I’ll do 
                        ya one better. Why don’t I take you 
                        down to The Hive and show you how 
                        it all works?

                                 BOB
                        Nice, jackass. Now we know there’s 
                        something called The Hive. Where is 
                        it?

                                 GARY
                        Damnit! I’m not saying another 
                        word!

                                 BOB
                        Really? Well maybe this will change 
                        your mind?

           Bob whacks Gary in the gut with a FRYING PAN. No response.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Hit ‘im in the balls!

           Bob hits Gary’s crotch. Gary simply laughs.

                                 BOB
                        I don’t know where their balls are! 
                                 (to Gary)
                        Do you even have balls?

           Bob smacks everywhere. More laughter. PHOOOM! Franklin fires 
           up a BRULEE TORCH. Burns Gary horribly.

                                 GARY
                        Oh, that feels nice, actually. A 
                        little lower?
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    80.

           More creepy laughter. That’s it. Bob grabs a pitcher filled 
           with FROZEN NEON LIQUID.

                                 BOB
                        Okay, I didn’t wanna go here. But 
                        if you don’t start giving us some 
                        answers, we’re gonna have to 
                        Margaritaboard you. Where’s this 
                        Hive?

                                 GARY
                        Go fu--

           Bob pours the Margarita right in Gary’s mouth. Which suddenly 
           FREEZES! The freezing spreads right through his entire head.

                                 BOB
                        Oops.

           Franklin barely touches Gary’s head with a finger and 
           it...SNAPS OFF, falling to the floor where it SMASHES INTO A 
           MILLION FROZEN PIECES.

           The guys stare in silence. Bob takes a big swig of Margarita.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        So we know their Kryptonite. The 
                        Presidente Margarita.

                                 BOB
                        It’s cold, Franklin. They don’t 
                        like cold.

           Bob grabs a pack of frozen peas, presses it into dead Gary’s 
           chest, which sizzles.

                                 EVAN
                        This is great. We killed our 
                        suspect. He’s not gonna be doing 
                        much more talking now.

                                 BOB
                        That’s alright. He already told us 
                        what we need to know. The attack is 
                        controlled by this Hive thing.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Great. But where is it?

                                 BOB
                        We know this town. If anyone can 
                        find it, it’s us.

           INT. TRAUTWIGS’ KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Abby and Paul are into a bottle of wine, laughing, as he 
           folds some paper...

                                 PAUL
                        ...and that’s how you can use an 
                        old milk carton to make your own 
                        envelopes.

                                 ABBY
                        I love it. And I never would’ve 
                        thought to rinse and reuse zip-loc 
                        baggies for produce.

                                 PAUL
                        Y’gotta start somewhere.

           She smiles. That’s just what she always says. He puts his 
           hand on hers. A bit too forward. She pulls it away.

                                 ABBY
                        Evan loves zip-loc baggies. My 
                        husband. Evan. Likes to suck out 
                        the air and taste the food.

                                 PAUL
                        How’s he adjusting?

                                 ABBY
                        Really good. It’s a surprise to be 
                        honest. He’s always off with his 
                        new friends. And he thought to plan 
                        that barbeque--

                                 PAUL
                                 (shakes his head)
                        Lisa was in the PTA. And she did 
                        Tupperware parties.

                                 ABBY
                        I’m sorry?

                                 PAUL
                        My ex-wife. They were surface 
                        things. Keeping up appearances for 
                        me. But inside...

           She looks concerned. He leans in closer.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        You have red wine lips.

                                 ABBY
                                 (covers her mouth)
                        Oh I hate that.

           He moves her hand, patting her lips with a napkin, and... 
           KISSES HER! She quickly pulls away.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        I think you should go.

                                 PAUL
                        Abby, I’m sorry--

                                 ABBY
                        Right now. Please.

           He does. She’s shaken, running a finger over her lip.

           EXT. TRAUTWIGS’ DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           As PAUL gets into his car his phone rings. He answers.

                                 MORGAN (O.S.)
                        Paul, it’s me.

           Franklin flips through Teppertown history books. Evan types 
           at a laptop. Jamarcus checks his phone.

                                 BOB
                        Alright, let’s find this Hive.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        It’d probably be wherever these 
                        guys first broke ground. What’s the 
                        oldest building around here?

                                 FRANKLIN
                        The Town Hall! Went up in May of 
                        ‘47 before any of the houses.

                                 BOB
                        What did I tell you? Let’s go get 
                        us some aliens.

                                 EVAN
                        We can’t just go in there unarmed--

                                 BOB
                        Good point.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    83.

           QUICK CUTS. Bob grabs a bunch of colorful plastic things. A 
           finger hits FRAPPE on a blender. Frozen liquid is poured. 
           REVEAL our guys with SUPERSOAKERS filled with frozen 
           Margaritas in Bob’s kitchen. Chelsea calmly walks by...

                                 CHELSEA
                        And I’m the child.

           Bob nods for them to go, stops her at the steps.

                                 BOB
                        This is for your own good.

                                 CHELSEA
                        Tomorrow night’s the Homecoming 
                        game. Everyone is going.

                                 BOB
                        Not everyone. Because you’re not.

                                 CHELSEA
                        I got it. Look, I promise I’ll stay 
                        away from him. 

                                 BOB
                        I don’t trust you.

                                 CHELSEA
                        You can’t leave me locked up 
                        forever. Dad, I could be missing 
                        the best night of my life.

                                 BOB
                        There’ll be plenty more nights.

           Bob is thrown by his own words. Will there? This could be it.

                                 CHELSEA
                                 (sighs)
                        That’s not fair.
                                 (then)
                        You don’t want me to end up a 
                        little runaway. Some...Daddy’s girl 
                        who learned fast...all the things 
                        he couldn’t say.

                        Just don’t go anywhere near him.

           She kisses her father on the cheek.

           The guys and their supersoakers take cover behind the 
           topiary. Bob throws a rock, which lands in a LARGE FOUNTAIN. 
           A SECURITY GUARD puts down his Slurpee to investigate,

           All three ladies’ eyes spin around to silver. They’re aliens! 
           The women POUNCE INTO ACTION, hot soccer moms with Matrix-y 
           fighting skills.

                                 BOB
                        Fire!

           The guys pump their supersoakers and shoot. But...

                                 EVAN
                        It’s melted!

           Bob hadn’t thought of that. Bob throws a haymaker which Meg 
           simply catches in her fist. She tosses him back on his ass.

                                 MEG
                        My kid hated you as a soccer coach.

                                 BOB
                        Run!

           And they do. The women stalk the guys down a hallway, toying 
           with them, tossing them around, knocking them down.

           The women TRANSFORM INTO FULL ALIEN FORM. Our first time 
           seeing this--it’s truly terrifying.

                                 EVAN
                        Ahhh! Ahhh! Just-- Ahhh!

                        I kissed that. With tongue.

           The guys flee upstairs. The alien women follow, CLIMBING UP 
           THE WALLS! They cling to the ceiling and drop down on them.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Down there!

           Jamarcus leads them down a set of stairs into the COURTYARD 
           where the security guard sits with his neck snapped, the 
           Slurpee still in his hand. Morgan, Brussels, and about 50 
           other Teppertowners stand waiting. Their eyes ALL GROW ALIEN-
           Y, their skin translucent.

                                 MORGAN
                        Hey, Bob. Funny running into you 
                        like this.

                        You’re the one who led us here. 
                        Told us this was where they first 
                        broke ground. And all your tough-
                        guy stories...? Trying so hard to 
                        fit in...?

                        Bob, I would never--

           Bob grabs the guard’s Slurpee. Pours the whole thing on 
           Franklin. Who is simply struck with goop.

                        Man, you people are stupid.

           PAUL strides forward, the alien mob parting for its leader, 
           who calmly KNOCKS JAMARCUS INTO THE FOUNTAIN. ‘Marcus slowly 
           pulls himself up from the frigid water...hurting from the 
           chill. He must use his ALIEN ARMS to get out.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        He works for me.

           Paul pushes Jamarcus into the fountain again, just for fun.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                                 (re: The Watch)
                        Get these things out of my sight.

           The cops grab and cuff our guys, who look at Jamarcus in 
           shock. He frees himself again, not cold enough to die. Sees 
           the look on his friends’ faces... 

                                 JAMARCUS
                        I’m sorry.

                        You get drunk with us in a fallout 
                        shelter.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Yeah, pretty much that’s it.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        How could you?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        I had to. If I didn’t help them 
                        they were gonna kill all my peoples 
                        back home.

                                 BOB
                        Well now they’re gonna off your 
                        friends, DJ Benedict Arnold!

                                 PAUL
                        Actually, there’s good news on that 
                        front. I promised Captain Bar 
                        Mitzvah we wouldn’t execute you. So 
                        instead we’re keeping you behind 
                        bars. You’re gonna be the first 
                        animals in our zoo.

           As the cops drag the Watch off, Brussels puts his arm around 
           Jamarcus, who cringes...

                                 BRUSSELS
                        And you can clean up after them.

           Paul leans in to Evan.

                                 PAUL
                        Don’t worry, Ev. I’ll take good 
                        care of Abby.

           Evan fights but is restrained.

           INT. TEPPERTOWN JAIL - LATER

           A COP sits at a desk, sipping Nitro. The Watch guys are 
           locked up in a cell down a hallway. Franklin whittles a 
           toothbrush into a shiv.

                                 BOB
                        Can you believe that traitor?! I 
                        thought of him as a brother. And 
                        not just a black, calling him ‘my 
                        brother’ thing, but a real brother.

           Evan is lost, hopeless...

                        This is it. I’m never gonna see 
                        Abby again.

           Franklin is silent. Bob rests his hand on his shoulder.

                                 BOB
                        You okay, buddy?

           Frank spins around wielding the shiv.

                                 FRANKLIN

                        You don’t have to make up all this 
                        gangster stuff, Franklin. You’re a 
                        sweet guy who loves his wife and 
                        kids and it’s okay. We know you 
                        were never in any bar fights.

           Before Franklin can answer...

                                 JAMARCUS (O.S.)
                        I should’ve told your asses the 
                        truth a long time ago.

           Reveal Jamarcus, outside the bars. They jump up, rush to him.

                        I ripped his heart out.

                        You think you guys can forgive me?

           Franklin looks at the shiv...jabs it in the wooden bench.

                                 FRANKLIN

                        This was our instruction tape upon

                        We use a technology you can’t 
                        fathom. But I burned it to DVD.

                        As you’ve already discovered, we 
                        prefer a warmer climate. Before we 
                        could fully colonize, the planet

                        Tomorrow at nine...we move in.

           Jamarcus hits pause on an image of unspeakable horror. The 
           men stand there in shock. Finally...

                                 BOB
                        This is great! Their Hive is right 
                        here in Teppertown! We can stop it.

           Evan snaps. He’s done with this. Points at the screen...

                                 EVAN
                        Are you kidding?! Look at that! 
                        It’s over.

                                 BOB
                        Like hockey sticks it is.

                                 EVAN
                        Bob--

                                 BOB
                        No! We are human beings! We went to 
                        the moon! We put rock climbing 
                        walls on cruise ships! We can do 
                        anything.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Booyah! I’m in. Whaddawedo?

                                 BOB
                        We find The Hive and destroy it, 
                        there’s no Moving Day.

                                 EVAN
                        Great. Except you don’t know where 
                        The Hive is. Do you?

           Bob turns to Jamarcus.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Above my pay grade.

                                 EVAN
                                 (rising)
                        I’m done.

                                 BOB
                        Evan--

                                 EVAN
                        I’m going home!

           Evan hustles out the door. Bob follows.

                                 EVAN
                        You can’t stop this, Bob.

                                 BOB
                        Of course we can! We’re the 
                        Neighborhood Watch!

                                 EVAN
                        Exactly! We’re a bunch of dudes 
                        with car magnets! We’re not Will 
                        Smith!
                                 (then)
                        We’re not in save-the-world 
                        territory anymore, okay? We were 
                        just given an extra 24 hours to 
                        live. And I want to spend it with 
                        the woman I love, Bob. In the city 
                        I love. I wanna watch the sun rise 
                        over the river. I wanna jump a 
                        turnstile and ride the subway 
                        anywhere. I wanna eat dinner at Le 
                        Cirque. And order a bottle of 
                        Latour Pauillac, 1990.

                                 BOB
                        Ah, see, that’s just one bottle. 
                        There’s free refills on Chianti at 
                        the Olive Garden--

                                 EVAN
                        My last meal is not gonna feature 
                        crazy bread!

                                 BOB
                        Evan, the team needs you. You’re 
                        one of us now.

                                 EVAN
                        Bob, I need you to really hear me 
                        for once. I came to you because I 
                        had to protect my wife and I had 
                        nowhere else to turn. But I am not, 
                        nor will I ever be, one of you.

           Bob takes this in. Swallows. Then...

                                 BOB
                        Okay. Okay, I get it. I know how 
                        you see me. You think I’m Mr. 
                        Ordinary. King of the Food Court! 
                        And maybe you’re right. But I 
                        wasn’t always this guy. 
                                 (off Evan’s look)

                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    93.
                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, Tommy Bahama used to go to 
                        Manhattan. I dated a Puerto Rican 
                        girl. I ate blowfish. Did you know 
                        that? It’s so cool it’s poisonous.
                                 (then)
                        But when Bonnie got pregnant I 
                        settled here. And I’m damn glad I 
                        did. Because none of that stuff 
                        mattered.
                                 (looks him over)
                        You think you’re some kind of hep 
                        cat? Newsflash--you’re a grown man 
                        in kiddie pants.
                                 (then)
                        Guess what, Evan? Life’s not about 
                        your address. It’s about your 
                        neighbors. I like the people in my 
                        life. And they’re happy to call me 
                        their friend.

                                 EVAN
                        That’s fine, Bob...but I’m just 
                        not.

           Bob stands there, hurt but stoic. He reaches into his jacket 
           and REMOVES A CD. Hands it to Evan.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        What’s this?

                                 BOB
                        I was gonna surprise you. 

           It’s a homemade mix: NOW THAT’S WHAT BOB CALLS MUSIC ‘10.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Just take it and go.

           INT. TRAUTWIGS’ HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           BANGING on the back door. Surprised, Abby opens it. Evan, out 
           of breath, paranoid, checks over his shoulder. 

                                 ABBY
                        Why are you--?

           As he storms in...

                                 EVAN
                        They’re really aliens!

           That’s the third strike. She’s crushed.

                                 ABBY
                        Evan, you promised--
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    94.

                                 EVAN
                        I know. But, it’s true. Look, we 
                        only have--

                                 ABBY
                        You want to go back to the city. I 
                        knew it. I knew this was coming.

                                 EVAN
                        Abby--

                                 ABBY
                        Tell me the truth. Did you ever 
                        really give these people a chance? 
                        Or were you just pretending? With 
                        your barbecue and your Neighborhood 
                        Watch?

                                 EVAN
                        I tried, but--

                                 ABBY
                        Look, it’s nobody’s fault. When we 
                        fell in love we were in the same 
                        place. And now we’re just not 
                        anymore, Evan. I want a kid and a 
                        house. And you still wanna be the 
                        unattached couple in the city. I 
                        shouldn’t’ve tried to change you.

                                 EVAN
                        Is that really what you think?

                                 ABBY
                        This is exactly what Paul said 
                        would happen.

                                 EVAN
                        Paul?! What did he say--?!

           She looks away. He sees she’s hiding something.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        What happened?!

                                 ABBY
                        Look, I was going to tell you. He 
                        kissed me--

                                 EVAN
                        Ah! Oh my god.

                                 ABBY
                        And I pushed him away.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    95.

                                 EVAN
                        You kissed him?! How could you?!

                                 ABBY
                        He kissed me! 
                                 (then)
                        But you know what?! Part of me 
                        wanted him to. Because we want the 
                        same things in life.

                                 EVAN
                        I can’t believe this! Do you know 
                        how hard I was trying?! And this is 
                        what you do to me?

           POLICE SIRENS, approaching. Evan looks out the window to see 
           THREE COP CARS screech up in front of the house. 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        We’ve gotta get out of here--!

           He hustles her to the back door.

                                 ABBY
                        I’m not going anywhere.

                                 EVAN
                        Abby, you don’t understand--!

                                 ABBY
                        Get out!

           Cops on the front lawn. He GRABS HER ARM, no time for 
           arguing, pulls her through the door...

                                 EVAN
                        C’mon--!

           She RIPS HER ARM AWAY, backing inside.

                                 ABBY
                        What the hell has gotten into you?!

                                 EVAN
                                 (reaches out)
                        Abby--

                                 ABBY
                        Get off me! Just. Go!

           She SLAMS THE DOOR. Evan tries the knob. It’s locked.

                                 EVAN
                        Abby!
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    96.

           The cops RING THE DOORBELL. He sees her go to open the door. 
           Damnit! He runs through the yard to his car (parked on the 
           street behind). Dials Bob...

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Pick up pick up pick up.

           INTERCUT BOB strategizing in the shelter. He sees that it’s 
           Evan. Stubbornly doesn’t answer. Evan reaches the Prius...

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

           EXT. HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan drives, distraught. Lights flash ahead. COP CARS. A ROAD 
           BLOCK. He SWERVES ACROSS THREE LANES, barely making the exit.

           TRAIN STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Lights killed, Evan rolls into the deserted parking lot in 
           neutral. Pulls over in the shadows. Checks to see he’s alone. 
           Dials again. Bob’s voicemail picks up...

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        It’s Bob. You know what to do.
                                 (ala Outkast’s Hey Ya)
                        You know what to dooooo. You know 
                        what to--BEEP!

                                 EVAN
                        Bob, call me. I’ve got nowhere else 
                        to go.

           EXT. SAME LOCATION - THE NEXT MORNING

           A TRAIN rumbles past. Evan snaps awake, not sure where he is, 
           face covered in spit. The way he’s laying, something digs 
           into his side. He reaches into his jacket pocket and removes 
           BOB’S MIX CD. Evan shakes his head. Then opens it. Pops it in 
           the player. The melancholy opening verse of a Bon Jovi ballad 
           begins, over which Bob speaks...

                                 BOB (ON CD)
                        Let’s start off with a little 
                        dedication. Robert from Teppertown 
                        writes: I once knew this guy. Who 
                        moved to this little town. He was 
                        scared shitless of losing himself. 
                        Becoming the same as everybody 
                        else. But he didn’t lose anything. 
                        He found himself. For the first 
                        time.

                        Who’d you steal that from, REO 
                        Speedwagon?

                                 BOB (ON CD)
                        Go to your room!
                                 (then)
                        Where’s the G.D. rewind?

                        Okay. Ahem.
                                 (back to his cool voice)
                        So this one’s for that guy. My new 
                        best friend.

                                 JON BON JOVI
                        I’ll be there for you. These five 
                        words I swear to you. When you 
                        breathe, I wanna be the air for 
                        you.

           I’ll be there for you.
                                                    I’ll be there for you.

           Evan shakes his head. It’s cheesy. But has it softened him a 
           bit? A TRAIN APPROACHES the station, heading the opposite 
           direction as the previous one.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Eight-forty to New York now 
                        arriving on Track One.

           Evan watches the train pull up to the station. A way out. He 
           opens the car door...

           FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKS

           The train blocks our view of the Prius. Its doors HISS and 
           the train pulls away, revealing...Evan, still in the car. 

           He slams the door shut, causing THE COSTCO POTATO KEYCHAIN in 
           the ignition to jiggle. Evan stares at the swaying potato, 
           the moving-ish Jovi continuing. Slowly a realization dawns on 
           him...That’s it!!! Determined, Evan fires the engine. The 
           Prius races off.

           INT. TRAUTWIGS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Abby sits thinking on the couch when the phone rings.

                                 ABBY
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT PAUL in his house.
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    98.

                                 PAUL
                        Abby, I’m so sorry about the other 
                        night. It’ll never happen again. I 
                        just--it’s been hard for me since 
                        Lisa left and--it was unacceptable.

                                 ABBY
                        Yes, it was.

                                 PAUL
                        Look, I’m having some people from 
                        the town over today to talk about 
                        the new recycling plan. You should 
                        be there. I’m an ass and I don’t 
                        deserve you. But your planet does.

                                 ABBY
                                 (considers, then)
                        Will there be pie?

           I/E. PRIUS (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           Evan on his cell, calling Abby. It’s busy.

                                 EVAN
                        Damnit!

           Tries Bob. INTERCUT BOB. In the Neighborhood Watch car. 
           Driving past Costco.

                                 BOB
                        Alright, boys. Keep your eyes 
                        peeled. We’re gonna find this Hive!

           Checks his phone. Sees it’s Evan again. Still doesn’t answer.  

                                 BOB (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
                        You know what to--BEEP!

                                 EVAN
                        Bob, it’s me! I know where The Hive 
                        is! Call me!

           INT. TRAUTWIGS’ HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan rushes in to find an address written on a pad by the 
           phone: “Paul’s 425 Maple” No... Marv barks. Evan grabs him 
           and runs...

           INT. PAUL’S HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           A group of LOCAL BUSINESSPEOPLE kibbitz with Paul and Abby, 
           who rises with her finished plate of food.

                                 ABBY
                        Anybody need another drink?
                        Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    99.

           She pads to the kitchen. Pours herself a Snapple. Tosses the 
           bottle in the RECYCLING BIN. Which is empty. Now she takes 
           the plate, goes to knock off the scraps into the REGULAR 
           GARBAGE. Which is...FILLED WITH RECYCLABLES! She gasps. Feels 
           a hand on her shoulder. Spins to find Paul.

                                 PAUL
                        You have no idea.

           I/E. PRIUS - CONTINUOUS

           Evan races through the Teppertown streets, on his cell. 
           Another BEEP on Bob’s voicemail...

                                 EVAN
                        Bob, pick up, damnit! Paul has 
                        Abby!

           ...skidding to a stop down the block from Paul’s house, where 
           his guests stream out, waving goodbye. Evan lowers the window 
           for Marv, who whines.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Stay here.

           Evan tiptoes around the side of the house to Paul’s study. 
           Tries a window. Locked. Another. Locked. Finally, one slides 
           open. Evan struggles to pull himself up, shimmies halfway 
           through the window, when he hears a GROWL. Looks up to see 
           Paul’s Rottweiler, teeth bared. Before he can shimmy out, the 
           window squeezes down on Evan’s midsection. It’s pushed by 
           Paul. Who sighs...

                                 PAUL
                        Humans.

                                 EVAN
                        Where is she, you freak?!

           The dog BARKS at Evan’s aggression.

                                 PAUL
                        Dahmer, no.

                                 EVAN
                        You named your dog after Jeffrey 
                        Dahmer?

                                 PAUL
                        Good alien. Just couldn’t wait 
                        until the big day. Can’t say I 
                        blame him.

           Paul calmly takes the last sip from his cocoa mug. Evan 
           sniffs at the air.
                       Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    100.

                                 EVAN
                        I smell her perfume. I know she’s 
                        here. If you hurt her I swear--

           Paul whacks Evan over the head with the mug.

           INT. GARAGE - THAT EVENING

           The sun setting. Evan comes to as Paul finishes tying him to 
           a chair beside Abby, already bound. Dahmer standing guard. A 
           HUMMER is parked beside them. Abby looks at her husband, 
           whimpering through a gag.

                                 EVAN
                        Okay, so I was right about the 
                        aliens. But you were right about 
                        everything else. I made you promise 
                        I wouldn’t change but I needed to. 
                        I was scared shitless, Abby. I 
                        still am...but I’m ready now. For 
                        friends and a linen closet and a 
                        baby. I want the special sauce.
                                 (off her puzzled look)
                        I want my life to be about more 
                        than just me.

           Though his hand is bound he manages to pry free his little 
           finger.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Pinky swear.

           Somehow, through it all, she smiles, bittersweetly. Tries to 
           say something.

                                 PAUL
                        She loves you, too.
                                 (then)
                        You bind and gag enough people, you 
                        start to understand.
                                 (she struggles again)
                        Sorry, couldn’t catch that.

           Paul lowers her gag...

                                 ABBY
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 PAUL
                        Our planet’s overcrowded. We need a 
                        suburb and this podunk planet is 
                        it. Trust me, had I known what 
                        assholes you were I’d’ve never 
                        taken the job. My wife couldn’t 
                        stand it. Left me here alone.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Do you know what it’s like to get a 
                        Dear John letter when she’s already 
                        seven trillion light years away? 
                        Kinda stings.

                                 EVAN
                        Just a thought here, but maybe your 
                        wife didn’t leave because she hated 
                        us. Maybe she left because she 
                        couldn’t stand you.

                                 PAUL
                        Cute. But it was definitely you 
                        people who cost me my Lisa. That’s 
                        why I’ve always planned to take one 
                        with me. To make things even.
                                 (re-gags Abby)
                        Abby’ll fetch a terrific price in 
                        our galaxy.

           Paul throws Abby in the back of the Hummer.

                                 EVAN
                        No! Please! Paul, let her go! Take 
                        me!

                                 PAUL
                        Dahmer, Bon Apetit.
                                 (flashes the sign)
                        Peace.

           The Hummer peels off. Dahmer slowly stalks forward towards 
           Evan, drooling in anticipation of his next meal...

           Bob can’t help but look at his phone. Sees the voicemail

                        I’m gonna check my voicemail. In

           As he listens, they drive past the HIGH SCHOOL.

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Big night out in suburbia. The whole community gathered under 
           the lights for the big game. The marching band playing. 

           CHELSEA sits in the stands. Sees JASON run off the field 
           after throwing a TD. The CROWD cheers for their star.

           But his focus is on Chelsea. He smiles that smile. Rushes up 
           to the edge of the stands.

                        Meet me at halftime. The training 
                        room.

           She’s torn...

           INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Dahmer licks his chops, about to attack when...he’s SLAMMED 
           INTO and sent skittering to the wall. Reveal his attacker was 
           Marv! The cute little Boston Terrier.

                                 EVAN
                        Marv! Good dog!

           A weird GROWL, not from this Earth. Dahmer TEARS OUT of his 
           Rottweiler skin to reveal he is actually some kind of ALIEN 
           CREATURE, equivalent to a dog for them. Kinda like a giant 
           scorpion hyena.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s not good.

           Marv GROWLS back. Takes a tough stance.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Marv, don’t. That thing is--

           But Marv isn’t taking this lying down. He steps forward, 
           BARKS.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Marv--

           Suddenly, Marv rips through his own adorable Terrier suit, 
           revealing that he is, in fact, a scorpion hyena himself. 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Marv?

           An alien dogfight ensues, the creatures clinging to the 
           walls, leaping over Evan’s head. They trash the garage, as 
           Evan winces, screams. They are slightly different variations, 
           but we can tell them apart by their colored collars.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m so glad we adopted.
                                 (realizing)
                        From a shelter. Here in Teppertown.

           The two dogs land across the garage from each other, size 
           each other up. Simultaneously they leap at each other, 
           clashing in mid air. A YELP. Dahmer sinks the floor, licking 
           his wounds, whimpering.

           Marv wields his spiky tail. Is he going to finish off the 
           creature? SLICE! Marv slashes all of Evan’s ropes, so close 
           to Evan’s skin that his t-shirt probably has a little rip.

           A giant TONGUE flicks out from Marv’s mouth, licking Evan’s 
           face gently.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Who’s a...good boy.

           The garage door surges open, the Watch guys on the other 
           side.

                                 BOB
                        Jamarcus, kill it!

                                 EVAN
                        No, that’s my dog.

           Bob shrugs. It’s been a weird day. As Bob helps Evan to his 
           feet...

                                 BOB
                        I got your message.

                                 EVAN
                        Bob, I’m sorry--

                                 BOB
                        You don’t have to say anything. 
                        It’s the end of the world. Feelings 
                        get a little touchy.

           Evan holds out a fist for a pound. Very un-Evan. Bob smiles 
           and obliges. But time is short...

                                 EVAN
                        I know where The Hive is. It’s at 
                        the Costco.

                                 BOB
                        Did you take a blow to the noggin’?

                                 EVAN
                        I’m serious. It’s right on top of 
                        the old potato farm. That’s where 
                        they first broke ground. Not Town 
                        Hall.

           Evan dangles the keychain.

                                 BOB
                        First football. Now this.

           CLOSE ON EVAN’S HAND

           Popping a CD into a stereo. Bon Jovi’s new faster, baddass 
           remix of Wanted Dead or Alive over a MONTAGE in which the 
           team prepares for battle, A-Team style.

           * Franklin has a cabinet full of shotguns. Tosses them to our 
           guys.

           * Bob cracks open a box of Costco HEADSETS.

           * Jamarcus unloads a huge vat of dry ice from the DJ smoke 
           machine in his trunk. 

           * In Bob’s kitchen, the guys pour the frozen mixture into 
           SHOTGUN SHELLS.

           * Bob has made a little model of the Costco with Chelsea’s 
           old Duplos, going over a plan with the others. Finally his 
           expertise comes in handy.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        There’ll be a few dozen of ‘em 
                        there, protecting The Hive.

           * They plug their supersoaker hoses into LARGE DRUMS. Pop 
           chemical ICE PACKS in their pockets.

           * A shot of the men in Bob’s yard, in slo-mo, walking towards 
           camera, cocking their shotguns, frozen ammunition bandoleros 
           slung over their shoulders, Costco headsets on.

           Our montage ends as they approach Franklin’s truck, COOL GUY 
           A/C REPAIR written on the side. Bob leans in to Evan, for the 
           first time betraying the tiniest bit of skepticism...

                                 BOB
                        We really are just a bunch of dudes 
                        with car magnets. You sure we can 
                        do this? 

                                 EVAN
                        Of course we can.
                                 (steely resolve)
                        We’re the goddamn Neighborhood 
                        Watch.
                                 (grabs the keys)
                        I’ll drive.

           I/E. FRANKLIN’S TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Our guys race toward battle. Jamarcus taps on the dashboard 
           clock. 8:38.
                       Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    105.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        We’ve only got twenty-two minutes 
                        to do this.

           Evan slams on the gas, surging into the Costco parking lot.

                                 EVAN
                        Bob, I just wanna let you know. I’m 
                        gonna hurt your Costco right now.

           Evan floors it, headed right for the bulk store’s GLASS FRONT 
           ENTRANCE... Bob covers his eyes... Franklin cheers...

           CRRRASHHH!!!!

           INT. COSTCO - CONTINUOUS

           We burst out the truck’s rear doors. The dust settles to 
           reveal...TWO DOZEN ALIENS. Transformed and pissed. It’s on.

           Bob gives a TACTICAL HANDSIGN to Jamarcus who triggers the 
           supersoakers...which are connected to Franklin’s A/C-repair 
           FREON DRUMS. When the cold chemical hits them it spreads 
           through the aliens’ bodies which freeze, then EXPLODE like 
           shards of glass. The supersoakers wipe out the first wave. 
           More HANDSIGNS. Franklin cuts open a chemical ICE PACK, 
           tosses it like a grenade. The cover laid down, the guys move 
           out.

           An alien hisses, descending on Bob, who blasts him with the 
           shotgun. The cold from the nitrogen-tipped bullet explodes 
           the alien.

                                 BOB
                        Welcome to the suburbs, bitch.

           Now a giant battle erupts. Very real combat amidst the most 
           mundane of consumer goods. The optometrist. The Christmas 
           trees.

           The three MILFs descend ON BOB. 

                                 MEG
                        I don’t usually like to eat people. 
                        All those calories. But for you, 
                        I’ll make an exception.

           Bob blows away Judy and Stella. But Meg proves tougher, 
           knocking his gun away. She backs him up against a FROZEN FOOD 
           CASE filled with Eggo waffles. Just as she’s about to rip out 
           his neck, Bob swings the door open, sending her flying into 
           the FREEZER. He slams the door shut on her. As the cold 
           spreads through her body...
                       Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    106.

                                 BOB
                        Your kid had poor ball skills and a 
                        piss-ass attitude.

           FRANKLIN dive-rolls into the drink aisle. Two aliens drop 
           from the ceiling. Frank fires but his GUN JAMS. One alien 
           smiles, runs at him. Franklin throws open a cooler, grabs a 
           cold beer bottle, and smashes it over its head, then jabs it 
           in its heart. Smashes the other’s head through the glass. 
           He’s like Swayze in Roadhouse. Jamarcus watches, slack-jawed.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        I wasn’t kidding about the bar 
                        fights. Shit went down!

           The team reunite in the auto section. Evan indicates the TIRE 
           PILE, slid open, the passageway visible.

                                 EVAN
                        I found the way down.

                                 BOB
                        Radials. Genius. Haven’t sold one 
                        if fifteen years.

           They rush in, fighting off aliens, slamming the door shut 
           behind them. Jamarcus smashes his hand into a fusebox, 
           ripping out wires, locking the door, the aliens in Costco now 
           trapped outside. They head down into the

           DARK PASSAGE

           A labyrinth of winding corridors. It’s hot, damp. Sweat 
           dripping down our guys’ faces.

           HIVE ROOM

           The guys emerge into a massive space, awed at the giant 
           beating HIVE in its center. A control panel around it, 
           massive air ducts hanging from the domed ceiling above. They 
           aim their weapons at the Hive...

                                 BOB
                        On three. One...two...three!

           They all FIRE SHELLS at The Hive. It seems to be hit, TURNS 
           BLACK. Then nothing. Suddenly, the shells come surging back 
           out, PINGING around the room, nearly killing our guys...

                                 FRANKLIN
                        What the hell was that?!

                                 JAMARCUS
                                 (realizes)
                        Oh dang. The Hive.
                       Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    107.

                                 EVAN
                        What about The Hive?! Explain!

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Well the Hive is like this giant 
                        ball of...stuff-- but it’s strong 
                        and it-- Hive-izes anything but 
                        more Hive--

                                 BOB
                        Really? That’s the best you can do?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        I’d like to see one of you explain 
                        photosynthesis.
                                 (then)
                        Look, it’s pure energy. And I’m 
                        pretty sure the only thing that can 
                        destroy it would be more of that 
                        same energy.

                                 BOB
                        Damnit.

           They stand there in silence, wracking their brains.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Energy...energy...energy...

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Repeating it isn’t helping.

                                 EVAN
                                 (realizing)
                        The car battery...

                                 BOB
                        Yes, it was defective. Why are you 
                        bringing this up now?

                                 EVAN
                        Remember?! The jumper cables. I 
                        didn’t ground it and it blew the 
                        battery. If the only thing that’ll 
                        blow it is more of itself, maybe we 
                        just need to mess with its cables.

                                 BOB
                        Yes. This good!
                                 (then)
                        You said this thing is sending its 
                        energy out to the ships through the 
                        goalposts, right?

                                 (nods)
                        We can access the cable in the high 
                        school. The Equipment Room.

                                 BOB
                        We un-ground that end, it’ll send 
                        the energy back here and--

                                 (looking at The Hive)
                        Blow the battery.

                                 BOB
                        Frank, guard the door. Evan, go get 
                        Abby. 
                                 (to Jamarcus)
                        Zeddemore, you’re coming with me. 
                        We’re going to school!

           Bob and Jamarcus race back out into the tunnels.

           Evan scans the Hive room. Sees ANOTHER PASSAGEWAY. Nods 
           goodbye to Franklin. Carefully approaches, gun drawn...

           WINDING THROUGH THE ALIEN TUNNELS

           Bob counts an exact number of paces, looking up.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Aisle sixteen, diapers, toaster 
                        strudel, and...the air vent.

           They have, indeed, arrived at vent grate. Jamarcus rips it 
           open and they hurry in, climbing a ladder...

           PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob and ‘Marcus pop out the other end, now outside Costco. 
           Look back towards the entrance where the A/C truck EXPLODES.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        There goes that plan.

           Bob looks across to some nearby HOUSES. An idea. Sneaks 
           across the parking lot on foot...

           ON EVAN

           As he searches these new tunnels. Hears something ahead. 
           Lights flash, like televisions. Tiptoes up to find

           THE CONTROL CENTER

           A wall of screens monitor the impending attack. Evan walks 
           in, gun drawn.
                       Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    109.

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        Does this mean you killed my dog?

           Paul (in full alien form for the first time, the most vicious 
           one yet) emerges from the shadows, holding little Abby in 
           front of him as a hostage shield.

                                 EVAN
                        Technically, my dog killed your 
                        dog. But, yes.

                                 PAUL
                        Drop the gun, Evan. Or she dies.

                                 EVAN
                        We’re gonna blow your Hive, Paul. 
                        Let her go and I’ll let you walk 
                        out of here.

                                 PAUL
                                 (grips her tightly)
                        I’d rather we all die.

           LINUS’ HOUSE

           Bob and Jamarcus burst in to find Linus on his couch, smoking 
           a pipe, and watching an episode of The Office in which Jim is 
           about to propose...

                                 BOB
                        We need your help.
                                 (Linus hesitates)
                        I’ll get you the DVD!

           FOOTBALL FIELD

           The ref blows the whistle. Halftime. The team jogs off. 
           CHELSEA bites her lip and...rushes off towards the school.

           The BURNOUTS lay on the grass off to the side of the 
           bleachers, again looking up at the sky. Another SHOOTING 
           STAR.

                                 DEBARGE
                        Hey, look, a shooting--!

           But the star freezes in midair. As does another. And another. 
           And a dozen more. Debarge rubs his eyes. The stars, with 
           their linear glinting, begin to ROTATE, revealing that they 
           are, in fact, SPACESHIPS! Hundreds of them. Filling the sky. 
           Descending. Right now. What the--?

           The scoreboard CLOCK flips from 8:59 to 9:00. The WHOLE CROWD 
           looks up, freaked...

           LINUS’ SHED

           Jamarcus has the hood up on Linus’ SPACESHIP. The ENGINE 
           STARTS.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        You were close. I can’t believe you 
                        got this thing to run on a 
                        lawnmower engine.

                                 BOB
                        Alright. Punch it, Lando!

                                 JAMARCUS
                        I can’t fly this thing.

                                 BOB
                        What do you know?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Can you fly an airplane?

           GUNSHOTS ring out. Bob leans out to see a COP CAR on the 
           lawn, MORGAN and BRUSSELS firing...

                                 BOB
                        They’re after us!

           Bob hops into the small cockpit, the others following.

                                 LINUS
                        I got this.

           Linus shoves his way in front of the alien controls. No wheel 
           or throttle, just hands in front of a sensor ala Minority 
           Report. Doesn’t exactly know what he’s doing.

                                 LINUS (CONT’D)
                        Okay, just gotta take off the 
                        emergency brake--

           The ship flies backwards, surging through the wooden shed, 
           which is smashed to pieces.

                                 LINUS (CONT’D)
                        My bad.

           The ship SURGES UP into the sky, the cops shooting after in 
           vain.

           SKIES ABOVE TEPPERTOWN

           Linus flies erratically. Zips through a giant donut atop a 
           donut store. Goes vertical between the legs of the WATER 
           TOWER. Zooms past a COP whose eyes go alien. He gets on his 
           radio, calling it in...

           CONTROL CENTER

           Tense. Evan and Paul circling. Abby looks up at the alien, 
           then to her husband, decided...

                                 ABBY
                        Shoot him, honey.

           His hand shakes. He could hit her...

                                 EVAN
                        But what if I--?

                                 ABBY
                        You can do this.

           Evan’s hand trembles on the gun. Should he? No. But he has 
           to. Finally...

                                 EVAN
                        Keep your head down.

           CLICK. Out of bullets. Paul smiles.

                                 PAUL
                        Nice tough guy line.

           Paul tosses Abby across the room to the monitor wall. She 
           falls to the ground, unconscious. Evan backs away. Uses the 
           shotgun as a stick, fending off Paul, who swipes at him, 
           enjoying this...

           AT THE FOOTBALL FIELD

           The marching band does their halftime show, playing John 
           Williams’ theme from Star Wars. IN THE STANDS people point at 
           the sky, panicked. Suddenly, A SHIP COMES SCREAMING DOWN...

           It CRASHES in an endzone and SKIDS TO A STOP at the fifty 
           yard line. Silence. Its hatch opens...FSSHHHH! Our guys pop 
           out.

                                 OLD LADY IN STANDS
                        They look just like us!

                                 LINUS
                        I come in peace!

                                 BOB
                                 (hops out)
                        Let’s move!

           They rush into the school...

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Throw open the doors to find...MORGAN AND BRUSSELS waiting 
           for them.

                                 BRUSSELS
                        Ladies.

                                 BOB
                        How did they--?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        We didn’t exactly take the 
                        straightest route.

                                 MORGAN
                        I’m gonna enjoy this.

           Linus’ eyes grow wide. He holds his head...

                                 LINUS
                        The voice... It’s you!

                                 MORGAN
                                 (smiles)
                        That’s right, darling.

           The cops move in. Jamarcus fires at Brussels, who bounces 
           away. Jamarcus chases.

           Bob fires at Morgan who leaps over the shot, landing right at 
           Bob’s feet. Knocks his gun away. Throws him down hard. Flicks 
           Linus away.

           Jamarcus BLASTS Brussels, who explodes into pieces...

                                 JAMARCUS
                        I’m not cleaning that up.

           ...but he’s too far to help Bob...Morgan lifts his leg in the 
           air, smiles for the death blow. Stomps down on Bob’s chest, 
           exploding a CHEMICAL ICE PACK in his pocket. The stuff 
           freezes Morgan’s foot, spreading up his leg. He staggers to 
           the ground, on his back. Linus sees Bob’s gun, picks it up, 
           leers over Morgan.

                                 MORGAN
                        Please, don’t! Not like this!

                                 LINUS
                        You’re right.

           Beat. Then Linus shoves Morgan onto his stomach. Cocks the 
           gun.

                        That’s better.

           BOOM!

           Bob turns to Jamarcus.

                                 BOB
                        Don’t let any of ‘em in.

           Leaving them to guard the door, Bob rushes off...

           TRAINING ROOM

           Chelsea waits for Jason, pours herself some Gatorade from a 
           barrel on the counter. Jason sidles up behind, kisses her 
           neck. Spins her, aggressive. He’s waited long enough.

                                 CHELSEA
                        Whoa, slow down.
                                 (no answer)
                        Maybe we should just stop--

           His skin gets translucent, the eyes morph.

           CONTROL CENTER

           Paul stalking Evan, who fends him off with the gun. Paul 
           SMACKS IT AWAY. Evan runs but Paul leaps to the ceiling, 
           skitters along and hops down in front of him.

           Paul HURLS EVAN UP BY THE NECK, CHOKING HIM. Evan kicks his 
           legs, helpless. Running out of air. Paul bares his teeth, 
           about to bite down on Evan’s face, when...

           SLAM! Abby, THROWS A MONITOR down on Paul’s head, 
           ELECTROCUTING HIM. As his body convulses on the floor...

                                 ABBY
                        Alright, what’s next?

           Evan smiles.

           HIVE ROOM

           Franklin hears a THUD! Skittering. Rushes out into the 
           doorway to see the SIX REMAINING COSTCO ALIENS storming down 
           the hall, descending from the AIR DUCT that Bob and Jamarcus 
           used. Franklin opens fire, SCREAMING...

                                 FRANKLIN (INTO HEADSET)
                        Evan, get back here! They’re in! 
                        They’re in!!! Hurry, Bob!

           SCHOOL HALLWAY

           Bob nears the Equipment Room when he hears a scream. Across 
           the hall in the Training Room, Chelsea is about to be 
           attacked by Jason, now transformed.

                                 BOB
                        No--

           Bob looks to the Equipment Room. His daughter.

           TRAINING ROOM

           CLOSE ON CHELSEA her eyes wide with fright.

                                 JASON
                        I’m glad you’re my first.

           As Jason reaches toward her...BOOM! A shotgun blast rings 
           out. Blowing a hole in the wall. Reveal Bob. As he struggles 
           to RELOAD, Jason races to him. Grabs the gun and bends it in 
           half. Kicks Bob across the room to the counter.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        You were always getting in the way.

           Jason marches toward Bob. Bob is pinned against the counter, 
           nowhere to run. Jason opens wide. Bob catches sight of 
           something. Just as Jason begins to bite down...

           Bob grabs the BARREL OF ICY GATORADE and--SPLOOSH!!--dumps it 
           over Jason’s head, which freezes and EXPLODES! 

           Chelsea rushes to her father...

                                 CHELSEA
                        I should’ve listened to you.

                                 BOB
                        Me too.

                                 CHELSEA
                                 (hugs him)
                        I love you, Daddy.

           Bob smiles, finally at peace.

                                 BOB
                        Get out of here. Run.

                                 CHELSEA
                        Where should I go?!

           HIVE ROOM

           Franklin struggles to hold off the aliens at the door.

                        Evan, where the hell are you?!

           Evan and Abby rush in. Abby grabs Evan’s gun. They all fire 
           at the remaining aliens, finally blowing them away. They head 
           back out into the tunnels. Franklin leads them to the vent.

           EQUIPMENT ROOM

           Bob races in, tosses aside some lockers to reveal a CONTROL 
           PANEL. He rips that open to see the giant ENERGY TUBE.

                                 BOB (INTO HEADSET)
                        I’m in! J-Marc, talk to me...

                                 JAMARCUS (ON HEADSET)
                        You gotta rip it out and jam it 
                        into the green socket!

                                 BOB (INTO HEADSET)
                        Are you sure?!

                                 JAMARCUS (ON HEADSET)
                        Pretty sure!

                                 BOB (INTO HEADSET)
                        Good. ‘Cause I’m pretty sure it’s 
                        time to blow this pop stand.
                                 (then)
                        Hey, Ev, before we do this, I gotta 
                        know. Did you listen to the CD?

           VENT

           Abby and Franklin make their way up the vent LADDER, Evan 
           about to do so...

                                 EVAN (INTO HEADSET)
                        I didn’t listen to it, Bob...I 
                        heard it.

           EQUIPMENT ROOM

           Bob cracks the tiniest hint of a smile. Yanks out the giant 
           tube. Energy spews out, threatening to incinerate him. He 
           struggles to get control. 

                                 BOB (INTO HEADSET)
                        Ready. Evan, are you out?

           VENT

           They near the top of the vent, Evan the last one up.

                                 EVAN (INTO HEADSET)
                        Do it, Bob!

           ...when he’s GRABBED FROM BEHIND by...PAUL, who’s still 
           alive! Paul tries to pull Evan back down, wounded but still 
           strong.

                                 ABBY
                        Evan!

                        Not until you’re out!

           VENT

           Paul OPENS HIS JAWS, lifting Evan toward his mouth. Abby and 
           Franklin pulling the other way. 

                                 EVAN (INTO HEADSET)
                        Bob, do it!!!

           EQUIPMENT ROOM

           Bob plunges the tube into the green outlet. The energy clogs 
           up, surging back the other direction.

           HIVE ROOM

           The energy hits The Hive, which overloads...

           VENT

           Evan...KICKS PAUL TWICE right in the face. They lock eyes...

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Get the fuck out of my neighborhood.

           Evan gives A FINAL KICK, SENDING PAUL FLYING DOWN THE VENT!

           BOOOOOOOM! The Costco explodes, flames enveloping Paul within 
           the vent. Evan and company run and take cover.

           FOOTBALL FIELD

           The crowd looks up in awe at

           THE SKIES ABOVE

           Their energy source overloaded, the SHIPS EXPLODE, like the 
           greatest fireworks display ever.

           THE BURNOUTS 

           watch...

                                 TUBER
                        Best Homecoming Rally ever.

           OUTSIDE COSTCO

           Safely covered from the falling debris, Abby looks at her 
           husband, smiles.

                                 ABBY
                        The planet is now officially saved.

                                 EVAN
                        Y’gotta start somewhere.

           EXT. TRAUTWIGS’ BACKYARD - DUSK - A WHILE LATER

           Franklin and his adorable WIFE AND KIDS sit at a table.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        --and then Daddy smashed him in the 
                        head with a Heineken--

           Bob and Bonnie walk past Chelsea and a cleaned-up TUBER, 
           their arms around one another. Bob smiles.

                                 BOB
                        I like this one.

                                 BONNIE
                        I’m really proud of you.

                                 BOB
                        Hey, Ace, your girl’s old man’s got 
                        an empty coozy here.

                                 TUBER
                        Lemme take care of that, sir.

           Tuber hops to the ICE-FILLED cooler. Reaches in. Bob watches 
           intently to make sure...

                                 BOB
                        Nah, a cold one. Really get in 
                        there.

           Linus, sans bathrobe, whispers with Jamarcus...

                                 LINUS
                        So what happened to the rest of 
                        you?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Redeployed. Turns out there were 
                        some unforeseen effects of the 
                        whole global warming thing. 
                        Hurricanes and shit. Rather than 
                        launch another attack, we decided 
                        to conquer Neptune.

                                 LINUS
                        There’s life on Neptune?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Not for long.

                                 LINUS
                        And you?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        I’m staying here to finish my 
                        research.
                                 (calling out)
                        Yo Doog!

           Jamarcus squirts Bob in the mouth with a Jaeger shot from a 
           supersoaker. 

           Bob saunters over to EVAN who wears SHORTS--a big step. He 
           slides a spatula under a piece of salmon on cedar planks--a 
           grilling expert.

                                 EVAN
                        Salmon, Bobber?

                                 BOB
                        Not bad, buddy. But you’d look 
                        better in one of these...

           Bob hands over a BLACK APRON with the PRADA logo across the 
           chest. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        It’s a genuine Prada reproduction.

           Evan smiles, puts it on.
                       Neighborhood Watch  -  Jared Stern  -  August 7, 2009    119.

           ABBY stands nearby, unable to hide a grin. Evan sees, pads 
           over.

                                 EVAN
                        What?

                                 ABBY
                        Nothing.

                                 EVAN
                        I know you. You’re glowing.
                                 (perhaps still nervous)
                        Did you pee on something plastic?

                                 ABBY
                        Four of ‘em.

                                 EVAN
                        And?

                                 ABBY
                        Pink, right arrow, plus and a 
                        creepy picture of a baby.

           Beat, then Evan sweeps her into his arms, kisses her sweetly.

           Bob tosses a FRISBEE. Marv (back as a Boston Terrier) jumps 
           fifteen feet in the air and snatches it. 

           We continue past him up into the sky, just starting to 
           twinkle with stars.

                                               THE END
