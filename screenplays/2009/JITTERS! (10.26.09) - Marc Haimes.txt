           OVER LOGOS:  

           CHIRPING.  BUZZING.  CLICKING.  HISSING.  

           A creepy cacophony of insect sounds.  Some are familiar.  But 
           others... not so much.  The sounds continue as we -- 

           FADE IN:

           EXT. HIGH HILL -- NIGHT

           A cheery SIGN reads:  “HONEY-FRESH FAMILY FARMS! FOOD CORP.”  
           But behind the sign sprawls an ominous INDUSTRIAL FACILITY.   

           INT. CORRIDOR -- INDUSTRIAL FACILITY -- NIGHT

           Those insect sounds are LOUDER now as THREE MEN walk though a 
           corridor.  Two are EXECUTIVES in SUITS.  

           They lead a MILITARY OFFICER with mid-level medals.   

                                 BLUE SUITED EXEC
                        ... Until last year, the regulatory 
                        standards were actually quite fair. 

                                 TAN SUITED EXEC
                        Two percent trace pesticide 
                        residue.   

                                 BLUE SUIT
                        Right.  See, as long as you were 
                        under that two percent you could 
                        still label your food items as one-
                        hundred percent pesticide free.  

                                 TAN SUIT
                        That’s what gives you access to 
                        health food stores.  Higher price 
                        points.  It’s a profit multiplier.   

           At the end of the corridor, they approach a glassed-off LAB 
           AREA.  The suits begin a rigorous process, UNLOCKING the 
           THICK STEEL DOORS leading into the laboratory.  

                                 BLUE SUIT
                        But then the Democrats came in, 
                        lowered it down to one percent.  
                        That’s when we starting having 
                        problems with that bug.   

                                 TAN SUIT
                        The red-horned locust.  
                                 BLUE SUIT
                        Right.  The red-horned locust.  

                                 TAN SUIT
                        With climate change, their 
                        population has been surging out of 
                        control for the past few years.  

                                 BLUE SUIT
                        Now these suckers are big.  Real 
                        big.  And they just love grain.  

                                 TAN SUIT
                        Conventional attempts to control 
                        them with chemicals took us well 
                        over the new cut-off restrictions.  

                                 BLUE SUIT
                        So we did something unconventional.  

           With that, he OPENS the steel laboratory doors.  The bizarre 
           INSECT SOUNDS are now almost OVERPOWERING.  

                                 TAN SUIT
                             (stopping the officer)
                        Um.  You haven’t had any unusually 
                        high amounts of refined sugar in 
                        the past couple hours, have you?  

                                 MILIARY OFFICER
                        I’m sorry?  

                                 TAN SUIT
                        Frosted flakes?  Gummy bears?  No?  
                        Good.  A few of ‘em can smell that 
                        stuff in your pores.  It makes ‘em 
                        a bit... well... jittery.  

           The military officer takes a moment to ponder these words 
           before following the suits into --  

           INT. LABORATORY -- INDUSTRIAL FACILITY -- CONTINUOUS

           The group walks past dozens of CAGES stacked next to thick- 
           glassed TERRARIUMS.  We catch the occasional SKITTER of feet 
           and FLUTTER of wings, but don’t yet get a good look.  

                                 BLUE SUIT
                        The real breakthrough came from our 
                        bioengineering division.  They 
                        found the simple, genetic solution 
                        to the problem... 
           As he talks, we see that many of the terrariums are LABELED 
           with increasingly odd-sounding names.  Among them: “HUNTER 
           CRICKETS,” “LONG-TOOTH SNAILS,” ”ROID ROACH.”     

           All the occupants seem to be staying HIDDEN and out of sight.  

                                 TAN SUIT
                        They were looking to develop a 
                        smaller, less aggressive locust to 
                        breed into the red horn population.  
                        One that would consume less grain.  

           The three men approach a large CAGE.  We HOLD on this cage 
           for a moment as they walk past it.  And then, suddenly -- 

           A TONGUE-LIKE APPENDAGE SHOOTS OUT FROM A SLIT IN THE BARS! 

           It UNFURLS toward the backs of the men as they walk away.  
           However, it FALLS SHORT of reaching them, RETRACTING back 
           into the cage as they obliviously continue talking... 

                                 BLUE SUIT
                        But the technology they developed 
                        for the project gave us much more.  

                                 TAN SUIT
                        It was ground-breaking because it 
                        was actually so simple.  

           Tan Suit steps over to a MACHINE.  As he switches it on, it 
           BEAMS HOLOGRAPHIC PATTERNS and INSECT SCHEMATICS.  

                                 TAN SUIT (CONT’D)
                        Basically, they figured out a way 
                        to holographically isolate genetic 
                        designations in real time.  Mixing 
                        and matching insect traits and 
                        behaviors suddenly became as easy 
                        as a point and click interface.  

                                 BLUE SUIT
                        Like Legos.  But with webs and 
                        wings and stingers.   

                                 TAN SUIT
                        Once they isolated the genes, they 
                        found they could also massage them.  
                        Improve them.  Suddenly, we’ve got 
                        roaches breezing through mazes the 
                        smartest rats could never do.

                                 BLUE SUIT
                        We’ve got dung beetles showing 
                        traits like loyalty and affection.      
                                 TAN SUIT
                        We’ve got ladybugs slicing through 
                        human...  

                                 BLUE SUIT
                             (cutting him off)
                        The ladybug was when we called you.  

           With renewed curiosity, the officer PEERS into the nearby 
           terrarium labeled: “DRAGONTULA.”  

           But it too seems EMPTY.  Just a layer of SAND and a plastic 
           WATER TUBE. 

                                 MILITARY OFFICER
                        Sounds promising.  For such amazing 
                        creatures, they’re awfully shy.  

           SUDDENLY A LARGE, HIDEOUS INSECT POPS UP OUT OF THE SAND!  

           Best described as half tarantula, half dragon fly, it SHRIEKS 
           WILDLY at the officer, SPREADING its VAST, GLOWING WINGS!  

                                 TAN SUIT
                        That’s a newer one.  He’s a 
                        little... grumpy.   

           The big bug continues to shriek and SPIT WEBBING. 

           One of the web strands HITS the water tube, MELTING it 
           instantly into a puddle of GOO.  The military officer watches 
           this, clearly impressed.  

                                 BLUE SUIT
                        You might want to cover your 
                        medals.  Their glint seems to be... 
                        annoying him slightly.  

           As if to echo this sentiment, that vicious “Dragontula” now 
           HURLS HIMSELF repeatedly against the glass, trying 
           frantically to get to the officer.  

                                 MILIARY OFFICER
                        They’re all like this?  Aggressive?   

                                 BLUE SUIT
                        Many of the more recent ones have 
                        been rather... strong-willed.   

           As the suits attempt to quiet the enraged Dragontula, the 
           officer puts his medals away into his pocket.   Oddly, when 
           he looks down he spots --

           A small HOLE in his uniform, exposing a patch of his chest!  
           Another HOLE provides a nice view of his BELLY BUTTON!  And 
           still more HOLES on his pants.  That’s really strange.  

           When he pats himself down, several KHAKI MOTHS go FLUTTERING 
           off of his clothes, CHANGING COLOR as they rise into the air!  

           He looks over to see: the two suits STARING AT HIM IN HORROR!  

                                 BLUE SUIT (CONT’D)
                        It’s the Camo-moths!  They’ve 
                        gotten out!    

           They immediately RACE over to the steel doors, yelling 
           instructions.  But for some reason, the doors won’t open.   

                                 MILITARY OFFICER
                        What’s wrong?  They’re just moths.  

           He watches mesmerized as CAMOUFLAGED moths all around the lab 
           REVEAL themselves, fluttering up, SHIMMERING magnificently.  

           One lands on his arm (turning khaki again).  It seems 
           innocent enough.  But as he reaches to touch it -- 

           IT ATTACKS!  SNAPPING AT HIM WITH HUGE, SHARP TEETH!!!  

           Eyes going wide, the officer SPRINTS to join the two men who 
           are PANICKING as they wrestle with the doors.  

                                 TAN SUIT
                        SOMEBODY TRIGGERED THE KILL SWITCH.  
                        WE’RE LOCKED IN!  TRY THE OVERRIDE!    

                                 BLUE SUIT
                        TOO LATE!  THEY’RE IN FORMATION.  

           They turn to see the moths assembled into A COLORFUL SWARM!!!  
           THEY SWOOP IN TOWARDS THE MEN, GNASHING THEIR JAWS!  

           Before we can lose our PG-13, we move outside the lab where:   

           A small, seemingly ordinary LADYBUG...

           Sits on the edge of the lab window.  It’s almost like she’s 
           observing the carnage through the glass.  As she watches, she 
           makes a tiny insect SOUND.  Not one we’ve heard yet.  

           It’s almost like a GIGGLE.  

                                                              SMASH TO:

           BLACK.  
           TITLE CARD UP:  JITTERS!

           The letters TREMBLE and QUAKE and finally FADE from view.  
           With shaky TITLES ROLLING, we abruptly CUT TO -- 

           AN ORDINARY ANT

           Tiny.  Harmless.  Then, a shadow LOOMS.  The ant scurries 
           away as a shoe steps into frame.  We are -- 

           EXT. LAWN -- SUBURBAN HOUSE -- DAY

           The shoe belongs to WALT HATCHER, 39.  He stands on the green 
           lawn, looking up at a lovely HOME with a white fence and an 
           elaborate TREE HOUSE in the front yard.  We now REVEAL --     

           Walt is standing next to a large FORECLOSURE SIGN.  

           After a moment, he is joined by his wife, ELIZABETH HATCHER, 
           35.  Sweet, attractive, and almost always upbeat.  Even now.  

                                 LIZ
                        Walt?  The car is packed and ready 
                        to go.  Everyone’s waiting.   

                                 WALT
                        I could have fought harder, Liz.  

                                 LIZ
                        Who would you fight?  These things 
                        happen.  We make the best of it.        

                                 WALT
                        I could have spent less time 
                        working and more time showing them 
                        I was working.  More time fighting.           

                                 LIZ
                        Sweetheart, that’s not who you are.  
                        You should feel proud.      

                                 WALT
                        Proud of losing my job?  My house?      

                                 LIZ
                        Proud of your wonderful family who 
                        believes in you.  Who knows that no 
                        matter what happens, no matter 
                        where we live... we are going to be 
                        just fine.          

           But for some reason, this nice sentiment doesn’t even begin 
           to cheer Walt up.  We see why as we go to --  
           INT. HATCHER FAMILY MINIVAN -- HIGHWAY -- DAY

           As the car motors down the highway, Walt’s three CHILDREN sit 
           in back.  They don’t make for the most impressive tableau:  

           KENNY, 3, sits in a car seat, thoughtfully picking his nose.  
           KATE, 13, SNIFFS under her armpits... then stares daggers at 
           JACKSON, 15, who’s making faces and smirking back at her.  

                                 KATE
                        Mom! Jackson’s making body odor 
                        accusations again!  

                                 JACKSON
                        I’m not accusing.  I’m suggesting, 
                        maybe her deodorant isn’t quite... 
                        living up to others’ expectations.    

                                 KATE
                        Unlike the chemical crap you use, 
                        my deodorant is all-natural.  It’s 
                        better for the environment.  

                                 JACKSON
                             (re: the car)
                        ... Not this environment.      

           Liz sits in front next to Walt who’s driving in silence.  She 
           puts down her paperback and turns around.  

                                 LIZ
                        Jackson, please be a gentleman.  
                        Kate, you smell fine. 
                             (sees Kenny)
                        Kenny, honey, stop picking your 
                        nose and giving it to the dog.      

                                 KENNY
                        Shiny!  

           He happily takes his finger out of his nose and points to the 
           the shiny ID tag hanging from the collar belonging to --     

           PHELPS, the family dog.  A gentle giant.  Phelps takes this 
           opportunity to poke his head up from the floor, delicately 
           LICKING Kenny’s nose-picking finger.  

           Meanwhile, a MOSQUITO flies in through the window and BUZZES 
           around Walt’s face.  He swats at it without success.  

                                 WALT
                        Can somebody do something about 
                        that bug?  It’s distracting me 
                        while I drive.  
           Liz eyes the bug warily.  It’s clear she’s not an insect fan.  

                                 LIZ
                        He’s sorta big.  Kids, little help?  

                                 KATE
                        We don’t have to kill the poor 
                        thing.  Just open all the windows.  

                                 JACKSON
                        No.  We must kill him.  It’s the 
                        only way he’ll learn.  

                                 WALT
                        Just get rid of it.  Please.   

           Walt turns back to the road, but the car has now gotten very 
           CHAOTIC.  Kate and Liz try to roll down the windows while 
           Jackson takes thunderous SWINGS at the bug with a magazine.  

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        Guys?  Guys!  It’s one bug!  This 
                        shouldn’t be that difficult for us. 

                                 LIZ
                        Jackson, honey.  Right behind you 
                        is a box labeled “kitchen cabinet.”  
                        The fly swatter is right on top.  

                                 KATE
                        No, it’s not.  I threw it out 
                        when I was taping up the boxes.  
                        It’s an instrument of death.  And 
                        that’s bad karma.  

                                 JACKSON
                        She can’t do that!  You should be 
                        punished severely, young lady.  

                                 KATE
                        Punishment won’t bring it back, 
                        Jackson.   It’s still gone.  Along 
                        with Dad’s leather belt and your 
                        little notebook filled with nudie 
                        website passwords.  

                                 JACKSON
                             (glowering at Kate)
                        You know what?  Don’t move, sis!  
                        That bug is right on your...  

           He uses his rolled up magazine to repeatedly SMACK Kate in 
           the head.  She YELLS and fights back as that annoying 
           mosquito continues buzzing around poor Walt’s neck...  
           EXT. MINIVAN -- GAS STATION -- DAY

           CLOSE ON:  A big MOSQUITO BITE on Walt’s neck.   

           Walt is pumping gas as he watches his bickering family walk 
           across the parking lot towards the CONVENIENCE STORE.  

           He pumps gas with one hand.  Scratches that bite on his neck 
           with the other.  A portrait of MISERY.  But then he notices:  

           That mosquito has landed on the car within striking range.    

                                 WALT
                        ... Payback is a bitch, pal.    

           Walt raises his hand and SWINGS it down to CRUSH the bug.  
           But the mosquito FLIES AWAY in the nick of time.  Walt ends 
           up SMACKING the gas pump right out of the nozzle, hurting his 
           HAND.  The nozzle then lands heavily on his FOOT.  

           Walt hops around in pain, still scratching that mosquito bite 
           with his one good hand as gas SPILLS OUT all over the ground.  

           INT. CONVENIENCE STORE -- GAS STATION -- DAY

           Liz holds Kenny while she browses through the little store.  
           Noticing a display of mediocre FLOWER BOUQUETS wrapped in 
           plastic, Liz puts Kenny down and kneels to inspect them.   

                                 LIZ
                        Kenny, aren’t these pretty flowers?  
                        We should get some for our brand 
                        new house.  Can you say, new house?  

           Kenny just STARES at her blankly.  

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Can you say, flower?  

                                 KENNY
                        ... Shiny?  

           Never losing patience, Liz gives Kenny a pat and goes back to 
           inspecting the flowers.  

           Kenny walks a few feet away from her, spotting a TALL OLDER 
           WOMAN.. or more specifically her glinting silver earings.   

                                 KENNY (CONT’D)
                        Shiny!  

           Keeping his eyes on the shiny earrings, he stealthily makes 
           his way toward the tall woman...
           ANOTHER PART OF THE STORE

           Jackson lingers by the magazine aisle.  He looks up and spots 
           a BUSTY YOUNG WOMAN, 20’s, in a thin, WHITE tank top. 

                                 JACKSON
                             (under his breath)
                        Please, please be going to the 
                        freezer section.

           He falls into step behind the woman while pulling out his 
           cell phone and readying the VIDEO CAMERA option. 

           He brightens as she opens a freezer door.  Much to his 
           delight, she leans way in to sift through the frozen foods.   

           Finally, she grabs a microwave pasta and turns from the 
           freezer to find --  

           Jackson.  Standing uncomfortably close.  

           He’s pretending to talk on his cell phone but it’s clearly 
           aimed directly at her TANK TOP.  

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                             (”on his phone”)
                        Look here, Anita.  I told you it 
                        was a one night thing.  Even if it 
                        was the greatest night of your 
                        life.  No.  I’m not taking your 
                        money.  You’re just going to have 
                        to learn to... Anita... hello?  I’m 
                        losing my signal... hello?  

           In a conspicuous effort to “get a signal,” he positions and 
           repositions the phone, smiling casually at the busty woman as 
           he ZOOMS IN on her chest.  

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        I really need to switch my carrier.  

           The woman looks at Jackson suspiciously as she pushes by him.  

           Jackson adjusts the phone to capture the rear view as she 
           walks away...    

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                             (quietly into cellphone)
                        Say hi to all your YouTube fans!  

           Jackson watches with a smile until he sees she has gone over 
           to talk to her BIG BOYFRIEND and is POINTING directly at him!  

           He quickly pockets the phone and tries to slip away...   
           EXT. BATHROOM -- SIDE OF THE GAS STATION -- DAY

           Kate exits the side bathroom, heading back to the car.  But 
           then she notices -- 

           A group of tough-looking TEENAGE BOYS.  They’re standing over 
           something, looking down and laughing.  As Kate moves closer, 
           she sees they’ve caught a little garden TURTLE.  

           They’ve got it trapped, shell-side down, and are getting 
           their jollies SPINNING it around on its back like a top.  

                                 TEEN BOY
                             (laughing)
                        I think he’s getting dizzy!  

           Kate takes a deep breath and marches right over to the teens. 
           Snatches up the turtle.   

                                 KATE
                        You lovely boys found my missing 
                        turtle!  I really appreciate it.  
                        Thank you ever so much. Bye now.    

           The boys aren’t buying it.  As Kate turns to leave, one of 
           them moves to block her path.   

                                 TOUGH TEEN
                        If that’s your turtle, what’s his 
                        name?  

                                 KATE
                        Her name.  Her name is Shelly.  

                                 TOUGH TEEN
                             (moving closer)
                        Well that’s a pretty lame name.  

                                 KATE
                        Maybe so.  But the un-lame, dare I 
                        say “majestic” thing about Shelly 
                        and all turtles really is their 
                        unique ability to retract their 
                        vulnerable appendages.  We as human 
                        beings lack that particular 
                        evolutionary defense mechanism 
                        which is a real shame for us and, 
                        more specifically, for you.  

                                 TOUGH TEEN
                        Oh yeah?  Why’s that?  

           Kate KICKS him in the balls as hard as she can and 
           immediately takes off running towards the car...  
           EXT. MINIVAN -- GAS STATION -- DAY

           Walt has just finished pumping gas.  He looks up to see Kate, 
           SPRINTING towards the car.  She’s not the only one.  A beat 
           later, Jackson comes flying out of the store.  

                                 KATE/ JACKSON
                        Dad...! / Dad...!  

           And now Liz comes hurrying out of the store, looking 
           nervously over her shoulder.  She’s got flowers in one arm, 
           Kenny in the other.  He’s giggling and holding a SILVER 
           EARRING!  He’s very pleased with himself.  

                                 LIZ
                        Honey...!  Start the car!  

           Walt drops the gas pump and rushes to start the car.   

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL FACILITY -- DAY

           That same building from the opening scene.  It sits on that 
           high hill with the “HONEY-FRESH FAMILY FARMS” sign out front.  

           INT. HATCHER MINIVAN -- PASSING HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- DAY

           Walt speeds obliviously past the facility as Kate & Jackson 
           are in the midst of yet another argument...   

                                 JACKSON
                        ... Why do you want to keep a 
                        turtle?  We have a dog.    

                                 KATE
                        I don’t prioritize pets based on 
                        cuteness and fur.  Shelly found me 
                        for a reason.  As an enlightened 
                        person, I recognize that.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Just be careful Phelps doesn’t try 
                        to eat her.  

                                 KATE
                        Phelps won’t eat anything that 
                        hasn’t come directly out of Kenny’s 
                        nose.  

           Phelps whimpers a bit as Walt pulls off the main road into a 
           pretty horrid and run-down INDUSTRIAL AREA.  
                                 WALT
                        Okay, everybody.  This is it.  The 
                        lovely district of Stillwater.  Our 
                        new home for the next little while.   

                                 LIZ
                        It’s got a certain character to it.  
                        Right kids?  

           As they wait at a traffic light, they see some scary-looking 
           GANG TYPES walking past a telephone pole stapled with dozens 
           of FLIERS.  Every flier reports a LOST or MISSING family pet.  

           Suddenly, a BANG on the windshield makes the family jump!  

           It’s a HOMELESS MAN who is staring at the Hatcher vehicle 
           with an INTENSE LOOK as he POUNDS on the glass.     

                                 JACKSON
                        ... I think that certain character 
                        is about to ask us for money.  

                                 WALT
                        Great.  Liz, do you have any pocket 
                        change we can give him? 

                                 KATE
                        We can’t give him pocket change.  
                        That’s humiliating for him.  Give 
                        him at least five dollars.  

                                 JACKSON
                        If we had five dollars we wouldn’t 
                        be moving here in the first place.  

                                 LIZ
                        Maybe he just wants food.  I have 
                        some Luna Bars in my purse.   

           But the homeless man isn’t asking for money or food.  Oddly, 
           he seems to be INSPECTING their windshield.  He peels off a 
           CRUSHED BUG and stares at it closely.  Scrutinizing it.    

           The Hatchers watch in uneasy silence as the man finally drops 
           the bug, peels off another one and EXAMINES that one too.     

           Finally satisfied, he steps back from the car and motions 
           that the Hatchers can now continue on their way.  

                                 WALT
                        ... Okay.  Thanks a lot then.  

           Walt waves nervously to the man.  Then, shrugging to Liz, he 
           puts his foot on the gas and gets the hell out of there.  
           EXT. NEW HATCHER HOUSE -- LOUSY NEIGHBORHOOD -- DAY

           The Hatcher minivan drives through more of this gloomy, run-
           down neighborhood.  Foreclosure signs mark many of the lawns.  
           A lot of the homes simply look abandoned.

           The minivan pulls into the driveway of a tiny, crappy house.  

           INT. NEW HATCHER HOUSE -- DAY

           All peeling walls and faded carpet.  And, right there on the 
           floor is a  --    

           LEECH-TYPE INSECT!  Bone white and gelatinous.  

           We’ve never seen anything like this!  It slithers across the 
           floor with awful SUCKIE-SLURPIE sounds.  

           Suddenly, it stops.  ANTENNAE spring up from his “head” like 
           ears hearing something.  Then, it hurriedly suckie-slurps 
           towards a CRACK in the wall and VANISHES inside just as --  

           The front door OPENS... The Hatchers pile into the hallway of 
           their new home.  

                                 WALT
                        This is it.  Welcome.  

           Jackson and Kate look at each other.  For the first time 
           since we’ve met them, they’re at a bit of a loss.  

                                 KATE
                        This is it?  Wow.  We are really... 
                        poor.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Yeah.  No offense, Dad, but I’ve 
                        had underpants mistakes nicer than 
                        this place.  

                                 KATE
                        And bigger.  

                                 JACKSON
                        No offense.  

                                 WALT
                        Oh, no offense taken.  Don’t be 
                        silly, Jackson.  Why on earth would 
                        I find my son’s comment comparing 
                        our new home to a shit stain 
                        offensive in any way?  
                                 LIZ
                             (a warning to Walt)
                        Honey...

           The kids inspect the place, opening doors and peering into 
           rooms.  What little there is to see is not at all impressive.  

           As Kate steps into a hallway and turns on a LIGHT, something 
           BLACK and HAIRY skitters past her into a crack in the floor!  

                                 KATE 
                        I think I just saw a bug!  It might 
                        have been a cockroach.    

                                 LIZ (O.S.)
                        Really?  Walt?  Kate saw a roach!  

                                 KATE
                             (rejoining the family)
                        I don’t know where it went.  I 
                        didn’t get a good look.  It was big 
                        though.  It kind of scared me.    

                                 WALT
                        Don’t be dramatic, Kate. 
                             (to Liz)
                        Honey, if we see any more, I’ll go 
                        to the store and buy some traps.  

                                 KATE
                        We don’t need to hurt them.  Just 
                        catch them and let them loose 
                        outside.  Like a relocation.  Like 
                        what our family is doing.  

           Opening a door to investigate another room, Jackson calls 
           back over his shoulder to Kate...  

                                 JACKSON
                        They might even leave on their own 
                        once they get a whiff of you.   

                                 WALT
                        Jackson!  That’s not your room.  
                        You’re in here.  With Kenny.        

                                 KATE
                             (re: rooms)
                        Dad?  If you guys are in there.  
                        And he’s in there.  Where am I? 

           Walt steers her to a tiny, claustrophobic room.  Like a 
           converted pantry.  He extends his hands with a flourish.    
                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        You’re kidding, right?  This is a 
                        closet.  This is a smallish closet.   

           Still freaked by the prospect of roaches, Liz inspects the 
           walls.  Finally satisfied, she turns to the family...  

                                 LIZ
                        You know something?  This place 
                        isn’t that bad.  There’s actually a 
                        nice... coziness to it.  We’ll 
                        certainly get to see a lot more of 
                        each other.
                             (beat)
                        You heard it from me first, this 
                        place is going to do great things 
                        for the Hatcher family.  

           In response to this comment, Kate rolls her eyes while 
           Jackson makes a big show of trying not to throw up.    

                                 WALT
                        Okay, that’s enough.  You kids are 
                        old enough to know that the money 
                        situation is touch and go right 
                        now.  Yes, this place is not ideal.  
                        But it’s close enough to the city 
                        so I can look for work every day.  
                        And the rental fee is a fraction of 
                        what our old mortgage was.  So at 
                        least we can get by on savings for 
                        a while without constantly feeling 
                        so... anxious and on edge.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Anxious and on edge.  Right.  
                             (squinting; innocent)
                        Mom, what’s that behind you?  Is 
                        that one of the roaches Kate saw?    

           Horrified, Liz FLINCHES and JUMPS in the air with a little 
           yell, turning to face whatever Jackson is pointing at.  

           But NOTHING is there.  He was clearly messing with her.  

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        No?  Must have been my crazy 
                        imagination.  Sorry about that.    

                                 WALT
                        Good one, Jackson.  Now you and 
                        your sister can unload the car by 
                        yourselves.  Honey, I’ll bike into 
                        town and pick up traps right now.  
                                 LIZ
                        ... And some Raid.  Lots of Raid.  

                                 KATE
                        And fresh greens.  For Shelly.  

                                 JACKSON
                        And also maybe, like, a different 
                        house?  

                                 WALT
                        Just unpack the car, Jackson.    

           The weight of the world on his shoulders, Walt turns and 
           heads out the front door.  

           EXT. MINIVAN -- HATCHER HOUSE -- DAY

           STRANGE LOW ANGLE:  On Walt, unchaining his bicycle from the 
           roof of the minivan.

           As if something very small is OBSERVING HIM from the ground.  

           EXT. STREETS OF STILLWATER -- DAY

           Passing a store window with more LOST PET fliers, Walt BIKES 
           through downtown Stillwater.  

           There’s that mysterious homeless man again.  He’s kneeling by 
           another dumpster.  His ear is pressed right up against it, as 
           if he’s “listening” to the garbage inside.  He clutches a big 
           can of BUG SPRAY as if it were a weapon.  

           Walt switches gears and pedals faster.

           INT. “KITCHEN SINK” HARDWARE STORE -- DAY

           A shabby, cluttered Mom & Pop store.  The name “Kitchen Sink” 
           seems appropriate as they really do seem to have everything.  

           Walt strolls through aisles, locating a shelf marked: “PEST 
           TRAPS & INSECTICIDES.”  His eyes narrow in confusion...  

           This is the one shelf that is COMPLETELY EMPTY.  Every last 
           trap, spray, and zapper has already been purchased.  

           As Walt looks around for some assistance, a strange, creepy 
           MOANING SOUND emanates from the back of the store.   

           The sound grows LOUDER and more intense as Walt hesitantly 
           walks towards it, pushing through rear doors and into --  
           INT. LOADING AREA -- HARDWARE STORE -- CONTINUOUS

           An OVERWEIGHT MAN struggles to lift a heavy bag of FERTILIZER 
           into a red pick-up truck, groaning horribly as he strains.    

           Walt rushes over to help him...  

                                 WALT
                        Hey there!  Let me give you a hand.  

           Walt grabs the other side of the bag and the two men wrestle 
           it into the back of the truck next to stacks of other bags.  

           The overweight man takes a minute to recover, panting and 
           wiping away sweat.  Finally, he gives Walt a jovial smile.  

                                 OVERWEIGHT MAN
                        You just saved this fat man’s life.  
                        My heart was about ready to... tear 
                        me a new asshole.    

                                 WALT
                        Yeah, I hate it when that happens.  
                        This is your store?  

                                 OVERWEIGHT MAN
                        Yes, sir.  Name’s Buff.  Well, 
                        actually that’s my nickname... on 
                        account that I like the buffets.  
                        And also because of an unfortunate 
                        photograph of me that my ex-wife 
                        circulated on the internet.  

                                 WALT
                        I’m Walt.  I just moved here with 
                        my family.  I was looking to buy 
                        some bug traps.  Maybe some spray. 
                        You didn’t seem to have any left.   

                                 BUFF
                        I’m sold out again?  Well, I’ll be 
                        damned, jammed, and body-slammed.
                             (pointing)
                        The only thing I got back here are 
                        professional-grade fumigation 
                        tanks... but that’s only for a full 
                        infestation.  I’ll probably have 
                        what you need coming in tomorrow.  

                                 WALT
                        Okay.  I guess one night without 
                        bug spray won’t kill me. 
                                 BUFF
                        You can always suck it up and use a 
                        shoe.  Or a slipper.  In a pinch, 
                        even an open palm does the trick.  
                             (mimes crushing a bug)
                        Wham!  Got him!  Wham!  Just to 
                        make sure he’s really dead.  Wham! 
                        Probably unnecessary but still 
                        cathartic none the less.    

                                 WALT
                        I’ll see you tomorrow then.  Nice 
                        meeting you, Buff.  
                             (as he turns to go)
                        By the way, nice butterflies.  

           We now see what Walt is pointing at.  Not actual butterflies 
           but a large inventory RACK of assorted construction HINGES.   

                                 BUFF
                        Only the finest selection in the 
                        state.  You a home improvement guy?    

                                 WALT
                        About ten years ago I had my own 
                        installation business.  Built all 
                        sorts of things in my spare time.  
                        But then I gave that up for a nice 
                        secure office job which... just 
                        recently laid me off.   

                                 BUFF
                        That doesn’t sound too secure.  

                                 WALT
                        The firings weren’t even the worst 
                        part.  It was the way they handled 
                        the whole thing.  Not telling us 
                        until the last possible second.    

                                 BUFF
                        Me, I’ll take delivering fertilizer 
                        any day.  At least the crap I gotta 
                        deal with is in a sealed bag.  

                                 WALT
                        ... And it’s clearly labeled.  

                                 BUFF
                        Know something, Walt?  Sounds to me 
                        like squashing a few bugs tonight 
                        might do you some good.  ...Wham!  

           Walt smiles.  Makes the same bug-crushing gesture.  Wham.   
           INT. LIVING ROOM -- HATCHER HOUSE -- NIGHT

           A MESS of moving boxes and suitcases scatter the floor of the 
           dark living room.   

           In other words, perfect cover for anything that creeps, 
           slithers, or crawls.  

           Fast moving SHAPES skitter along the floor, casting distorted 
           SHADOWS.  But we don’t yet see anything clearly.  

           INT. KENNY & JACKSON’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Kenny is asleep in bed with a big SMILE.  He cuddles with an 
           ELMO-STYLE DOLL that quietly sings a pre-recorded LULLABY.     

           Jackson, dressed in pajamas, is looking for the best hiding 
           place for a STACK of lingerie catalogs.  

           Opening his closet, he notices a LOOSE BOARD in the floor.  

           He grabs the board and SLOWLY YANKS IT UP TO REVEAL...     

           Nothing much.  Just a nice, little hollowed-out HIDING SPACE.   
           It’s a perfect cubby to store those magazines.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Maybe this place isn’t all bad.  

           INT. KATE’S CRAMPED BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Kate sits on the floor next to a pile of lettuce leaves.  She 
           feeds Shelly The Turtle as Phelps snoozes by her side.  

           LOW POV:  It WATCHES Kate feeding the little turtle.  And 
           then it TURNS to check out that pile of lettuce.  

                                 KATE
                        You are one of the hungriest little 
                        turtles I have ever met. 

           Without looking, she reaches to grab another lettuce leaf.  
           Her hand feels around but doesn’t find anything.  

           Finally, she looks over.  That pile of greens is all GONE.  

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Phelps?  Did you eat Shelly’s 
                        dinner?  Bad boy!  

           Phelps opens his eyes and WHIMPERS a bit.  He seems pretty 
           innocent to us.  But he’s stuck taking the blame for now.   
           INT. WALT AND LIZ’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Walt sits in bed, typing on an old LAPTOP COMPUTER.  He’s 
           browsing some JOB SEARCH site like “monster.com.”    

           Liz is in her fluffy white bathrobe, pulling BATH SUPPLIES 
           out of one of the moving boxes.  

                                 LIZ
                        Honey, have you seen my bath salts?  

                                 WALT
                             (not looking up)
                        No.  

                                 LIZ
                        They’re in this yellow bag with 
                        blue writing. It says, “Stress-Less 
                        Lavender with like a picture of...  
                             (sees Walt not listening)
                        ... a man who no longer pays 
                        attention to his wife.  First, 
                        because he’s busy working.  Then, 
                        because he’s always worrying.   

                                 WALT
                        ... Nope.  Haven’t seen ‘em.  

           Liz stares at Walt.  Then decides to try a different tact. 

           She adjusts her robe to show a little more skin.  Then steps 
           over to Walt.  Touches his shoulder suggestively.  

                                 LIZ
                        Whatcha doing?  

                                 WALT
                             (still not looking up)
                        ... You know what I’m doing.  

                                 LIZ
                        How’s it coming?  

                                 WALT
                        All that time working for one 
                        place?  I actually think it’s a 
                        negative.  Companies look at me 
                        like I’m a dinosaur.  Like I won’t 
                        have any energy or initiative.  

                                 LIZ
                             (not subtle)
                        I know something you could 
                        initiate.  
                                 WALT
                        ... They’d rather hire some kid 
                        fresh out of school.  

                                 LIZ
                        Remember when we were fresh out of 
                        school?    

                                 WALT
                        ... They have no clue what’s really 
                        important.  

                                 LIZ
                             (giving up)
                        No.  They really don’t.   

           She grabs her bath supplies and heads into the bathroom.  
           Walt doesn’t even realize she’s gone.  

                                 WALT
                        ... So I’m not twenty-years old.  I 
                        don’t do a big song and dance.  But 
                        I’m a good worker.  I get the job 
                        done.  Right?  

           And now he looks up to see he’s talking to an empty room.  

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        Liz?  

           But the water is already running in the bath room.  

           Sighing, Walter powers down the computer.  He watches as it 
           exits the web, returning to the DESKTOP screen, which is:     

           AN OLD PHOTO of Walt with Jackson and Kate.      

           Everybody is much younger.  We recognize the white home in 
           the background as the one they recently had to leave.

           And this is Walt like we’ve never seen him.  He’s actually 
           got a TOOL BELT on.  

           Looks like he’s building his kids that elaborate TREE HOUSE 
           we saw earlier.  Everyone is happy and smiling.  

           And then, the computer finishes powering down.  The happy 
           picture suddenly snaps off.  

           The screen goes to BLACK.

           Walt stares at the black screen, lost in thought.  
           EXT. ENTRY DOORS -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS FACILITY -- NIGHT

           The CHIRPING of crickets is interrupted by a red pick-up 
           truck pulling up the hill and PARKING by the front entrance.  

           Our friend Buff (from the hardware store) exits the truck.  
           Buff hits a button on his car keys.  The truck LOCKS with a 
           quick FLASH of its lights and CHIRP of its alarm.    

           Buff walks up to the entrance, only to discover the doors are 
           BOLTED.  The place looks completely DESERTED.  

                                 BUFF
                             (pounding on the doors)
                        Hello?  Anybody here?  Hello?!? 

           No response.  It really doesn’t seem like anybody is here.      

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                             (re: work order)
                        Your email said that somebody would 
                        be here to accept a night time 
                        delivery!  HELLO?!?

           But now Buff notices a crudely written NOTE taped to the 
           door:  “FERTILIZER DELIVERY AROUND BACK.” 

           Buff squints at the horrible handwriting...

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                        You folks need to work on your 
                        penmanship.  

           EXT. BACK ENTRANCE -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           Now on the other side of the building, Buff brings the truck 
           to a stop next to a set of REAR DOORS.   

           But these are also bolted and chained.  Buff walks over and 
           POUNDS on the doors, starting to lose his patience.  

                                 BUFF
                        Is anybody there?  I got a whole 
                        truck full of stinkin’ fertilizer!  

           Buff finally stops knocking and LISTENS for any response.  

           But there’s nothing.  Just the gusting of wind, the wailing 
           of far away sirens.  And the CHIRPING of crickets.  

           Hearing a loud CHIRP at his feet, he glances down, spotting:  

           A TINY CRICKET.  Adorable as can be.    
           The cricket stares up at Buff.  Rubs its legs together, 
           chirping loudly as if to get his attention.  

           Buff can’t help but crack a smile.  The cricket is very cute 
           and he’s not a guy who can stay angry for very long.  

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                        Noisy little thing, aren’t you?  

           He whistles back at the cricket, “chirping” a short, tuneless 
           melody of his own invention.  

           The cricket is quiet for a moment.  Then PERFECTLY DUPLICATES 
           the melody, note for note!

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                        Well I’ll be damned, jammed, and 
                        body-slammed!    

           Buff stares at the cricket a moment longer.  Then he whistles 
           the five-note CLOSE ENCOUNTERS theme.  

           The cricket chirps it right back at him.   

           Buff looks around.  Is this a joke?  Making a decision, the 
           fat man kneels down next to his tiny, new friend.  

           The cricket looks up at Buff sweetly enough.  But then, out 
           of nowhere, it -- 

           JUMPS STRAIGHT AT HIM!  

           And lands on his arm.  It crawls up to his shoulder and gazes 
           at him, ready for the next song.  

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got to be kidding me.  

           At a loss, Buff now whistles the first few bars of TOMORROW 
           from the musical ANNIE.  

           The cricket starts almost before he’s done.  It chirps with 
           flair now, holding the last note for an extended VIBRATO. 

           Lost in wonder, Buff launches into MEMORIES from CATS.  
           Apparently, he’s a show tune guy.  

           The cricket seems to know this one and readily JOINS IN, 
           chirping with resounding depth and emotion.  

           Buff closes his eyes, really feeling it as the two unlikely 
           partners perform together in the night.  
           Their sweet duet SWELLS into a rousing conclusion backed by a 
           10,000 PIECE CHIRPING ORCHESTRA!  

           Uh oh.  

           Puzzled, but not yet frightened, Buff TURNS to look behind 
           him.  

           And there they are...  

           A VAST ARMY OF CRICKETS AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE!

           Hundreds of thousands.  Maybe millions.  They SWARM over 
           every inch of the concrete, the walls, the overhang!   

           And before Buff can even react...

           THEY SWARM TOWARD US, COVERING EVERY INCH OF THE CAMERA LENS!

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. KATE’S BEDROOM -- HATCHER HOUSE -- NEXT MORNING

           Kate sleeps with Phelps and Shelly on either side of her.  
           Suddenly, her eyes snap open.    

           Some kind of COMMOTION is going on outside.  Kate looks out 
           her window to the driveway of the house next door, where --  

           TWO SKINNY DWEEBS, 20’s.   

           Are unloading steel-plated CAGES from a station wagon.  

                                 FIRST DWEEB
                             (yelling into cage)
                        Hammerclaw!  Disengage!  Disengage, 
                        you little piece of crap!    

           No longer able to carry the cage, he rests it on the ground. 
           Whatever that cage holds is JUMPING AROUND inside it.  

                                 SECOND DWEEB
                             (to first dweeb)
                        I thought you said he followed 
                        voice commands.    

                                 FIRST DWEEB
                        He’s supposed to.    
                             (into cage)
                        I said, disengage!  

                                 KATE (O.S.)
                        Um.  Excuse me?  
           The dweebs look up to see Kate is now standing there in her 
           pajamas watching them.  They both give her a NASTY LOOK.  

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Just inquiring.  But you wouldn’t 
                        happen to have a living creature in 
                        that cage, would you?  

           They now give her an even NASTIER look if that’s possible. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Because I know you wouldn’t have a 
                        living creature cooped up in there.  
                        Because that would be cruel.  

           The dweebs share an annoyed glance.  Then...  

                                 FIRST DWEEB
                        Why, yes!  There is, in fact, a 
                        living creature in this cage.  It’s 
                        a rabid, man-eating wolverine.  

                                 SECOND DWEEB
                        And he’s hungry and vicious and he  
                        despises nosey little girls.  

                                 KATE
                        Really?  
                             (after a moment)
                        How does he feel about skinny 
                        little nerds?  

           Before they can respond, the cage comes to life again, 
           SHAKING and RATTLING.  The first dweeb turns back to Kate...  

                                 FIRST DWEEB
                        Just watch it around here, maggot.  
                        Or you could get hurt.  

           With that, they grab the cage again.  They carry it up the 
           walk towards their house, still YELLING at whatever’s inside.   

           Kate watches them as they disappear into their house, 
           bringing the cage inside and SLAMMING their front door.    

           Kate doesn’t like this.  

           Not one bit.   

                                 LIZ (O.S.)
                        Honey, please try to remember.  
                        We’re brand new to the area.  Our 
                        neighbors don’t know us yet...  
           INT. KITCHEN -- HATCHER HOUSE -- MORNING

           Kenny sits in a high chair, nibbling from a bowl of dry 
           cereal for breakfast.  Phelps lies at his feet.  Liz unpacks 
           kitchenware from boxes as she talks to Kate.  

                                 LIZ
                        ... So it’s probably best to avoid 
                        any direct conflict or accusations.  
                        Give it time.  Then you can 
                        approach them in a friendly manner.  

                                 KATE
                        But you should have seen them, Mom.  
                        They were acting really suspicious.  

                                 LIZ
                        Maybe they just got shy around such 
                        a beautiful girl.  

                                 KATE
                        Or they were hiding something. 
                        Something that needs to be exposed.   

           Jackson shuffles into the kitchen in his pajamas... 

                                 JACKSON
                        Mom.  I know that tone.  She’s 
                        about to go all “cause-ie” again 
                        and embarrass us even more than she 
                        does by refusing to use traditional 
                        brands of hygiene products.  

                                 KATE
                        Don’t start with me right now, 
                        Jackson. I will break you!  

                                 JACKSON
                        Bring it on, home girl. 

                                 LIZ
                        Kids!  Come on now!  Knock it off.  

           Kenny watches the three of them from his high chair as Liz 
           tries to restore the peace.  But then he notices... 

           SOMETHING ELSE.  Something OFF SCREEN.  Whatever it is, Kenny 
           GAZES at in complete awe!  And that’s when --

           A FAMILIAR TONGUE-LIKE APPENDAGE SHOOTS INTO FRAME, ADHERING 
           TO HIS BOWL OF CEREAL!

           It then RETRACTS, yanking the bowl back OUT OF FRAME.  
           We now hear some loud and appreciative CHEWING off screen.   

           ... Kenny looks down at Phelps.  Phelps looks up at Kenny.  
           Then they both go back to WATCHING in fascination.  

           Meanwhile, Liz finishes lecturing Jackson and Kate...   

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        ... So get dressed and finish 
                        unloading that car already.  The 
                        sooner you do that, the sooner we 
                        can make this place feel like home.  

           She ushers Jackson and Kate out of the kitchen, finally 
           turning to Kenny.  She looks surprised as she NOTICES:     

           That bowl of cereal - now COMPLETELY EMPTY and back on the 
           little high chair tray in front of Kenny.  Whatever ate the 
           cereal had the courtesy to return the dish.    

           As Walt enters the kitchen in his pajamas, Liz informs him...  

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Honey, Kenny finished all of his 
                        cereal!  I think he likes it here.  

           EXT. HATCHER HOUSE -- DAY

           We watch the Hatchers from a strange HIGH ANGLE as the family 
           unloads the rest of the car.  

           In a series of time ELAPSES, the boxes are carried inside the 
           house as the sun sinks LOWER in the sky.  

           INT. MINIVAN -- OUTSIDE HATCHER HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

           Jackson ignores a heavy box (we see a SNOW BLOWER and CROQUET 
           MALLETS sticking out of it) and chooses a much lighter one.  

           He starts to carry it up the walkway, when suddenly he hears 
           an odd SOUND.  Kind of like a FRICATIVE HISSING.  

           He stops.  Listens.  There it is again.  He follows the 
           sound, walking around to a neighboring lawn (not the dweebs).  

                                 JACKSON
                        Hello?  Somebody here?  

                                 SOUND (O.S.)
                        Psssst!  

           Startled, Jackson JUMPS and gazes around wildly.  
                                 VOICE (FROM ABOVE)
                        Psst!  Up here.  In the tree.   

           Jackson cautiously LOOKS UP... and LOVES what he sees!  

           It’s a hot TEENAGE GIRL in cut-off shorts. She’s perched up 
           in a tree, peering down at him.  

                                 GIRL
                        Hey.  What’s your name?  

                                 JACKSON
                        Jackson.  Name’s Jackson. Hi there.   

                                 GIRL
                        I’m Amelia.  I’m your new neighbor.
                        I’ve been watching you move in.

                                 JACKSON
                        Oh yeah?  Well, I wasn’t 
                        scratching.  I was... adjusting.      

                                 AMELIA
                        Your hilarious comments.  The way 
                        you... bug your sister.  I must 
                        say, I think you and I are perfect 
                        for one another, Jackson.     

                                 JACKSON
                        Really!?!  I mean... I like the way 
                        you think.  

                                 AMELIA
                        I want you to meet me tonight.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Tonight?  Okay, where?  

                                 AMELIA
                        A few blocks from here is a park. 
                        Stillwater Park.  Inside the park 
                        is a playground.  Inside the 
                        playground is a tube slide.  Meet 
                        me in there.  At nightfall.    

                                 JACKSON
                        A tube slide?   

                                 AMELIA
                        Like a regular slide, but it’s a 
                        plastic tube.  Makes it more fun 
                        for kids.  More private for... us.     

           Off Jackson, the HAPPIEST we have ever seen him -- 
           EXT. “KITCHEN SINK” HARDWARE STORE -- STILLWATER -- AFTERNOON

           Walt has propped his bicycle nearby and is KNOCKING on the 
           LOCKED glass doors of the hardware store.  

                                 WALT
                        Hello?  Buff?  Anybody here?  I 
                        came to pick up the bug traps.    
                             (beat)
                        Sorry I couldn’t get here sooner.  
                        It took all day to unload the car.  

           But the store is DARK and QUIET.  That’s odd.  He checks the 
           posted store hours.  Then his watch.  

           It should be open.  

           EXT. STREETS OF STILLWATER -- LATE AFTERNOON

           Walt bicycles through the industrial area, checking out more 
           of the stores and fast food restaurants.  

           He notices a FAMILY that seems to be looking for a lost pet.  
           They are CALLING the pet’s name and searching everywhere.  

                                 FAMILY MEMBERS
                        Hudson?/  Here boy, come on?  

           Cycling by a garbage dumpster, Walt suddenly catches a 
           GLIMPSE of MOVEMENT out of the corner of his eye.   

           Something skittering out of sight under the dumpster bin!  

           Walt double-takes, staring at the bin.  Which is when... 

           A loud ROARING SOUND behind him takes him by surprise!  

           It’s some tattooed bikers, blasting by him on their hogs!  
           They shoot Walt a look of contempt as they pass.  

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL FACILITY -- OUTSKIRTS OF STILLWATER

           Walt cycles by that “Honey-Fresh” sign in front of the high 
           hill.  He glances up at that industrial facility.  Then... 

           Something he NOTICES up there grabs his attention.  

           Puzzled, he turns the bicycle around, pedalling up the hill 
           toward the facility entrance...  
           EXT. HONEY-FRESH FACILITY -- LATE AFTERNOON

           And now we see what made Walt come up to check things out:    

           Buff’s red truck is still parked here.  The cargo bin that he 
           was loading is now EMPTY.  The bags of fertilizer are GONE.   

                                 WALT
                        Buff?  Are you up here?  Buff?  

           He dismounts his bicycle, looking around the premises.  Then, 
           he NOTICES something on the ground.  It’s actually --   

           BUFF’S CAR KEYS!  

           As Walt picks them up, an abrupt CHIRP grabs his attention.  

           Sure enough, it’s that same tiny cricket that recently 
           performed the duet with Buff.  It chirps adorably up at Walt.  

           Walt looks at the cricket sitting there, singing sweetly.  
           Will he be lured into the same fate as Buff?  

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                             (to the cricket)
                        You’re kind of annoying.  

           Still holding Buff’s keys, Walt walks away from the cricket.  

           It’s a great call for somebody in this kind of a movie.  But 
           unfortunately, as he heads over to check out Buff’s truck --  

           THE ENTIRE ARMY OF CRICKETS NOW SWARMS INTO VIEW!  

           They CRAWL all over the pick-up truck, blocking Walt’s 
           escape.  Beady eyes.  Sharp teeth.  No pretense of cuteness.  

           Walt stops dead in his tracks.  Stares at the crickets.  They 
           stare back at him.  He stands rooted.  Afraid to move.  

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        ... Um.  Okay, this is unusual.    

           They continue staring at him in eerie, salivating SILENCE.  

           Keeping very still, Walt glances down at Buff’s keys.  As we 
           saw, they’re attached to one of those auto unlock buttons.       

           Not moving or breaking eye contact, Walt shifts his thumb, 
           past the button with the “lock” icon... and the button with 
           the “unlock” icon... and PRESSES the red “ALARM” icon!  

           Alarm triggered, the truck’s LIGHTS flash wildly.  It starts 
           to WHISTLE and HONK and, of course, CHIRP.   
           This distracts and confuses the crickets... who immediately 
           TURN to the truck and begin trying to ATTACK IT!  

           It buys Walt enough time to TAKE OFF RUNNING towards the 
           front entrance.  

           EXT. HILL -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- DAY

           Walt sprints down that high hill leading back to the road.    

           ON WALT’S FEET.  Scrambling for traction as he descends down, 
           tromping through the dirt and sticks and rocks.   

           As he passes a distinct cluster of STICKS, we HOLD on them 
           for a moment as they begin to QUIVER and MOVE!  

           We now SEE they are WALKINGSTICKS.   

           These are actual mantis-like insects that blend into the 
           scenery because they are brown and spindly and look just like 
           walking twigs.  Only kind of ALIEN and very creepy.  

           Walt now passes a MUCH LARGER pile of sticks and branches.  
           These too slowly start to COME TO LIFE!   

           Walt gets to the road, attempting to flag down a passing CAR.  

                                 WALT
                        HEY!  HELP!  PLEASE HELP ME!  

           But the car just passes him by. 

           Walt now HEARS something right behind him.  Like a hissing 
           RATTLE.  He turns around to look -- 

           But NOTHING is there.   

           And now he hears a new sound.  An angry CHIRPING in the 
           distance... but growing rapidly LOUDER.  

           The crickets are DESCENDING down the hill toward him!  

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        Crap, crap, crap!  

           He quickly TURNS back around to flee, almost crashing into --  

           A TWO FOOT WALKINGSTICK!  

           It’s up on its hind LEGS, standing ERECT like some kind of 
           emaciated, other-worldly NIGHTMARE. 

           Walt stumbles backwards, FALLING to the ground.  
           As the bug moves toward Walt, RAISING its dagger-like arm...  

           A BALL OF FIRE

           EXPLODES in the walkingstick’s face, setting him ABLAZE!  

           The bug backs off, SCREAMING HORRIBLY as flame consumes it!  

           A HUMAN HAND comes into frame, grabbing Walt and yanking him 
           to his feet.  It’s --   

           THE HOMELESS MAN

           He’s holding that bug spray can and a lighter (the source of 
           the fire ball) and is looking up at the hill with concern.   

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        You...?  

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        Oliver.  My name is Oliver.  Come.  
                        The crickets are proximity guards.  
                        They won’t follow us much further.       

           He leads Walt towards a large area of WOODS that borders the 
           road.  For a man with a LIMP, he moves pretty quickly. 

                                 WALT
                        Proximity guards?  What the hell is 
                        going on here?   

                                 OLIVER
                        They’re genetically enhanced 
                        insects.  They’ve secretly infested 
                        the entire town.  

                                 WALT
                        Genetically enhanced insects?     

                                 OLIVER
                        And if my calculations are correct, 
                        it’s going to get a lot worse.  
                             (beat)
                        Their secret infestation is about 
                        to turn into an all-out massacre.  

           Walt REACTS to this as they enter the woods.  

                                 OLIVER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        ... Welcome to Stillwater.  

           Behind them, the walkingstick’s BURNING SHRIEKS grow even 
           LOUDER and more HORRIBLE!  
           INT. LIVING ROOM -- HATCHER FAMILY HOUSE -- NIGHT

           In stark contrast, the house is VERY QUIET.  Kate tip-toes to 
           the front door, dressed in BLACK with binoculars in hand.  

                                 LIZ (O.S.)
                        What are you doing, sweetie?  

           Kate whirls to see that Liz has stepped out of the kitchen.  

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        You’re not about to spy on those 
                        neighbors you told me about?  

                                 KATE
                             (re: binoculars)
                        Me?  No!  I’m going... bird 
                        watching.  I thought I saw a Blue 
                        Heron outside my window.  

                                 LIZ
                        You’re going bird watching now?  
                        It’s dark out.  

                                 KATE
                        The Heron is a nocturnal bird.

           Jackson enters the living room, also headed for the door.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Bye, Mom.  See ya, sis.  

                                 LIZ
                        Wait a minute, Jackson.  I know 
                        you’re not bird watching.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Me?  No, I’m going out to lose my 
                        innocence to a strange girl on some 
                        playground equipment.  

                                 LIZ
                        Don’t be flip.  If you need a 
                        little air just say so.   

                                 JACKSON
                        Well, I was trying to spare 
                        “certain people’s...”  
                             (tilts head towards Kate)
                        ...feelings.  But I definitely 
                        could use some fresh air.  

                                 KATE
                        Now it’s just old, Jackson.  
                                 LIZ
                        Your father should be home any 
                        minute.  I thought we could all 
                        order pizza.  

                                 JACKSON/KATE
                        Not hungry./ Yeah, not hungry.  

                                 LIZ
                        Okay.  Just don’t go too far. And I 
                        want you back in an hour. Agreed?    

           The kids chorus agreement, slamming the door as they EXIT.  
           Alone now, Liz drops her upbeat attitude for a moment.  Rubs 
           her temples.  And her eyes.  But then, notices something...   

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Okay, that is really disgusting. 

           It’s just Kenny.  He’s picking his nose with a finger in each 
           nostril and offering the booty to BOTH Shelly and Phelps.    

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        It’s bath time for you, young man.    

           INT. BATHROOM -- HATCHER FAMILY HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Kenny SQUEAKS a RUBBER DUCKY happily as Liz gives him a bath.  

                                 LIZ
                        We’re almost done shampooing your 
                        hair.  Can you say, shampoo? 

           Kenny looks up at her with a big, happy, silent SMILE.   

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Okay, then maybe just give mommy 
                        some tiny act of reassurance that 
                        you are simply just a late bloomer.  

           Kenny stares at her for a moment.  Then SQUEAKS that ducky 
           again.  Liz laughs.  Tousles his wet hair.    

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re a genius.  You’re 
                        just a quiet genius.  

           She reassures herself with these words for a minute.  Then 
           she looks down... and sees what Kenny is doing.  

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Kenny, honey, don’t stick the ducky 
                        in your nose. 
           INT. BEDROOM -- HATCHER HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Liz now tucks Kenny into bed.  He’s already sleeping happily 
           with his doll.  Liz adjusts the covers.  Gives him a kiss.  

           Then she walks past all the moving boxes and back into -- 

           THE BATHROOM

           The bath has been RUNNING, filling the tub higher with 
           STEAMING hot water.  

           Liz shakes in some bath salts and adds bubble bath.  The 
           water FROTHS as she sheds her clothes and steps into the tub.  

           She reaches for an iPod next to the tub and carefully puts it 
           on.  Then she takes a wash cloth, drapes it OVER her eyes.  

                                 LIZ
                        Calgon, take me the hell away from 
                        here.  

           Now she settles in for a nice, long sensory-deprived SOAK.  

           The iPod STARTS.  Something ballady and bathtub appropriate.  
           Perhaps Celine Dion’s luxurious cover of “Alone.”  

           And, right on cue with the intro, that’s when the first --  

           BEETLE-LIKE BUG! 

           Pokes his head and hairy pincers out of the bathtub faucet.  

           This is a SUPER STINKBUG.  We’ll find out why soon enough.   

           The thick shell and awkward, shuffling walk give this slimy, 
           aversive bug a sense of being overweight and out-of-shape.      

           The stinkbug DROPS out of the faucet and into the tub, 
           landing with a PLOP in the bath water right next to Liz!   

           He hasn’t seemed to notice Liz as she relaxes and gets more 
           comfortable, coming within INCHES of the disgusting creature.  

           And if this weren’t bad enough...  

           The ugly bug now PROPELS himself through the tub by flapping 
           his hairy arms and RELEASING BURSTS OF AIR FROM HIS PYGIDIUM! 

           For you non-entomologists, that means his ASS.  

           The air shoots out of the bug’s behind with a high-pitched 
           FLATULENT SOUND, creating BUBBLES in the froth of the bath.  
           He “swims” like this across the tub past Liz, then climbs up 
           the rim of the tub where he encounters Kenny’s rubber ducky.  

           Threatened, the bug’s eyes get big and he HISSES viciously.  

           When the ducky shows no signs of backing down, the stink bug 
           spins around and POINTS HIS ASS at the ducky.  

           With a SOUND horribly familiar to anybody who’s ever eaten 
           egg salad in Tijuana, a CLEAR LIQUID MIST SPRAYS out of the 
           bug’s ass and onto the ducky!  

           The rubber ducky instantly WITHERS into YELLOW PLASTIC MUSH.  

           A moment later, Liz’s nose starts to twitch.  She’s smelling 
           something HORRIBLE.  She lifts her washcloth.  Looks around.  

           NOTHING.  No stink bug in sight.  

           Confused but not wanting to get up, she pours a few drops of 
           bubble bath on the wash cloth and pulls it down to cover her 
           NOSE as well as her eyes.  

           And as she sinks back into her senseless reverie, we see the 
           stink bug has crawled all the way across the bathroom floor.  

           He PEERS under the crack in the door, giving him a PERFECT 
           VIEW of the KITCHEN.  Assorted boxes and cans of FOOD sit on 
           the counter.  Not yet put away.    

           Satisfied, he RAISES his pygidium high into the air and toots 
           out a triumphant, summoning WHISTLE of FLATULENCE.  And now --

           MORE STINKBUGS!

           Poke their heads out of the bathtub faucet, one by one.  

           As Celine belts the refrain, the bugs begin DROPPING into the 
           bath water all around Liz, landing with little PLOPS.     

           Liz is really RELAXING now, SINGING ALONG to the music: “And 
           now... it chills me to the bone!  How do I get you alone?”   

           Meanwhile, the DOZENS of bugs pass their gas, PROPELLING 
           themselves through the tub past Liz and creating a roiling --

           BUG FART JACUZZI!!!  

           No need to draw this out.  If we did this correctly, our kids 
           now have something to talk about in camp tomorrow and we will 
           never, ever set foot in another bathtub as long as we live.   

           As a final, lingering stinkbug uses oblivious Liz’s leg as a 
           RAMP, skittering up to the rim of the tub, we go to --  
           EXT. DARK WOODS -- STILLWATER -- NIGHT

           Leading Walt through the woods, Oliver moves briskly, keeping 
           his eyes and ears peeled for any signs of danger.  

                                 WALT
                        ... So you’re telling me all these 
                        super, killer bugs are loose?  And 
                        the company that made them isn’t 
                        even doing anything?  

                                 OLIVER
                        They did something.  They shut down 
                        the facility.  Paid off employees.  
                        District officials.  The local 
                        media.  Anybody who mattered.   

                                 WALT
                        But what about... everybody else?  

                                 OLIVER
                        Since when does anybody ever give a 
                        damn about them?  

           Hearing something ahead of them, Oliver suddenly CHANGES 
           DIRECTION, yanking Walt along with him.  

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        The company said things would 
                        eventually go back to normal.  The 
                        life span of the bugs is no more 
                        than two, three months.  And none 
                        of them are able to reproduce.    

                                 WALT
                        The bugs can’t reproduce?  

           Hearing something else, Oliver GRABS Walt and PULLS HIM DOWN 
           behind a large fallen tree.  He now whispers...  

                                 OLIVER
                        They said that three months ago.  
                        So I guess we’ll know soon enough.     

           And with that, he SPRINGS UP from behind the fallen tree.  
           Using the lighter and bug spray, he sprays a FIREBALL 
           directly at an oncoming walkingstick!  

           The bug screams and burns as the two take off running again.  

                                 WALT
                        But this is an entire town!  
                        They’ve infested an entire town!  
                        You can’t cover that up!    
                                 OLIVER
                        The bugs are clever.  They were 
                        mostly staying hidden.  Avoiding 
                        human contact. Preying on smaller 
                        animals.  I’m sure you’ve seen the 
                        missing pet fliers.    

           Suddenly, Oliver pauses.  Head cocked.  Listening.    

           Then he whirls around to FIREBALL another crazed, rushing 
           walkingstick.  The bug goes down screaming and grasping at 
           Walt’s neck.  The two men resume running.  

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        But these past few days, they’ve 
                        become increasingly agitated.  
                        Taking more risks.  Snatching more 
                        pets.  It’s not like they’re dying 
                        out.  It’s more like they’re... 
                        stockpiling food.  I don’t know 
                        why.  But I know it can’t be good.   

                                 WALT
                        You’re saying the bugs are all... 
                        working together?   

                                 OLIVER
                        Are you familiar with the concept 
                        of “connectivity?”  In our deepest 
                        brains, there’s a hive mentality.  
                        Like we’re all... one big family.  
                        That’s how they’re behaving.    

           Walt nods as he POINTS behind Oliver.  Oliver whirls around 
           to FIREBALL a third attacking walkingstick.  Then...   

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        The crickets, the walkingsticks... 
                        you already met them... they’ve 
                        been guarding the facility.  
                        Meanwhile, the Gunner Wasps.  The 
                        Bleach Leeches.  The Dragontulas.  
                        The Roid Roach.  They’ve been 
                        gathering food and materials.     

                                 WALT
                        The... Roid Roach?  What’s that?       

           But Oliver just points toward a small path leading upward...  

                                 OLIVER
                        This path will take us back onto 
                        the main road.
           EXT. DARK ROAD -- EMERGING FROM THE WOODS -- NIGHT

           Oliver & Walt step out into a dark road leading back into the 
           commercial district.  Walt has his cellphone out...   

                                 WALT
                        Still no bars.  I can’t seem to get 
                        a signal.      

                                 OLIVER
                        ... Of course you can’t.  

           Walt stares at Oliver, realizing the implications of this.   

                                 WALT
                        My house is only a few miles away.  
                        I’ll have to make a run for it.  

                                 OLIVER
                        After you get your family out of 
                        town, I’ll need you to meet me by 
                        the facility. If we can sneak past 
                        the sentries we’ll have a decent 
                        chance of slipping inside.    

           Walt stops in his tracks.  Turns to Oliver...

                                 WALT
                        Wait a minute.  You want me to 
                        rescue my family and... come back?      

                                 OLIVER
                        You have to.  Something big is 
                        about to go down.  We’ve got to 
                        figure out what it is.  Before it’s 
                        too late.         

                                 WALT
                        Okay, you need to stop saying we.   

                                 OLIVER
                        Please.  I can’t do this alone.  

                                 WALT
                        Look.  Oliver.  I’m just an 
                        unemployed paper pusher.  Not some 
                        bug-slaying freedom fighter.  

                                 OLIVER
                        If not you... then who?  

                                 WALT
                        I can go to the state police.  I 
                        can find you help.  I promise.  
           But now, Oliver is looking down on the ground in front of 
           them.  His eyes getting HUGE!  

                                 OLIVER
                        ... Oh no!  She found us! 

           Walt glances over to where Oliver is looking.  

           And there she is.  Sitting on the street right behind him.  
           That tiny, perfectly normal-looking LADYBUG.  

           But if that’s the case, why would Oliver be so TERRIFIED?  

                                 WALT
                        Who found us?  

                                 OLIVER
                        Her!  The queen!
                             (to the ladybug)
                        You!  Stay away!    

           That’s when they both hear it.  Something unmistakable.  That 
           chilling little GIGGLE.   

           The little bug hops a few inches closer to Oliver.  

           Oliver immediately SCREAMS and takes off running... as if 
           from the SCARIEST CREATURE on the planet.  

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        WALT!!!  GET OUT OF HERE!!!   

           Walt doesn’t need to be told twice.  He also takes off 
           RUNNING in a different direction.  

           And now, HOLDING on the ladybug, we finally see why Oliver 
           was so intimidated as --    

           TWO LONG, SKINNY INSECT ARMS POP OUT! 

           From underneath her shell. LIFTING IT OFF!  Revealing it was 
           actually a kind of --  

           LADYBUG COSTUME 

           It conceals A MUCH LARGER BUG that was folded and squashed 
           and contorted underneath... and is now beginning to UNFURL.  

           Before we can see ALL of her, we cut back to Oliver... racing 
           away as fast as he possibly can.  

           Until something DROPS DOWN in front of him with a concrete-
           cracking THUD!  
           We catch sight of CLAWS and HAIR and TALONS as we look over 
           her shoulder... way, way down at the terrified Oliver.   

           Then she lets loose with a SOUND.  A much louder and deeper 
           and more nefarious version of that same soul-numbing -- 

           GIGGLE.  

           EXT. DARK ROAD -- NIGHT

           Walt is SPRINTING down the road when SOMETHING HUGE COMES 
           ROCKETING UP NEXT TO HIM!  

           It’s one of those intimidating bikers we saw earlier.  He 
           motions for Walt to stop running.  

                                 BIKER
                        Dude?  Are you okay?  

                                 WALT
                             (out of breath; pointing)
                        I know... this is... sounds 
                        crazy... bugs everywhere... genetic 
                        super bugs... want to kill us...!  

           Walt knows he’s not sounding too convincing.  But then...    

                                 BIKER
                             (after a moment)
                        Of course!  It all makes sense!  
                        The missing pets!  The weird 
                        movements in the corner of my eye.  
                             (re: his bike)
                        Hop on.  I’ll help you.  I’m Ted.    

                                 WALT
                        Oh.  Thank God.  

           Walt breathes a huge sigh of relief and steps toward the 
           motorcycle, when just then --  

           A SHRIEKING DRAGONTULA POPS UP BEHIND THE BIKER!!!  

           It GRABS TED IN ITS TALONS AND THEN YANKS HIM OFF THE 
           MOTORCYCLE, LIFTING HIM INTO THE AIR!  

           SPREADING its VAST, GLOWING WINGS!  It takes off flying, 
           carrying the SCREAMING biker off to God knows where!  

           As the “Dragontula” disappears into the night, Walt is now 
           left ALONE with Ted’s still-throttling motorcycle.  

           He takes a hesitant step toward it...   
           EXT. ENTRANCE -- STILLWATER PARK -- NIGHT

           The gate is PADLOCKED SHUT and a sign indicates:  “PARK 
           CLOSES AT NIGHTFALL.”  But a labored GRUNTING tells us that --     

           JACKSON is not to be thwarted.  He’s climbing up the fence to 
           get into the park.  That is until SOMETHING GRABS HIS LEG!  

           It’s a PARK RANGER with a flashlight... 

                                 PARK RANGER
                        Hey kid!  What do you think you’re 
                        doing?  The park is closed.  

                                 JACKSON
                        What?!?  Oh!  The park is closed?  
                        I thought this jungle gym seemed a 
                        tad high.  It all makes sense now.  

                                 PARK RANGER
                        Are you kidding me?  Get out of 
                        here.  Go home.    

                                 JACKSON
                        I can do that.  I can go home.

           He jumps down and starts to walk away.  But then...  

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        But, first, can I level with you?  
                             (seeing his name plate)
                        Ranger Dan?  One guy to another.  

                                 PARK RANGER
                        You want to level with me?  

                                 JACKSON
                        Yes.  Yes I do.  See, my family got 
                        hit pretty hard recently.  We lost 
                        our money.  Our home.  And, I’ll 
                        say it, I lost my confidence.  
                        However, today, I discovered the 
                        silver lining on this cloud of 
                        poverty, humiliation, and despair. 

                                 PARK RANGER
                        ... Okay?   

                                 JACKSON
                        When your family is forced to move 
                        to a bad kind of neighborhood... 
                        you can meet a bad kind of girl.  

           He takes a step towards the ranger, picking up steam... 
                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        The kind of girl who -- even though 
                        she is like exceptionally hot and 
                        you’re basically kind of a dork -- 
                        will still be happy to meet you 
                        inside a tube slide in what you are 
                        certain will be the single greatest 
                        night of your life.  But that’s 
                        only if strong, handsome Ranger Dan 
                        agrees to look the other way, while 
                        you climb that god-forsaken fence.    

           The park ranger STARES at Jackson for a long moment.  

                                 PARK RANGER
                        Wait a minute.  You’re sneaking 
                        into the park to meet a girl?  

                                 JACKSON
                        Yes, sir.  That’s correct.  

                                 PARK RANGER
                        Well, why didn’t you say so in the 
                        first place?  Here, let me open 
                        these gates right up for you!  

                                 JACKSON
                        ... Really?  

                                 PARK RANGER
                        No!  Get the hell out of here!  Go 
                        home.  Before I take you in.    

                                 JACKSON
                        Please, sir.  I’ll be back in five, 
                        ten minutes tops.  She’s probably 
                        already in there.  My dream girl.    

           As Jackson gazes through the fence longingly, A GIANT TONGUE-
           LIKE APPENDAGE ROCKETS INTO FRAME, ADHERING TO RANGER DAN AND 
           YANKING HIM BACK OUT OF FRAME BEFORE HE CAN EVEN SCREAM!!!  

           A beat.  Then, Jackson turns back from the fence obliviously.  
           Sees that the park ranger has now completely VANISHED.   

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Hello?  Ranger Dan?  Hello?  
                             (no response)
                        Huh.  Guess he had a change of 
                        heart.  ...Good for him.  

           Jackson hops back onto the fence, re-starting his climb.    
           EXT. STILLWATER PARK -- NIGHT

           Jackson tromps through the DARK, WOODSY park grounds.  He 
           rounds a corner, grinning with joy as he spots:    

           THE CHILDREN’S PLAYGROUND!  

                                 AMELIA (O.S.)
                        Pssst.  Hey, Jackson. 

           Jackson turns to the voice, noticing a long TUBE SLIDE.  At 
           the top of the tube slide ladder is a GIRL.  It is the girl!  

           Amelia.  She is actually here.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Hey, Amelia.  

                                 AMELIA
                        So glad you could make it.   

                                 JACKSON
                        ... I can make a lot of things.     

           God, that was lame.  But it doesn’t seem to bother her one 
           bit.  In fact, she SMILES like he’s the coolest guy around.  

                                 AMELIA
                        Follow me.      

           And with that, she crawls inside the tube slide and PUSHES 
           OFF, disappearing inside the plastic tube.  

           Jackson hurries over there, climbs the ladder, and peers into 
           the slide.  But it’s PITCH DARK inside the tubing.  He lowers 
           himself into the slide.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Hello?  Amelia?  It’s slippery.  

           He pushes off and starts to SLIDE DOWN...  

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        All right.  Here I come.  

           But he wasn’t wrong.  It is exceedingly SLIPPERY.  Jackson 
           picks up SPEED as he WHIZZES down and around the turns.  

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        You might want to get out of my 
                        waaaaaaaay! 

           Jackson rockets towards the bottom.  Unable to stop, he GOES 
           FLYING OUT OF THE SLIDE, landing heavily on the ground.  
           But as he hits the dirt, it GIVES WAY underneath him.  
           Jackson now finds himself SLIDING DOWN AGAIN into a big --  

           PIT OF MUD

           Recovering, Jackson tries to get to his feet.  But he’s STUCK 
           in the mud on his back, making it very difficult to move.  

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Okay, I think we’ve suffered a 
                        minor setback here. Hello?  

           Silence.  Eerie SILENCE.  And then... a slower, creepier 
           version of that same fricative HISSSSSING.   

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        PSSSSSSSSSSSSST.  

           A horrific, shadowy FIGURE appears on the side of the pit.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Amelia? Is that you?   

           The figure slowly DESCENDS on what seems to be a strand of 
           WEB, closing in on the helpless Jackson.  

                                 “AMELIA’S VOICE” (O.S)
                        Oh yes, Jackson.  It’s me.  Are you 
                        ready now to... have some fun?  

           It’s very dark, but there’s no mistaking the shape.  This is 
           a HUGE SPIDER that’s descending towards him.  Its torso is 
           the size of a beach ball with hairy LEGS and a SHARP BEAK.  

           As Jackson’s brain processes the shape he starts to FREAK!  

                                 JACKSON
                        Hello?  Oh my God!  Holy crap! 
                        You’re actually a giant... oh my... 
                        crap!  I knew this was way too good 
                        to be true.    

           He SCRAMBLES around but he can’t get traction in the mud.  He 
           falls again on his back as the bug continues its descent.    

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Please!  I’ll do whatever you say.  
                        I’ll bring you humans to feed on.  
                        Lots of them.  I’LL BE YOUR SLAVE, 
                        SPIDER QUEEN!  SPARE MY LIFE AND I 
                        WILL BE YOUR WILLING SLAVE!  

           But now, the spider has gotten very close.  And with this 
           proximity, the ILLUSION rapidly falls away...  
           The “monster” is, in fact, only a BEACH BALL that’s been 
           painted and decorated to resemble an arachnid beast.   

           Amelia now appears at the top of the pit.  She holds a rope 
           attached to the “spider” and, also, a VIDEO CAMERA.  

                                 AMELIA
                        Wow!  Bravo!  That was amazing!  By 
                        far the best work I’ve ever done!   

                                 JACKSON
                        What?  What’s going on?  

                                 AMELIA
                        YouTube is just the beginning for 
                        this video.  We could go viral.  
                        You’ll be bigger than the sneezing 
                        pandas.  I mean, you were begging 
                        to be my slave.  How great is that?  
                        I just wish you’d wet your pants.  
                        Okay.  Bye!  

           With that she runs off, leaving Jackson muddy and alone. 

                                 JACKSON
                             (calling after her)
                        So... can I see you again?  

           As if in response, a new wave of mud slides down the side of 
           the pit, landing on Jackson’s face and mouth.  

           Jackson lays there another moment.  Finally, he struggles to 
           his feet, wiping mud from his eyes, not yet seeing the -- 

           VERY, VERY REAL FOUR-FOOT SPIDER!  

           That’s standing right there behind him, watching him.  

                                 REAL GIANT SPIDER
                             (very real sounding)
                        Psssssssssssssssssssst!  

           Hearing the sound, Jackson turns around to face the spider...

           But his eyes and face are still very MUDDY.  So when he sees 
           this thing, it’s not quite the reaction we want from him...  

                                 JACKSON
                             (calling out)
                        Oh, come on!  How stupid do you 
                        think I am, Amelia?  

           The spider stands there, not offering any verbal assessments 
           as to Jackson’s intelligence.  
                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        You think you can get me twice in 
                        one night?  

           Jackson now approaches the spider fearlessly.  Convinced he’s 
           getting punked again, he’s determined to put on a show. 

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                             (to spider)
                        Well, hello there!  You’re awful 
                        cute!  What’s your name? 

                                 GIANT SPIDER
                        Pssssssssssssssst!  

                                 JACKSON
                        Oh whasa matter?  Is spidey-widey a 
                        widdle grumpy-wumpy?  Does he need 
                        a little scratchy-scratchy?   

           That’s when Jackson reaches over and starts to SCRATCH the 
           spider on his thorax as one might do to a Golden Retriever.  

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Oh yes he does!  He’s a little 
                        itchy.  He’s an itchy boy.  

           Weirdly enough, the spider actually seems to be enjoying 
           this.  As Jackson continues scratches him, the beast begins 
           to GRUNT happily and kick his legs like an ecstatic dog.  

           After a moment, he FLOPS onto his back so that Jackson can 
           really get to work on him, grunting louder with excitement.    

           That’s when Jackson starts to realize that this situation 
           might not be exactly what he thought it was.  

           Eyes narrowing, he stops scratching.  Starts to back up.    

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        No way.  

           Frustrated the scratching has stopped, the spider gives an 
           impatient GROWL.  He still wants more.   

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        No.  Fricking.  Way.  

           Annoyed now, the spider struggles to his feet whilst making 
           some very odd SOUNDS.  Jackson isn’t sticking around.  

           With all his might, Jackson THROWS HIMSELF up onto the side 
           of the pit, struggling to pull himself the hell out of there!  
           EXT. STILLWATER PARK -- NIGHT

           Panting and terrified, Jackson runs through the park.  

                                 JACKSON
                        HELP!  SOMEBODY HELP ME!  IT WANTS 
                        TO EAT ME!   

           Turning a corner, he almost slams into --  

           A DRAGONTULA!!!  

           It FANS OUT its glowing WINGS and SHRIEKS MENACINGLY at 
           Jackson... who also SHRIEKS in fear right back it!  

           He then takes off running in a different direction.   

           EXT. ENTRANCE -- STILLWATER PARK -- NIGHT

           A motorcycle ZOOMS around the corner, speeding past the park. 

           It’s Walt.   He’s racing to get home.  But then he sees:    

           His son, Jackson!  

           Screaming and frantic and covered with mud, sprinting out 
           into the middle of the road.  

                                 JACKSON
                        HELP!  GIANT BUGS!!   HELP!!!    

           Walt catches up to Jackson, stopping the bike...  

                                 WALT
                        ... JACKSON?!?  

                                 JACKSON
                        DAD!?!  You’re never going to 
                        believe what’s chasing...  

                                 WALT
                        ... I believe you.  I totally 
                        believe you.  Just get on!  

           Jackson jumps on to the bike behind his father.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Wow.  Dad.  You really know how to 
                        drive a motorcycle?    

           Walt gives Jackson a look.  Then expertly THROTTLES the bike 
           and BLASTS OFF down the straightway.  
                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God.  You do.  Shocking.   

                                 WALT
                        We moved to a town infested by 
                        super insects and the fact that I 
                        know how to ride a motorcycle is 
                        what’s shocking to you?  

                                 JACKSON
                        ... Kind of.  

           They round a corner into the commercial section of town.  

           It’s now complete CHAOS on the streets!  People are RUNNING 
           and SCREAMING.  Car alarms HONKING.   

           A dragontula flies overhead, carrying a SHRIEKING WOMAN in a 
           NET of sticky WEBBING.    

                                 WALT
                             (to himself)
                        It’s starting.  He was right.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Who was right?  

                                 WALT
                             (ignoring him)
                        Where is the rest of the family?  
                        Are they back at the house?  

                                 JACKSON
                        Mom and Kenny should be.  Kate went 
                        out to spy on the neighbors.  She 
                        said something weird was going on.  

                                 WALT
                        Oh dear lord.  Kate! 

           EXT. BUSHES -- SIDE OF THE HATCHER HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Kate has hidden herself in a cluster of BUSHES. She’s staking 
           out the dweebs’ house, looking through her binoculars.  

           BINOCULARS POV:  Both dweebs are here in their living room.  
           They’re ARGUING about something as one polishes a TROPHY.  We 
           also notice more of those CAGES piled next to the wall.  

                                 KATE
                        Come on.  What’s in the cages?  
                        Open it already.  Open it up!
           Kate crawls DEEPER into the bushes to get a better view.  
           Given what we know about bugs and bushes, we might be 
           starting to feel just a bit nervous for her.  

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, so what are you guys doing 
                        now?  Excellent!  Yes!  Perfect!  

           BINOCULARS POV:  The dweebs are now LEAVING the house.  They 
           are still arguing...  

                                 SECOND DWEEB
                        But Slaughtertail needs the upgrade 
                        way more than Hammerclaw.  He 
                        barely survived his last battle.  

           Kate DUCKS DOWN as low as she can in the bushes as the dweebs 
           pass by her, entering their station wagon and SPEEDING AWAY.  

           Scrambling up from the bushes, Kate then sprints towards 
           their house, PRYING OPEN a small, ground floor window.  

           INT. LIVING ROOM -- DWEEBS’ HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Kate feels her way into the living room of the DARKENED 
           HOUSE, spotting the cages lined up against the wall.  She 
           approaches the nearest cage and PULLS OPEN the door... 

           It’s EMPTY!  She walks over to the next cage.    

                                 KATE
                        Is somebody in here?    

           In response, something COMES TO LIFE, moving around inside 
           the cage!  Kate bends toward the cage, speaking gently.  

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be scared.  I’ll get you out.  

           Kate unlatches the cage and OPENS the metal door...    

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Hi there.  Don’t be shy.  Come on 
                        out, little guy. Come on...    

           That’s when -- 

           HANDS FALL ON HER SHOULDERS FROM BEHIND, MAKING HER JUMP!  

           It’s Liz!  She’s standing there in her slippers and robe!  

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Mom!  What are you doing here?  
                                 LIZ
                        What am I doing here?  I walked 
                        outside to look for your father and 
                        see my daughter breaking into the 
                        neighbor’s house.  I told you no 
                        spying, young lady.  

                                 KATE
                        I’m not spying.  I’m rescuing.  

                                 LIZ
                        I don’t want to hear any more out 
                        of you.  Not one tiny peep...    

           But that’s when... SOMETHING COMES BURSTING OUT OF THAT CAGE!  

           It PASSES Kate and Liz, scuttling to the center of the room, 
           waving a SILVER HOOK.  Its movements are STILTED and ROBOTIC! 

           As Liz and Kate move closer to get a better look, we can tell 
           it is not a living creature at all, but rather a...  

                                 KATE
                        Junkbot!  It’s only a Junkbot.    

                                 LIZ
                        What?  What’s a Junkbot?  

                                 KATE
                        It’s this show on The Discovery 
                        Channel.  I’ve seen previews.  
                        These teams of engineering students 
                        build robots out of junk.  Then the 
                        robots... fight each other.  
                             (points)
                        See, look?    

           Kate is pointing to a trophy case where we now see several 
           framed PICTURES: The Dweebs posing with ROBOTIC “JUNKBOTS,” 
           that boast an assortment of claws, hooks, and WINGS.     

                                 LIZ
                        Look at all these trophies they’ve 
                        won.  They must be very talented.  

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Indeed we are.  

           Liz and Kate whirl around to see the two dweebs, DUSTIN & 
           NICHOLAS, illuminated in the doorway.  

                                 DUSTIN
                        Silverhook!  Disengage!  
           Immediately, the silver robot stops waving its claw and 
           scuttles over to stand by the dweebs.   

                                 NICHOLAS
                        You’d think with our level of 
                        supreme talent, we could finally 
                        move out of this dump town.  But do 
                        you know what the “grand” prize was 
                        for last month’s battle-pit?  

                                 KATE
                        Okay, guys?  This was all a big...    

                                 DUSTIN
                        ... A three-hundred dollar Radio 
                        Shack gift certificate, a smoked 
                        ham, and some Dr. Who figurines.  

                                 NICHOLAS
                        So when we catch two low-life 
                        snoops like yourselves in our 
                        house, our first questions is...  

                                 DUSTIN
                        ... What’s it worth to you for us 
                        not to call the police?  I’d say a 
                        thousand dollars might do it.  

                                 LIZ
                        Now just hold on a moment here, 
                        boys. I think you’re getting a bit 
                        ahead of yourselves.  

                                 NICHOLAS
                        Breaking and entering.  Property 
                        damage.  First degree theft.  And 
                        we will press charges.  

           Picking up the phone, Nicholas notices a HOLE in the sleeve 
           of his shirt.  Then he shrugs and starts to dial... 

                                 LIZ
                        We don’t have a thousand dollars. 

                                 KATE
                        I could bake you boys something.  
                        Do you like bundt cake?  

           Dustin now notices a STRANGE HOLE in his sweater.  He 
           inspects it for a moment, then murmurs to Nicholas...  

                                 DUSTIN
                        By the way, degrees are only used 
                        for murder charges.  Not theft.  
                                 NICHOLAS
                        There’s degrees of theft...  

                                 DUSTIN
                        No there’s not.  Theft is theft.    

           As the dweebs argue, Kate elbows Liz to get her attention.  
           She subtly motions to something behind the dweebs:  

           It’s those strange, shimmering CAMO-MOTHS we saw in the lab!  
           They’re here!  Fluttering up from various hiding places.     

                                 NICHOLAS
                        Why do you always correct me?  

                                 DUSTIN
                        Because you’re always wrong.

                                 NICHOLAS
                        Well, you’re a first degree assh...  

           Just then, one of the moths FLAPS UP from where it was 
           camouflaged on his sweater.  IT UNHINGES HIS JAWS AND CLAMPS 
           ONTO HIS NOSE!

                                 NICHOLAS (CONT’D)
                        OW!!! Holy God!  What was that?  

           With increasing aggression, the moths are now swooping in and 
           attacking both of the helpless dweebs.

                                 DUSTIN
                        Whatever they are... I think 
                        they’re trying to kill us!  

                                 NICHOLAS
                        Silverhook!  ATTACK!  

           That Junkbot comes to life, swinging its metal hook around 
           USELESSLY as the moths swarm. It’s pretty PATHETIC really.   

           A few moths swoop in, easily BITING THROUGH Silverhook’s 
           exposed wires.  

           The robot immediately falls down LIFELESS.  

                                 NICHOLAS (CONT’D)
                        SILVERHOOK!  NOOOOOOO!!!    

                                 LIZ
                        Kate!  Look!  

           A second CLOUD of moths is FORMING away from the two dweebs.  
           They’ve clearly got Liz and Kate in their sights.  
                                 KATE
                             (re: moths in hallway)
                        They’re blocking the front door!  

                                 LIZ
                        The window!  

           Both of them turn and run towards that window that Kate pried 
           open.  But just as they get there --

           A GELATINOUS BLEACH LEECH (FROM WHEN WE FIRST SAW THE HOUSE) 
           POPS UP ON THE OTHER SIDE IN A SUCKIE-SLURPIE RAGE!

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        ... Come on!  

           With the moths closing in, Liz and Kate sprint away from the 
           window, towards a nearby door.  Running into -- 

           INT. BATHROOM -- DWEEBS’ HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           SLAMMING the door closed, Kate grabs some hanging towels and 
           uses them to COVER the crack between the door and the floor.  

           She then looks over at her mother who is CURLED UP against 
           the wall in fetal position.  She is completely freaked out.  

                                 KATE
                        Mom?  

                                 LIZ
                        I.  Hate.  Bugs.  

                                 KATE
                        Mom, we’re gonna be okay.  They 
                        can’t get in here.  

                                 LIZ
                        Are you sure?  Are you really... 
                        so... sure?  

                                 KATE
                        Yes.  Everything’s going to be 
                        fine, Mom.  I promise.  Everything 
                        is going to be... just fine.  

           Which is precisely the moment we choose to check in on --  

           INT. KENNY & JACKSON’S BEDROOM -- HATCHER HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Kenny AWAKENS in his bed and looks around.  All is QUIET.  
           INT. KITCHEN -- HATCHER HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Two little HANDS appear on the kitchen counter.  Kenny is 
           climbing up here!  Phelps watches, whimpering from the floor.  

           And now we see what Kenny was after:  a piece of ALUMINUM 
           (the seal of a can of Pringles chips) catches the light.    

                                 KENNY
                        Shiny.  

           He examines his new prize.  Transfixed.  But then --

           Hearing a THUD, Kenny glances up from his reverie.  

           And there it is again.  Another THUD.  

           It seems to be coming from the KITCHEN WINDOW just a few feet 
           away from Kenny.  As he looks over at it -- 

           A DRAGONTULA APPEARS OUT OF NOWHERE!!!

           It THROWS ITSELF against the kitchen window with another 
           THUD, trying to get to Kenny.  

           Undaunted, Kenny HOLDS UP the aluminum, showing it to the 
           Dragontula and explaining...  

                                 KENNY (CONT’D)
                        Shiny.  

           This drives the Dragontula completely BERSERK!  It redoubles 
           its effort to get through that window.  THUD.  THUD.  THUD.   

           Kenny LAUGHS.  Absolutely fearless.  Liking this game.  

                                 KENNY (CONT’D)
                        Shiny! 

           The Dragontula makes the MOST AWFUL sound we have ever heard!  
           It’s FURIOUS and FRUSTRATED and THREATENING and COVETOUS!!!

           And as the first small CRACK appears in the kitchen window --  

           EXT. STILLWATER STREETS -- NIGHT

           Speeding along with muddy Jackson holding on behind him, Walt 
           expertly maneuvers the motorcycle...

                                 WALT
                        We’ll be back at the house in two 
                        minutes.  Everything is going to be 
                        just fine...  
                                 JACKSON
                             (re: the motorcycle)
                        Boy.  You’re pretty good with this 
                        thing, Dad.  

                                 WALT
                        We’ll get everybody in the car.  
                        And then we’ll just... drive the 
                        hell out of here.    

                                 JACKSON
                        A man your age.  It’s very 
                        impressive.  

                                 WALT
                        How old do you think I am?  

           Before Jackson can respond, a loud, teeth-jarring BUZZING 
           gets both of their attention.  They turn around to see -- 

           A WASP!     

           STREAKING through the air in the distance like something out 
           of TOP GUN.  

           This guy is BIG.  At least two feet long.  With large, barbed 
           STINGERS visibly protruding from his rear.  

           And yes, he’s in pursuit of Walt and Jackson!  

                                 JACKSON
                        Dad!  

                                 WALT
                        I see it!  

                                 JACKSON
                        Go faster!  

                                 WALT
                        I’m trying!  

           As the bike picks up speed, the pursuing wasp flies by, 
           firing hundreds of STINGERS like from a MACHINE GUN!

           The stingers SLAM into the ground all around the bike...  as 
           Walt desperately veers out of the way.   

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        Gunner wasp.  It’s a Gunner Wasp!  

                                 JACKSON
                        What are you talking about?  
           No time to explain.  The wasp is already launching his next 
           SALVO!  Walt CUTS sharply, causing the shots to GO WIDE.  

           He steers into the cut, spinning the bike (so the wasp is 
           behind him again) and heading off the road into -- 

           EXT. PARTIALLY CONSTRUCTED BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

           Walt SPEEDS the bike, maneuvering around the concrete and 
           girders as the wasp tries to catch up to them.     

                                 JACKSON
                        It can only shoot behind.  We need 
                        to stay ahead of it!  

           Walt fakes one direction, then weaves the bike into a narrow 
           gully.  The loud BUZZING momentarily stops.  

                                 WALT
                             (looking behind)
                        Hey!  Where did he go?  

                                 JACKSON
                        Dad!  Look out!   

           A CONCRETE BLOCK has sprung up on the path in front of them!  

           As the bike COLLIDES with the block, Walt and Jackson go 
           FLYING OFF of it, LANDING in a muddy ditch.  

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Come on!  We’ve got to hurry!   

           Both of them, now covered with mud and panting, pick 
           themselves up and RUSH over to the fallen bike.  

           But it’s too late:  they hear a sudden ANGRY BUZZING!  

           The wasp is DIVING TOWARDS JACKSON!     

           With the wasp almost upon him, Jackson instinctively covers 
           his face.  Just as -- 

           A STEEL BEAM comes out of nowhere and WHACKS the insect right 
           in the head!  

           Jackson uncovers his face to see:   Walt, holding that steel 
           beam like a baseball bat and looking pleased with himself.  

           The wasp has DROPPED to the ground, more stunned than hurt.  

           But it gives Walt the opportunity to now PICK UP that 
           concrete block and --    
           SMASH THE INSECT AS HARD AS HE CAN!   

           As the wasp’s BUZZING weakens, Walt lifts the block and 
           SMASHES AGAIN!  AND AGAIN!  AND AGAIN!  

           We should stay on Walt’s FACE here.  

           The dying BUZZ of the wasp and the SQUISHY SOUND of block 
           hitting bug should be more than enough to sell it.    

                                 WALT
                             (after a moment)
                        I think he’s dead now.  

                                 JACKSON
                        ... You think? 

           They stand there staring down.  Catching their breath.  

           A long BEAT.  

           And now, just when we thought we might be spared, we WIDEN to 
           INCLUDE the GROTESQUE REMAINS of the slain Gunner Wasp.  

           The mutilated insect stays in FOREGROUND as Jackson and Walt 
           finally turn away, stumbling back to the bike.  

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        I gotta say, Dad.  That was some 
                        pretty clutch play.  

                                 WALT
                        Thanks, Jackson.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Perhaps I’ve been misjudging you.   

                                 WALT
                        Perhaps.   

                                 JACKSON
                        I mean, I always thought you were 
                        just like this aging, pathetic guy 
                        whose entire identity was vested in 
                        some stupid job that he wasn’t 
                        smart enough to hold on to...     

                                 WALT
                        ... Thank you, Jackson.  

           As a dangling CHUNK of dead wasp gives way to gravity and 
           SPLATTERS to the ground, Jackson & Walt ride into the night.  
           INT. BATHROOM -- DWEEBS’ HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Kate kneels by the door, SPYING OUT through the keyhole.  Liz 
           has a rolled up a Maxim magazine (from a rack by the toilet) 
           and is wielding it in front of herself with a trembling hand.  

                                 LIZ
                        Those things are still out there?  

                                 KATE
                             (looking through keyhole)
                        Uh huh.  

                                 LIZ
                        And those two young men?  Where are 
                        they?  What’s happened to them?  

                                 KATE
                        I don’t see them.  

                                 LIZ
                        But the things are still out there?

                                 KATE
                        Yes.  

                                 LIZ
                        As many as before?  

                                 KATE
                        Um.  Give or take?  

                                 LIZ
                        Give or take?  

                                 KATE
                        Uh huh.  

                                 LIZ
                        What does that mean?  

           KATE’S KEYHOLE POV:  The ENTIRE LIVING ROOM has now filled up 
           with fluttering, shimmering, snapping MOTHS. 

           Suddenly, a moth COMES OUT OF NOWHERE, rushing the keyhole, 
           SNAPPING MANIACALLY RIGHT AT US!!!

           BACK TO SCENE.  Kate pulls her head away from the keyhole.  

                                 KATE
                        We should probably look for another 
                        way out of this bathroom.   
                                 LIZ
                        In our house there’s a window above 
                        the tub.

           She grabs the shower curtain and PULLS IT BACK TO REVEAL... 

           No bugs back here.  Just a small SEALED window.  

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Too small.  Not even Kenny could 
                        get through there.  

           Then she turns back to Kate, suddenly REALIZING...  

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        OH MY GOD!!!  KENNY!!!  WHAT IF 
                        THEY’VE GOTTEN TO KENNY!?!  

                                 KATE
                        MOM! NO!!!!

           But it’s too late.  Liz PULLS AWAY from Kate, opening the 
           door and RUSHING back out into the living room.  Into --  

           THE MAELSTROM OF SHIMMERING MOTHS.  

           She wasn’t at all prepared for how many of them were going to 
           be out there.  She stands there PARALYZED as --  

           The moths all turn to FACE HER, snapping their enormous JAWS.  
           But that’s exactly when:   

           The THUNDEROUS ROAR of a DIESEL MOTOR fills the room.  

           The attacking moths are immediately BLOWN AWAY FROM LIZ by 
           GREAT GUSTS OF COMPRESSED AIR.  

           It’s Walt!  

           He’s got that SNOWBLOWER we saw earlier in the car.  He’s 
           flanked by Jackson, who holds a couple of CROQUET MALLETS.  

                                 JACKSON
                             (tossing Kate a mallet)
                        Kate!  Behind you! 

           Kate CATCHES the mallet and whirls to face --   

           That slurpie-suckie leech!  It apparently got through the 
           window and is SLURPING ITS WAY ACROSS THE FLOOR TOWARDS KATE!  

           With no time for hesitation, Kate SWINGS the mallet at the 
           attacking bug, trying to knock it away.  
           But as the mallet makes contact, the leech FULLY EXPLODES in 
           a SHOWER of BLOOD and SLIME and GELATINOUS GUTS!    

           Kate is SPLATTERED with the stuff.  Her hands, arms, and 
           clothes completely COVERED in the bug’s horrible remains.  

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Kate?  Are you okay?  

           Kate turns to Jackson, looking very GUILTY and DISTURBED...  

                                 KATE
                        I liked that.  I liked that a lot. 

           And as Walt continues BLOWING moths out of the way, Liz 
           dashes past him, out the door and toward --    

           EXT. KITCHEN -- HATCHER HOUSE -- NIGHT

           The kitchen window is now a MESS of CRACKS.  It looks like it 
           could BREAK any moment as the dragontula HAMMERS away at it.   

           Inside, Kenny still sits calmly on the kitchen counter, 
           waving to his new friend and GIGGLING.  

           And now, with the next CHARGE, the glass completely SHATTERS!   
           The dragontula SHRIEKS with glee and prepares to ATTACK!    

                                 LIZ (O.S.)
                        HALT BUG!  THAT’S MY SON!!!

           It’s Liz, racing across the lawn toward the dragontula.  But 
           the furious bug ignores her, CHARGING into the kitchen!  

           This really doesn’t look good for our little nose-picker.  

           EXCEPT THAT KENNY BULLFIGHTERS OUT OF THE WAY AND OPENS THE 
           MICROWAVE DOOR AT THE LAST POSSIBLE SECOND!!!

           The dragontula goes CRASHING inside the microwave, the door 
           CLOSING before he can recover, SHUTTING him inside.  

           DRAGONTULA POV:  Kenny WAVES at him through the smoked glass 
           and dangles the aluminum seal one last time.   

                                 KENNY
                             (muffled by the glass)
                        ... Shiny.  

           BACK TO SCENE.  Kenny hits START and climbs off the counter, 
           patting Phelps on the head as we hear the off screen... 

           SPLAT!  
           INT. LIVING ROOM -- HATCHER HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Liz clutches Kenny in her arms.  Walt is still wielding that 
           snow blower.  We hear the sounds of police and fire SIRENS 
           off in the distance.  Walt is addressing everybody...    

                                 WALT
                        ... Okay, I want everybody gathered 
                        right behind me.  We will move to 
                        the car at a brisk pace.  We will 
                        not bicker.  We will not quip. We 
                        will simply... leave.
                             (hand on door knob)
                        Okay, on three.  One... two...  

                                 KATE 
                             (suddenly)
                        Oh my God!  Shelly!  We almost 
                        forgot Shelly!  She’s in my room.  

                                 LIZ
                        Kate, wait...

           But Kate is already dashing back into --  

           INT. KATE’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Kate SEARCHES all around the room.  And then she notices: she 
           had left her window OPEN.  Shelly could have gotten outside.   

                                 KATE
                        Oh no!  Shelly!  Where are you?   

           EXT. HATCHER YARD -- NIGHT

           For a moment, we’re not sure why we are here.  We just seem 
           to be looking at a couple of ROCKS on the muddy grass.  

           Then, one of the rocks pokes out a HEAD.  Then little ARMS 
           and FEET.  And we realize, we’ve found Shelly The Turtle!  

           She has gotten through that open window and onto the lawn.  

           Shelly twists her head around, perhaps searching for any 
           threatening activity.  But the coast seems CLEAR.  Just rocks 
           and mud and a FEW GARDEN SNAILS a few feet away.  

           Shelly takes a few steps forward.  Then turns her head again.  
           Those snails have gotten just a little CLOSER.  And, to make 
           matters worse, one of them LOOKS at Shelly and --   

           BARES LARGE JAGGED FANGS!!!  
           And now it’s clear! These very frightening KILLER SNAILS are 
           inching their way towards Shelly!    

           With an INTENSE MUSIC cue.... the chase begins!   

           ON SHELLY...  

           Crawling as fast as she can (which isn’t very fast) away from 
           the snails.  

           ON THE SNAILS...  

           Going as fast as they can (which isn’t very fast) in PURSUIT.  

           BACK ON SHELLY...  

           Still crawling along the lawn, sneaking a GLANCE back at -- 

           THOSE SNAILS...  

           Maybe they’re gaining on her.  It’s actually hard to tell.  

           Thankfully, that’s when PHELPS RUNS ONTO THE SCENE!  

           He grabs Shelly in his jaws and TROTS AWAY!  Just like that.  

           The snails stare after them a while.  

           That sucked.  It’s tough being a killer snail.    

           They slowly turn, inching dejectedly back from where they 
           came.  

           EXT. FRONT WALKWAY -- HATCHER HOUSE -- NIGHT  

           Walt, hefting his snowblower, leads everybody out to the car.  
           Liz cradles a now-sleeping Kenny.  Kate is happily holding 
           Shelly.  Phelps trots along behind Jackson.  

                                 WALT
                             (whispers)
                        Anybody see anything?  

           The rest of the family shakes their head... no.  

           Liz gets a little closer to Walt.  She’s recovered from her 
           ordeal and is clearly now liking this side of her husband.  

                                 LIZ
                        Honey, I forgot how commanding you 
                        can be.  And you’re very imposing 
                        with that blower.   
                                 WALT
                             (playing the role a bit)
                        Keep walking, Liz.  There’s no time 
                        for shenanigans.  

           Nobody notices, a SHADOWY FIGURE sneaking up behind them...  

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        BOO!!!!   

           The family collectively JUMPS.  Walt swings his snow blower 
           around, aiming it towards the voice.  

                                 AMELIA
                             (stepping out of the dark)
                        Whoah!  Easy there, commander.    

                                 JACKSON
                        Amelia?  

                                 AMELIA
                        What are you guys doing?  Like... 
                        capture the flag or something?  Can 
                        I play?  

                                 WALT
                        Young lady.  You need to run back 
                        to your house and wake your family.  
                        This community is under attack.  

                                 AMELIA
                        It’s just me and my dad.  And he’s 
                        out of town on business.  What’s 
                        going on?  Who’s attacking us?  

                                 KATE
                        Those!  Those are what’s attacking 
                        us!  

           They all look where Kate is pointing.  

           In front of them, on the path, are two of those strange 
           ROACHES (we saw when Kate turned on the light earlier).  

                                 WALT
                        Everybody!  Stay absolutely still.  
                        I don’t think they see us yet.  

           It’s true.  The roaches seem more interested in each other.  
           In fact, one hops ON TOP OF the other and LOCKS INTO PLACE.   

                                 JACKSON
                        Huh.  It kinda seems like the two 
                        of them are... 
                                 WALT
                        Don’t say it, Jackson.  

                                 AMELIA
                        ... Special friends? 

           Jackson smiles at Amelia.  Finally, somebody with his sense 
           of humor.  Annoyed, Walt turns to Amelia...  

                                 WALT
                        What did you say your name was?  

                                 AMELIA
                        Amelia Enriquez.  I live next door.  
                        Your son and I go way back.    

           As Walt weighs his response to this, MORE roaches appear, 
           joining the party.  All of them piling ON TOP OF one another.       

                                 LIZ
                        Um.  Does anybody see this?  

                                 WALT
                        What are they doing now?   
                             (to Jackson & Amelia)
                        Don’t say it, either of you.  

           As we watch the roaches, we now see they are all LOCKING INTO 
           PLACE like tiny pieces in a giant, three-dimensional PUZZLE.  

                                 KATE
                        They’re forming something.  
                        Something... bigger.  

                                 JACKSON
                        I think it’s a...   

                                 AMELIA
                        ... leg.   

           Sure enough, the roaches are all MESHING TOGETHER to form a --  

           LARGE, HORRIBLE COCKROACH LEG!  

           Realizing the implications of this, the family (and Amelia) 
           now TAKES OFF RUNNING TOWARD THE MINIVAN.  

           As they enter the car, more roaches swarm out, CONSTRUCTING 
           what is shaping up to be... 

           THE MOTHER OF ALL ROACHES!
           INT. HATCHER FAMILY MINIVAN -- NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS -- NIGHT

           Walt SPEEDS through the neighborhood, putting as much space 
           as he can between them and the still-assembling giant roach.   

                                 AMELIA
                        You think they’re going to... I 
                        mean it’s going to come after us?  

                                 WALT
                             (speeding up more)
                        Doubtful.  

                                 JACKSON
                        If it did, it would be just like 
                        that story.  

                                 KATE
                        What story?  

                                 JACKSON
                        You know.   That scary story.  The 
                        Russian guy.  He gets chased by a 
                        giant cockroach.  

                                 KATE
                        There’s no such story.   

                                 JACKSON
                        Sure there is.  

                                 WALT
                        Kids, please.  We really have 
                        bigger concerns right now.  

           EXT. WALKWAY -- HATCHER HOUSE -- NIGHT

           And is Walt ever right about that!  

           We only get a GLIMPSE of this huge, coprophagic BEAST, now 
           FULLY FORMED, as it BARRELS OFF in pursuit of the minivan!   

           INT. HATCHER FAMILY MINIVAN -- NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS -- NIGHT

           As Walt RACES the car through the neighborhood...  

                                 KATE
                        You’re thinking of “The 
                        Metamorphosis” by Franz Kafka.  The 
                        Russian guy wakes up to discover 
                        he’s turned into a giant cockroach.  
                                 JACKSON
                        No.  That doesn’t even make sense.  
                        Why would that be scary?    

                                 KATE
                        Because it’s dark and existential.

                                 JACKSON
                        It’s scary if you’re being chased 
                        by a giant bug.  Not if you are the 
                        giant bug.  Then you’re the thing 
                        that everybody else is afraid of.    

                                 KATE
                        Right!  That’s exactly right!  
                        That’s what makes it existential.      

                                 JACKSON
                        Oh, okay Miss “I-make-up-words-to-
                        sound-smart.”   

                                 AMELIA
                        Do you two always argue like this?  

                                 WALT
                        Yes.  

                                 LIZ
                        Always.  

           Jackson and Kate now turn to face the front seat.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Come on now.   That’s not true.  

                                 KATE
                        Yeah.  There’s lots of times we 
                        don’t argue. 

                                 WALT
                        Oh, please!  You guys can’t go more 
                        than ten seconds without...  

           WHAM!!!  Just at the moment we weren’t expecting it!  

           A HUGE PINCER THE SIZE OF A LAMP POST, SLAMS INTO THE CAR, 
           KNOCKING IT ACROSS THE ROAD!  

           Walt wrestles with the wheel, managing to REGAIN CONTROL and 
           STOP the car.  

           He looks through the SMASHED OPEN driver side window to see:  

           A ROACH THE SIZE OF A GREYHOUND BUS!!!
           Is CHARGING at the minivan for a second attack!!!  

                                 JACKSON
                        Dad...    

                                 KATE
                        Dad...?    

                                 LIZ
                        Walt...!?! 

                                 AMELIA
                        DRIVE!!!  

           Walt finally STOMPS on the accelerator.  The minivan SURGES 
           FORWARD at the last possible second, DODGING the attack.  

           The roach OVERSHOOTS, CRASHING into a cluster of dumpsters 
           and FLATTENING the metal bins.  

           Walt SHOOTS AWAY down the road as the gargantuan “Roid Roach” 
           rights itself and skitters after them.  

           HIGH VIEW

           The minivan blasts through the streets of Stillwater with the 
           roach gradually catching up to it and SNAPPING at its heels.  

           INSIDE THE CAR

           The kids peer through the back window as the huge, hideous 
           thing gets CLOSER and CLOSER, BELLOWING HORRIBLY as it runs.    

                                 JACKSON
                        So, Kate.  And, given our prior 
                        discussion, I really am curious 
                        about this.  Who would you rather 
                        be right now?  Us?  Or...  

                                 KATE
                        Shut up!  Just shut up!  

                                 LIZ
                             (pointing at the roach)
                        Walt.  Something’s happening!  

           She’s right.  Still pursuing them, the roach LIFTS its head 
           in the air and makes a sound like a WET, HEAVING COUGH!  

           That’s when a GEYSER of SMALL ROACHES come SPEWING OUT OF ITS 
           MOUTH and into the air, landing on the roof of the minivan!  

           The smaller roaches immediately start LOCKING TOGETHER, 
           forming a MEDIUM-SIZED ROACH (about the size of a possum).  
                                 JACKSON
                        DAD!  

           The medium-sized roach is pushing his head through the 
           smashed open driver’s side window, snapping his jaws!  

           Driving with one hand, Walt tries to SHOVE the medium-sized 
           roach back through the window with his other arm.  

           But the bug soon realizes that it is just too big to fit into 
           the car this way.  

           So he scrambles back up onto the roof, SCRAPING at the metal, 
           trying to TEAR A HOLE to get into the car.  

           As Walt desperately tries to outmaneuver the giant roach, the 
           others listen to the awful sound of CLAWS scraping on METAL.  

           They watch as a SMALL HOLE opens up in the roof, giving them 
           a look at the roach up there.  It SNEERS down at them.  

                                 LIZ
                        Walt! You have to shake it off!  

                                 WALT
                             (pointing at the big one)
                        I’m still worried about him!  

           But he obliges, TWISTING the steering wheel back and fourth 
           while still trying to evade the giant roach.   

           As the car SWERVES, the possum-sized roach hangs onto the 
           roof for dear life.  But then it gets an idea... 

           Its features begin to SQUIRM and WIGGLE as it now UNLOCKS, 
           turning BACK into HUNDREDS of the smaller roaches!  

           The small roaches pour through the hole and INTO THE CAR!  

                                 AMELIA
                        They’re in!  They’re coming in!  

                                 KATE
                             (taking off a shoe)
                        Squash them!  Before they form back 
                        together!  

           She takes aim at two roaches that are trying to lock together 
           and... WHAM, WHAM, WHAM... clobbers them with her sneaker.  

           From the looks of this, her incident with the leech must have 
           severely softened her stance against bug violence.  
           And it seems to work.  Both roaches CRUMBLE and drop 
           lifelessly to the floor of the car.  

           Jackson and Amelia stare at Kate.  Very impressed...  

                                 JACKSON
                        Jeez.  

                                 AMELIA
                        Nice.  

           Then, they pull off their own shoes and get to work, SMASHING 
           AT the ever-growing number of roaches.  

           Walt continues his heroic driving as his family climbs over 
           and around him, smashing at the frenzied roaches.  

           Even Liz, holding Kenny protectively, makes a few squeamish 
           attempts with her slipper as Phelps BARKS helpfully.   

           Catching a glimpse of a sexy TOE RING on Amelia’s BARE FOOT, 
           Jackson is momentarily DISTRACTED.  But then he gets back to 
           business, slamming away at the bugs for all he’s worth.  

           Yet for every one roach they kill, five more are flooding 
           inside the car and LOCKING TOGETHER.  It looks hopeless.  

           But then...  

                                 WALT
                        He stopped.  He stopped chasing us.  

           Sure enough, the giant cockroach has simply STOPPED, receding 
           in the distance as Walt continues speeding down the road. 

           And now, the remaining small roaches also seem to have picked 
           up the signal.  All as one, they ABOUT-FACE and stream BACK 
           OUT of the car, skittering off into the night.    

           The family watches in AMAZEMENT and RELIEF as the roaches all 
           simply abandon the attack.  

                                 JACKSON
                        They gave up.  They just gave up.
                             (after a moment)
                        We beat them.  

           The family registers these words...    

           And then, everybody begins CHEERING and HIGH-FIVING! 

                                 LIZ
                        But why?  Why did they just stop?  
                                 KATE
                        We must have gotten them too far 
                        away from the nest.    

                                 WALT
                        The nest?  What do you mean?  

                                 KATE
                        Most animals, even bugs, like to 
                        stay close to home.  So they can 
                        protect their young.    

                                 WALT
                        Their... young?  

                                 JACKSON
                        Who cares!  We’re safe!  We did it!  
                             (to Amelia)
                        You were awesome!  

                                 AMELIA
                        You were awesome!  

           Carried away, Jackson & Amelia share a BIG KISS!  Then Amelia 
           pulls away... surprised she enjoyed that as much as she did.  

                                 LIZ
                             (to Walt)
                        I think you were pretty awesome!  

           It’s the first TRULY JOYOUS moment for our family.  And quite 
           well-deserved.  Just one problem...  

           Everybody is so busy CELEBRATING that no one sees: 

           THE LARGE DRAGONTULA!

           SWOOPING IN next to the driver’s side window!  

           It SPITS its WEBBING right into the car, directly at --  

                                 KATE
                        PHELPS!!!!  

           Before anybody can get it together, Phelps has been SNAGGED 
           by the webbing!!!  

           THE DOG IS THEN LIFTED UP AND AWAY, HIGH INTO THE AIR BY THE 
           DRAGONTULA’S WEBBED NET!  

           Phelps looks down at his family, rather sheepishly, as the 
           flying insect carries the poor dog away into the night.  

           And off of Phelps’ despairing HOWLS --  
           EXT. HIGHWAY -- NIGHT

           The family (and Amelia) drives in awful SILENCE.  No 
           bickering.  No name-calling.  Kenny sleeps in Liz’s lap.    
           Even Shelly The Turtle seems depressed as she pokes her head 
           out of her shell, looks around, then retreats back inside.  

                                 WALT
                        ... We’re safe.  That’s the most 
                        important thing.          

           Nobody bothers to respond to this.  

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        Next exit we’ll stop.  We’ll get 
                        help.  He might still be okay.  

           He obviously doesn’t believe that.  But nobody even bothers 
           to call him out on it.  More dreadful SILENCE.  

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        I mean, Phelps is no pushover.  
                        Remember what he did to those sofa 
                        cushions? That took strong teeth.   

                                 JACKSON
                        You don’t need to act like you’re 
                        upset, Dad.  We know you never 
                        liked him.  

                                 WALT
                        Why would you even say that, 
                        Jackson?  Of course I like Phelps.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Really?  Could have fooled me.  

                                 WALT
                        What are you talking about?  I 
                        loved that dog.  He was a perfectly 
                        lovely, lovable dog.  

                                 KATE
                        I’ll bet he didn’t know you felt 
                        that way.  And now he never will.  

                                 WALT
                        He’s a dog.  What should I have 
                        done?  Written him a sonnet?  

                                 KATE
                        You didn’t pet him.  You didn’t 
                        walk him.  You didn’t talk to him.  
                                 JACKSON
                        Except to yell at him for humping.  

                                 LIZ
                        I think what they’re saying, honey, 
                        is that unless he was doing 
                        something wrong, you pretty much 
                        acted like he wasn’t there.  

           Walt shoots Liz a look.  He can’t believe that she’s taking 
           their side.  

                                 WALT
                        ... I’ve been working. 

                                 KATE
                        No you haven’t.  Not for a while.  

                                 WALT
                        Trying to find work is work.    

                                 JACKSON
                        What about trying to find excuses?  
                        Is that work?  

                                 LIZ
                        Or rolling your eyes and feeling 
                        sorry for yourself?  Is that work?   

                                 KATE
                        Or being distant and sarcastic and 
                        short-tempered all the time?  That 
                        takes a lot of work, right?  No 
                        wonder you didn’t have time to talk 
                        to him.  

                                 JACKSON
                        ...Or play ball with him.  

                                 LIZ
                        ...Or scratch his belly when he 
                        wanted a little affection.  

           Walt sputters a bit, not sure how to respond to this assault.  

                                 AMELIA
                        Okay, I’m just catching up here.  
                        But you guys aren’t talking about 
                        the dog anymore, are you?    

           Walt stews for another moment.  And then, suddenly, he pulls 
           the car over and STOPS it on the shoulder of the road.  

           Without further comment, he EXITS the car and SLAMS the door.  
           EXT. SHOULDER OF THE ROAD -- NIGHT

           The Honey-Fresh facility is just barely visible on that high 
           hill off in the distance.  

           Walt stares up at it.  Lost in thought.  

           After a few moments he is joined by Liz.  This should feel 
           reminiscent of the very first time we met these two.  

                                 LIZ
                        Honey?  I’m sorry about that.  It 
                        was unfair of us.  

           Walt doesn’t respond right away.  He just keeps looking off 
           in the distance.  But then...  

                                 WALT
                        No it wasn’t.  You were right.  All 
                        of you.  You were absolutely right.  
                        I haven’t been there.  Not for 
                        Phelps.  Not for any of you.  

                                 LIZ
                        Not until tonight.  Tonight you 
                        were there.  In a big way.   

                                 WALT
                        I guess I didn’t realize it until I 
                        was being chased through those 
                        woods, thinking I might never see 
                        any of you again.  
                             (beat)
                        That fear.  That sense of real 
                        loss.  Not just money.  Or jobs. Or 
                        houses.  But things that actually 
                        matter.  That woke me right up.     

                                 LIZ
                        Sometimes, they say that’s what 
                        needs to happen.  

                                 WALT
                        It took the smartest insects in the 
                        world to show me how stupid I 
                        really am.   

                                 LIZ
                        You’re not stupid.  You were just 
                        anxious about the wrong things.  

           Walt looks at her.  Takes her hand.  A nice moment.  They 
           stand there like this, hand in hand, staring together at the 
           Honey-Fresh facility.  And then...  
                                 WALT
                        Liz?  

                                 LIZ
                        Yes, sweetheart.  

                                 WALT
                             (points to the facility)
                        That’s their nest.  It’s where they 
                        took Phelps.  I’m sure of it.           

                                 LIZ
                        ... What are you saying?          

                                 WALT
                        I think you know what I’m saying.    
                             (beat)
                        Phelps is part of my family.  And 
                        nobody messes with my family.

           Liz regards Walt for a LONG MOMENT.  But then...  

                                 LIZ
                        Walt, I can’t let you do this...
                             (after a moment)
                        Alone.  Because those things were 
                        really starting to piss me off too.  

                                 JACKSON (O.S.)
                        Hey, I wasn’t so crazy about them 
                        either.  

           Liz and Walt turn to see that Jackson, Amelia, and Kate 
           (holding Kenny) are walking over to join them.  Kate has a 
           new gleam in her eyes...  

                                 KATE
                        We’ll need more croquet mallets. 
                        Ones with a little more heft. 

                                 AMELIA
                        You can count me in.  Long as 
                        you’ve got some kind of a plan.      

                                 WALT
                        I do.  I have a plan.  There’s some 
                        stuff we need to... build.    

           Which is when Kenny opens his eyes and SHOUTS...  

                                 KENNY
                        NO MORE TALK!  GET PHELPS NOW!    

           As the Hatchers stare at Kenny in total AMAZEMENT, we go to --  
           A SET OF KEYS.  

           We recognize them as Buff’s keys that Walt found earlier.  
           They TURN a lock, opening doors to --   

           INT. “KITCHEN SINK” HARDWARE STORE -- NIGHT

           Walt, Amelia, and the rest of the family rush into the store 
           with purpose.  They begin GRABBING items off the shelves.  

                                 WALT
                        ... Tarps, tents, rain gear...  
                        anything labeled as water proof 
                        should do the trick.  

                                 JACKSON
                             (going through a shelf)
                        What about these pool toys?  

                                 WALT
                        Yes.  Perfect.  

           Kate has grabbed an ALUMINUM BAT and is taking practice 
           swings with it.  Between the leech and the roaches, Kate has 
           definitely forgotten all her concerns about karma...  

                                 KATE
                        In terms of melee items, this bat 
                        has some good precision.  But a 
                        nice, thick socket wrench might 
                        pack more of a wallop.  

                                 WALT
                        Kate, the whole point of this plan 
                        is to stay out of danger and avoid 
                        direct combat.  

                                 KATE
                             (clearly disappointed)
                        Oh.  Right.  
                             (beat; pointing)
                        So I shouldn’t take that chain saw?  

                                 WALT
                             (after a moment)
                        ... Take the chain saw.  

           Kate brightens as she piles about six different chain saws 
           into her cart.  

           Amelia has located a display of PELLET GUNS.  She grabs one, 
           expertly LOADING it and taking aim...  
                                 AMELIA
                        What about longer-range weapons?  

                                 LIZ
                             (re: guns)
                        Are those things real?  

                                 AMELIA
                        They’re just pellet guns.  But this 
                        Tac Elite still has some decent 
                        range... and stopping power for 
                        anything under twenty-five pounds.  
                        I could probably jury-rig it with 
                        the night scope from this 77K. 

           Jackson watches Amelia with utter ADORATION as she deftly 
           handles the different fire-arms.  His cup runneth over.  

                                 JACKSON
                        So... you’re into guns?  

                                 AMELIA
                        Yup.  On weekends, I like to put on 
                        my bikini and head on down to the 
                        shooting range for target practice. 

                                 JACKSON
                        You’re messing with me now, right?  

                                 AMELIA
                        ... Maybe you’ll come with me some 
                        time.  Find out for yourself.    

           Meanwhile, Walt throws COILS of GARDEN HOSING into his cart.  
           It lands next to those professional FUMIGATION TANKS (labeled 
           with skull and crossbones) that Buff pointed out earlier.  

           As he works, Walt catches Liz looking at him with a strange, 
           happy SMILE.  

                                 WALT
                        What?  

                                 LIZ
                        Nothing.  It’s nothing, really.  

                                 WALT
                        Then why are you smiling?  

                                 LIZ
                        It’s just... been a while since we 
                        all went shopping together.   

           As the two of them share this weirdly nice moment -- 
           INT. LIVING ROOM -- DWEEBS’ HOUSE -- NIGHT

           The Dweebs’ house is dark and quiet now.  As far as we can 
           tell, all the moths have left the premises.  Then -- 

           Walt and the rest of the family BURST in through the door.  

                                 WALT
                        ... Look for something with wings.  
                        At least one of them needs to fly.   

           As Walt sorts through a box of JOYSTICK REMOTES, the rest of 
           the family unlocks and OPENS the Junkbot cages.  

           As Kate inspects the junkbots, she is surprised by a sudden 
           muffled VOICE coming from inside one of the cages.   

                                 DUSTIN (INSIDE CAGE)
                        Help!  We’re stuck!  

           The dweebs, Dustin & Nicholas, have CRAMMED themselves inside 
           a cage to hide from the moths.  As Kate helps them out...

                                 NICHOLAS
                        ... Are they gone?  

                                 DUSTIN
                        Just get off me, Nicholas.  I never 
                        want to be this close to you again.      

           Walt approaches them.  He’s not mincing words...     

                                 WALT
                        Okay, here’s the deal.  Those bugs 
                        that came after you?  They took our 
                        dog.  We’re getting him back.  And 
                        we’ll need to borrow some of your 
                        junkbots to do it.  Preferably one 
                        that can go airborne.  Are we cool?   

           Jackson turns to Kate with a look of disbelief.  Neither of 
           them are used to seeing their dad like this... 

                                 JACKSON
                        “Are we cool?”  

           The dweebs glance at each other.  A look of agreement.  Then -  

                                 DUSTIN
                        Demonhawk.  Demonhawk is a flyer.  

                                 NICHOLAS
                        Also, you should probably check 
                        down in our basement.  
                                 AMELIA
                        What’s in your basement?  

                                 DUSTIN
                        Before we got into junkbots, we 
                        used to play a lot of paintball.    

                                 NICHOLAS
                        We’ve still got our old equipment.  
                        Boots, fatigues, lightweight body 
                        armor... stuff like that.  

           A moment.  Then, off of Walt’s RAISED EYEBROW --  

           EXT. FRONT WALKWAY -- DWEEBS’ HOUSE -- NIGHT

           DECKED OUT in ultra-slick CAMO GEAR and BOOTS and GLOVES, the 
           ENTIRE FAMILY struts back to the minivan in FORMATION!   

           ON WALT.  In the center of things.  DETERMINATION in his eyes 
           that we haven’t seen there before.  

           ON LIZ.  Looking surprisingly imposing, next to her husband. 

           ON KATE.  Walking heavily, holding a socket wrench in one 
           hand and Shelly in the other.  

           ON JACKSON.  Turning his head every few seconds to OGLE --  

           AMELIA.  Who is rocking some tight, black NIGHT CAMO with her 
           hair pulled back, hefting that pellet gun.  

           ON KENNY.  Toddling along like a miniature bad-ass.  

           And now we WIDEN to REVEAL, the family is FLANKED by --  

           DUSTIN & NICHOLAS!  

           Using joysticks to control the two junkbots crawling along 
           next to them, including a newly-repaired Silverhook.   

           Hovering in the air above them like a miniature helicopter is 
           the awesome-looking robot bird of prey: DEMONHAWK.   

           If you’ve been counting, that makes for a clean DIRTY DOZEN,  
           ready for battle.  

           We almost feel a little sorry for those poor bugs.  

           Almost.  

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           EXT. FRONT ENTRANCE -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           BINOCULARS POV:  Scanning across the grounds of the facility.  
           But all is quiet and still.  The only source of movement is -- 

           SILVERHOOK

           The junkbot is rolling up the high hill towards the facility.  
           Something is hanging from his silver hook.  Strangely enough, 
           it is that Elmo-style, singing DOLL we saw in Kenny’s bed.   

           EXT. BUSHES -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           Kate, hidden in some BUSHES a safe distance from the high 
           hill, lowers the binoculars and adjusts her HEADSET MIKE...  

                                 KATE
                             (into headset)
                        This is perimeter one.  Silverhook 
                        is nearing position.  I repeat.  
                        Silverhook is nearing position.  

                                 WALT (ON KATE’S HEADSET)
                        Any sign of the crickets?  

                                 KATE
                        Negative.  Nothing whatsoever.  

                                 WALT (ON KATE’S HEADSET)
                        Okay.  Perimeter two?  Anything?  

           EXT. TREE -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           Jackson & Amelia have climbed a TALL TREE by the Honey-fresh 
           sign, overlooking the facility from a different angle.  

           Amelia squints through the scope of her pellet gun.  Jackson 
           lowers his binoculars and turns to her...  

                                 JACKSON
                        I got nothing.  What about you?  

                                 AMELIA
                        Deader than dirt.  

                                 JACKSON
                             (into headset)
                        That’s a negative, Dad.  It’s... 
                        deader than dirt.  

           Jackson sneaks another joyous glance at Amelia, loving the 
           fact that he’s with a hot girl who says things like that.   
           INT. MINIVAN -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           Lights off, the minivan is hidden on the shoulder of the 
           road, about two hundred feet away from the facility.  

           Liz sits at the wheel as Walt talks into his headset...  

                                 WALT
                        Okay.  Cue phase two.  

                                 DUSTIN (ON HEADSET)
                        Cueing phase two...  

           INT. STATION WAGON -- OTHER SIDE OF THE HILL -- NIGHT

           Nicholas controls Silverhook with a remote joystick as Dustin 
           gives him a signal.      

                                 DUSTIN
                        Do it.     

           EXT. SUNNFRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           Silverhook carefully lowers the doll so that it is “sitting” 
           on the grass.  

           That’s when we hear something.  It’s coming from the ground 
           right near Silverhook’s treads.  

           A tiny, inquisitive...

           CHIRP. 

           It’s a lone cricket!  He’s here, looking up at Silverhook and 
           acting especially adorable.  

           But the cricket’s chirping turns ANNOYED when the junkbot 
           pays him no attention.   

           The cricket hops after the junkbot, chirping quite 
           belligerently now.  

           He will not be ignored.  

           His chirps turn SHRILL and RHYTHMIC!  Like an ALARM.  

           EXT. TREE -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           AMELIA’S SCOPE POV:  In response to the chirping alarm, the 
           ENTIRE HORDE of crickets has now EMERGED out of the darkness.  
           They’re all HOPPING directly towards Silverhook!   

                                 AMELIA
                             (urgently)
                        They’re coming.  They’re coming.  
                        Now get him moving.  

           EXT. HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           Silverhook rolls slowly toward the hill.  

           As now...   

           THE ENTIRE CRICKET ARMY!!!  Hops madly after him!  

           They gain on the junkbot, approaching -- 

           KENNY’S DOLL!

           Just as the crickets hop past, THE DOLL SNAPS TO LIFE with a 
           SONG ACCOMPANIED BY JERKY ANIMATRONIC MOVEMENTS.  

                                 DOLL
                        ... We gotta grow and show that we 
                        all know you gotta care and share!      
                        You gotta care and share!  

           Intrigued by the music, the crickets STOP HOPPING after 
           Silverhook and begin migrating back towards the doll.  

           AMASSING around the doll like fans at a STADIUM CONCERT, the 
           crickets immediately pick up the MELODY of the catchy song. 

           Fighting for the best seat, the entire cricket army is soon 
           happily CHIRPING ALONG to the kiddie music.   

           INT. MINIVAN -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           Liz and Walt listen to Kate’s report.  

                                 KATE’S VOICE (ON HEADSET)
                        That did it.  They’re completely 
                        distracted.  At least for now.   

                                 WALT
                             (into headset)
                        Okay, now everybody keep your eyes 
                        open for the walkingsticks. They’re 
                        the next line of defense.    

                                 JACKSON’S VOICE (ON HEADSET)
                        I think I see ‘em!  
           EXT. HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           Seemingly innocent “sticks” and “branches” are now revealing 
           themselves as those gaunt, alien-like GIANT WALKINGSTICKS.  

           They stride across the grounds and towards the crickets, 
           aiming to check out the commotion.  

           But then, one of the walkingsticks SPOTS something back in 
           the other direction.  It lets loose a HISSING, RATTLING 
           “SCREAM” and POINTS with his branch-like “arm.”    

           The rest of the walking sticks TURN to see -- 

           Six more Junkbots.  Standing there.  “Backs” turned.  

           They stand there unmoving as the squad of walking sticks RUSH 
           towards them, hissing and bellowing.  

           It would appear that the walkingsticks have size, numbers, 
           and the element of surprise in their favor.  That is until --

           The Junkbots WHIRL AROUND to face their attackers... 

           EXTENDING THEIR NEWLY-MODIFIED CHAINSAW ARMS!

           Walkingstick limbs go FLYING as our new and improved robots 
           just cut a swathe through their attackers. 

           And, in a heightened moment that is simply one of the coolest 
           things we’ve ever seen:  

           The junkbot known as Hammerclaw LAUNCHES his metallic CLAW at 
           a walkingstick, SNAGGING him.  REELING HIM IN close.  And 
           then DECAPITATING him with one SWING of his chainsaw.  

           EXT. TREE -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           Jackson works his REMOTE JOYSTICK, operating the claw.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Yes!  Fatality.  

                                 AMELIA
                        Okay, that was awesome!  

                                 JACKSON
                        Well, we’re kind of playing to my 
                        strengths right now.  
           INT. STATION WAGON -- NIGHT

           Nicholas and Dustin are also operating joystick remotes, 
           controlling two of the junkbots.  

                                 DUSTIN
                             (into headset)
                        Excellent!  But stay in formation.  

           EXT. BUSHES -- SUNNYFRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           Kate is operating a joystick of her own.  

           And we now REVEAL that Kenny is hidden in the bushes next to 
           her.  He’s also got a joystick he’s using.  

                                 KATE
                        It’s working!  We’re totally 
                        ripping them to shreds!  

                                 JACKSON’S VOICE (ON HEADSET)
                        Nice one, sis!  

                                 KATE
                        Thanks, Jackson!  

           INT. MINIVAN -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           As they listen to the sounds of their delighted children, 
           operating the Junkbots, Liz turns to Walt... 

                                 LIZ
                        You realize we will never again be 
                        able to give the “video-games-are-a-
                        total-waste-of-time” lecture with a 
                        straight face?    

                                 WALT
                        I’d say that’s one of several 
                        lectures we’ll have to cross out of 
                        our playbook after tonight.    

                                 KATE’S VOICE (ON HEADSET)
                        Okay, guys!  Crickets and 
                        walkingsticks are both out of 
                        commission.  It’s now or never!  

                                 WALT
                        We’re on our way!  

           He nods to Liz who STARTS UP the minivan...  
           EXT. HIGH HILL -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           Lights still off, the minivan creeps down the road, turning 
           and heading up the hill towards the facility.  

           It passes the distracted crickets and the dead walkingsticks, 
           approaching the ENTRANCE DOORS and BACKING UP next to them.  

           INSIDE THE MINIVAN

           Here in the back of the minivan, Walt has connected all those 
           garden hoses to form ONE HOSE on a giant spool.  The hose has 
           been screwed into those FUMIGATION TANKS we saw earlier.   

           Walt grabs the hose and drags it around towards the entry 
           doors, where Liz is using a BOLT CUTTER to remove the chains.  
           She swings the door open for Walt as he approaches, dragging 
           the hose into the ENTRY HALL. 

                                 WALT
                             (whispers into headset)
                        We’re in.  You know what to do.   

                                 KATE (ON HEADSET)
                        On it, Dad.  Good luck! 

           EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE FACILITY -- NIGHT

           A flying junkbot, DEMONHAWK, circles the facility, carrying a 
           very large PACKAGE in his metal talons.  

           As Demonhawk flies over the VERY CENTER of the Honey-fresh 
           building he RELEASES the package.  

           It simply DROPS for a moment.  And then it... 

           BALLOONS OUT.

           Like a HUGELY, ENORMOUS PARACHUTE!!!

           If we’re looking closely we can tell its constructed from a 
           patchwork of different tents and raincoats and plastic 
           materials and is WEIGHTED DOWN on each of its corners.  

           It catches the wind underneath, continuing to EXPAND as it 
           drops.  It’s actually an amazing SIGHT.  

           And as the parachute falls into place, DRAPING over the Honey-
           fresh building we realize what they’ve done... 

           THEY’VE SUCCESSFULLY “TENTED” THE ENTIRE FACILITY!  

           Just like one might do before major FUMIGATION.  
           EXT. TREE -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           Jackson & Amelia gaze together at the eerily beautiful image.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Now it’s up to them.  

                                 AMELIA
                        So what do we do?  

                                 JACKSON
                        We wait.  And we pray.  

           After a moment...  

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        And we make out?  

                                 AMELIA
                        Sure, why not?   

           And as they lean in towards one other we head into --  

           INT. ENTRANCE HALLWAY -- FACILITY -- NIGHT

           Walt and Liz creep through the deserted corridor.  Walt drags 
           that hose along with him, finger on the trigger.    

           The place is VERY DARK with some sort of ORGANIC SLIME 
           coating the walls.  If we listen closely we can hear a 
           rhythmic PULSING.  Like a MILLION incubating HEARTBEATS.  

                                 LIZ
                        You think they’ll be okay out 
                        there?  The kids?  

                                 WALT
                        If there’s one thing I’ve learned 
                        in the last twenty-four hours, it’s 
                        that our children are a whole hell 
                        of a lot tougher than I thought.  

                                 LIZ
                        Good point.  

                                 WALT
                        Their mother too.  

                                 LIZ
                        She has to keep up with their 
                        father.    
                                 WALT
                        Well then he must be a real bad-
                        ass.     

           And that’s just when something LANDS on WALT’s NECK with 
           EXTENDED CLAWS and an angry YOWL!  

           Walt FREAKS as he tries to SHAKE whatever-it-is off of him.  
           Finally, it jumps from his neck to the ground.  It was a --  

           CAT.  

           It HISSES at both Walt & Liz.  Then it runs off to join a 
           larger pack of cats.  

                                 LIZ
                        The animals?  They’re still alive!   
                        Do you think this means?   

                                 WALT
                        We can hope.  Just keep an eye out 
                        for him.  

                                 LIZ
                        I wish we had thought to bring some 
                        of Kenny’s boogers. 
                             (off Walt’s look)
                        What?  Phelps loves them.  He’s a 
                        quirky dog.  

           INT. STAIRWELL -- FACILITY -- NIGHT

           More cats and dogs run by Walt and Liz’s feet as they trudge 
           down flight after flight of STAIRS.  

           The rhythmic pulsing has gotten LOUDER.  There is a lot more 
           of that SLIME coating the walls.  

                                 WALT
                             (into headset)
                        Perimeters.  Do you read?  

                                 KATE’S VOICE (ON HEADSET)
                        Right here, Dad.  

                                 WALT
                             (into headset)
                        Okay...  Jackson?  Jackson!?!

                                 JACKSON’S VOICE (ON HEADSET)
                             (after a moment; fumbling)
                        We weren’t doing anything...  I 
                        mean, we’re right here.  
           EXT. BUSHES -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           Kate is still scanning the grounds with her binoculars as she 
           listens to Walt on her headset.     

           BINOCULARS POV:  The crickets are still chirping away to that 
           doll as the Junkbots stand over the fallen walkingsticks. 

                                 WALT (ON KATE’S HEADSET)
                        ... Okay.  We’re going down pretty 
                        deep.  We could lose you for a...  

           We remain in BINOCULAR POV as Walt’s voice starts to cut out.    

                                 KATE (O.S.)
                             (into headset)
                        Dad?  Dad are you there... Dad?     

           And that’s just when...  

           BINOCULARS POV:  EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF ONE OF THOSE BLEACH 
           LEECHES AS IT JUMPS IN FRONT OF KATE’S BINOCULAR LENSES!!!   

           BACK TO SCENE.  

           The leech has POPPED UP right next to Kate and is trying to 
           ADHERE to her with desperate SUCKING sounds! 

           This looks like a fight Kate is LOSING until -- 

           BANG!  The leech EXPLODES all over Kate.  Drenching her for a 
           second time in disgusting GUTS and INNARDS. 

           EXT. TREE -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           Having just made the kill shot that saved Kate, Amelia looks 
           up from her pellet gun.  

                                 AMELIA
                        Direct hit.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Yeah.  Bullseye.  

                                 AMELIA
                             (turns to him; stoic)
                        Unless you’re shooting at 
                        concentric circles on a paper 
                        target you say, “direct hit.”  

                                 JACKSON
                             (lost in love)
                        Got it.  Direct hit.  
           INT. CORRIDOR -- FACILITY -- NIGHT

           The PULSING sound is now much LOUDER as Walt and Liz hurry 
           down a corridor leading to --

           INT. LAB -- FACILITY -- CONTINUOUS

           The entire ROOM is a loathsome HIVE of FERTILIZER and DIRT 
           COLUMNS and some kind of insulating SLIME.  

           Just Google images of insect EGG CHAMBERS and think way, way 
           BIGGER!  

           Thousands of THROBBING, DISGUSTING EGG SACKS can be seen 
           JUTTING OUT from the columns.  

           The CREATURES inside the sack are nearing maturation as they 
           MOVE AROUND, trying to escape from their translucent wombs.   

                                 WALT
                        I guess this answers the question.  

                                 LIZ
                        What question?    

                                 WALT
                        Whether or not they can reproduce.     

           But, that’s when -- 

           SOMETHING POKES WALT FROM BEHIND!

           It’s Oliver!  The homeless man who saved Walt earlier!   

           He’s STUCK between the insulating slime and the wall... only 
           able to move his arms slightly.  But he is STILL ALIVE!    

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        Oliver!  

           Oliver tries to say something... but he’s clearly very weak, 
           and the sheets of slime are MUFFLING his voice.  

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        Oliver!  We’ll get you out of 
                        there.  

           As Walt turns to examine the slime, he now sees that it also 
           imprisons Buff from the hardware store and several other 
           PEOPLE... including Ted, that biker we saw get snagged.  

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        Buff!  Ted!  You’re still alive!  
                                 LIZ
                        Wow.  We live in Stillwater for one 
                        day, you make more friends than 
                        you’ve ever had in your entire 
                        adult life.  

           The other prisoners call soundlessly for help as Walt 
           attempts to TEAR the sheet of slime off of the wall.

                                 WALT
                        Liz.  I’ll take care of these guys.  
                        Use the gas on the eggs.    

                                 LIZ
                        Gotcha.  

           As Walt gets to work freeing the prisoners, Liz approaches an 
           egg sack and points the hose at it.  She releases the VALVE 
           and DOUSES it with GAS.  

           Seeing her do this, Oliver’s eyes go WIDE.  He seems to be 
           SHOUTING something... but Walt still can’t understand him.  

                                 WALT
                        Oliver.  Just hang on.  

           Meanwhile, Liz watches as the thing inside that sack begins --

           SCREAMING and TWISTING and THRASHING around in the throngs of 
           an agonizing death.  

           Finally, the sack goes STILL and SILENT.  

           Liz approaches it tentatively, just to make sure it really is 
           dead.  That’s when the sack suddenly --  

           DEFLATES IMPLOSIVELY (like a balloon)!  

           Liz JUMPS BACK in surprise.  Her FOOT gets CAUGHT in the gas 
           hose and she --

           FALLS BACKWARDS!   

           Twisting her foot.  Landing awkwardly in some EGG SACKS.  

           Before she can catch her breath, the creatures inside those 
           egg sacks go into a FRENZY OF MOTION!  CLAWING and GRABBING 
           at her hair through the embryonic skin of the sacks!!!  

                                 LIZ
                        Walt!  Help!   

           Walt rushes over to Liz just as Oliver gets loose from under 
           the slime and frantically shouts...  
                                 OLIVER
                        DON’T KILL THEM YET!  SHE’LL KNOW!  
                        SHE’S GOING TO KNOW!!!  

           But it’s too late.  

           As Walt wrestles Liz out of the egg sacks, the creatures 
           inside the sacks are already starting to WRITHE and DIE.  

           Egg sacks all around them are DEFLATING implosively.  

           EXT. BUSHES -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           An ENRAGED, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM pierces the night, causing 
           Kate to lower her binoculars.    

           The scream could be coming from several miles away.  Could be 
           closer.  But it’s pretty obvious what it means...    

                                 JACKSON (ON HEADSET)
                        That did not sound happy.   

                                 KATE
                        Something is coming!  We’ve got to 
                        warn them!  
                             (into headset)
                        Dad!  Come in!  You need to hurry!  
                        Dad!?!

           EXT. TREE -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           Jackson listens to his headset as Amelia uses her rifle scope 
           to scan the grounds.  

           Meanwhile, the ladybug’s screams are getting louder and 
           closer by the second.  

                                 KATE (ON JACKSON’S HEADSET)
                        I still can’t get through.   

                                 AMELIA
                        Jackson!  Look!    

           Jackson turns to look where she’s pointing -- 

           The ENTIRE HILL leading up to the facility is now SWARMING 
           with the slurpie-suckie BLEACH LEECHES.    

                                 JACKSON
                        They figured it out!  They’re 
                        coming for us!  
           INT. STATION WAGON -- NIGHT

           Dustin and Nicholas have a bird’s eye view as the hundreds of 
           bleach leaches emerge from out of the ground.  

                                 DUSTIN
                        Bring the junkbots into position!  

           BUT THAT’S WHEN, SEVERAL DRAGONTULAS APPEAR OUTSIDE THE CAR.  
           THE BUGS ALL BEGIN THROWING THEMSELVES AGAINST THE WINDOWS.  

                                 NICHOLAS
                        Dustin, we’ve got bigger problems!  

                                 DUSTIN
                             (starting the car)
                        Screw this!  We’re outie.    

                                 NICHOLAS
                        But they’re a family.  We can’t 
                        just leave them here.  

                                 DUSTIN
                        Sure we can.  They’re not our 
                        family.  And they’re kind of 
                        annoying.    

                                 NICHOLAS
                        ... I meant the junkbots.  

           The station wagon TAKES OFF, the dragontulas in pursuit... 

           EXT. BUSHES -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS BUILDING -- NIGHT

           Kate grabs her wrench and prepares to defend herself as the 
           Bleach Leeches slurp in for the kill.   

                                 JACKSON (O.S.)
                        Kate!  Kate!  

           Kate turns to see Jackson running towards her as attacking 
           leeches EXPLODE all around him, SHOT from above.  

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Amelia’s giving us cover.  I’ll get 
                        you to the car!  Come on!  

           He grabs Kenny from Kate.  They start BOOKING towards the 
           minivan.  

           As the leeches POP-UP in their path, they just as quickly 
           BURST INTO PIECES.  Victims of Amelia’s crack shooting.  
           EXT. VAN -- ENTRANCE -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- CONTINUOUS

           The kids arrive at the van just as the tent SPLITS OPEN right 
           where those front doors are and --  

           HUNDREDS of DOGS AND CATS come racing out of the facility.  
           And right behind the animals come --    

           THE FREED HUMAN PRISONERS!  

           Oliver leads them.  We catch sight of Ted the biker and Buff 
           helping some of the weaker prisoners.    

                                 JACKSON
                        Where’s Mom and Dad?  

                                 KATE
                             (into headset)
                        Dad?  Come in.  Are you there.  

           She shakes her head to Jackson.  Nothing.  She’s hearing 
           nothing.  

           Another moment.  

           And then --  

           Walt BURSTS THROUGH those front doors!   

           And this is Walt as we’ve been waiting to see him.  A true 
           bug-slaying commando!  He’s sweaty.  Dirty.  Triumphant.  Liz 
           limps along next to him, arm around his shoulder for support.  

           And in his arms, Walt carries an absolutely delighted...  

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        PHELPS!  

           As Phelps jumps out of Walt’s arms and runs to the kids, tail 
           wagging, Oliver steps over to Walt.  

                                 OLIVER
                        The ladybug will be here any 
                        second.  
                             (re: prisoners)
                        I think I can get us to safety 
                        through the woods.  I know them 
                        better than her.  

                                 JACKSON
                        But, Dad?  What about Amelia?  

           Jackson points over at that tree where Amelia is still 
           diligently taking out the last of the leaches.  
           Walt, in full on commander mode, doesn’t take long to make a 
           decision...  

                                 WALT
                             (to Oliver)
                        Do it.  Take them through the 
                        woods.  
                             (to his family)
                        Hatchers!  Into the car!  

           The kids don’t need to be asked twice.  They jump inside as 
           Walt helps Liz into the passenger seat.  He then runs around 
           to get into the driver’s seat when he hears...  

                                 WEAK VOICE (O.S.)
                        Walt?  

           He turns to see the owner of the voice is Buff.  He’s calling 
           to Walt as Oliver leads the prisoners towards the woods.  

           When the two make eye contact, Buff smiles and makes that 
           same gesture of smashing an insect...  

                                 BUFF
                        Wham!  

                                 WALT
                             (smiling back)
                        Wham!  

           He then gets into the minivan, slamming the door and JAMMING 
           down the hill toward --    

           EXT. TREE -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           Amelia starts to climb down the tree as the minivan SCREECHES 
           to a halt next to her.  Jackson sticks his head out...  

                                 JACKSON
                        Amelia!  Come on!  

           But then, as Amelia balances tenuously on a branch --

           A BLEACH LEECH 

           Climbing its way up the tree jumps right at her, ADHERING to 
           her leg!  It causes Amelia to loose her footing.   

           She tries to catch herself.  But she’s way off balance.  She 
           drops a good TWELVE FEET to the ground below.  
           INT. MINIVAN -- TREE -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           Jackson sees Amelia’s fall and is immediately out the door, 
           rushing to help her.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Amelia!  

                                 WALT
                        Okay, I’ll go give him a hand.  
                        Everybody stay in the car.  

           But Kate is already opening the door, screaming to Jackson.    

                                 KATE
                        You help Amelia.  I’ll guard you 
                        both.  

           Phelps BARKS with alarm and jumps out after Kate.  Which 
           causes Kenny to take off after Phelps.  

                                 KENNY
                        Phelps!  I help too!  I help too!  

                                 LIZ
                        Kenny!  

           And now she’s out the door, limping towards her baby.  Walt 
           is LEFT ALONE in the minivan with Shelly.  

                                 WALT
                        Which part of “everybody stay in 
                        the car” don’t they understand?  

           He then gets out of the minivan and runs over to help.  

           EXT. TREE -- HONEY-FRESH FARMS -- NIGHT

           That white bleach leech ADHERING to Amelia’s leg is starting 
           to TURN INCREASINGLY RED as it FILLS itself with her blood.  

                                 AMELIA (O.S.)
                        Jackson!  Just do it!  

           Huddled over Amelia, Jackson uses all his strength to RIIIIIP 
           the big leech off her leg!!!   

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Owwwwww!  Mother....  

           We assume she was going to say, “Mother of God.”  But it 
           doesn’t really matter because she is cut off by the EXPLOSION 
           of INNARDS as Kate CLOBBERS the leech with her wrench.   
                                 WALT
                        Okay!  Let’s go!  Let’s go!  

           They all turn back to the minivan, ready to make a dash back 
           to the car.  

           But then they STOP DEAD in their tracks...  

           Their car is now SURROUNDED by Gunner Wasps and Dragontulas!    
           They CIRCLE but don’t attack yet.  Because that’s when -- 

           The FURIOUS LADYBUG DROPS ONTO the roof of the minivan!

           And this is our first GOOD LOOK at her...  

           By far, the freakiest, deadliest, most hideous thing we’ve 
           ever seen.  

           And now she is NOT giggling.  

           She immediately LEAPS off the roof and STOMPS toward them as 
           those lethal TALONS and BARBS extend out from her arms.  

           The family stands FROZEN as she RUSHES them in a blind rage.  
           But just before she gets to them -- 

           A HAIRY, MULTI-LEGGED FIGURE BOUNDS TOWARD HER AND...     

           JUMPS UP AT HER THROAT, PULLING HER DOWN AND ATTACKING!

           It’s that big spider!  The one from Stillwater Park.    

           The wasps now SWOOP IN, firing their stingers at the spider, 
           trying to help their queen.  

           The distraction of the wasps allows The Ladybug the 
           opportunity to GET TO HER FEET behind the spider...  

                                 JACKSON/REST OF THE FAMILY
                        Hey!  Spider, watch out!  

           The spider WHIRLS to face the attacking Ladybug...  

           But it is too late.  

           The Ladybug HAMMERS him with her TALONED arm, sending him 
           FLYING through the air and SMACKING into a tree.  

           As the spider lies there, unmoving, The Ladybug stands over 
           him with a victorious SMIRK.  

           She turns back to face The Hatchers.  Her eyes narrow with 
           menace as she opens her mouth and actually CROAKS OUT THE 
           WORDS...  
                                 LADYBUG
                        Take my family.  I take yours. 

           Then, she’s back striding towards them like DEATH INCARNATE.  

           But just as The Ladybug arrives in front of our huddled 
           family, UNFURLING that lethal ARM... 

           DEMONHAWK

           Comes SWOOPING DOWN out of the shadows of the night, diving 
           towards The Ladybug like a great, steel KAMIKAZE.  

           The Ladybug pauses, looking up, just as Demonhawk --

           TORPEDOES INTO FRAME... 

           IMPALING THE GIANT BUG RIGHT THROUGH HER CHEST!  

           She STUMBLES around for a moment.  

           Looks down in shock at the GAPING WOUND right in the middle 
           of her horrible body.  

           Then she FALLS to her “knees” with a final, dying SOUND.  

           Almost like a sad, self-pitying... 

           GIGGLE.  

           With the death of their queen, the gunner wasps and 
           dragontulas flutter around... CONFUSED.  

           Then, they simply fly off into the night.  

           Phelps BARKS after the dragontulas as he watches them go.  

           A BEAT as the family processes what has just happened.  

           Then...  

           Dustin and Nicholas step from the shadows.  Dustin holds a 
           joystick control.  

                                 NICHOLAS
                        After a lengthy discussion, we 
                        decided we should probably come 
                        back.  

                                 DUSTIN
                        You may not be our family.  But you 
                        are our neighbors.  And, given the 
                        state of the world, that needs to 
                        count for something too.  
                                 NICHOLAS
                             (rolling his eyes)
                        Oh please.  You are so preachy.  

           Meanwhile, the spider hesitantly gets to his feet and SHAKES 
           himself off like a wet dog.  

           He then trots right over to Jackson and FLOPS on his back, 
           wanting some affection ASAP.  

           The rest of the family turns to Jackson, a bit puzzled.  

                                 JACKSON
                             (explaining)
                        It’s a long story.  

           He kneels to pet the delighted spider who immediately begins 
           kicking his legs and GRUNTING happily. 

           After a moment, the rest of the gang JOINS IN.  Even Phelps 
           approaches the spider with some cautious KISSES of his own.  

           Shelly too gets in on the action, licking the spider with her 
           little turtle tongue.  

           Meanwhile, Dustin stands over the dead ladybug.  He launches 
           a victorious kick at her squishy head...     

                                 DUSTIN
                        You super insects were no match for 
                        us.  And our lethal junkbots.  

                                 WALT
                             (looking over at Dustin)
                        ... Huh.  Now that’s interesting.     

                                 KATE
                        What’s interesting?    

                                 WALT
                        The whole robot versus killer bug 
                        thing.  It’s kind of a good idea.  

                                 LIZ
                        A good idea for what?  

                                 WALT
                        I’m not really sure.  Maybe like 
                        a... toy or something?    

                                 LIZ
                        A toy?  
                                 WALT
                        Yeah.  If we could design smaller, 
                        safer junkbots.  And build some 
                        radio control bugs.   

                                 DUSTIN
                        ... Kids could stage their own mini-
                        battles.  Like junkbot wars but you 
                        could do them at home.     

                                 JACKSON
                        That is a cool idea.  I would 
                        totally play with that toy.      
                             (off Amelia’s look)
                        If I were younger.  

                                 NICHOLAS
                             (re: the ladybug)
                        She would make a pretty sweet 
                        action figure.  

                                 LIZ
                        You don’t think it would be too 
                        scary for kids?  Or too gross?    

                                 KATE
                        Kids like scary and gross.  

                                 JACKSON
                        Everybody likes scary and gross.  

                                 AMELIA
                        ... As long as it ends happily.  

           Amelia and Jackson share a sweet look.  Then they go back to 
           scratching the delighted spider.  

           CRANE UP favoring that “Honey-Fresh Family Farms” SIGN in 
           front of the facility.  It’s SPLATTERED with leech remains, 
           covering some of the letters.  

           Now it simply reads:  ONE... FRESH... FAMILY!

           And as we continue CRANING UP over the facility...

           An AMPED BOY plays with an ACTION FIGURE that has a passing 
           resemblance to our friend, Dragontula.  A VERY AMPED BOY 
           holds a toy that looks a lot like our Junkbot, Silverhook.  

                                 VERY AMPED BOY
                        He can be stopped!  Just ask

           The “Robonauts vs Megabugs” LOGO pops up on screen, while the 
           amped boys continue going at it...  

                                 VERY AMPED BOY

           The COMMERCIAL plays on a television in --  

           INT. NICE LIVING ROOM -- LOVELY HOUSE -- DAY

           It’s the same house we watched the Hatchers move into.  But 
           now they’ve transformed it, making it homey and comfortable.  

           The Hatchers.  Amelia.  The dweebs.  Buff.  Oliver.  Even Ted 
           the biker.  Everybody is here, sitting around the television 
           and watching the commercial.  
           A big bowl of POPCORN and other party foods sit on the coffee 
           table in front of them.  

                                 COMMERCIAL NARRATOR (ON TV)
                        ... Made by Stillwater toys.  The 
                        new evolution in fun.    

           Everybody cheers and high-fives!  The celebration is so 
           enthusiastic that nobody notices -- 

           A TONGUE-LIKE APPENDAGE!  

           IT RATCHETS INTO VIEW, ADHERING TO THE BOWL OF POPCORN AND 
           SNATCHING IT BACK OUT OF FRAME!    

           After a moment, Jackson absently reaches down for some 
           popcorn.  And now notices:  

           The bowl is no longer there.  

           Confused, he looks around the room.  

           And now he SEES IT! 

           His eyes get VERY, VERY BIG as we...

           A 2010 arrangement of the George Michael/Wham classic:  

           JITTERBUG (WAKE ME UP BEFORE YOU GO GO)!

           Singing along and perhaps removing our 3-D glasses, we take 
           this opportunity to check under our seat for any creepy 
           crawly critters.

           And as our singer of choice gets to the part of the song 
           where he “wants to hit that... high,” we can’t help thinking 
           that the extended falsetto note sounds an awful lot like a 
           terrified...
