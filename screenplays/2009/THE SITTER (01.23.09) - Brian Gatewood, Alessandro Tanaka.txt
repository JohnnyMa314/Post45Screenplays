           It's 10:00 PM. Do you know where your children are?

           Never raise your hands to your kids. It leaves your groin

           INT. MARISA'S BEDROOM - DAY

           The sound of SEX, as we PAN past numerous PHOTOGRAPHS of 
           MARISA LEWIS and RICKY FONTAINE from HIGH SCHOOL. Marisa is 
           GORGEOUS, and Ricky looks like a YOUNG TOM BRADY. The 
           PHOTOGRAPHS are of RICKY AND MARISA AT HOMECOMING... 

                                 GUY'S VOICE (O.C.)
                        Oh, baby, you like that? You like 
                        when I do that to you...?

           MORE PHOTOGRAPHS: RICKY IN A FOOTBALL UNIFORM CARRYING MARISA 
           IN HER CHEERLEADING OUTFIT... RICKY AND MARISA AT PROM... 

                                 GUY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                        You like when I do that to you, you 
                        bad girl... You bad, bad girl...

                                 GUY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                        Yeah... That's good, right there... 

           WE PAN PAST ALL THE PHOTOGRAPHS... And land on the Guy who 
           the voice belongs to: It is definitely NOT Ricky Fontaine. 
           It's NOAH KLEINFELD (21), a curly haired Jewish kid. 

                                 NOAH
                        Oh, that's so good... I'm a Jew so 
                        I don't even believe in Christ, but 
                        Christ that feels so good... 

           Noah stops and looks down. Marisa (21) is underneath him, her 
           eyes SHUT tight. Noah SIGHS. Marisa OPENS her eyes.

                                 MARISA
                        What's wrong?

                                 NOAH
                        Why do you always keep your eyes 
                        shut when we have sex? 

                                 MARISA
                        Why do you always keep talking when 
                        we have sex? It's like fucking a 
                        soliloquy.

           Marisa ROLLS OUT from underneath him and gets dressed. 

                                 NOAH
                        Marisa...? What are you doing?

                                 MARISA
                        I told you, I'm not feeling well. 

           Noah reluctantly dresses. He looks over at the PICTURES.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NOAH
                        You ever gonna take down these 
                        pictures of your ex-boyfriend?

                                 MARISA
                        They're not pictures of my ex-
                        boyfriend, Noah, they're pictures 
                        of my high school experience. 
                        Besides, there's pictures of you 
                        too. Look at my prom picture.

           Noah picks up the framed PICTURE of Marisa and Ricky at Prom. 
           Sure enough, IN THE BACKGROUND IS NOAH, in a powder blue tux, 
           staring forlornly at Marisa. 

                                 NOAH
                        Call me crazy, but uh, I can't help 
                        thinking you still got feelings for 
                        this guy.

                                 MARISA
                        For Ricky? He's a total asshole. He 
                        dumped me and fucked my best 
                        friend. I hate him. How can you 
                        even say that? 

                                 NOAH
                        Look, I don't want to fight. It's 
                        my fault, I've been in a shit mood 
                        lately. It's not easy getting 
                        kicked out of college, y'know?

                                 MARISA
                        You didn't get kicked out. You got 
                        suspended. You look at everything 
                        so negatively. 

                                 NOAH
                        Well, it sucks, Marisa. After 
                        Christmas break, everyone will be 
                        back at school, you'll be back to 
                        school, but me, I'll be living with 
                        my mom for the next six months. 

                                 MARISA
                             (softening)
                        I'm sorry. Is there anything I can 
                        do to make you feel better?

                                 NOAH
                        There is actually.

                                 MARISA
                        What?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        to In A Relationship.

                                 MARISA
                        That would make you feel better?

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah. 

                                 MARISA
                        Jesus, Noah, you gotta grow up.

           EXT. MARISA'S FRONT DOOR - DAY

           Marisa walks Noah out the door.

                                 NOAH
                        Sure you don't wanna come over 
                        tonight? My mom's going out. We 
                        could get Chinese. Watch a Netflix.

                                 MARISA
                        No, I'm really not feeling well.

                                 NOAH
                        Alright. I'll call you later.

           Noah kisses her, mounts his BMX BIKE and rides away. 

           EXT. BOSTON AREA - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           TITLES AND MUSIC: Over Noah riding his bike in the slushy 
           streets of this BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS SUBURB, past numerous 
           CHRISTMAS and HOLIDAY DECORATIONS. 

           EXT. NOAH'S MOM'S HOUSE - DAY

           Noah dumps his BMX bike in front of his mom's nice, suburban 
           house. END TITLES AND MUSIC.

           INT. NOAH'S MOM'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Noah ENTERS as his mom, SANDY (45), hurriedly PREPS herself 
           for a SEMI-FORMAL OCCASION. She glances at Noah as he enters.

                                 SANDY
                        You're supposed to be grounded.

                                 NOAH
                        I'm twenty one years old, you can't 
                        ground me.

                                 SANDY
                        Oh, you bet I can. You should've 
                        thought about that before you got 
                        kicked out of college. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        I didn't get kicked out, I got 
                        suspended. 

                                 SANDY
                        Were you with that girl again?

                                 NOAH
                        She's not that girl. We're in a 
                        relationship.

           Noah sinks into the couch, grabs the remote and flips on the 
           tv in one motion. He is very skilled at this.

                                 SANDY
                        Things have to change around here, 
                        Noah. You are not going to spend 
                        the next 6 months sitting on that 
                        couch. Have you started looking for 
                        a job yet?

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, mom, there's nothing out 
                        there. Don't you watch CNBC? 
                        There's a fucking a recession on--

                                 SANDY
                        Hey, hey, hey, watch the mouth!

                                 NOAH
                        Sorry.

                             (softens a bit)
                        So, how come I haven't met this gal 
                        you're in a relationship with yet? 

                                 NOAH
                        She was supposed to come over 
                        tonight, she's just not feeling 
                        well. Whatever. 

                                 SANDY
                        How do I look? And be honest.

                                 NOAH
                             (looks her over)
                        Lose the scarf. It's too busy.

                                 SANDY
                        Really? Thanks. The Polk's are 
                        introducing me to a surgeon at this 
                        party tonight. Mrs. Polk thinks 
                        we're really going to hit it off!

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Let's just hope he doesn't turn out 
                        to be a loser like the others. 

                                 SANDY
                        From your lips to God's ears, 
                        kiddo. 

           Sandy kisses him and EXITS. Noah turns up the volume on the 
           tv-- ESPN, Sports Center. We see RICKEY FONTAINE'S FACE come 
           up on SCREEN. He's being interviewed by KIRK HERBSTREIT.

                                 KIRK HERBSTREIT
                        So, Ricky, growing up in Boston you 
                        led your high school to a state 
                        football championship. Now, you 
                        have a chance to lead Boston 
                        College to a national championship 
                        in the Fiesta Bowl. How does it 
                        feel to be a hometown hero?

                                 RICKY FONTAINE
                        Kirk, as a Christian, I've got my 
                        faith to guide me on the field...

           Noah, disgusted, changes the channel. The HOUSE PHONE RINGS. 

                                 SANDY (O.C.)
                        Noah, can you please get the phone!

           Noah looks at the phone, it's right next to him.

                                 NOAH
                        I'm busy! 

                                 SANDY (O.C.)
                        No you're not!

                                 NOAH
                        Yes I am! I'm looking for a job!

           Noah goes back to the tv. The phone continues to ring. Just 
           then Sandy HURRIES in the room, changed and ready to go. 

                                 SANDY
                        Really, Noah, can't you do your 
                        mother one little favor...
                             (answers phone)
                        Hello...? Yes, Linda, how are you? 
                        I'm so excited for tonight...! 
                        Oh...? Is that so...? No, it's fine 
                        ... A rain check, sure... Bye now. 

           Sandy hangs up the PHONE, she looks SUPREMELY DISAPPOINTED. 
           She SLUMPS on the COUCH next to Noah, defeated. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Well, lucky for that babysitter. If 
                        my memory serves me correctly, 
                        those two Polk kids are freaks.

           Sandy looks up at him, staring. Her mind WORKING.

                        You need to start earning some

                        I'm twenty one years old. I'm not 
                        babysitting!

                        You take what you can get. Don't 
                        you watch CNBC, kiddo? There's a 
                        fucking recession on.

                                 NOAH
                        No, Mom, come on! 

                                 SANDY (ON PHONE)
                        Hi, Linda? It's Sandy. Guess what? 
                        I know a great babysitter... You 
                        bet he's available. And he'd love 
                        to step in. 

           HOLD ON Noah in complete AGONY. 

           EXT. POLK'S HOUSE - EVENING

           Noah drops his bike on the lawn and walks up the front steps. 
           RINGS the BELL. The door opens, revealing MRS. POLK (40s), 
           your average soccer mom.

                                 MRS. POLK
                        Hi, Noah! So nice to see you again. 
                        And thank you so much for filling 
                        in like this... Come in, come in...

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Noah follows her into...

           INT. POLK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The Polk home is upper-middle class. Noah sizes the place up.

                                 MRS. POLK
                        ... You're really doing us a big 
                        favor. And, I promise, this 
                        gentlemen I'm introducing your mom 
                        to tonight is wonderful. I think 
                        they're really going to hit it off!

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, let's hope so. A lot of 
                        sacrifice went into making this 
                        happen. Looooootta sacrifice.

           They reach the LIVING ROOM, where SLATER (13) is watching 
           TENNIS on television. He's an incredibly good looking kid, 
           but underneath there's a taut anxiety about him.

                                 MRS. POLK
                        This is Slater. Slater, remember 
                        Noah? He'll be babysitting you. 

                                 SLATER
                        What happened to Nancy?

                                 MRS. POLK
                        I told you, Nancy couldn't make it. 
                        Relax, Slater. Noah's is going to 
                        take good care of you. Right, Noah?

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, okay. You bet. 

                                 MRS. POLK
                        Is Clayton coming over tonight?

                                 SLATER
                        No, he's grounded. 

                                 MRS. POLK
                        You're in luck, Noah, when Slater 
                        and Clayton get together it's 
                        nothing but trouble. 

                                 SLATER
                        That's not true! Why do you say 
                        that?! You're always attacking us!

                                 MRS. POLK
                        No one's attacking you, Slater. 
                        Calm down. 

           Just then Mrs. Polk's PHONE RINGS.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Excuse me for a moment.

           Mrs. Polk leaves. Slater and Noah are left together.

                                 NOAH
                        So, uh, how old are you now?

                                 SLATER
                        Thirteen.

                                 NOAH
                        You're thirteen? What the fuck am I 
                        doing here? Why can't you babysit? 

                                 SLATER
                        Because, Dr. Bella doesn't think 
                        I'm ready to handle the extra 
                        responsibility, ok?! 

           Mrs. Polk comes back into the room.

                                 MRS. POLK
                        Ok, Noah, time to finish the tour.

           Noah follows Mrs. Polk to a STAIRCASE. She says sotto:

                                 MRS. POLK (CONT'D)
                        Ever since he started 9th grade 
                        he's been having panic attacks, 
                        just general anxiety. He takes 
                        Lexapro in the morning, a Klonopin 
                        when he needs them, and at night--

                                 NOAH
                        I'm not a nurse.

                                 MRS. POLK
                        Oh, don't worry. Slater's very good 
                        with his medication, he'll be on 
                        top of it. It's not your concern.

                                 NOAH
                        Good, because, I'm not a nurse.

           Mrs. Polk heads upstairs, Noah follows.

           INT. POLK'S HOUSE - BLITHE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           PARIS HILTON, BRITNEY SPEARS and LINDSAY LOHAN PICTURES 
           everywhere. At a desk is BLITHE (8), painting on MAKE UP. She 
           looks like a THAI PROSTITUTE. Mrs. Polk and Noah enter.

                                 MRS. POLK
                        Blithe! What did I tell you about 
                        using my make up? Put that down!

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Mrs. Polk RACES over to Blithe and begins CLEANING her face.

                                 MRS. POLK (CONT'D)
                        Remember Blithe? As you can see 
                        she's going through her whole Paris 
                        Hilton, Britney Spears phase...

           When Mrs. Polk isn't looking, Blithe looks straight at Noah 
           and LICKS HER LIPS SEDUCTIVELY. 

                                 NOAH
                        What the fu--?

                                 MRS. POLK
                        What's that, Noah?

                                 NOAH
                        No, nothing, uh... Um, hi, Blithe.

                                 BLITHE
                        Noah? That's your name? That's hot.

                                 MRS. POLK
                        It's not hot, honey, it's just his 
                        name. 

                                 BLITHE
                        It's a hot name. 

           Mrs. Polk finishes wiping off Blithe's face. Mrs. Polk stands 
           up, approaches Noah, smiles and says sotto:

                                 MRS. POLK
                        Someone's got a crush on you. 

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, wow... 

           Noah follows her out, he takes one last look at Blithe who 
           keeps staring at him seductively. Noah is FREAKED out. 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Noah follows Mrs. Polk in the hallway. 

                                 MRS. POLK
                        Okay, next stop, Rodri--

                                 NOAH
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa, there's another 
                        one? What am I Nanny McFee? 

                                 MRS. POLK
                             (chuckling)
                        I see you have your mom's sense of 
                        humor... Right this way, Noah...

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Mrs. Polk smiles and continues, Noah rolls his eyes.

           INT. POLK'S HOUSE - RODRIGO'S ROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Mrs. Polk and Noah enter to find RODRIGO (10) a fat Latin kid 
           standing in the middle of the room WAVING a LIT SPARKLER.

                                 MRS. POLK
                        Rodrigo! What did I say about those 
                        things in the house? You know 
                        better than that...

           Rodrigo doesn't respond. Mrs. Polk TAKES the sparkler, BLOWS 
           IT OUT and gives Rodrigo a look of disappointment.

                                 MRS. POLK (CONT’D)
                        Noah, this is the newest addition 
                        to our family. Rodrigo. Say hello 
                        to Noah, Rodrigo.

           Rodrigo just stares back at Noah.

                                 MRS. POLK (CONT’D)
                        We adopted him from Ecuador six 
                        months ago, he's still going 
                        through some transitions. 

           Rodrigo continues to just stare at Noah. 

                                 MRS. POLK (CONT'D)
                        I'll see your later tonight, 
                        Rodrigo. Mommy and daddy are going 
                        out for a while. Okay?

           Rodrigo doesn't answer. Mrs. Polk and Noah EXIT. Mrs. Polk 
           SHUTS the DOOR and hands Noah a HAND HELD GPS UNIT. 

                                 MRS. POLK (CONT'D)
                        Here, hold on to this. Rodrigo has 
                        a habit of running away. We sewed a 
                        GPS chip in his jacket, so that we 
                        can track him. Sort of like a Lo 
                        Jack for kids. If you can't find 
                        him, just turn this on. 

                                 NOAH
                        Great... That's... Totally normal.

           They continue down the HALLWAY and reach Dr. Polk's OFFICE. 
           DR. POLK (49), distinguished, is on the PHONE.

                                 DR. POLK (ON PHONE)
                        ... You send those x-rays over now 
                        or it's your fucking ass, got it?

                                 MRS. POLK
                        Peter, please, hurry, we're late...

           Dr. Polk FROWNS and SHUTS the DOOR in her face. Noah and Mrs. 
           Polk share an awkward moment.

                                 MRS. POLK (CONT'D)
                        Dr. Polk is head of radiology at 
                        Cambridge Memorial... This way.

           INT. POLK'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Mrs. Polk jots NOTES on a BOARD. Noah inspects the FRIDGE.

                                 MRS. POLK
                        Okay, Noah, all of our contact info 
                        is on the board and we'll be at the 
                        Boston Harbor Hotel if you need us.

                                 NOAH
                        Uh-huh...

           Dr. Polk ENTERS.

                        Oh, there you are, Peter. You 
                        remember Noah.

                                 NOAH
                        Hey...

           Dr. Polk sizes up Noah with disdain.

                                 DR. POLK
                        Yeah... Linda, you ready to go?

                                 MRS. POLK
                        Absolutely. Noah, we should be home 
                        no later than one. 

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, or even earlier would be cool 
                        too.

                                 MRS. POLK
                        Bye now, Noah.

           Dr. and Mrs. Polk leave. Noah's FAKE SMILE turns to a FROWN. 
           Noah turns around and is SURPRISED to find RODRIGO STANDING 
           THERE in the kitchen, just staring at him. 

                                 NOAH
                        Oh, uh, Rodrigo, right? What's 
                        going on, little man?

           Rodrigo REACHES for a BOTTLE OF RED WINE that's sitting on 
           the counter. Without taking his eyes off Noah, he KNOCKS the 
           bottle over. It CRASHES to the ground and SHATTERS. GLASS and 
           RED WINE EXPLODE everywhere. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 RODRIGO
                             (slight Spanish accent)
                        You should clean that up.

                                 NOAH
                        No. Fuck no. You clean it up. 

           Rodrigo turns around and walks out of the kitchen. Noah just 
           stares at him, then looks down at the mess he made.

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        Fucking weirdo... 

           Noah steps over the debris and walks out of there.

           INT. TV ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Slater watches TENNIS. Noah enters, HOPS on the couch, GRABS 
           the REMOTE CONTROL and SWITCHES the CHANNEL. 

                                 SLATER
                        Hey, I was watching that!

                                 NOAH
                        Well, now you're watching Top Chef. 
                        Speaking of which, are you hungry?

                                 SLATER
                        Yeah.

                                 NOAH
                        Me too. Why don't you go make us 
                        something to eat. 

           Slater is completely confused.

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        Hey, go make us some sandwiches. 
                        I'm starving over here. I'm a guest 
                        in your home, what kind of a host 
                        are you? Hurry up. Shoo! 

           Slater frowns, gets up and exits.

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        And clean up that mess your brother 
                        made in the kitchen!

                                 BLITHE (O.C.)
                        I kissed a girl and I liked it.

           Noah looks over to find Blithe, her face, once again, COVERED 
           in MAKE UP.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Huh?

                                 BLITHE
                        I said, I kissed a girl and I liked 
                        it! Wanna hear some gossip?

           DING DONG! The front door bell rings. Noah sighs.

                                 NOAH
                        Saved by the bell...

           He gets up and exits.

           EXT. POLK'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Noah opens the door REVEALING THREE PEPPY TEEN GIRLS.

                                 TEEN GIRL # 1
                        Hi, is Slater home?

                                 NOAH
                        Slater! You got company, you dog!

           Slater walks up. He eyes the girls nervously. 

                                 TEEN GIRL # 1
                        Hi, Slater... Um, Wendy Sapperstein 
                        is having her Bat Mitzvah tonight 
                        and she said it was okay if some 
                        boys wanted to crash it. 

                                 TEEN GIRL # 2
                        But, we only want the cute boys. 

                                 TEEN GIRL # 3
                        You want to come?

                                 SLATER
                        I can't. My parents are out so I 
                        wouldn't have a ride.

                                 TEEN GIRL # 1
                        We can totally find you a ride. 
                        Please.

                                 SLATER
                        I don't know. 

                                 TEEN GIRL # 1
                        Well, if you want to come, just 
                        text me, okay?

                                 SLATER
                        Yeah, later.

           Slater heads in as the girls leave. Noah turns to Slater. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        game.

                                 SLATER
                        What do you mean?

                                 NOAH
                        I mean, the way you handled those 
                        chicks. You got game, Clooney. 
                        Acting all cool. Just make sure you 
                        get home before one. 

                                 SLATER
                        I'm not going to Wendy 
                        Sapperstein's Bat Mitzvah.

                                 NOAH
                        Why not? I don't give a shit, 
                        Slater, you can go. I'll cover for 
                        you. Those girls want to get in 
                        your pants

                                 SLATER
                        I don't want those girls to get in 
                        my pants! I don't like how they 
                        look at me! They make me feel 
                        uncomfortable!

           Slater STOMPS off and heads back for TV ROOM. Noah yells:

                                 NOAH
                        You got yourself some real 
                        champagne problems, kid!

           Just then Noah's IPHONE RINGS. He checks the ID, it's a 
           PICTURE of Marisa. She's holding her hands up to the camera 
           as if to say: I don't want you to take my picture!

                        Hi...

           Noah can HEAR COMMOTION coming from her end.

                                 NOAH
                        Where are you?

                        I'm at a party.

                                 NOAH
                        You're at a party? I thought you 
                        were sick.

                        I was, I mean, I am, but then 
                        Tiffany called and told me about 
                        this party at the Mods, a bunch of 
                        seniors decided to stay an extra 
                        night and are throwing a bash. Do 
                        you want to come? I really want to 
                        see you.

                                 NOAH

                        Will you come?

                        Can't you just get away for like an 
                        hour or something?

                        Noah, I really want to see you. 
                        Just come for like an hour or 
                        something. 

                                 NOAH
                        Marisa, I really shouldn't. I'm

                        and she really wants some. It's a

                        I can't believe you would say that. 
                        I can't--! Go to a computer, Noah. 

           INT. BLITHE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Blithe is at her computer, when Noah BARGES in. He SNAPS his 
           fingers at her and SWOOSHES her away. He takes her spot at 
           the computer, and is disgusted to find that Blithe has been 
           watching the KIM KARDASHIAN SEX TAPE.

           Noah brings up Marisa's Facebook page and then he stops.

                        Do you see it?

           Sure enough, under Relationship Status is: IN A RELATIONSHIP. 
           Noah is obviously MOVED.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Noah grabs his coat as he's trailed by the kids. Rodrigo has 
           A LIT SPARKLER IN HIS HAND, Noah doesn't seem to notice.

                        I really don't feel comfortable 
                        with this.

                        Slater, you're gonna be fine. 
                        You're thirteen years old. Christ, 
                        when I was thirteen all I wanted 
                        was to be left alone.

                                 RODRIGO
                        Yeah, you should leave us alone.

           Noah ignores her as they all step out into the...

           GARAGE

           REVEALING A BENTLEY. Noah stops in his tracks. Smiles.

                        Yeah, you should take the car.

                        Look, Slater, relax. I'll only be 
                        gone for like an hour or something.

                                 RODRIGO
                        Yeah, like an hour or something.

           Noah opens the door and starts searching for the KEYS.

                                 NOAH
                        Where are the keys?

                        Dad would be really mad if he found 
                        out you took his car.

                                 RODRIGO
                        They keep the keys right there.

           Rodrigo POINTS to a BOX. Noah goes to it, finds the KEYS.

                                 SLATER

           Noah STOPS when he NOTICES that Slater is HYPERVENTILATING 
           and starting to have a FULL BLOWN PANIC ATTACK. SLATER DIGS 
           in his POCKET, PULLS his HAND out and PILLS SPILL ALL OVER.

                        My Klonopin! My Klonopin!

           Slater gets DOWN ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES. Noah, in awe, 
           watches him SCRAMBLE. Noah looks at Blithe.

                                 NOAH
                        What the hell's his problem?!

                        He's having a panic attack. 

           Rodrigo starts to STOMP on any PILLS he can find.

                                 SLATER
                        No, Rodrigo! Stop! Not my Klonopin!

                        Yeah, your Klonopin!

                                 BLITHE
                        I dunno. Usually my mom or Nancy or 
                        Dr. Bella takes care of him.

           Slater is now trying to PRY OPEN a METAL DRAIN on the FLOOR.

                                 SLATER
                        Some fell in! Help! My Klonopin!

                        He's about 30 seconds away from 
                        calling Dr. Bella.

                        Face it, Noah, you're either going 
                        to have to take us with you, or 
                        stay home.

           HOLD ON Noah WATCHING Slater GRAB a PAPER BAG and start 
           BREATHING INTO IT.

           Noah is driving. Blithe sits shotgun. Slater and Rodrigo are 
           in the back. Noah EYES Slater. Noah is REALLY PISSED at him. 
           He NOTICES that Slater is fiddling with a FANNYPACK.

                                 NOAH
                        Are you wearing a fannypack?

                        Yeah, he's wearing a fannypack.

                                 NOAH
                        Are you purposely trying to make 
                        yourself look like a fucking dork?

                        What the hell do you need those 
                        pills for anyway?

                                 SLATER
                        Because, I've got issues, okay? 

                                 NOAH
                        What issues could you possibly 
                        have? You look like a Gap model. 
                        When I was your age I had a mouth 
                        full of braces and a face like a 
                        Papa John's Pizza. Those are some 
                        real fucking issues. 

                                 BLITHE
                        Why did you get kicked out of 
                        college?

                                 NOAH
                        Huh? I didn't get kicked out. I got 
                        suspended.

                                 SLATER
                        What's the difference?

                                 NOAH
                        The difference is you get kicked 
                        out for like, making a racial slur, 
                        or trying to date rape a freshman. 
                        All I did was cheat on a paper. How 
                        did you know about that anyway?

                        Your brother. Rodrigo! Where the 
                        fuck is he?

                                 SLATER
                        I don't know. I guess he left.

                                 NOAH
                        Where?

                                 SLATER
                        I don't know. I was texting my 
                        friend Clayton.

                                 NOAH
                        Well, which way did he head?!

                                 SLATER
                        I don't know! I was texting my 
                        friend Clayton! 

           Noah suddenly remembers the GPS HANDSET. He takes it out, 
           turns it on... IT BEGINS TO BEEP....

                                 NOAH
                        You two, do not move.

           Noah starts to follow the GPS HANDSET and heads for a nearby 
           restaurant-- CHEZ BRIGITTE, right across from the Wal-Mart.
           INT. CHEZ BRIGITTE - NIGHT

           Noah enters this POSH restaurant. He's holding the GPS 
           HANDSET, which continues to BEEP. The MAITRE' D approaches.

                                 MAITRE D
                        May I help you, sir?

                                 NOAH
                        I'm just looking for someone.

           Noah brushes past him, FOLLOWING the GPS, down the back 
           CORRIDOR, until the BEEPING gets more rapid as he reaches... 

           THE MEN'S ROOM

           Noah enters the Men's Room. It's empty. Then a TOILET FLUSHES 
           and a door to a STALL OPENS. Rodrigo steps out.

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        There you are!

                                 RODRIGO
                        I dropped a bomb.

                                 NOAH
                        Dropped a bomb, huh? That's cute. 
                        That's real cute. Wash your hands.

           Rodrigo goes to wash his hands, but while he rinses them he 
           doesn't take his eyes off of Noah. 

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        What? What is it--?

           KABLOOM!!!!! The TOILET Rodrigo was using EXPLODES! WATER 
           SHOOTS UP like a GEYSER! A FIRE ALARM BELL RINGS LOUDLY. 

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        Holy fuck!

           INT. CHEZ BRIGITTE - MAIN RESTAURANT - SECONDS LATER

           Noah DRAGS Rodrigo out of there as the EMERGENCY SPRINKLER 
           RAINS DOWN on confused restaurant CUSTOMERS.

                                 NOAH
                        What the fuck did you do?!

                                 RODRIGO
                        I dropped a bomb!

                                 NOAH
                        What the hell did you do that for?!

           They get intercepted by the Maitre' D. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MAITRE D
                        What is going on back there?

                                 NOAH
                        I, uh... I dunno... 

           Noah RUNS past him, PULLING Rodrigo with him. 

                                 MAITRE D
                        Hey! You! Come back here!

           But Noah and Rodrigo are already OUT the door.

           INT. BENTLEY - NIGHT

           Noah DRIVES FAST, still FREAKED out, while Rodrigo sulks 
           shotgun. Slater and Blithe sit in the back.

                                 RODRIGO
                        How did you find me?!

                                 NOAH
                        How did I find you? Your fucking 
                        parents put a chip in your jacket. 

                                 RODRIGO
                        Then next time I leave the jacket 
                        in the car!

                                 NOAH
                        No! Fuck no! There's no fucking 
                        next time, you hear me? You try to 
                        run away again, I'll break both 
                        your fucking legs! What did you use 
                        to blow up that toilet?

                                 RODRIGO
                        I used a Cherry Bomb.

                                 BLITHE
                        Rodrigo's really into firecrackers.

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, no shit! You got any left?

                                 RODRIGO
                        No, that was my last one. Can we 
                        buy some more, please?

                                 NOAH
                        Can we--? No we can't buy some 
                        more! What are you? FUCKING 
                        RETARDED?!

                                 RODRIGO
                        Yeah, kinda.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NOAH
                        Huh? What do you mean?

                                 BLITHE
                        Rodrigo has a really low IQ. Me and 
                        Slater have above average IQ's but 
                        Rodrigo has a low one, because his 
                        mommy smoked crack when he was in 
                        her tummy.

                                 RODRIGO
                        Yeah, my mommy smoked crack when I 
                        was in her tummy.

                                 SLATER
                        He's developmentally challenged.

                                 NOAH
                        Oh... So, I guess... You kinda are 
                        retarded.

                                 RODRIGO
                        Yeah, kinda.

                                 NOAH
                        Well, um, you know, don't sweat it, 
                        uh... I was developmentally 
                        challenged too. I didn't grow hair 
                        on my balls til I was like fifteen.

                                 BLITHE
                        That's hot!

           Noah ignores her and TURNS UP THE RADIO.

           EXT. THE ZAKIM BRIDGE - NIGHT

           The Bentley races across this famous BRIDGE and heads towards 
           the bright, twinkling, lights of the CITY of BOSTON.

           EXT./INT. BENTLEY - NIGHT

           The Bentley pulls up to the curb in a quiet neighborhood 
           street. Noah cuts the engine. He turns to the kids. 

                                 NOAH
                        Okay, I gotta go, uh, pick up some 
                        candy for my girlfriend. You guys 
                        wait here and watch Rodrigo. You 
                        understand me?

                                 SLATER
                        How long are you gonna be?

                                 NOAH
                        I'm gonna be right back.
           EXT./INT. KARL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Noah, holding a sheet of paper, double checks an address and 
           stops at a rather NORMAL HOME. He skips up the FRONT PORCH. 
           RINGS A BELL. Takes a last look at the Bentley. 

           The FRONT DOOR opens REVEALING KARL (28), strikingly 
           handsome, covered in tattoos, with a wild gleam in his eye. 
           He is James Dean and Charles Manson's love child. 

                                 KARL
                        You must be Noah Kleinfeld. 

                                 NOAH
                        Yup. 

                                 KARL
                        Come on in, Noah Kleinfeld. 

           Noah follows Karl into the LIVING ROOM, he has Noah sit down 
           in a chair and Karl makes himself comfortable on the couch. A 
           LARGE FLAT SCREEN TV has a VIDEO GAME on PAUSE. 

                                 KARL (CONT'D)
                        So, you got my number from Marisa.

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah.

                                 KARL
                        Yo, that girl's crazy, man, she 
                        cracks me up.

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, she's, uh, cool.

                                 KARL
                        Yeah, she cracks me up, man, she's 
                        crazy. Wanna do a couple rails? 

                                 NOAH
                        No, thanks, I'm just picking it up.

           Noah BLANCHES when he spots a SHOTGUN leaning up against the 
           wall. Karl notices and SMILES. He GRABS it. 

                                 KARL
                        Beautiful, isn't she? 

           He COCKS IT and POINTS IT at Noah. 

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, she's uh-- I really wish you 
                        wouldn't point that at me.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 KARL
                        Why? You think it might go off 
                        accidentally--?

           Just then Karl PULLS the TRIGGER. We HEAR a very LOUD CLICK! 
           Noah JUMPS out of his seat. Karl starts LAUGHING.

                                 KARL (CONT'D)
                        Hahahaha! It's not loaded, man! You 
                        think I'm crazy? You're never 
                        supposed to keep a loaded gun in 
                        the house. That's the first thing 
                        they teach you when you get NRA 
                        certified. You should've seen your 
                        face, though...

           Just then JULIO (29) a BUFF BLACK GUY walks in the room.

                                 KARL (CONT'D)
                        You should've seen this guy's face, 
                        man. He thought I was gonna shoot 
                        him accidentally. 

                                 JULIO
                        That gun ain't even loaded. 
                        Hahaha... You ain't supposed to 
                        keep a loaded gun in the house.

                                 KARL
                        That's what I said! 

                                 JULIO
                        Wassup, man, I'm Julio.

           Noah and Julio SLAP hands. Julio sits down next to him and 
           picks up the CONTROL to the PLAYSTATION, RESUMES the GAME. 

                                 KARL
                        So, Noah Kleinfeld, what do you 
                        need?

                                 NOAH
                        I was told to get, uh, one ticket. 

           Karl nods and heads out of the room. Noah turns to Julio.

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        So, uh, Julio, I think I remember 
                        seeing you down by the schoolyard. 

                                 JULIO
                        What?

                                 NOAH
                        I said, Julio, I think I remember 
                        seeing you down by the schoolyard. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 JULIO
                        The fuck is that supposed to mean?

                                 NOAH
                        Um, you know, it's like--

                                 JULIO
                        No, I don't fucking know. I don't 
                        fucking know what it's like. 'Cause 
                        I don't sell drugs to no kids. 

                                 NOAH
                        Oh, no, that's not what I meant--

                                 JULIO
                        I know what you meant, Noah 
                        Kleinfeld. You one of those 
                        motherfuckers that judge people. 

                                 NOAH
                        No, it was just a misunderstanding--

                                 JULIO
                        You a Simon Cowell, judging 
                        motherfucker! 

           Julio is now STANDING OVER Noah, about to BEAT THE SHIT OUT 
           OF HIM. Just then Karl RE-ENTERS the room.

                                 NOAH
                        It was just a misunderstanding! 

                                 KARL
                        Chill, Julio! This guy's cool. He's 
                        friends with Marisa.

                                 JULIO
                        Oh, for real? You know Marisa?

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah...

                                 JULIO
                        Oh, okay...
                             (settles down)
                        That girl's crazy, man, she cracks 
                        me up. 

                                 NOAH
                        So I've heard...

                                 JULIO
                        How do you know, Marisa?

                                 NOAH
                        Um... She's my girlfriend. We're in 
                        a relationship.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Julio and Karl look SURPRISED and share an AWKWARD GLANCE. 

                                 KARL
                             (clears throat)
                        Oh... Um, cool, anyway, that's a 
                        hundred and fifty for the ticket. 

                                 NOAH
                        A hundred and fifty? But... Marisa 
                        said it would only be a hundred.

                                 KARL
                        That's cause she didn't factor in 
                        inflation.

                                 JULIO
                        Yeah, man, there's a fucking 
                        recession on.

           Noah takes out all of his MONEY and COUNTS it, he's SHORT. He 
           looks at Karl and Julio, staring back at him expectantly.

                                 NOAH
                        Can you guys excuse me for just one 
                        second?

           INT. BENTLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Noah opens the door in a RUSH.

                                 SLATER
                        What's going on? We've been waiting 
                        out here for like an hour!

                                 NOAH
                        Oh, quit exaggerating. You guys got 
                        any money? Huh? You, Lexapro, got 
                        any money in that fannypack? Come 
                        on, come on, I'm good for it. 
                        Let's go, Rodrigo, cough up some 
                        pesos. Come on, guys, team effort 
                        here. Team effort!

           Slater and Rodrigo HAND Noah some MONEY. Blithe removes a 
           LARGE WAD OF SINGLES from her TANK TOP. Noah stares at it.

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        Why do you have a wad of singles--? 
                        Know what? Let's just skip it.

           Noah POCKETS the MONEY and heads back INSIDE.

           INT. KARL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Noah steps back inside the house. He throws down the MONEY.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Sweet. Mind if I count it?

                                 NOAH
                        No, go right ahead. 

           Karl starts counting the money. Julio plays the VIDEO GAME. 
           DING DONG! The DOOR BELL RINGS.

                                 KARL
                        Julio, go see who that is. 

           Julio goes to the FRONT DOOR. We HEAR the door OPEN.

                                 JULIO (O.S.)
                        Yo, man, there's some kid here! 

           Noah SNAPS UP and HURRIES towards them at the door ONLY TO 
           FIND RODRIGO STANDING THERE.

                                 NOAH
                        Oh, um, that's cool. He's with me.
                             (to Rodrigo)
                        Rodrigo, what are you--? Get back 
                        in the car.

           Karl is now at the door, looking oddly at Noah.

                                 KARL
                        He's with you? 

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, I'm, uh... babysitting. 

                                 JULIO
                        Babysitting?!

                                 RODRIGO
                        I need to go to the bathroom.

                                 KARL
                        Lemme get this straight, he's with 
                        you?

                                 JULIO
                        Babysitting?!

                                 RODRIGO
                        I need to use the bathroom.

                                 KARL
                        You're telling me, you brought a 
                        kid to a pickup?

                                 NOAH
                        Well, it's not like he's my kid--

                        At least we know he ain't 5-0... 
                        Let the kid in, Julio, he can use 
                        the can.

                                 NOAH
                        No! He doesn't need to use the can. 
                        Rodrigo, you just went to the 
                        bathroom. Remember? You made that 
                        mess? You do not need to go to the 
                        bathroom. 

                                 RODRIGO
                        Yeah, I need to go to the bathroom.

                                 NOAH
                        You just went--!

                                 RODRIGO
                        Yeah, I need to go to the bathroom!

                        What's wrong with you? Let him go 
                        to the bathroom. Come in, player, 
                        bathroom's right down the hall...

           Rodrigo ENTERS and heads down the hall. Julio heads back to 
           the Video Game. Noah watches as Rodrigo enters the BATHROOM 
           and gives Noah one last, LONG, CRYPTIC LOOK. Then he SHUTS 
           the DOOR behind him. Noah GULPS.

                                 JULIO (CONT'D)
                        You bring a little kid to a drug 
                        deal and you sitting there judging 
                        me? Bitch please...

                                 NOAH

                        Relax. Have some Skittles, man.

           Noah helps himself to SKITTLES sitting in a BOWL. His EYES 
           keep DARTING to the BATHROOM. 

                                 KARL (CONT'D)
                        You okay, you seem nervous?

                        I'm great--

           KABLOOM!!!! Noah JUMPS! But then REALIZES the EXPLOSION came 
           from the VIDEO GAME.

           KABLOOM! Again, from the video game, Noah still JUMPS!

                        I'm gonna go check on, Rodrigo.

                                 KARL
                        He's cool, man, don't worry. What 
                        you think he fell in? I'm almost 
                        done counting here.

                        Bitch, I'm about to set a record!

           KABLOOM! KABLOOM! KABLOOM! Noah, keeps JUMPING on edge... One 
           last final KABLOOM! Julio has just lost.

                        Shit! I died!

           Julio THROWS the CONTROLLER across the room. The TOILET 
           FLUSHES. The bathroom door opens and Rodrigo steps out calmly 
           and walks into the living room. Karl FINISHES counting money.

                                 KARL
                        ... And one fifty. Perfect. Nice 
                        doing business, Noah Kleinfeld. 

           Nothing blows up. NOAH TAKES A HUGE BREATHE. 

           INT. BENTLEY - NIGHT

           Noah, a BIG SMILE plastered on his face, drives.

                                 NOAH
                        Okay, guys, I know we had some 
                        setbacks, but, we're almost done. 
                        I'm gonna drop this candy off for 
                        my girlfriend, say a quick hello to 
                        her, then turn around and get us 
                        home. I know I can be a bit of a 
                        prick sometimes, so I just want to 
                        thank you three for being patient.

                        When we get home I'll whip up some 
                        of Noah's famous sundaes and we'll

                        Even if it's PG-13...

           Noah looks in the REARVIEW MIRROR and SPOTS: Rodrigo PLAYING 
           with A SOFTBALL SIZED OBJECT. Rodrigo is TOSSING IT LAZILY IN 
           THE AIR...

                        Hey, buddy, uh, what do you got 
                        there?

                                 RODRIGO
                        I dunno. I found it.

                        What is that?

                        I dunno. I found it in the 
                        bathroom. 

           Noah takes a closer look and REALIZES: RODRIGO IS PLAYING 
           WITH A BIG PLASTIC BAG OF COCAINE. Noah's EYES go WIDE.

                                 NOAH
                        Rodrigo, gimme that!

                        No, finder's keepers.

                        No, finders keepers!

           Noah, one hand on the wheel, TRIES with his other hand to 
           GRAB the BAG from Rodrigo, but Rodrigo holds it OUT OF REACH.

                                 NOAH
                        Gimme that! Gimme that right now!

                        Okay.

           With that Rodrigo LET'S GO. Noah's hand SNAPS back, bringing 
           the bag straight to his FACE. The BAG EXPLODES! A WHITE CLOUD 
           surrounds Noah. He SLAMS on the BREAKS. The car SPINS out of 
           control, until it finally comes SCREECHING to a HALT.

           Noah sits there for a beat, breathing heavy. His whole face 
           is PANCAKED WITH COCAINE. The kids are speechless. Noah's 
           CELLPHONE rings. As if in a trance, he ANSWERS.

                                 NOAH

                        Okay, thank you, bye now. 

           Noah HANGS up the phone. Still STUNNED. A beat, then: 

                                 RODRIGO
                        I told you. Finder's keepers.

           Noah just stares back at Rodrigo. The PHONE starts RINGING 
           again. This time Noah IGNORES it and SILENCES HIS RINGER. 

           INT. BOSTON MARKET - NIGHT

           Noah ENTERS with the three kids trailing him. Noah's FACE AND 
           UPPER TORSO ARE STILL THINLY COATED WITH COCAINE. He goes up 
           to the COUNTER across from BOSTON MARKET GUY.

                                 BOSTON MARKET GUY
                        Hey, you coming from the circus?

                        Sorry, guy, it's a rule. If you 
                        want to use the bathroom, you gotta

           Boston Market Guy POINTS to a SIGN that reads: BATHROOM FOR 
           CUSTOMERS ONLY. NO EXCEPTIONS.

                        fucking night. I'm not in the 
                        fucking mood for this. I have ten 
                        fucking dollars to my name and I'm 
                        not about to spend it on a fucking 
                        meal no one wants to fucking eat. 
                        So, just do me a fucking solid and 
                        gimme the fucking key to the 
                        bathroom. 

           Boston Market Guy shakes his head. Noah loses it. He starts 
           DIGGING into his POCKETS. 

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)

                        chicken, that's $7.99.

           Boston Market Guy takes Noah's money and rings him up. 

                                 NOAH
                        Can I have the key to the bathroom

                        to the bathroom!

           CARLOS looks up from the back kitchen. 

                                 CARLOS
                        Uh, bathroom is out of order!

           HOLD ON Noah, STEWING. 

           EXT. BOSTON MARKET - NIGHT

           Noah, Slater, Blithe and Rodrigo exit. The kids all EATING 
           CHICKEN. Noah cleans the coke off his face with HANDY-WIPES. 
           He pulls out his IPhone which has the RINGER SILENCED, but 
           his phone is RINGING, KARL IS STILL CALLING.

           Noah and the kids head for the elevators.

           INT. BOSTON HARBOR HOTEL - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           They get into the elevator in ANGRY SILENCE. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NOAH
                        Look, uh, I'm sorry I called you 
                        guys fuck-ups, okay? I was a little 
                        angry. Things got heated.

           The three kids ignore him.

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        Okay, fine, whatever. I'm gonna 
                        drop you off with your parents and 
                        then we'll never have to see each 
                        other again. 

           The doors open. They exit into a...

           HALLWAY

           At the end is the BALLROOM where the PARTY is taking place.

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        Okay, you three wait here. I'm 
                        gonna go get your mom.

           Noah heads inside the...

           BALLROOM

           The party is in full swing. Noah hangs out at the edge 
           looking for Dr. and Mrs. Polk, when he SPOTS his mom talking 
           to her HANDSOME DATE. 

           Sandy looks over, SPOTS Noah and SMILES. She excuses herself 
           and heads for Noah. 

                                 SANDY
                        Noah, what are you doing here?

                                 NOAH
                        Hey, mom, uh--

                                 SANDY
                        What do you think? Isn't he good 
                        looking?

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, uh--

                                 SANDY
                        He's a true gentleman. He's never 
                        been married. Apparently, he's a 
                        brilliant surgeon, and when I was 
                        coming back from the bathroom, I 
                        overheard him tell Dr. Polk that he 
                        thought I was pretty. He thinks I'm 
                        pretty, Noah!

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 NOAH
                        That's great, mom....

                                 SANDY
                        Wait... What are you doing here?

                                 NOAH
                        Huh? Oh, uh, well, I gotta talk to 
                        you--

                                 SANDY
                        Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no, no. What 
                        did you do? Noah, what did you do?

                                 NOAH
                        Um...

                                 SANDY
                        Just tell me! What did you do? What 
                        did you do?

                                 NOAH
                        Uh...

                                 SANDY
                        I should've expected this. Every 
                        time anything is going well in my 
                        life you always manage to step in 
                        and screw everything up. 

                                 NOAH
                        That's not true.

                                 SANDY
                        Yes it is. I got a promotion at 
                        work, you burnt down the garage. I 
                        bought a new car, you snuck it out 
                        and crashed it. I won a free 
                        vacation to Antigua and you got 
                        yourself thrown into jail for 
                        impersonating a Federal Marshal--

                                 NOAH
                        Okay! You're just taking these 
                        things out of context. You're 
                        cherry picking--

                                 SANDY
                        Just tell me what you did, Noah. 
                        Tell me what you did this time...

           Noah looks at his mom. Sandy is CLOSE TO TEARS.

                                 NOAH
                        Mom, I did a stupid thing.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 SANDY
                        What?

                                 NOAH
                        I... Uh, I... brought the kids into 
                        the city because they wanted to see 
                        a movie, but, um, I don't have 
                        enough money to buy the tickets. I 
                        was hoping maybe you could lend me 
                        the money. Until the Polk's pay me 
                        and then I'll pay you back, I 
                        swear. 

                                 SANDY
                             (beat)
                        Is that it?

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah.

                                 SANDY
                        The kids are fine?

                                 NOAH
                        The kids are great. 

           Sandy is RELIEVED. She digs into her purse and removes FIFTY 
           DOLLARS and hands it to Noah.

                                 SANDY
                        Here. Get some popcorn too, my 
                        treat. I'm sorry, Noah, I'm sorry 
                        for the things I said...

                                 NOAH
                        Don't worry about it. Thanks... And 
                        this date of yours?

                                 SANDY
                        Yeah?

                                 NOAH
                        He's a real lucky guy, mom. 

           Sandy smiles. Kisses him on the forehead. 

                                 SANDY
                        Thanks, kiddo.

           Sandy turns back around and heads for her Handsome Date. Noah 
           smiles, watching his mom have a good time. Then he looks over 
           and SPOTS Dr. Polk. As if sensing his presence, Dr. Polk 
           turns his head and LOOKS STRAIGHT AT NOAH...

           But, we REVEAL, that Noah is already GONE. 
           INT. BOSTON HARBOR HOTEL - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Noah and the kids make their way across the lobby. 

                                 SLATER
                        I thought you were dropping us off 
                        with our parents. 

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, well, change of plans. 

           INT. BENTLEY - NIGHT

           The four of them climb into the car. Slater starts TEXTING 
           right away. Noah is just sitting there THINKING. He pulls out 
           his IPhone, KARL IS STILL CALLING. He looks at the phone for 
           a LONG BEAT. He SIGHS. Then finally ANSWERS.

                                 NOAH

                        I'm not your fucking bro.

                        I don't have them. The kid I'm 
                        babysitting? Rodrigo? He took a bag 
                        and uh, I was trying to get it back 
                        from him, and uh, well, it exploded 
                        and now there's none left.

                        the kid under the bus.

           Karl HANGS up the phone. Noah RUBS his TEMPLES. Slater's

                        Hey, Slater, will you give it a

                        think. I need some quiet. You can

                        I guess.

                                 NOAH
                        You know what? We should go.

                                 SLATER
                        I don't want to go. Those girls 
                        freak me out. 

                                 NOAH
                        Slater, if I was your age and the 
                        runner ups to the Miley Cyrus look 
                        alike contest wanted to Hannah 
                        Montana me, I wouldn't be freaked 
                        out, I'd be getting my freak on!

           Noah puts the car in drive. 

           EXT. RITZ CARLTON - NIGHT

           The Bentley pulls up. Noah and the kids exit the car. Noah 
           throws the VALET a set of keys. A FEW OLDER GIRLS stand 
           outside, talk and smoke cigarettes.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           As Noah notices them, his EYES DRIFT down to one of THE 
           GIRL'S ASSES. She has an incredible ass. HOT ASS GIRL turns 
           around and spots him staring.

                                 HOT ASS GIRL
                        Hey, douche bag, why don't you take 
                        a picture. That way you can stare 
                        at my ass in private and I won't 
                        feel objectified. 

                                 NOAH
                        Oh... Um... Sorry...

           Noah, embarrassed, continues on inside. 

           INT. RITZ CARLTON - BAT MITZVAH - NIGHT

           Noah and the kids step inside. It is without a doubt the 
           GRANDEST Bat Mitzvah ever seen. 

                                 SLATER
                        Look, there's Wendy Sapperstein.

           Slater POINTS to a MOUSEY GIRL, CRYING, throwing a TANTRUM. 

                                 NOAH
                        Okay, let's just do our best to 
                        blend in. 

                                 BLITHE
                        Does this place have bottle 
                        service? I want a redbull and 
                        vodka.

                        Slater?

           They look over and SPOT the Three Teen Girls walking up. 

                                 TEEN GIRL # 2
                        OMG! You made it!

                                 TEEN GIRL # 3
                        I knew you would. Come sit with us, 
                        we've got a table over there.

                                 SLATER
                        Um, no that's okay--

                                 NOAH
                        He'd love to. Go on, Slater, take a 
                        couple for the team. And keep an 
                        eye on your brother and sister. 
                             (to Rodrigo)
                        You, Rodrigo, stay the fuck away 
                        from the bathrooms, you hear me?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Yeah, I'll stay away from the 
                        bathrooms. 

           The girls PULL SLATER AWAY, Rodrigo and Blithe follow them to 
           a table. Noah SCANS the ROOM until he finds what he's looking 
           for... THE GIFT TABLE.

           INT. RITZ CARLTON - BAT MITZVAH - GIFT TABLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Noah walks past the BAR where a group of ADULTS are watching 
           the BOSTON BRUINS HOCKEY GAME on TV. Next to the bar is the 
           GIFT TABLE. Noah surreptitiously walks up to the table that's 
           PILED a mile high with GIFTS.  

           Noah pokes around, looking for ENVELOPES. He starts to STEAL 
           the ENVELOPES, STUFFING them in his jacket POCKET.

           Noah spins around and spots HOT ASS GIRL. She getting a drink 
           at the bar. Noah takes a good look at her, she's very 
           attractive, slightly bored. This is RACHEL (21).

                        God, I fucking hate Bat Mitzvahs. 
                        Mine totally sucked. I gave Seth 
                        Coen his first handjob, then he got 
                        food poisoning, threw up all over 
                        my dress and went home early.

                        actually won. So, all the money I 
                        made from my Bat Mitzvah went to

                        and I think it fucked up my memory.

                        Because, right now, he's pissing in 
                        the middle of the dance floor.

           Noah looks over. Sure enough Rodrigo is in the MIDDLE OF THE 
           DANCE FLOOR, pants down, PISSING. The other dancer's have yet 
           to notice, but they're about to. Noah RACES towards him.

           Rodrigo is STILL PISSING, Noah comes up behind him.

           Rodrigo continues to PEE. PEOPLE nearby start to NOTICE and 
           are getting disgusted.

           Noah GRABS him by the back of his SHIRT and DRAGS him away.

           AROUND. They wait for the car. Just then THREE TEEN BOYS skip 
           up the stairs to the hotel. Slater looks surprised.

                        What are you doing here? I thought 
                        you were grounded.

                                 CLAYTON
                        I was, but then Benji and Brendan 
                        convinced me to sneak out. 

                                 SLATER

                        I don't know. We got gym together. 
                        They're cool guys. Look, Slater, 
                        we're in high school now. We don't 
                        have to hang out all the time. We 
                        should make new friends.

                        But, you're my best friend.

                        Yeah, I know, but I'm getting a 
                        little sick of coming to your house 
                        and watching tennis. I wanna, like, 
                        do other stuff.

                                 SLATER
                        What other stuff?

                                 SLATER
                        I said, no! Okay?! Just leave me 
                        alone! 

           Just then the Valet comes up to Noah. 

                                 VALET
                        Hey, um, I can't find your car. 

                                 NOAH
                        What do you mean you can't find my 
                        car?

                                 VALET
                        I think someone stole it.

                                 NOAH
                        How could someone steal it?

                                 VALET
                        Well, they steal the key from the 
                        Valet Box and then they drive away 
                        with the car. It happens all the 
                        time.

                                 NOAH
                        It happens all the time?

                                 VALET
                        Yeah, it happens all the time. What 
                        kind of insurance do you have?

                                 NOAH
                        How the fuck should I know?!

                                 VALET
                        Isn't it your car?

           HOLD ON Noah, BLINKING. 
           INT. THE T - METRO CAR - NIGHT

           Noah sits next to Blithe on the METRO. Rodrigo and Slater sit 
           at other seats. Noah is furiously OPENING THE ENVELOPES 
           sorting through CASH and CHECKS. He gets to the last one. 

                                 NOAH
                        Three thousand dollars. 

                                 BLITHE
                        Is that good?

                                 NOAH
                        Not good enough. 

                                 BLITHE
                        Don't worry, Noah, as soon as I 
                        start my clothing line, I'm gonna 
                        make lots of money and I can give 
                        you some. Because, I'm going to be 
                        living a life of Fabulosity.

                                 NOAH
                        Fabulosity? What the hell are you 
                        talking about?

                                 BLITHE
                        I'm gonna start my own clothing 
                        line, it's gonna be called 
                        Blithealicious!

                                 NOAH
                        So, you want to be a clothing 
                        designer when you grow up?

                                 BLITHE
                        No, I'm gonna be a famous celebrity 
                        who happens to design, because when 
                        it comes to fashion, I'm fierce. 

                                 NOAH
                        Being a celebrity is not a real 
                        job, Blithe. 

                                 BLITHE
                        Yeah, it is. Being a famous 
                        celebrity is the greatest thing in 
                        the world. It means everybody knows 
                        who you are, and people take your 
                        picture, and you get to have 
                        birthday parties at the coolest 
                        clubs and dance on tables. And you 
                        do everything for you fans. And you 
                        get to save the environment.  

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                        I thought you said you had a high 
                        IQ. You sound like an idiot.

                                 BLITHE
                        Now I'm not gonna tell you my 
                        gossip. 

                                 NOAH
                        I'm sure I'll read all about it on 
                        Perezhilton.

                                 BLITHE
                        Perezhilton is so five minutes ago. 
                        I'm a Gawker Girl. Dur! 

           Noah looks over at Slater who is on the verge of tears. 

                                 NOAH
                        Dude, you're like the Wailing Wall. 
                        What's your problem now?

                                 SLATER
                        What's my problem? Clayton doesn't 
                        want to be my friend anymore! 
                        That's my problem!

                                 NOAH
                        Slater, it's no big deal. You'll 
                        make other friends. 

                                 SLATER
                        Not like him!

                                 NOAH
                        Hey! I just lost your dad's one 
                        hundred and twenty five thousand 
                        dollar car. So, let's have a little 
                        perspective. Okay?

                                 SLATER
                        I'd rather lose a car than a best 
                        friend! Why doesn't he want to be 
                        my friend anymore?

                                 NOAH
                        How the hell should I know?

           Slater begins to SOB uncontrollably.

                                 SLATER
                        I don't know what I'm going to do 
                        without him in my life! He's my 
                        best friend! We do everything 
                        together! Why doesn't he want to be 
                        my friend?!

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                        Ok, seriously, I've had enough. 
                        Take a Klonopin. You're acting like 
                        a total drama queen--

           Noah STOPS himself, suddenly REALIZING SOMETHING about 
           Slater. He SIZES Slater UP, who is still in tears.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Uh, Slater...?

                                 SLATER
                        What?!

                                 NOAH
                        Uh... nothing. Nothing.

                                 SLATER
                        Why? Why? Why? Why doesn't he like 
                        me anymore? Why?! Why?!

           Slater continues to SOB. Noah turns and spots the GUY sitting 
           across from them is reading the PAPER. The SPORTS PAGE is 
           facing Noah, and he spots a PICTURE OF RICKY FONTAINE, with 
           the HEADLINE: FIESTA FOR FONTAINE!

           Noah stares grimly at the photo. Slater continues to cry. 

           INT. FANEUIL HALL - PIZZERIA REGINA - NIGHT

           Noah leads the kids into the Pizzeria where Karl and Julio 
           are waiting for him at a table. Noah turns to the kids.

                                 NOAH
                        Wait here, I'll be watching.

           The kids sit, Noah heads to Karl and Julio across the way.

                        Look who it is! Mr. Belvedere!

           Noah takes a seat across from Karl and Julio, ANGLED so he 
           can watch the kids.

                                 NOAH

                        where the sun don't shine.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Best believe we're gonna put more 
                        than just a pinky in that stinky--

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, okay, I get it. Keep it down-- 

                                 KARL
                        And then we're gonna kill you. So, 
                        bring us our fucking money. Seven 
                        grand by midnight, punk. 

           Karl and Julio get up, leaving Noah alone. Slater, Blithe and 
           Rodrigo step up to Noah.

                                 SLATER
                        Can we go home now?

                                 NOAH
                        No, I gotta go see someone.

                                 SLATER
                        I don't wanna go see anyone. I 
                        wanna go home!

                                 NOAH
                        Believe me, Slater, I don't feel 
                        like seeing this person either.

           EXT. BROOKLINE HOUSE - NIGHT

           A TAXI pulls up to this very well to do home. Noah and the 
           kids step out of the taxi and head up to the FRONT DOOR 
           passing a WHITE MERCEDES.

                                 NOAH
                        Guys, please, just try to be on 
                        your best behavior here, okay?

           Noah gets to the DOOR and RINGS the BELL. The door OPENS 
           revealing BETHANY (29), A VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMAN. 

                                 BETHANY
                        Do you have any idea how late it 
                        is?

                                 NOAH
                        Hey, Bethany, can I come in? 

           Bethany ROLLS her EYES, Noah and the kids ENTER into the...

           LIVING ROOM 

           The kids take seats on the couch. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        What do you want, Noah? And who are 
                        these kids?

                                 NOAH
                        I'm babysitting. Looks like you and 
                        I finally have something in common.

                                 BETHANY
                        I'm not your babysitter anymore, 
                        Noah. 
                             (calling out)
                        Jim!

           JIM, (50s), enters carrying ASHTON a five year old boy. His 
           face drops when he spots Noah.

                                 JIM
                        Noah?

                                 NOAH
                        Hey, dad. 

           INT. JIM'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER

           Noah sits across from Jim, who is pouring himself a drink.

                                 JIM
                        Seven thousand dollars?

                                 NOAH
                        I wouldn't be asking you if I 
                        didn't really need it.

                                 JIM
                        What's it for? 

                                 NOAH
                        Just trust me, I'm in trouble and, 
                        uh, the less you know... Look, this 
                        is the last time I'll ever ask you 
                        for anything. I'll work it off, 
                        too. I'll work in the store. I'll 
                        do whatever it takes--

                                 JIM
                        Stop. There's no way I'm giving you 
                        seven thousand dollars.

                                 NOAH
                        Dad, you have it. You blow that 
                        money on one of your "golf trips" 
                        alone.

                        It's always something with you, 
                        isn't it? It's never going to stop.

                        You know, when you left mom for 
                        Bethany, did I ever give you any 
                        shit about that? No. The fact that 
                        you only call me on my birthday or 
                        Hanukkah, do I ever bring that up? 
                        No. I could, but I don't. I mean, I 
                        realize I'm a total asshole as a 
                        son, but, Jesus, dad, you're not 
                        exactly winning any Father Of The 
                        Year Awards--

                                 JIM
                        Enough! I am no longer taking 
                        responsibility for your life. You 
                        cannot keep blaming me for your 
                        shortcomings. You are an adult. You 
                        make your own decisions and it has 
                        nothing to do with me. I will not 
                        be responsible for the fact that 
                        you grew up to be a total fuck up.

                                 NOAH
                        Wow, it's amazing how little 
                        respect you have for me.

                        How can I have respect for someone

                                 JIM
                        Yes... You can call it that.

           Noah goes to HUG him. Jim, awkwardly, hugs him. The two hug 
           for a long beat. Jim obviously wants to break away, but Noah 
           won't let him. Noah finally breaks away.

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        I'll see you around, dad.

           EXT. BROOKLINE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Noah, followed by the kids, step out of the house.

                                 SLATER
                        So, how'd it go with your dad?

           Noah REMOVES a PAIR OF KEYS HE LIFTED FROM HIS DAD.

                                 NOAH
                        Awesome. He said I could take the 
                        Mercedes.

           Noah holds the key up to the BRAND NEW WHITE MERCEDES in the 
           DRIVEWAY and PRESSES a button -- BEEP-BEEP!

                        hurry up...! 

           INT. MERCEDES - MOMENTS LATER

           Noah is speeding down the road, fiddling with his CELLPHONE.

                                 BLITHE
                        That woman was your babysitter?

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah. She was the first crush I 
                        ever had. Later I found out my dad 
                        was uh, tipping her a little extra 
                        when he drove her home at night.

                        She said she's not talking to you 
                        until you make it snow for us. Let 
                        it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

           CLICK. She's HUNG UP on him.

           Noah looks out the window, sure enough, it's starting to 
           LIGHTLY SNOW.

                                 NOAH
                        Well, what do you know.

                        It's beautiful.
           EXT. MINI-MALL - NIGHT

           The Mercedes PULLS into the Mini-Mall parking lot. All the 
           stores are closed. The car parks out in front of a store with 
           a sign that reads: KLEINFELD DIAMONDS.

           Noah steps out of the car and approaches the store. After a 
           beat Slater, Blithe and Rodrigo follow him out.

                                 SLATER
                        What are you doing?

                        I gotta pick something up from my

                                 SLATER
                        You're breaking in.

                        I'm not breaking in. I got the

                                 SLATER
                        What about the alarm?

                                 NOAH
                        The alarm is the same code it's 
                        always been. It's my birthday. 
                        Relax, I know what I'm doing. 

           Noah slides the KEYS into the FRONT DOOR and enters...

           KLEINFELD DIAMONDS

           He's met by a FLASHING AND RINGING ALARM. Noah PUNCHES in a 
           SERIES OF NUMBERS... But the LIGHT KEEPS FLASHING. THE ALARM 
           KEEPS RINGING.

                                 NOAH
                        What the fuck?

                                 SLATER
                        You didn't do it right.

           Noah PUNCHES in the numbers again. But, still the LIGHT 
           CONTINUES TO FLASH, THE ALARM CONTINUES TO RING.  

                                 NOAH
                        I did it. Shit! It's not working... 

           Noah KEEPS PUNCHING THE SAME NUMBERS INTO THE KEY PAD. 

                                 BLITHE
                        Maybe your dad changed the code?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NOAH
                        Why would he change it?

                                 SLATER
                        Try your brother's birthday.

                                 NOAH
                        What brother?

                                 SLATER
                        That little kid back at the house. 

                                 NOAH
                        That's not my brother. Okay? He's 
                        my half-brother. 

                                 SLATER
                        He's still your little brother.

                                 NOAH
                        No, he's not, he's just another kid 
                        my dad has. He's definitely not 
                        family. It's not like I'm gonna 
                        invite him over for fucking 
                        thanksgiving when I get older--

                                 SLATER
                        Just try his birthday!

           Noah acquiesces and PUNCHES A NEW SERIES OF NUMBERS. The 
           ALARM STOPS FLASHING AND RINGING. 

                                 SLATER (CONT'D)
                        See? It worked! Can you hurry up 
                        now so we can go home?

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah. You guys stay put. I gotta go 
                        into the back office.

                                 BLITHE
                        Look at all this bling!

                                 NOAH
                        And don't touch anything.

           Noah NOTICES Rodrigo is STARING at him, ANGRY. 

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        You okay, Rodrigo?

                                 RODRIGO
                        Yeah, I'm okay. 

           Noah nods and heads for the back. Something is WRONG with 
           Rodrigo.
           INT. KLEINFELD DIAMONDS - BACK OFFICE - SECONDS LATER

           Noah ENTERS and walks past a his FATHER'S DESK. On the desk 
           he NOTICES a SERIES OF PICTURES OF JIM, BETHANY AND ASHTON. 
           There are NO pictures of Noah.

           Noah then CROUCHES DOWN and finds a SAFE with a NUMBERS LOCK. 

                                 NOAH
                             (to himself)
                        Let me guess...

           Noah SPINS THE SAFE COMBINATION DIAL to his step brother's 
           birthday when he SPOTS Blithe staring at him at the DOORWAY.

                                 BLITHE
                        Can I tell you my gossip now?

                                 NOAH
                             (spinning the combo lock)
                        Is it gonna freak me out? Because, 
                        I'm really at the end of my rope 
                        here, Blithe, and I don't think I 
                        can deal right now--

                                 BLITHE
                        I saw daddy kissing his assistant 
                        Deborah. That's why he always stays 
                        late at the hospital because he's 
                        spends all night kissing Deborah.

           Noah STOPS spinning the combo lock. A beat. Noah doesn't know 
           what to say.

                                 BLITHE (CONT'D)
                        My mom knows. She pretends like she 
                        doesn't know. But, she knows. 

                                 NOAH
                             (beat)
                        Oh... uh, I'm sorry to hear that, 
                        Blithe... Uh...

           Blithe turns around and walks out of the office. Noah watches 
           her leave. After a beat he finishes the combination lock. 

           It works. He opens the SAFE to reveal STACKS and STACKS of 
           CASH. Noah counts out $7,000. He puts the REST OF THE MONEY 
           BACK IN THE SAFE. Then SHUTS the SAFE and exits.

           KLEINFELD DIAMONDS

           Noah enters, spots Blithe and Slater, but Rodrigo is MISSING.

                                 NOAH
                        Where's Rodrigo?

                        He's in the bathroom.

                                 NOAH
                        Jesus, did someone slip that kid 
                        some Flomax or what?

           A TOILET FLUSHES. The bathroom door opens. Rodrigo steps out. 
           Noah NOTICES a SINISTER LOOK in Rodrigo's EYE. 

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        Oh... No, Rodrigo, no... not 
                        again... Tell me you didn't...

                                 RODRIGO
                        Yeah, I did!

           KABLOOM! SMASH CUT:

           INT. MERCEDES - MOMENTS LATER

           Noah is SPEEDING like MAD. COP CARS WIZZ BY in the OTHER 
           DIRECTION. The kids hold on for dear life.

                                 NOAH
                        What the hell did you do that for?! 
                        Christ! You said you didn't have 
                        any more cherry bombs. How many 
                        more do you have?!

           Rodrigo just stares back at him, not speaking.

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        What? You're a fucking mute all of 
                        a sudden? Huh? Answer me, Rodrigo?!

           Rodrigo still doesn't answer him, just STARES back at him 
           with contempt.

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        Why'd you have to go an do that? Is 
                        that your schtick, Chupacabra? Huh? 
                        Just do whatever fucked up thing 
                        goes through that head of yours? 
                        Why can't you be more like your 
                        brother and sister? They're only 
                        half-crazy, you're full on fucking 
                        nuts!

                        They are not my brother and sister!

                             (pointing to Blithe)
                        This one does nothing all day but

                        And this one is sick in the head. 
                        He goes to a head doctor four times 
                        a week! Four times a week! 

                                 SLATER

                        fannypack! I take your fannypack!

           Rodrigo RIPS the FANNYPACK from Slater.

                                 SLATER
                        Give that back! I need that!

           Rodrigo ROLLS down the window. Slater tries to GRAB it back 
           from him, but Rodrigo squirms away from him.

                                 RODRIGO
                        I show you crazy! You see how crazy 
                        you become without your medicine!

           Rodrigo THROWS THE FANNYPACK out the WINDOW.

                        No! My Klonopin! My Klonopin!

                        You're never gonna find your pills, 
                        Slater. It's pitch black out there!

           Noah reluctantly PULLS OVER. Slater opens the door and JUMPS 
           out. Noah turns back around to face Rodrigo.

                                 NOAH
                        Dude, seriously, what the fuck is 
                        wrong with you?

                                 RODRIGO
                        There is nothing wrong with me. 

                                 NOAH
                        You just gave your brother a

                        He is not my brother. I will not be 
                        inviting him over for Thanksgiving 
                        when I get older.

                        Christ, Rodrigo, I didn't really 
                        mean what I said about my brother, 
                        I just... I get mad sometimes and 
                        say stuff I don't actually mean...

           Noah notices that Rodrigo is not listening, just staring out 
           the window.

                        Fine. Forget it. Fine. Stay put.

           EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - NIGHT

           Slater is FRANTICALLY LOOKING for his fannypack, while Noah 
           realizes it's an exercise in futility.

                        Come on, Slater, we're never gonna

                        Yeah, I do! Rodrigo's right. Why do 
                        you think I'm in therapy four times 
                        a week? Because, I got serious

                        gay! Why would you say that? I'm 
                        not gay!

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, Slater, you are. The reason 
                        you're so upset that Clayton 
                        doesn't want to be your friend 
                        anymore is because you're in love 
                        with him. And he broke your heart. 
                        Believe me, I know what that looks 
                        like. It happens to me all the 
                        fucking time. 

                                 SLATER
                        I don't want to be gay!

                                 NOAH
                        Well, tough...

                                 SLATER
                        I don't want to be a cockgobbler!

                                 NOAH
                        Hey, hey, hey, watch the mouth!

                                 SLATER
                        I don't want to be a cockgobbler!

                                 NOAH
                        Don't call yourself that, Slater! 
                        You're gonna have a lot of people 
                        hating on you. There's no reason 
                        for you to join them.

                        This is the worst night of my life! 
                        This is awful!

                                 NOAH
                        Look, Slater, I'm not gonna lie to 
                        you. High school is gonna be a 
                        bitch. And coming out to your 
                        parents ain't gonna be a picnic 
                        either, but I swear, once you go to 
                        college no one's gonna give a shit. 
                        And when you graduate you'll get a 
                        cool job in the entertainment 
                        industry and you'll dress real nice 
                        and smell good-- 

                                 SLATER
                        Smell good? What are you talking 
                        about? I'm a freak! I don't want to 
                        be a freak, Noah.

                                 NOAH
                        Slater, my dad hates me, I got 
                        suspended from college, I've only 
                        ever had one job as a lifeguard and 
                        got fired after four days because I 
                        kept falling asleep in the sun. 
                        I've been a constant disappointment 
                        to my mom, I've been arrested 
                        numerous times, I had a month long, 
                        intense addiction to Robitussin, I 
                        mean, there's only one freak out 
                        here, Slater. You're looking at 
                        him. And I never had a gay thought 
                        in my life, so what does that tell 
                        you? 

                                 SLATER
                        It tells me you're pretty messed 
                        up.

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, take a good look. This is 
                        what a guy with issues looks like. 
                        There's nothing wrong with you. 
                        You're completely normal. So, let's 
                        forget the pills, okay? Let's get 
                        back in the car.

           Slater NODS, feeling better. They head back to the car.

                                 SLATER
                        You know, deep down, I think I 
                        always knew... Just don't tell 
                        anybody yet, okay?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 NOAH
                        No, of course not. What do think I 
                        am? An asshole?

                                 SLATER
                        Yeah, sorta.

           Noah looks at Slater. Slater CRACKS A SMILE. It's the FIRST 
           TIME THE KID'S SMILED SINCE WE MET HIM. Noah smiles back as 
           they reach the car.

                                 NOAH
                        Alright, wiseass, get in the car.

           The two start to get in the Mercedes, when a CAR DRIVES VERY 
           FAST PAST THEM.

                                 SLATER
                        Holy shit... That's dad's Bentley.

                                 NOAH
                        You sure?

           Just then we HEAR A BEEPING SOUND. Noah digs in his pocket 
           and takes out THE HAND HELD GPS DEVICE. IT'S BEEPING LOUD.

           MERCEDES

           Noah and Slater get into the car.

                                 NOAH
                        Rodrigo, where's your jacket?

                                 RODRIGO
                        I left in the car. 

                                 NOAH
                        What car? You left it in the 
                        Bentley?

                                 RODRIGO
                        Yeah, I left in the Bentley. I told 
                        you, Then next time I leave the 
                        jacket in the car. And I did!

           Noah CHECKS the TIME on his IPhone, then excitedly gets into 
           the driver's seat. He starts the engine.

                                 BLITHE
                        What are we doing?

                                 NOAH
                        We're getting your dad's hundred 
                        and twenty-five thousand dollar car 
                        back!

           Noah PEELS out of there. 
           INT. MERCEDES - LATER

           Noah has the GPS UNIT ON THE DASH, and he's following the 
           BEEP-BEEP-BEEP... Noah is looking at his surroundings, 
           REALIZING they are in a TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD. 

                                 NOAH
                        Is this South Boston?

                                 SLATER
                        We should be coming right up on 
                        them... They should be right here 
                        around the corner... And, yes, this 
                        is South Boston.

                                 NOAH
                        Oh, that's just great... 

           Noah SPEEDS around the bend, and slows down... His face 
           falls. Sure enough he SPOTS THE BENTLEY, but it's PARKED in 
           front of an IRISH PUB with a bunch of "SOUTHIES" -- tough 
           Irish guys, hanging out.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Oh... Shit. 

                                 BLITHE
                        It looks scary in there. 

                                 SLATER
                        Maybe we should start thinking 
                        about calling the cops?

           Noah looks at his WATCH: It's 11:30PM. 

                                 NOAH
                        We don't have time. I got a half 
                        hour to get to this party... 
                        Alright, here's the deal. Just stay 
                        in the car. Lock the doors. I'm 
                        gonna scope out the situation. 

           INT. IRISH PUB - NIGHT

           Noah enters the bar and looks around. It's filled with 
           locals. Noah looks supremely out of place. The BARTENDER 
           spots him, FROWNS and walks up.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Hey, are they with you?

           Bartender points behind Noah, to where Slater, Blithe and 
           Rodrigo are standing.

                                 NOAH
                        I told you guys to stay in the car!

                                 SLATER
                        Yeah, then we realized that if you 
                        got killed you'd need witnesses.

                                 BARTENDER
                        They can't be in here...

                                 NOAH
                        I know, sir--

                                 BARTENDER
                        ...without ordering something. 

                                 BLITHE
                        I want a Redbull and vodka!

                                 BARTENDER
                        One Redbull and vodka coming up--

                                 NOAH
                        No! Just, um, three Shirley 
                        Temples, please. And do you know 
                        who belongs to the Bentley outside?

                                 BARTENDER
                        That crew over there.

           Bartender points to a BACK TABLE. Noah looks over and SPOTS 
           THREE SOUTHIES... But then he also SPOTS RACHEL and TWO of 
           her FRIENDS. They're all LAUGHING and doing SHOTS. 

           Noah, incredulous, STORMS over. Rachel looks up and SPOTS 
           him, she SMILES. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Hey, bet you're not gonna forget me 
                        now. 

                                 NOAH
                        You stole my car!

                        I highly doubt that's your car.

                        Are you out of your mind?

                        Relax, it was a joke.

                        Do I look like I'm fucking 
                        laughing?

                        right to be pissed. 

           Rachel STANDS up and takes Noah ASIDE.

                                 RACHEL (CONT'D)
                        Look, I'm sorry, it was a joke. I 
                        moved the car to the back of the 
                        hotel, but then you left in such a 
                        hurry I didn't get a chance to tell 
                        you the car was fine. I was gonna 
                        return it to you tonight.

                                 RACHEL
                        I was gonna call you. I got your

                        Don't you know you're not supposed 
                        to post that? 

                                 NOAH
                        Um, yeah, it's been brought to my 
                        attention. Look, can I just get the 
                        car back? Please.

                        Sure. Just as soon as you give me 
                        whatever you stole from Wendy.

                                 NOAH

                             (calling out)
                        Shamus!

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           SHAMUS, the Southie, stands up. 

                                 SHAMUS
                        What is it, Rachel? You want me to 
                        kick this college boy's fucking 
                        teeth in?!

                                 NOAH
                        Who is that? Is he your boyfriend 
                        or something?

                                 RACHEL
                        No, he's just some guy that I'm 
                        fucking.

                                 NOAH
                        Oh...

                                 RACHEL
                        Dude, I'm joking. My friend over 
                        there, Karen, her uncle owns this 
                        place. Karen's known Shamus since 
                        they were like, two. 
                             (to Shamus)
                        It's okay, Shamus, thanks.

           Shamus sits back down.

                                 NOAH
                        Look, I did take some envelopes 
                        but, I, um... Shit, I'm in a real 
                        bad spot... Rachel, I really need 
                        that car back. 

                                 RACHEL
                        And how am I supposed to get home? 

           Noah DIGS into his pockets, takes out KEYS TO THE MERCEDES. 

                                 NOAH
                        Here. Here's my dad's Mercedes. 
                        I'll pick it up tomorrow. Just 
                        please, I need that Bentley back. 
                        Please. 

           Rachel considers him, then takes out the keys. They trade.

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        Thanks... Thanks a lot. 

           Rachel SMILES... Then from the JUKEBOX the first few NOTES of 
           Bryan Adams' Heaven starts to PLAY. Rachel's face drops. She 
           turns to her TWO FRIENDS, KAREN (21) and LISA (21).

                                 RACHEL
                        Which one of you bitches put this 
                        song on?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 KAREN
                        I did! 

                                 LISA
                        You gotta get over him, Rach!

           Rachel's peppy demeanor suddenly turns to sadness.

                                 NOAH
                        You okay, Rachel?

                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah, um, my boyfriend dumped me 
                        right before winter break. This is 
                        our song... This was our song.

                                 NOAH
                        Oh, I'm sorry.

                                 RACHEL
                        Will you, um, dance with me?

                                 NOAH
                             (beat)
                        Huh?

                                 RACHEL
                        Just dance with me for the next two 
                        minutes, at least until the second 
                        verse. Please.

                                 NOAH
                        Uh... Yeah...

           Noah takes her by the hand. The two BEGIN to SLOW DANCE. 

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        I'll pay your cousin back. It might 
                        take a while but--

                                 RACHEL
                        Don't worry about it. That girl is 
                        a whiney little brat.

                                 NOAH
                        I'm sure she's not that bad.

                                 RACHEL
                        You never had to babysit her.
                        You're pretty good with kids, 
                        though, huh?

                                 NOAH
                        What do you mean?

           Rachel MOTIONS to Slater, Blithe and Rodrigo who are now 
           playing DARTS with Shamus and the Southies. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 RACHEL
                        They seem like they're having a 
                        great night. 

                                 NOAH
                        It's getting better.

           Noah SMILES at her and the two share a moment, swaying to 
           Bryan Adams, looking into each other's eyes. For a moment it 
           looks like they might kiss... But then RING!!!!

           Noah takes out his IPHONE...

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        I gotta take this. It's my 
                        girlfriend.

                                 RACHEL
                        Of course it is. 

                                 NOAH
                        Actually, I gotta go. Thanks for 
                        being cool. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Sure. Thanks for the dance.

           Noah smiles at her. She smiles back.

           EXT. IRISH PUB - NIGHT

           Noah exits the bar, followed by the kids. He's got the PHONE 
           up to his EAR.

                                 NOAH
                        Where are you?

                        Fuck that! This party is off the

                        No, you listen to me, you were 
                        supposed to be here hours ago and 
                        you're dicking around--

                        Jesus, Noah, do we have to do this 
                        right now?

                                 NOAH
                        Just answer the question.

                        Then trust me. You have to leave 
                        that party. There's a Dunkin' 
                        Donuts across the street from the 
                        Mods. Leave now. I'll be there in 
                        ten minutes. Okay?
                             (silence)
                        Okay?!

                        Okay! 

           Noah hangs up the phone and turns to the kids. 

                                 NOAH
                        Everyone get in the car.

           Slater and Blithe hop in, but Rodrigo hangs back.

                                 RODRIGO
                        I told you. They are not my brother 
                        and sister. These people are not a 
                        family. They are strangers who live 
                        the same big house. That is not a 
                        family. 

                                 NOAH
                        Look, Rodrigo, sometimes the truth 
                        hurts. But the truth is, they're 
                        the only family--

                        You know nothing about family! Your 
                        father throw you away like garbage 
                        and get himself a new son. A better 
                        son. A handsome son!

                                 RODRIGO
                        Yeah, the truth hurts, gringo!

                                 NOAH
                        Just get in the fucking car. 

           Rodrigo, stone faced, gets in the car.

           EXT. BENTLEY - NIGHT

           The Bentley RACES down the street, running a RED LIGHT. 

           EXT. DUNKIN DONUTS - NIGHT

           The Bentley comes SCREECHING into the PARKING LOT. Noah, 
           Slater, Blithe and Rodrigo SPRINT from the car. 

           INT. DUNKIN DONUTS - NIGHT

           TWO POLICE OFFICERS eat DONUTS at a counter. Noah NOTICES 
           them as he and the kids ENTER. Then Noah SPOTS MARISA, who's 
           back is to us, at a table. Noah is completely RELIEVED.

                                 NOAH
                        Marisa! Thank God!

           Noah RUNS UP to Marisa and GRABS her shoulder... ONLY IT'S 
           NOT MARISA... It's ANOTHER GIRL, who turns around and THROWS 
           her STEAMING HOT COFFEE in Noah's FACE. 

                                 ANOTHER GIRL
                        Get off me, you creep!

                                 NOAH
                        AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!! My face!!!!

           The Girl RUNS out of there. Noah is still SCREAMING IN PAIN. 
           He's now attracted the attention of the Two Police Officers. 
           They RISE from the table and APPROACH Noah. They have kind 
           eyes and sympathetic faces.

                                 POLICE OFFICER # 1
                        Can we have a word with you, son?

           Noah hesitates... starts to EMPTY HIS POCKETS on the COUNTER.

                        Let's see, got a cell phone, some

           Officer O'Malley TAKES the BAGGIE OF COKE and EXAMINES it.

                                 OFFICER FRANK
                        Seven thousand dollars in cash?

           Officer Frank TAKES the CASH and EXAMINES it.

                                 OFFICER O'MALLEY
                        Looks like he drove over here in a 
                        Bentley. 

                                 OFFICER FRANK
                        Is that your car, son?

                                 NOAH
                        Uh...

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Officer Frank takes out a POLICE SKETCH-- that we saw earlier 
           on TV -- it's of Noah.

                                 OFFICER O'MALLEY
                        Is this you?

                                 NOAH
                        Um...

                                 OFFICER FRANK
                        Why don't you tell us what's going 
                        on, son?

           Noah hesitates. He looks over at the kids.

                                 SLATER
                        Just tell them the truth, Noah.

           Noah looks back at the Police Officers. HOLD ON Noah.

           EXT. DUNKIN' DONUTS - MOMENTS LATER

           Noah stands opposite the Police Officers, who are still 
           holding onto Noah's cash, lint, etc. Noah's explaining: 

                                 NOAH
                        ...anyway, my girlfriend was 
                        supposed to meet us here. She 
                        hasn't shown up, so she's probably 
                        still at that party. And pretty 
                        soon these guys are gonna come and 
                        I need to get to her, so that they 
                        don't hurt her. 

                                 OFFICER O'MALLEY
                        Karl and Julio?

                                 NOAH
                        That's right. Karl and Julio.

                                 OFFICER FRANK
                        So, let me get this straight, you 
                        blew up a restaurant bathroom, 
                        involved three minors in an illicit 
                        drug deal that went afoul, burgled 
                        a Bat Mitzvah... 

                                 OFFICER O'MALLEY
                        That's gotta be a first.

                                 OFFICER FRANK
                        And that's not the end of your 
                        little crime spree, is it?

                                 OFFICER O'MALLEY
                        Nope, like a hopped up Energizer 
                        Bunny, you kept going and going....

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 OFFICER FRANK
                        You also pulled a grand theft on 
                        your father's auto, then a B&E on 
                        the family store.

                                 OFFICER O'MALLEY
                             (shaking his head sadly)
                        Stealing from your own flesh and 
                        blood?

                                 OFFICER FRANK
                             (shaking his head sadly)
                        You're in deep trouble here, son.

                                 OFFICER O'MALLEY
                        This is not good. 

                                 NOAH
                        I know... I know... I take full 
                        responsibility. I just need your 
                        help right now.

                                 OFFICER FRANK
                        Well, he did come clean.

                                 OFFICER O'MALLEY
                        Yeah, he sure did. Ok, first things 
                        first. We're gonna go put out an 
                        APB on these Karl and Julio 
                        characters. Wait right here. 
                        Everything's gonna be okay, son. 

                                 NOAH
                        Thank you so much, Officers. 

           The Two Officers head for their car. Noah walks over to 
           Slater, Blithe and Rodrigo who are by the Bentley. 

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        Hey, guys, I'm probably gonna get 
                        arrested right now. Listen, I just 
                        wanted to apologize to you guys. 
                        You know, I screwed up pretty badly 
                        and I put your lives in danger and 
                        I didn't mean to. Everything just 
                        got out of hand so quickly...

           WE NOTICE that BEHIND Noah the TWO OFFICERS are COUNTING 
           NOAH'S MONEY. They finish and HIGH-FIVE each other.

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        ...and, I just wanted to say that I 
                        was sorry. I'm sorry for 
                        everything...

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           The Two Officers get into their PATROL CAR and START the 
           ENGINE. They REVERSE at top speed and SCREECH OUT OF THERE. 
           Noah SLOW... LY... REALIZES... WHAT... IS... HAPPENING... 

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        Wait a second...? Are they...? 
                        They're leaving?!

                                 RODRIGO
                        Yeah, they're leaving!

           Noah FLIPS and CHASES after them.

                                 NOAH
                        Wait! Where you going? Wait! I need 
                        that money! Where you going?! Wait!

           Noah stops running, the COP CAR is long GONE. 

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        Oh, no, no, no, no...!

           Noah then hears the DISTANT SOUND OF PARTY MUSIC. He look up 
           across the street and spots A PARTY TAKING PLACE IN THE MODS 
           DORMITORY. We HOLD ON Noah looking at the party. 

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

           Noah, Slater, Blithe and Rodrigo enter. The PARTY IS IN FULL 
           SWING. Noah SCANS the CROWD.

                                 NOAH
                        Do me a favor and watch your 
                        brother and sister, Slater.

                                 SLATER
                        I'm on it, Noah.

                                 NOAH
                        Thanks, Slater, I'm gonna go get my 
                        girlfriend.

           Noah starts walking through the PARTY. No sign of Marisa. He 
           reaches a STAIRCASE and climbs to the SECOND FLOOR. 

           He goes in and out of ROOMS. PARTY PEOPLE are DRINKING, 
           LAUGHING, DRUGGING. But, no Marisa. 

           He OPENS a BEDROOM DOOR and spots a BONG CIRCLE taking place. 
           TIFFANY (21) wasted, is in the middle of a bong hit. The HUGE 
           BONG she is smoking is FOUR FEET TALL AND FILLED WITH WATER.

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        Tiffany! Where's Marisa?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                        There you are, Noah! Woo-hoo! Did 
                        you bring the snow, Saint Nick?

                                 NOAH
                        Where the fuck is Marisa?

                                 TIFFANY
                        Where the fuck is my coke? You 
                        promised the forecast was snowy!

                                 STONER# 1
                        Yeah, make it snow, Papa Noel.

                                 STONER # 2
                        Yeah, what happened to the snow 
                        flurries, Santa? 

                                 NOAH
                        I don't know, you guys tell me, 
                        what do I fucking look like Al 
                        Roker?

                                 STONER #1
                        No, actually you remind me of a 
                        young Ernest Borgnine.

                                 STONER # 2
                        Oh yeah!

                                 STONER # 3
                        Good call!

                                 TIFFANY
                        We want snow! We want snow!

           Every PARTYGOER in the room joins in:

                                 PARTYGOERS
                        We want snow! We want snow!

                                 NOAH
                        Okay, okay, okay! Everyone listen 
                        up!

           Everyone settles down, waits on BATED BREATHE.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        I was wrong, the forecast doesn't 
                        call for snow... 

           A collective GROAN from the Partygoers.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        ... it calls for a hundred percent 
                        chance of rain!

           CONTINUED: (2)

           And with that Noah PICKS UP the HUGE BONG and DUMPS IT ALL 
           OVER TIFFANY AND THE STONERS-- SPRAYING them in BONG WATER.

                                 PARTYGOERS
                        Party foul...! What the hell...?! 
                        Ah... Fuck me!

                                 NOAH
                        No thanks!

           Noah BOLTS out of the room. Noah RACES out back into the 
           HALLWAY, towards the STAIRCASE and STOPS short... At the foot 
           of the STAIRS ARE JULIO AND KARL. They start CLIMBING the 
           stairs towards him.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Fuck, fuck, fuck!

           Noah spins around and RUNS in the other direction. He BUSTS a 
           left into a DARKENED BEDROOM, where a COUPLE ARE HAVING SEX 
           ON THE BED. Noah JUMPS on the bed and HOPS over them.

                                 GUY SEX PARTNER
                        What the hell, dude? I'm banging my 
                        girl here.

                                 NOAH
                        Uh... Sorry...

           Noah OPENS A WINDOW and begins CLIMBING OUT.

                                 GIRL SEX PARTNER
                        Kleinfeld? I thought you got kicked 
                        out of school. 

                                 NOAH
                        No, I was suspended... 

           Noah JUMPS out the WINDOW and lands...

           EXT. PARTY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ...on the ROOF of the FRONT PORCH. He climbs over the LEDGE 
           and hangs there for a moment, TANGLED IN CHRISTMAS LIGHTS, 
           where he LOOKS THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOWS AND SPOTS:

           BLITHE IS ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE, DANCING LIKE A STRIPPER. 
           SHE IS SURROUNDED BY A LARGE GROUP OF DRUNK PARTYGOERS WHO 
           ARE WATCHING HER AND EGGING HER ON.

           I Wanna Rock by 2 Live Crew's Luke Skyywalker is blaring. 

                                 NOAH
                        Blithe? Shit!

           Noah lets go of the LEDGE and FALLS to the GROUND. He jumps 
           back up and runs back through the...
           INT. PARTY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Front door, where he SPOTS Slater and Rodrigo.

                                 NOAH
                        Slater! What the hell's your sister 
                        doing?!

                                 SLATER
                        I don't know! I couldn't stop her!

           Noah RACES out into the DINING ROOM and PUSHES HIS WAY PAST 
           THE CROWD. He gets to the Dining Room TABLE, Blithe continues 
           to dance like a stripper, as the CROWD IS GOING NUTS.

                                 CROWD
                        Shake them titties, baby! / Shake 
                        them titties, baby! 

                                 NOAH
                        Blithe! Get down from there!

                                 BLITHE
                        Leave me alone! I'm crunking!

                                 NOAH
                        No, there's no crunking! Get down! 
                        That's an order! 

                                 BLITHE
                        They love me! I'm like a 
                        celebutante! I'm a celebutante!

                                 NOAH
                        They don't love you! They're 
                        fucking drunk. They're making fun 
                        of you!

                                 BLITHE
                        You're just a hater who's never 
                        gonna be famous! No one is ever 
                        gonna know who you are, Noah! No 
                        one is ever gonna care about you!

           Noah CLIMBS up on the TABLE and GRABS HER. The CROWD BOOS! 

                                 NOAH
                        Get down from there!

                                 BLITHE
                        Help! Help! Help! He's drinking 
                        Hater-ade! He's drinking Hater-ade!

           Noah makes his way back out of the party, DRAGGING Blithe, 
           with Noah and Rodrigo behind him. Just then he SPOTS Marisa 
           coming out of the BATHROOM. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 MARISA
                        Where the fuck have you been? This 
                        has been the worst night ever! 

                                 NOAH
                        You have no idea.

                                 MARISA
                        No, you have no idea. I've been 
                        waiting for you for like four hours 
                        ... Wait. Who are these kids?

                                 NOAH
                        I'll explain later. We have to go. 

                                 MARISA
                        Did you get the coke?

                                 NOAH
                        No. Marisa, listen to me we, have 
                        to go. We have to go! 

           But, Marisa is looking towards the front door and none other 
           than RICKY FONTAINE has just gotten to the party. He's with a 
           GROUP OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS. On his arm, is MODEL GIRL, who 
           looks like she just cat-walked out of a VICTORIA'S SECRET 
           catalogue. 

           Marisa, as if in a trance, starts to walk towards him.

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        Marisa, wait! We don't have time!

                                 MARISA
                        I have to go say hello, Noah! He's 
                        my ex-boyfriend.

                                 NOAH
                        No, we have to get out of here!

           But, Marisa isn't listening. She heads straight for Ricky 
           Fontaine. Noah follows her.

                                 MARISA
                        Hey, Ricky.

                                 RICKY FONTAINE
                        Oh, Marisa, what's up? 

                                 MARISA
                        If you really cared what's up, 
                        you'd return an e-mail every once 
                        in a while.

                        say it before you get it into your 
                        skull? It's over. Quit stalking. 

           Marisa looks like she MIGHT CRY. Noah steps in.

                                 NOAH
                        Hey, don't worry, Ricky. She's over 
                        it. 

                                 RICKY FONTAINE
                        Noah? Get the fuck out of here, 
                        fucktard. This isn't your business.

                                 NOAH
                        ... because Marisa has moved on. 
                        She's dating me now.

                                 MARISA
                        Noah, no--!

                        Yeah, that's right. We're in a 
                        relationship.

                                 RICKY FONTAINE

                        You're such a fucking loser, 
                        Marisa. You're letting Noah

           Ricky Fontaine starts to SHOVE HIM. 

                                 RICKY FONTAINE (CONT'D)
                        Come on, Jew Boy. Come on... 

           He KEEPS SHOVING HIM HARD.

                                 RICKY FONTAINE
                        So, do something. Hit me!

           Then from OUT OF NOWHERE... RODRIGO JUMPS on Ricky Fontaine's 
           back! He BITES Ricky's EAR! Ricky SCREAMS IN PAIN! 

                                 RICKY FONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck?! What the fuck?!

           Ricky tries to throw Rodrigo off, but RODRIGO IS CLINGING to 
           his back, BITING HIS EAR. Ricky keeps SCREAMING! 

                                 RICKY FONTAINE (CONT'D)
                        Get off me! Get him off me! Get him 
                        off me! 

           Finally Ricky manages to THROW RODRIGO OFF. Rodrigo goes 
           FLYING and lands on the ground. 

                                 RICKY FONTAINE (CONT'D)
                        I'm gonna fucking kill that shit! 

           Ricky goes to STOMP on Rodrigo, but Noah gets in his way.

                                 NOAH
                        Let him go! Stop! Come on, he's

                        You're his babysitter, Noah? 
                        Hahahaha! 

           The ENTIRE PARTY ROARS WITH LAUGHTER at Noah.

                                 RICKY FONTAINE (CONT'D)
                        Oh, man, how much more pathetic can

                        don't you just kill yourse--

           Noah can't take it anymore. HE THROWS THE HARDEST PUNCH OF 
           HIS LIFE. He HITS Ricky square in the face. Ricky for a 
           moment is stunned. Noah is stunned too. Everyone is stunned. 
           Then a slow smile creeps over Ricky's lips. 

                                 RICKY FONTAINE (CONT'D)
                        And now you die.

           Ricky BRINGS BACK HIS FIST... Noah's eyes go wide... Ricky 
           let's his PUNCH FLY... But, Noah does something unexpected... 
           HE DUCKS! Ricky ends up PUNCHING THE WALL. We HEAR A LOUD 
           CRACK!!!! Ricky SCREAMS IN PAIN!!!

                        move!

           Noah THROWS Marisa over his SHOULDER. He NODS to Slater.

                                 MARISA
                        Is that Karl?

           By now Karl and Julio are RACING TOWARDS THEM. Noah, carrying 
           Marisa over his shoulder, SPRINTS out of there, with the kids 
           keeping pace behind them.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT 

           Noah, Marisa still over his shoulder, BOOKS to the Bentley. 
           The kids aren't far behind. Karl and Julio are CATCHING UP. 

                                 MARISA
                        Put me down! Put me down!

                        Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

           Suddenly, RODRIGO TRIPS and FACE PLANTS. He GROANS in PAIN. 
           Noah DOES NOT NOTICE, neither does Slater or Blithe.

                                 RODRIGO
                        Ahhh! My ankle! Yeah! My ankle!

           Blithe SENSES SOMETHING and STOPS, LOOKS BACK.

                        Rodrigo!

           Blithe runs back to help Rodrigo. She TRIES to pull him up.

           Rodrigo just stares back them, both SLATER and BLITHE

           Rodrigo's MIND IS WORKING, SOMETHING INSIDE HIM IS MOVED BY 
           HIS SIBLINGS' EFFORT TO SAVE HIM... 

           Karl and Julio are FAST APPROACHING...

                                 SLATER
                        They're catching up!

                                 RODRIGO
                        Yeah! They're catching up! 

           With that, Slater and Blithe manage to get him to his FEET... 
           Blithe and Slater HELP RODRIGO to the car... As Karl and 
           Julio CLOSE IN ON THEM... 

           INT. BENTLEY - CONTINUOUS

           They all PILE into the car. Noah frantically starts the 
           ENGINE, and hits REVERSE... Just as Karl and Julio near the 
           car... Karl and Julio DIVE out of the way to avoid getting 
           hit. Noah TAKES OFF...

           Paul Simon's Me and Julio Down By The Schoolyard begins to 
           play over the following CHASE SEQUENCE.

           INT. BENTLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Noah has not let up on the gas. He's SPEEDING like CRAZY.

                                 MARISA
                        Noah, what the hell is going on?

                        I inadvertently stole ten grand 
                        worth of coke and now Karl and 
                        Julio want to kill me and do things 
                        to you that haven't been seen since 
                        the last Rocco Siffredi movie.

                                 MARISA
                        Who the hell is Rocco Siffredi?

                                 SLATER
                        Uh, Noah, we got company!

           Noah's eyes dart to the REARVIEW MIRROR, where he spots a 
           1969 DODGE CHARGER is FAST APPROACHING. Noah SLAMS his foot 
           against the GAS... The Bentley picks up SPEED...

                                 NOAH
                        Everyone buckle up!

           Everyone complies and BUCKLES UP. Noah zips the Bentley 
           through TRAFFIC, zig-zagging his way past other cars... The 
           Dodge picks up speed... 

                                 SLATER
                        They're getting closer!

           The Dodge is now right behind them, and pulls up close and 
           BUMPS the Bentley from behind. Everyone in the car SCREAMS in 
           PANIC. The Dodge BUMPS them again, this time HARDER. 

                                 NOAH
                        Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

           Noah JERKS THE WHEEL HARD TO THE LEFT, the Bentley WHIPS on 
           to an EMPTY SIDE STREET. The Dodge FOLLOWS. 

           The Dodge SWERVES into the LEFT LANE, GUNS THE ENGINE, and 
           pulls up next to the Bentley. Julio is HANGING OUT THE 
           WINDOW, WAVING A SHOTGUN.  

                                 JULIO

           Noah ROLLS DOWN THE WINDOW.

                                 NOAH
                        Oh, hey, Julio, what's up, bro?!

           BLAM! Julio FIRES the SHOTGUN into the AIR.

                        Pull the car over, Noah Kleinfeld!

           Just then RODRIGO HAS REMOVED A CHERRY BOMB from his POCKET 
           AND LIT IT.

           Rodrigo THROWS THE CHERRY BOMB INTO THE DODGE CHARGER.

                        What the fu--?

           KABLOOM! The Cherry Bomb EXPLODES! The Dodge SWERVES OFF THE 
           ROAD, hits an EMBANKMENT MADE OF SNOW... The Dodge FLIES IN 
           THE AIR... FLIPS OVER AND CRASHES...

                                 NOAH
                        Holy shit, Rodrigo! I think you

                        Yeah, I think I killed them. 

                                 SLATER
                        Do you really think they're dead?

           Noah thinks about it, his mind RACING... He SLAMS on the 
           BREAKS and PULLS THE CAR OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. 

                                 MARISA
                        What are you doing?

                        Everyone, just sit tight.

           EXT. EMPTY STREET - NIGHT

           Noah EXITS the car and starts heading for the DODGE CHARGER. 
           He picks up SPEED... 

           EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - NIGHT

           The Dodge is FLIPPED OVER and is UPSIDE DOWN, the BACK TIRES 
           ARE STILL SPINNING. Noah reaches the car out of breath... He 
           warily approaches the DRIVER SIDE... He bends down to look 
           inside, but DISCOVERS THE CAR IS EMPTY.  

           CHA-CHICK! Noah SPINS around, only to find Karl and Julio 
           standing there. Julio has got his SHOTGUN AIMED at Noah.

                                 KARL
                        You are in deep fucking shit, Noah

                        For the last time, man, we ain't 
                        your fucking bros.

                                 KARL
                        Why do you keep calling us that? 

                                 NOAH
                        Okay, you guys are upset. I get 
                        that, and, I'm gonna get you your 
                        money and pretty soon, we're just 
                        gonna be laughing about all this-- 

                                 KARL
                        No, I don't think so. You stole 
                        from me, then you ruined our night 
                        and now you made me crash my car. I 
                        don't want your money, Noah 
                        Kleinfeld, I just want to kill you.

                                 NOAH
                        But, I came back to make sure you 
                        guys were okay. I mean, don't I 
                        score some points for that?

                        Yeah, you score points for being 
                        stupid. Now say good night.

           Julio RAISES the Shotgun and AIMS it at Noah.

                                 KARL
                        Wait, not here. In the woods. 

           Julio motions Noah to head for the woods.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Noah enters the woods with Karl and Julio close behind. Noah 
           notices both Karl and Julio are LIMPING.

                                 NOAH
                        Are you guys alright from that 
                        crash?

                                 KARL
                        We're better than you.

                                 NOAH
                        'Cause I notice you're limping.

                                 JULIO
                        Limping ain't gonna prevent me from 
                        pulling this here trigger.

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, but it might get in the way 
                        if you try to... RUN!

           And with that, Noah is off like a ROCKET. Noah begins RACING 
           through the WOODS. Karl and Julio RUN AFTER HIM. BLAM! Julio 
           FIRES THE GUN. SHOTGUN PELLETS WHIP PAST NOAH'S HEAD. 

                                 JULIO
                        Get back here, Noah Kleinfeld!

                                 NOAH
                        No fucking way!

           Noah SNAKES his way through the darkened woods, CRASHING 
           through BRANCHES, JUMPING over LOGS... BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

           Each SHOT narrowly MISSES Noah, as he continues his MAD DASH. 
           Karl and Julio keep up, with Julio FIRING all the way.

           Noah races out of the WOODS, and finds himself suddenly 
           SLIDING ACROSS A FROZEN POND... He SLIPS, FALLS on his BACK. 

           He desperately stands up, right as Karl and Julio break into 
           the clearing. Julio's got the shotgun up and steadies it 
           towards Noah. Noah puts his hands up.

           Julio steps out onto the FROZEN POND... Julio SLIPS for a 
           moment, but catches himself and continues towards Noah...

                        twine... Mmmm. Five hole, top 
                        shelf, don’t matter to Julio, so 
                        long as the biscuit finds the back 
                        ‘a the net...

           CREEEAAAAAAAAAAK...

                                 NOAH
                        We’re going to die--!

                        ...goddamn! I was so good they used 
                        to call me “Hat Trick” Julio--

           CRASH! The ICE GIVES OUT and both Noah and Julio FALL into 
           the water. They both begin to FLAIL. Julio starts SINKING.

                                 JULIO (CONT’D)
                        Karl! Karl! Help! I can't swim!

                        I'm coming, man!

           Karl takes a few steps back and runs towards the POND about 
           to DIVE IN, but then STOPS short.

                                 KARL (CONT'D)
                        How cold is it?

                        motherfucker! Help! I'm drowning!

                                 KARL
                        How can you not know how to swim?

           Noah is swimming away from them.

                                 JULIO
                        Help! Help! I'm drowning, Karl!

                                 KARL
                        I know but that water looks really 
                        cold, man!

           Julio starts to SINK... Noah, hesitates, turns around and 
           swims back to Julio. He DIVES down, grabs Julio and DRAGS him 
           to the side of the pond, where Karl is waiting. Julio has 
           passed out. Noah is out of breath. Karl SMILES at him.

           Karl LIFTS Noah to his feet and RUNS him straight into a 
           NEARBY TREE. Noah falls to ground.

                                 NOAH
                        Ow, my face, Karl, Christ!

           Karl starts to PUNCH Noah repeatedly in the FACE. 

                                 KARL
                        That's for stealing my drugs! 
                             (wham!)
                        That's for making me chase you all 
                        night!
                             (wham!)
                        And this is for making me crash my 
                        motherfucking '69 Dodge Charger!

           Karl REELS BACK his FIST...

                        Stop! 

           They look up. Julio has woken up. He stands. 

                                 JULIO (CONT'D)
                        Let him go, Karl. 

           Karl begrudgingly let's Noah go.

                        Noah Kleinfeld, don't you got kids

                        So...? Are we cool?

                        But, we're not.

           With that Julio BELTS Karl and proceeds to BEAT THE SHIT OUT 
           OF HIM. Noah takes this opportunity to turn and get the hell 
           out of the woods.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Noah, DRIPPING WET, SHIVERING, heads for the Bentley.

           INT. BENTLEY - NIGHT

           Noah enters the car. Marisa and the kids look at him 
           expectantly.

                                 MARISA
                        You're all wet. Jesus, Noah, you're 
                        freezing.

           Noah turns on the HEAT.

                        Everything okay?

                        Everything is A-okay.

           From OUTSIDE WE HEAR THE DISTANT SOUND OF SIRENS.

                        We heard gunshots, so we called the

                        That was good thinking, Slater... 
                        Guys, I know I did a lot of fucked 
                        up things tonight. But, I'm gonna 
                        do one more fucked up thing. And I 
                        promise this will be the last 
                        fucked up thing I do.

           Noah starts the car, puts it in drive and RACES AWAY. 

           EXT. ZAKIM BRIDGE - NIGHT

           The Bentley drives over the bridge, AWAY from Boston. 

           INT. BENTLEY - NIGHT

           Noah pulls up in front of Marisa's HOUSE. The kids are ASLEEP 
           in the back. Noah NUDGES Marisa AWAKE.

                                 NOAH
                        There you go. Door to door service.

                        You know, I think you're right, 
                        Noah. I don't think I'm over Ricky.

                        You were never in love with me. You 
                        just wanted to fuck the hot girl 
                        from high school, that's all. 
                        That's all anyone ever wants from

                        That's not true. I got suspended 
                        because of you. I didn't have to 
                        tell them that it was me who copied 
                        your paper. I could've told them

                        copied mine.

           Marisa leans in and KISSES him on the CHEEK. She goes inside. 
           Noah starts the car again.

                        don't you come sit up front and 
                        keep me company?

           Blithe climbs into the FRONT SEAT.

                                 BLITHE
                        I'm sorry I said you're never gonna 
                        be famous, Noah. I'm sure you can 
                        be famous someday, you know, if you 
                        worked out a little, and dressed 
                        hotter.

                                 NOAH
                        I don't want to be famous, Blithe. 
                        Do you ever think about why you 
                        want to be famous?

                        Isn't it obvi? Because, when you're 
                        a famous celebrity, everyone loves 
                        you.

                        and me, I felt like a total loser. 
                        I got all depressed, started 
                        painting my nails black. Hell, I 
                        even dabbled in eyeliner. Spent all 
                        day listening to The Cure. Then one 
                        day I looked at myself and 
                        realized, I'm still a loser, now 
                        I'm just a Goth Loser. And being a 
                        Goth Loser is like ten notches 
                        below regular loser. You follow?

                                 BLITHE
                        Yeah, being Goth is not hot.

           Noah LEANS OVER and PULLS DOWN HER SUN-VISOR, he FLIPS OPEN 
           THE MIRROR.

                                 NOAH
                        You know what else isn't hot?

           Blithe STARES at her REFLECTION, and for the first time she 
           sees what she really looks like with all that make-up, some 
           type of GROTESQUE CLOWN.

                        Paris Hilton is a clown. Acting 
                        like her isn't going to get you 
                        more friends, or make you more 
                        interesting. And it's not going to 
                        stop your dad from kissing his 
                        assistant Deborah. 

           Blithe is silent. She then removes some NAPKINS and begins to 
           WIPE HER FACE CLEAN. 

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        You know what Blithe means?

                        What does it mean?

                                 NOAH
                        It means joyous. 

           Blithe finishes cleaning her face. She looks back at the 
           MIRROR, and we can tell she likes what she sees.

                        We're in luck, they're not home 
                        yet!

           ... Onto the driveway...

           INT. POLK'S HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Noah parks the Bentley. 

                                 NOAH
                        Alright, guys, let's go, get inside 
                        and get ready for bed!

           The kids RACE out.

           QUICK CUTS

           Noah WIPES down the dash.

           Noah CLEANS the hood with his spit and a shirt.

           Noah TOSSES the garbage out.

           Noah RACES inside the house.

           INT. POLK'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Noah HUSTLES in to find Slater and Blithe in their pajamas on 
           the couch, watching tv. Noah smiles... then stops.

                                 NOAH
                        Where's Rodrigo?

                                 SLATER
                        Uh, he was here a second ago.

                                 NOAH
                        Oh, no... Split up! Split up! Find 
                        Rodrigo! Go! Go! Go!

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Noah, Slater and Blithe RACE in DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS through 
           the house, room to room.

                                 NOAH/SLATER/BLITHE
                        Rodrigo...?! Where are you?!

           Noah checks the BATHROOM.

                                 NOAH
                        Rodrigo?!

                                 SLATER (O.C.)
                        He's in here! The kitchen!

           Noah RUNS.

           INT. POLK'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER

           Noah SCRAMBLES into the KITCHEN.

                                 NOAH
                        Rodrigo?! Didn't I tell you...

           Noah STOPS when he SEES SOMETHING OFF CAMERA that gives him 
           pause. Slater and Blithe are staring off screen as well, in 
           complete awe. 

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Whoa...

                                 BLITHE
                        I can't believe it.

                                 SLATER
                        Seriously, that is the most messed 
                        up thing I've seen all night.

                                 NOAH
                        Uh... Rodrigo?

           We reveal that Rodrigo is ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES CLEANING UP 
           THE BOTTLE OF WINE HE BROKE EARLIER IN THE NIGHT. Noah looks 
           at Slater and Blithe who just SHRUG.

                                 RODRIGO
                        Yeah, I'm cleaning up the mess I 
                        made.

           Rodrigo DISPOSES of the rest of the trash. Just then THEY 
           HEAR DR. AND MRS. POLK'S CAR PULLING INTO THE DRIVEWAY.

                                 NOAH
                        Alright, you three, get to the 
                        couch! Go! Go! Go!
           INT. POLK'S HOUSE - SECONDS LATER

           All four JUMP onto the couch just as...

           WE HEAR the JINGLE of KEYS at the FRONT DOOR.

                                 NOAH
                        Slater, turn on the tv!

           Slater turns on the tv...

           Only to find that RICKEY FONTAINE'S FACE is on the NEWS. 

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)
                        Bill, the only information we know 
                        at this point is that Rickey 
                        Fontaine broke his hand at a party 
                        and he will not be playing in the

                        He also made a racial slur, which 
                        should be enough to get him kicked 
                        out of college.

                        anti-Semitic racial slurs--

           Noah can't help but smile. MRS. POLK ENTERS. Mrs. Polk SPOTS 
           Noah and the kids in the TV Room and FROWNS.

                                 NOAH
                        Hey, welcome back.

                        Noah, what happened tonight?

                                 NOAH
                        Huh?

                        It's past one in the morning, these 
                        kids should be in bed already.

                        This is a school night for them...

           Mrs. Polk turns around to face the tv. Without noticing 
           Noah's portrait, she grabs the remote and turns OFF the tv. 

                                 NOAH

                        It's not his fault. 

                                 SLATER
                        Yeah, we told him our bedtime was 
                        one thirty.

                        Yeah, they fooled me. Not cool,

                                 MRS. POLK
                        Shame on you kids... Well, it's 
                        time for bed. Say good night to 
                        Noah and maybe he'll be nice enough 
                        to come back and babysit again. 

                                 SLATER
                        I don't think so. 

                                 MRS. POLK
                        Why not, Slater? Is everything 
                        okay?

                                 SLATER
                        Yeah, it's just. I'm thirteen. I 
                        think I can babysit myself. 

                                 MRS. POLK
                        But, Doctor Bella said--

                                 SLATER
                        I'm done with Doctor Bella.

                        Yeah, and my sister, she's not a 
                        puta anymore.

                                 MRS. POLK
                        Oh... A what?

           Mrs. Polk looks oddly at Noah. He shrugs innocently.

                                 MRS. POLK (CONT’D)
                        Okay then, let's get to bed, kids. 

           The kids go to head upstairs.

                                 MRS. POLK (CONT’D)
                        Noah, my husband has your money.

                             (to the kids)
                        Bye, guys.

           The three kids WAVE to Noah, he turns to leave when:

                                 MRS. POLK
                        Wait a minute, Noah, stop right 
                        there!

                                 NOAH
                        Uh... Yeah?

           Noah looks back nervously, he looks at the kids, they're 
           nervous too.

                                 MRS. POLK
                        I almost forgot. Your mother wanted 
                        me to tell you not to wait up. She 
                        and Dr. Stevens went off to have a 
                        nightcap. You should've seen her, 
                        Noah, she was having the night of 
                        her life.

                                 NOAH
                             (beat, he smiles)
                        Nice. Thanks for setting them up, 
                        Mrs. Polk.

                        Thanks for babysitting, Noah.

           Mrs. Polk smiles. Noah exits. The kids head upstairs.

           FOYER

           Dr. Polk is sorting through the mail. He SPOTS Noah.

                        I would be very careful with how

                        It's you who should be careful,

                        months with nothing to do. So, I'm 
                        gonna be keeping an eye on your 
                        kids and I'm gonna be keeping

                        straightened up, Doctor. Have a

           Noah STARES HIM DOWN. Dr. Polk goes WHITE. Noah exits.
           EXT. POLK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Noah picks up his BMX. He takes one last look at the house. 
           On the SECOND FLOOR he spots Slater, Blithe and Rodrigo at 
           the WINDOW looking down at him. Rodrigo's got a SPARKLER. 
           Noah SMILES.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey, douche bag, need a lift?

           He turns and spots Rachel sitting in his dad's MERCEDES. Noah 
           approaches the car.

                                 NOAH
                        Rachel...? How'd you find me?

           Rachel points to Rodrigo's GPS TRACKING UNIT.

                        This gizmo on the dash kept 
                        beeping, so I followed it to this 
                        house. Are you happy I did?

           Just then Noah's PHONE RINGS. He takes it out, looks at it.

                                 RACHEL (CONT'D)
                        Let me guess. Your girlfriend?

                                 NOAH
                        No, I broke up with my girlfriend

                        Oh...?

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah. It's actually my dad. I'll 
                        just let that one go to voicemail. 

           He puts the phone away.

                        Scoot over, it's probably a good 
                        idea to let me drive.

           Noah gets into the car. He looks at her.

                        So, uh, you wanna grab something to 
                        eat?

                                 RACHEL
                        It's kinda late, isn't it?

                                 NOAH
                        Are you kidding me? The night is 
                        young.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Noah SMILES, Rachel SMILES back at him. Noah puts the car 
           into drive and they take off. 

                                 THE END
