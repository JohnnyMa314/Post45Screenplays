           EXT. DUTCH HARBOR - ALASKA - NIGHT

           FROM ABOVE 

           Rugged, snow-covered peaks tower over a tiny frontier town 
           and the largest fishery in the United States...the center of 
           crab operations for the Bering Sea - the wildest, most 
           dangerous stretch of water in the world.  

           CLOSER ON THE HARBOR

           The 90 ships that make up the Bering Sea crab fleet...manned 
           by a rag tag navy of old salts, ex-cons and family men 
           hellbent on making a fortune or dying in the process. 

           It’s a flurry of activity as all the ships frantically gear 
           up for a long trip. 

           CLOSE ON ONE OF THESE SHIPS - THE MAGGIE MAY

           A BLINDING FLASH OF SPARKS cascades into ice-flecked water. 

           REVEAL the sparks erupt from a welding torch on the deck of 
           the 200 FOOT CRAB FISHING SHIP.  

           It’s an old rust-bucket that’s clearly seen better days. Her 
           hull is an awkward patchwork of welded metal and fatigue. 

           The Maggie May is tied to an ice-coated dock along with a 
           gaggle of other ships...

           A MASKED WELDER puts the finishing touches on the hydraulic 
           arm of a DECK-MOUNTED CRAB POT LAUNCHER. 

           Beside the welder, CLIFF BAYLISS (30’s), the Maggie May’s 
           big, bullish Deckboss, works the controls of the ship’s CRANE 
           between the ship and  

           THE DOCK 

           Where a FUEL TRUCK is PUMPING DIESEL into the ship. 

           Cliff has just picked up a pallet full of BAIT - lifting it 
           25 FEET OVER THE ACTIVITY. 

           Hitching a ride on the pallet is DECKHAND PETE FRYE (late 
           20’s wiry, blond, surfer-mellow). 

           Pete casually lights a smoke as he takes in the view. 

           With a WHINE of hydraulics, Cliff lowers the pallet to the 
           ship’s deck.
           ON THE SHIP’S DECK

           Pete clambers off like a monkey, unhooks the pallet beside 
           boxes upon boxes already on deck. 

           Beyond the pallets...A HUNDRED CRAB POTS (800lb, 6x6x2 steel 
           crab traps) are stacked like enormous legos, loosely held 
           together by lengths of chain. 

           These guys are nearing the end of a very long day, prepping 
           the ship for battle. 

           Pete steps onto the hook for the return trip to the dock. 

           Cliff hits the controls, has Pete ten feet over the dock 
           before he notices the lit cigarette. 

           He shouts up to Pete. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Knievel. Put the smoke out. 

           He looks pointedly at a FUEL TRUCK, PUMPING DIESEL into the 
           ship just below Pete.  

                                 PETE
                        Dude. My last one. 

           ON CLIFF as he smiles enigmatically -  

                                 CLIFF
                             (sotto)
                        No problem, Petey. 

           Cliff abruptly switches up on the controls - 

           THE CRANE ABRUPTLY CHANGES DIRECTION - sending captive Pete 
           back over the deck...

                                 PETE
                        Cliff. Dude. 

           And Pete is suddenly hanging over the icy, dark water on the 
           other side of the ship. 

           Cliff lowers him towards the water...only feet below...yet 
           the guy is mellow as ever.  

           CREWS OF NEARBY CRAB SHIPS CAT-CALL at Pete’s expense. 

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        This shit isn’t funny. 

           Cliff chuckles to himself as Pete’s boots touch water. 
           Pete finally gets some life as he tries to climb the cable 
           like a cat...cigarette still hanging from his mouth. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey! We got no time for you to be 
                        artistic, bud. 

           Reveal CAPTAIN BEN LARSEN (early 30’s) coming out of the 
           deckhouse. A control freak with a perpetual frown - Ben leads 
           his men into battle with the toughest of love. 

           He shouts to the oblivious Welder as he checks his watch. 

                                 BEN
                        It’s nine. Gotta be outta here by 
                        midnight. Where’re you at?

                                 WELDER
                        About done - 

           Ben finally looks up to the crane - follows the arm to Pete, 
           dangling over the water...smoke still in his mouth. 

                                 BEN
                        Cliff. For chrissakes, be a 
                        Deckboss. 

           Pete overhears the exchange, puffs contentedly as Cliff 
           sullenly gets to work pulling him back to the ship. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Pete. Put the fucking smoke out. 

           Cliff flips Pete the bird as the deckhand dejectedly tosses 
           his smoke to the water. 

           The Welder checks a list as Ben turns back to him. 

                                 WELDER
                        ...got your saltwater 
                        pumps...crane...propeller shaft. 
                        All that’s left is those deck 
                        cleats.

           He uses his boot to tap a RUSTED, FATIGUED METAL CLEAT set 
           into the deck beside the tall stack of pots...already 
           creaking under the chains.  

                                 BEN
                        Will they last through this trip?

                                 WELDER
                        Sure...yeah, I mean - 
                                 BEN
                        Then we skip it. Can’t load my pots 
                        with you working on the cleats.
                        Just invoice me, okay - 

                                 WELDER
                        You still owe me from the last two - 

                                 BEN
                        You’ll get your money.

           EXT. DOCK - SAME

           A PICKUP TRUCK pulls to a stop beside the ship. 

           NATE LARSEN (mid 30s) gets out of the bed, retrieves a 
           stuffed army GREEN DUFFEL. Only a few years older than Ben, 
           but could pass for an uncle. The world has not been kind to 
           Nate.   

           He waves to the NATIVE ALEUT DRIVER as the truck drives off.

           He absorbs the frenzy on the dock and the ship with a smile.

           He looks pointedly at a small FAMILY CREST, an intricate 
           design built around the letter ‘L’, painted above the 
           wheelhouse windows. 

           The paint is faded and cracking, but it’s still there. 

           EXT. SHIP’S DECK - A MOMENT LATER

           Nate climbs from the dock to the deck. He watches Cliff 
           operate the crane for a moment before he drops his duffel to 
           the planks, getting Cliff’s and Pete’s attention. 

                                 CLIFF 
                        Well look what the cat heaved up.
                        Pete, take over for a minute. 

           Pete ignores Nate’s outstretched hand. 

                                 PETE
                        When’d you get out? 

                                 NATE
                        A while ago, man - 

           But Pete doesn’t care, he’s already turned his back as 

           Cliff leaves the controls, moves to Nate. 
           Nate reaches out to shake Cliff’s hand..Cliff grabs it. 

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        You smell like bait -  

           Cliff PUNCHES Nate in the stomach - dropping him. 

           Pete nods with approval from behind the controls. 

           Nate doubles over as Cliff waits for a response...

           There’s a brief flash in Nate’s eyes, but he remains Zen. 

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        Good to see you too. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Thought Ben was high when he said 
                        you’d be on this trip. 

                                 CLIFF (CONT’D)
                        I ain’t your junior no more. I’m 
                        Deckboss now. You fuck around with 
                        me, I’ll throw you in the bait 
                        chopper. 

                                 NATE
                        Past is the past. 

           Cliff’s skeptical. Ben approaches.  

                                 BEN
                        We’re running late. 

                                 NATE
                        Missed you at the airport - 

           Ben doesn’t stop moving as he checks the Welder’s work on the 
           pot launcher. 

                                 BEN
                        Didn’t have the time. Too many 
                        repairs, too much to take care of.

           Nate follows him across the deck.  

                                 NATE
                        All you had to do was tell me. 

                                 BEN
                        Fuck me if I’m gonna have to hear 
                        this pity-party for a month on the 
                        water. 
           Nate’s thrown off by the sudden hostility. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You got to town like every other 
                        deckhand.  
                             (beat)
                        Where the fuck is Brady? 

                                 CLIFF
                        Meeting us at the bar. 

           Ben looks at the progress on the ship...mostly done - only a 
           few pots left on the deck. 

           OTHER CREWS are getting in trucks and cars, heading off the 
           dock and back into town. 

                                 BEN
                        Fuel topped off?

                                 CLIFF
                        Yep. 

           Ben checks his watch, whistles to Pete to take a break.  

                                 BEN
                        Fuck it. To the bar. 

           EXT. DOCK - A MOMENT LATER

           Ben, Pete, Cliff and Nate approach Ben’s pick up - 

           CHET GRIGGS (early 20’s) earrings and goatee, sits on his 
           army duffel bag nearby, a wool beanie pulled tight over his 
           head. He’s got the gaunt, hopeful look of the starving and 
           desperate...

                                 BEN
                        I told you we’re crewed up. Try the 
                        other captains - 

                                 GRIGGS
                        I did. 

                                 BEN
                        Well, then you’re fucked.

           Pete shakes his head at the poor kid as he shuffles down the 
           dock...obviously freezing his ass off.  

                                 PETE
                        The less jobs there are, the more 
                        retards show up.
           Cliff moves to get in the truck with Pete and Ben, nearly 
           forcing Nate into the open-air bed. 

                                 BEN
                        Cliff. Ride in back. 

           Cliff gives Nate a look of death, climbs into the bed.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BEN’S TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Cliff is bundled up in the bed, freezing his ass off and 
           grumbling to himself. 

           INT. BEN’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Tense silence as Ben drives, Nate sits on the passenger side 
           with Pete stuck in between. 

                                 PETE
                        You best be on your game this time. 
                             (to Ben)
                        And he sure as shit better not be 
                        anywhere near the helm. 

           He takes a drag off a cigarette...HE’S MISSING A FINGER. 

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        Fingers don’t grow back, asshole. 

           He blows the smoke in Nate’s face. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. EAGLE’S ROOST - CONTINUOUS

           T. REX’S ‘CADILLAC’ BLARING from an ancient jukebox in the 
           seedy fisherman’s bar...a triple-wide trailer on blocks.  

           The place is jammed to the flocked ceiling with rowdy, drunk 
           crewmen blowing their hard-earned cash the night before their 
           month-long battle with the Bering. 

           Linoleum, fishing relics and photos, prefab wood-panelling: 
           it has the charm of an elk’s lodge, circa ‘72.

           The only women in the bar are WAITRESSES, kept busy either 
           slapping groping hands away or collecting huge tips as they 
           deftly maneuver with trays of drinks. 
           AT THE BAR

           The eye of the hurricane...a GROUP OF OLDER CAPTAINS AND 
           DECKHANDS (40’s/50’s) sit perched on the stools. 

           Among them, DANNY MONTOYA (early 30’s). He’s gaunt and 
           unshaven, looks like he hasn’t slept or showered in weeks.   

           The men chain-smoke, watching the end of the bar with 
           fascination...a pile of money between them.

           AT THE END OF THE BAR - the main attraction. 

           SOL HAVERSHAM (50’s) wild-eyed and grizzled (and clearly 
           plastered) sloooowly works his ‘magic’ on BONNIE (40’s). The 
           BARTENDER.

           A menthol dangles from her lips as she watches Sol struggle 
           to produce his lighter. Drunk or sober, everything Sol does 
           is slow and considered.

           Bonnie impatiently rolls her eyes towards the men down the 
           bar - a silent plea...they barely contain their laughter. 

           Sol balances on his stool as he finally, slowly pulls his 
           Zippo from a shirt pocket...it’s excruciating.

           He winks ‘smoothly’ as he tries to spark a flame for her...

                                 BONNIE
                        Get it up, big boy. I got faith. 

           A YOUNG DECKHAND passes by, sees her dangling cigarette - 
           SPARKS A LIGHTER. 

           She gives a look of warning to the kid, who looks down the 
           polished oak TO SIX ANGRY GLARES STARING HIM DOWN. 

           The Young Deckhand sheepishly disappears into the crowd as 

           Sol finally gets a SPARK...

           Bonnie uses her lips to angle it towards the flame - trying 
           to help him along.

           Montoya is nervously biting his nails to the quick. 

                                 MONTOYA
                        Don’t you dare move those lips. 

           Sol finally gets within centimeters...SLOOOWWWLY closing in. 

           Every one of the men is rapt...LEANING in anticipation...
           AND HE FINALLY CONNECTS...

                                 MONTOYA (CONT’D)
                        GODDAMMIT SOL. 

           GROANS from everyone except TWO MEN at the other end of the 
           bar - who receive the pile of crumpled cash. 

           Bonnie takes a satisfying drag off her smoke as she winks at 
           Sol - moves to the winners circle, hand held out. 

           They grudgingly give her a share of the winnings...

           As Sol falls off his stool. 

           ACROSS THE BAR, the door opens. 

           REVEALING Cliff, Pete and Ben...reluctantly followed by Nate. 
           He knows this place well and has no desire to be back.

           The guys get the familiar greetings from the OTHER 
           CREWS...even Nate, who gets some surprised looks - some 
           people had no desire to see him back either. 

           The group wades to the bar where Montoya slaps down every 
           denomination of the dollar to settle his debt.

           Ben signals Bonnie as he helps Sol to his feet. 

                                 BEN
                        Three Wise Men.

           Cliff and Pete whoop it up. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (to the guys)
                        We’re back at the dock in an hour. 
                        No bullshit.
                             (re: Sol)
                        Pot of coffee for the old man, 
                        Bonnie. 

           Sol lays eyes on Nate, reacts as only Tommy Chong can. 

                                 SOL
                        Oh. Hey, Nate. 

           He gives Nate a sloppy hug. 

           Montoya turns at the mention of Nate. 

                                 MONTOYA
                        Holy shit. I heard it but didn’t 
                        believe it. Welcome back, man. 
           He claps Nate on the shoulder. It’s the friendliest greeting 
           Nate’s gotten so far. 

                                 NATE
                        Thanks, Montoya - 

                                 MONTOYA
                        You got ten bucks I can borrow...?

           He indicates the pile of wadded cash on the bar and the 
           ANNOYED CAPTAIN waiting for Montoya...

                                 NATE
                        Nothing changes around here.

                                 SOL
                        Fuck no it doesn’t.  

           Nate reaches for his wallet.

           Bonnie pours a row of shots for the guys...upends three 
           bottles into each glass...Beam, Daniels and Cuervo. 

           Each man grabs his glass, except Nate. Cliff nudges him.

                                 CLIFF
                        Pick it up. 

                                 NATE
                        I can’t. Would you make mine a 
                        Coke, Bonnie - 

           Cliff stops Bonnie with a hand. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Fuck the steps. You don’t drink the 
                        booze, it’s bad juju.  

           The crew stares him down...including Ben. 

           Nate finally picks up the glass as Ben’s CELL GOES OFF. 

           He checks the CALLER I.D...sets his glass down.

                                 BEN
                        Just a minute. 

           They collectively groan as Ben hustles outside. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Chicks, man. 
           EXT. THE ROOST - A MOMENT LATER

           Ben paces in the freezing cold and relative quiet of the 
           parking lot, phone pressed to ear. 

           He speaks with patience and tenderness...much different than 
           he is with the crew. 

                                 BEN
                             (into phone)
                        Yeah, Nate made it in. 
                             (listens)
                        No. It’ll be fine as long he keeps 
                        his mouth shut.  

           He abruptly changes the subject. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        She feeling better? Temperature 
                        gone down? 
                             (beat)
                        Good, good. 

           He winces as he listens - turns emotional for an instant. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I know...I love you too. You stay 
                        warm and I’ll see you before you 
                        know it - 

           Blinding HIGH BEAMS as a truck pulls into the gravel lot. 

           BRADY WILTON (early 20’s - small, wiry and scrappy) storms 
           from the passenger side, slams the door - cutting off a 
           SCREAMING TIRADE from his GIRLFRIEND, the driver. 

                                 BRADY
                        Fucking twat. 

           He reaches into the bed of the truck, pulls out his duffel 
           and kicks the car for good measure as she POUNDS THE HORN and  
           fishtails away, PEPPERING him and Ben with gravel. 

           Ben calmly goes back to his conversation - he wipes the dew 
           from his eyes as we see him go back to ‘Coach Ben’. Can’t let 
           the guys see you cry. 

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, honey. Brady just got here.
                             (beat)
                        I love you too. Bye. 

           He hangs up as Brady walks towards him. 
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You alright? 

                                 BRADY
                        I’m fucked. 

           He shows Ben his hand...so swollen he can’t wear a glove. 

           Ben instinctively grabs him around the neck. 

                                 BEN
                        That better not be from Sue’s face 
                        you piece of shit - 

                                 BRADY
                        Fuck no! You know I wouldn’t do 
                        that.
                             (sheepish)
                        I punched the fucking door. 

           Ben lets him go - mind spinning at the idea of being one man 
           down so close to the start time. 

                                 BEN
                        Jesus H.

                                 BRADY
                        I swear I’m good to go - 

                                 BEN
                        Bullshit.  

           Brady pleads. 

                                 BRADY
                        We’ll be out on our asses if I 
                        don’t come back with a cut.  

           Ben shakes his head, thinking it through. 

           INT. THE ROOST - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben and Brady rejoin the assembled crew at the bar.

           All raise their glasses as Ben and the men give the required, 
           and oft repeated toast.

                                 BEN
                        As dad used to say...

                                 BEN AND CREW 
                        Times are hard,
                        Wages are small,
                                 (MORE)
                                 BEN AND CREW  (CONT'D)
                        Drink more whiskey,
                        Fuck ‘em all.

           The men slam their shots...and Nate’s eyes are drawn to 
           Brady’s swollen hand. 

           He trades a look with Ben. Ben’s eyes are clear: ‘it’s not 
           your problem’. Ben’s in charge. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DUTCH HARBOR - NIGHT

           Snow falls on the harbor as a fierce wind whips up a chop. 

           DOZENS OF FISHING VESSELS of various sizes stream out of the 
           bay for the start of the season, headed into the open water 
           of the Bering Sea - toward the crab grounds. 

           A distant last in the long line of ships is the newly 
           repaired MAGGIE MAY, breaking the white-caps at top speed. 

           EXT. MAIN DECK

           The light snow is blown horizontal by the wind as they head 
           towards open water....where the seas are rougher as well. 

           Nate is running the blocks of frozen bait through the BAIT 
           CHOPPER - a huge meat grinder, while - 

           Pete and Cliff double check the chains securing the pots. 

           Montoya coils and secures one of the thick ropes that had 
           tied the ship off to the dock.

           Griggs, the hopeful greenhorn, watches Montoya, trying to 
           learn, but is more focused on keeping his balance as the ship 
           crashes through the rough waters.

           He staggers sideways, gripping the bulwark for support.

           Montoya smirks at Griggs who’s already sliding on 
           accumulating deck ice. 

                                 MONTOYA 
                        Lucky for you Brady fucked up his 
                        hand. 

           Montoya looks to the water ahead where a lit BUOY MARKER bobs 
           violently in the waves.
                                 MONTOYA (CONT'D)
                        Bad luck for all of us if we don’t 
                        make that buoy pronto.

                                 GRIGGS
                        Why?

                                 PETE
                        Midnight is Friday. No one leaves 
                        Dutch on a Friday. Bad luck.

           Griggs isn’t sure if they’re fucking with him or not.

                                 GRIGGS
                        So we’ll just turn around, right?

                                 MONTOYA 
                        Up to the cap’n. But if we do, I’m 
                        gonna kick Brady’s ass.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHEELHOUSE 

           Ben at the helm, Brady close by - a fresh cast on his injured 
           hand...already graffiti’d to look like a crab claw.  

           He anxiously looks at the buoy marker in the water ahead, 
           then back to the mounted digital clock that reads 11:57.

                                 BRADY
                        C’mon c’mon...

           Ben guns the ship past the buoy marker just before

           The clock marks 12:00. 

           Brady sighs, raising his cast in prayer. 

                                 BRADY (CONT’D)
                        Thank. Fucking. God.  

           Ben smiles, doesn’t slow as he speeds away from Dutch. 

           EXT. MAGGIE MAY - MAIN DECK

           The crew watches the marker buoy fly past - they all look up 
           to the wheelhouse.

           Ben gives the thumbs up through the glass. 
           The men HOOT and HOLLER.

                                 MONTOYA
                        Gonna be a damn lucky trip. I feel 
                        it in my bones. 

           EXT. DUTCH HARBOR - FROM ABOVE

           Instead of following the rest of the fleet north, the Maggie 
           May makes a hard turn left, cruises to the west. 

           ON THE MAIN DECK

           Nate watches the rest of the fleet moving away - 

                                 NATE
                        Where the fuck is Ben taking us?

                                 CLIFF
                        Some secret spot your Dad had. 

                                 NATE
                        You fucking kidding? That’s Russia. 
                        Only time Dad ever went out there 
                        was on a bet. 

           Cliff smiles. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Virgin fishing, man. 

                                 NATE
                        Illegal fishing, Cliff. Those 
                        Russians don’t screw around. We’ll 
                        be lucky if they don’t blow our 
                        ship out of the water on sight. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Whatever, man. Captain’s decision. 
                        And you ain’t captain. 

           Cliff whistles with glee as he walks away. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MAIN DECK - DAY

           CHYRON: ‘TWO WEEKS LATER’

           A clear day, but dark clouds approach on the horizon...and 
           with it - turbulent water. 
           WAVES SWELL and CRASH against the faded blue hull, covering 
           the Maggie May in WHITE EXPLOSIONS of freezing spray. 

           A thick crust of ice coats the rigging and bulwarks... 
           dangling hundred pound icicles over the crew’s heads. 

           Except for Ben and Brady, all hands are on deck, in orange 
           hooded slickers, gloves and galoshes, grinding through.

           Longer beards, bags under eyes: these guys haven’t bathed or 
           slept in days - they’re running on empty. 

           Griggs staggers toward the side rail, grips it for support 
           and hangs his head overboard...for the umpteenth time. 

           Next to the pot launcher, Pete coils some rope while Montoya 
           readies a small grappling hook attached to another line of 
           rope. 

                                 PETE
                        Where’s that newbie enthusiasm? 
                        Thought you’d have sea legs by now. 

           Griggs says nothing, clings to the rail. 

           Pete looks to the horizon where ominous, dark clouds are 
           rolling in.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        You think this has been snotty? 
                        Last couple weeks have been a 
                        pleasure cruise.

           Montoya points Griggs towards the horizon. 

                                 MONTOYA
                        See those clouds in the distance?  
                        Aleutian Gray. That means fifteen, 
                        twenty foot swells comin’ our way.
                             (beat)
                        So get off my rail and get back to 
                        the bait before it gets worse. 

           He pulls Griggs off the rail and shoves him towards the BAIT 
           TROUGH under the wheelhouse. 

           The kid fights more dry-heaves as Montoya expertly hurls the 
           heavy hook over the rail into - 

           THE FREEZING WATER

           The hook snags a length of rope draped between two 
           FLUORESCENT BUOYS bobbing between rolling swells...
           Montoya swiftly uses the line to pull the hook, rapidly grabs 
           the rope hand over hand as the ship motors past the buoys. 

           He attaches the buoy line to a MOTOR-DRIVEN WINCH beside the 
           pot launcher at the rail. 

           Rubber wheels snag the length of rope, quickly reels it in, 
           then coils the rope into a container beneath the wheels.   

           The TWO BRIGHTLY COLORED BUOYS pop over the rail with the end 
           of the rope, and the line GOES TAUT as a heavy CRAB POT 
           begins to peek from the water...

           BESIDE MONTOYA, Sol operates the hydraulic CRANE CONTROLS. He 
           swings the long crane arm into position above the pot. 

           Montoya attaches a hook dangling from the crane to the pot, 
           and Sol raises the crane arm.

                                 MONTOYA (CONT’D)
                        Our luck’s gotta change. I’m 
                        bettin’ two-fifty. Who’s in?

                                 CLIFF
                        You broke fuck. What are you 
                        bettin’ with? Your boots? 

                                 NATE
                        Be happy if we get a hundred. All 
                        we need is a hundred per pot for 
                        the next two weeks and we’ll be on 
                        track. 

           All watch in anticipation as the 800-pound steel pot is 
           slowly hoisted out of the sea and hauled over the bulwark.

                                 CLIFF
                        C’mon, baby. No whammies...no 
                        whammies...

           The dripping pot is finally lifted into view...

           IT’S EMPTY, except for a couple of crabs, some trash fish, 
           and the dangling bait bag. 

           Montoya grunts, annoyed.

                                 CLIFF (CONT’D)
                        This ship is fucking cursed. 

                                 MONTOYA
                        I blame Nate. 
           Sol lowers the crane, while Nate and Cliff carefully guide 
           the heavy pot into position on the launching platform.  

                                 NATE
                        Blame your captain.  He’s the one 
                        who’s dropped a hundred pots 
                        illegally in Russian waters and 
                        won’t fucking leave. 
                             (shakes his head)
                        All our eggs in one basket, even 
                        with the ice pack knockin’ on our 
                        door. 

           The pot bangs heavily against the bulwark before thudding 
           onto a slanted launching platform, rail-side. 

           Sol flips a lever, triggering hydraulic clamps on the 
           platform - LOCKING THE HEAVY POT TO THE PLATFORM so that it 
           doesn’t slip off and crush the men. 

           Cliff swings open a gate on the bottom of the pot. A half-
           dozen fish fall into the sorting table in the center of the 
           deck. The fish flopping around wildly.

                                 MONTOYA
                        I think Benny may also have 
                        confused herring season with opi’s. 

           Pete throws the fish overboard, where waiting GULLS and TERNS 
           battle over the free lunch.

           Nate carries the two spindly Opilio crabs to the center of 
           the deck, drops them through a LARGE OPEN HOLE into the WATER-
           FILLED CRAB TANK.

           He looks up to - THE WHEELHOUSE WINDOWS - where Ben peers 
           through the window onto the deck just below. 

           Nate holds up two fingers. 

                                 NATE
                        There’s two for ya, bud. 

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ben stands next to his captain’s chair in a cockpit of 
           COMPUTER MONITORS, RADIOS and a HARDWIRED SATELLITE PHONE 
           mounted beside it all. 

           His body is tense with frustration as he smokes a cigarette 
           down to its nub. 

           He looks like shit. Twice as bad as the crewmen.
           Ben grinds the smoke out in a Red Bull can overfilled with 
           butts.

           He looks out the window at Nate signalling below, grabs a 
           radio mic connected to the main deck’s PA system.

                                 BEN
                             (into mic)
                        I can count it from here, you 
                        retarded fuck.

           BELOW - ON DECK, Nate turns his two-finger signal into TWO 
           MIDDLE FINGERS.

           Ben marks the count in the LOG BOOK. 

           CLOSE ON THE LOG BOOK - only single digit numbers for weeks. 
           They’ve been struggling to find the crab. 

           BELOW - ON DECK, Cliff remains by the empty pot, looking up 
           to Ben, asking for direction with an exaggerated shrug.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (into mic)
                        Stack it with the rest. We’ll 
                        finish pulling up the pots on this 
                        string and move on.

           Ben SLAMS THE MIC DOWN, then turns to a monitor displaying a 
           topographic map of the Bering Sea.

           He lifts his cap and scratches his head in frustration, 
           stares at the cryptic lines searching for inspiration.

           EXT. MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

           The men continue their work in the freezing spray...as Ben 
           shouts a warning from the P.A. system.  

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        Duck. 

           The men pause and duck as a HUGE WALL OF WATER washes over. 

           Griggs is too slow. His legs whisk out from under him. 

           He SKIDS across deck with the water, GRABS HOLD OF THE 
           SORTING TABLE - saves himself from a concussion...and 
           possibly being washed over. 

           As the water recedes...LAUGHTER ERUPTS behind him. 

           He turns to find Cliff watching him with glee. 
           Griggs is slow to get up. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Suck it up, Skidmark.  

           Griggs gets up, staggers back to Cliff and the pot...

           REVEALING SKIDMARK written in sharpie across his back - his 
           new nickname.  

                                 CLIFF (CONT'D)
                        Bait bag’s waiting and so are we.

           Griggs climbs into the open pot, reaches toward the dangling 
           bait. He moves slowly, fumbles to unhook it.

           Cliff grows more impatient.

                                 CLIFF (CONT'D)
                        You making out with it? Let’s go.

           Griggs finally unhooks the bait, wriggles out of the pot.

                                 CLIFF (CONT'D)
                        You got one job right now. Bait. 
                        That’s it. Shouldn’t be that hard.

           Griggs stares back at Cliff a beat, anger burning. Cliff 
           squares off with him.

                                 CLIFF (CONT'D)
                        Yes?

           Griggs backs off, heads toward the bait trough as 

           Sol lifts the empty pot with the crane. Cliff and Nate guide 
           it to the mostly empty stack of twenty already stacked near 
           the front of the ship. 

           Griggs is visibly upset by Cliff’s abuse. Pete approaches.

                                 PETE
                        Don’t mind those assholes. 

           Griggs’ anger subsides as he takes this in. 

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        Better a nickname than goin’ for a 
                        swim. 

           Pete winks and gets back to work clearing the sorting table. 

           A SWELL ROCKS THE SHIP, shakes the pot from Nate and Cliff’s 
           grip.
           Sleep-deprived Sol is slow to react as Nate drops to the 
           deck, ducking as the heavy pot swings loose on the crane arm. 
           IT BANGS INTO THE STACK, hard enough to squash him like a 
           bug. 

                                 NATE
                        Whoa - 

           He looks to Sol, who looks nearly as scared.

                                 SOL
                        You okay?!

           Nate gets up, shoots Sol a dirty look. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SHIP’S GALLEY - LATER

           BELOW DECK a cramped kitchenette with the basic amenities of 
           an RV. Latched wooden cabinets and shelves with braces jammed 
           with cans and cans of tuna.

           The cans of food and utensils SLIDE and CLANG behind the 
           braces as the ship does acrobatics in the worsening weather. 

           Brady clumsily prepares a line of TUNA SANDWICHES, his 
           plaster cast is covered in graffiti...and SMEARED with food.

           It’s amazing that the guy can even prepare food as the floor 
           continuously drops and comes up again...much less one-handed. 

           Nearby, Nate, Cliff, Sol and Montoya sit in a vinyl u-shaped 
           booth around a formica galley table.

           Everyone is fine with the motion in the ocean.

           Stripped of their orange weather gear, they lounge in sweat-
           soaked thermals and flannel, casually brace their cups of 
           coffee as the ship rides the steep swells. 

           They’re exhausted and ravenous.

                                 CLIFF
                        Let’s go. Starving over here. 

                                 NATE
                        You’re not sick of this shit yet? 

           Brady drops the plate of sandwiches on the table.

           Montoya stares at the unappetizing food.
                                 MONTOYA
                        Hmmm...the Sue Special.  

                                 BRADY
                        Shut your trap. 

                                 MONTOYA
                        What, man? That’s what I hear. Your 
                        girlfriend’s got the best fish 
                        tacos around.

           Cliff starts laughing, spitting up chunks of tuna. Nate 
           avoids the sight. 

                                 BRADY
                        Fuck you both.  

           Nate reaches for a sandwich, sniffs it with distaste.

                                 NATE
                        Smells like the bait box.

                                 BRADY
                        Better get used to it. We’re out of 
                        everything else. We’ll be eating 
                        tuna sandwiches, grilled tuna 
                        patties, tuna on toast...

           Montoya tries to shrug it off, reaches for a sandwich.

           Sol indifferently takes a bite of his sandwich.

                                 SOL
                        Nothing wrong with tuna. 

                                 BRADY
                        Right. You assholes bought the 
                        first thing you saw so you could go 
                        get wasted while we were prepping 
                        to leave. 

           Cliff is relishing his sandwich. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Don’t see what the problem is. 
                        We’re fishermen. 

           Ben interrupts the moment as he exits the head (restroom), 
           shakes his head at Brady’s pile of opened tuna cans.

                                 PETE
                        You hungry? You can have mine.

           Ben reaches for the coffee pot instead.
                                 BEN
                        I’m fine.
                             (beat)
                        I’ll relieve Griggs from the helm, 
                        and then we’re back on the crab. 

                                 NATE
                        I’m sure I’m not the only one that 
                        could use a siesta. Even a short 
                        one -

                                 BEN
                        This is a dinner break, no time for 
                        sleep.

           Exhausted GROANS all around.

                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                        Storm’s moving in. Gotta get the 
                        rest of the gear up before we lose 
                        it under the ice-pack. 

           Montoya starts to protest, but Ben is faster.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Eat. Then back on deck.

                                 NATE
                        It’s been twenty hours straight - 

           Ben ignores him. He retreats up the stairs to the wheelhouse.

           Nate looks to the rest of the guys, who offer him no back up. 

           Montoya grumbles.

                                 MONTOYA
                        Shit, if that’s how it is, then I’m 
                        gonna eat slooowly.

           Nate scoots from the booth, follows Ben upstairs.

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Griggs sits in the captain’s chair. His body is rigid and 
           eyes wide as he keeps a white-knuckle grip on the JOG LEVER 
           and STEERING CONTROLS. 

           It’s his turn on watch and he’s not comfortable with it, to 
           say the least. 

           Ben comes up the stairs behind him, shakes his head at 
           Griggs’ anxiety. 
                                 BEN
                        No need to be so fucking tense. 
                        You’re doing fine. 

           He observes Griggs for a moment, satisfied with what he sees.

           Griggs doesn’t take his eyes from the water. Still tense as 
           he pushes the jog lever forward a notch, bow pointed into a 
           large wave.  

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Good. Always keep her pointed into 
                        the swells. 
                             (re: the rough water)
                        This shit’s cake, you got the easy 
                        shift. 

           Griggs nods gratefully as Ben resumes control. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Get downstairs and eat before it’s 
                        gone. Need you back on deck in 
                        five. 

           Griggs moves to leave, makes way as Nate enters.

           Griggs notes the tense exchange as he heads down the stairs. 

           Nate hovers uncomfortably at the stairwell as

           Ben retakes his seat at the helm. SLEET and SPRAY lash the 
           windows as the seas worsen outside. 

           REVEAL three computer flat-screens that Ben begins checking.

           ON ONE SCREEN - SONAR DATA and corresponding graphics to 
           indicate the vast underwater topography of the Bering Sea 
           fishing grounds.

           ONE ANOTHER SCREEN - shows the RADAR DISPLAY for miles 
           around...the comparably tiny ship in the FAR NORTHWEST...very 
           close to Russia...

           AN OVERLAID RED DOTTED LINE, nearly vertical, cuts through 
           the map just to the east of their position. This is both the 
           International Dateline and, this far north, the maritime 
           border between Russia and the United States. 

           Our guys are firmly in Russian waters. 

           ON ANOTHER SCREEN - A WEATHER MAP, to the north - A GIANT 
           MOVING MASS OF ODD-SHAPED BLOCKS...like a broken wall of 
           bricks. 
           It’s the ice pack, moving down from the Arctic Circle. 

           Even more bad weather is clearly on the way. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck do you want, Nate?

                                 NATE
                        We shouldn’t have dropped pots 
                        anywhere this far west. We haven’t 
                        even seen any Russian ships out 
                        here.

           Ben’s in no mood.

                                 BEN
                        Just thought we’d get some luck, 
                        for once -

                                 NATE
                        Besides being dangerous, why’d you 
                        think Dad hadn’t been here since 
                        ninety-one?

                                 BEN
                        Fine. I take the blame.
                             (beat)
                        Doesn’t matter anyway. We still 
                        need to pick up those pots or we’ll 
                        have the ice bustin’ buoys left and 
                        right. And if we lose that gear I 
                        don’t have sixty fucking grand to 
                        replace it. Do you?

           Nate’s silent as Ben chain lights another smoke. 

                                 NATE
                        We need sleep. We’re worn out, 
                        getting sloppy. Sol almost popped 
                        my head like a grape -

                                 BEN
                        You’ve forgotten what it’s like to 
                        pull a long shift.

                                 NATE
                        Bullshit. It ain’t fair to drive us 
                        hard because of your fuck up. 

                                 BEN
                        I’m doing what I need to keep us in 
                        business - 
                                 NATE
                        There’s gonna be a bad accident.

                                 BEN
                        I don’t need you telling me about 
                        accidents, Nathan. 

                                 NATE
                        This won’t be your wheelhouse for 
                        much longer -

                                 BEN
                        Get out of my wheelhouse. 

                                 NATE
                        The bank’s been sending letters to 
                        Ma. They want to repo the fucking 
                        ship. 

                                 BEN
                        I’ve already talked to the bank, 
                        I’ve worked it out. She doesn’t 
                        have to worry - 

                                 NATE
                        Really? She talked to them too. 

                                 BEN
                        I said I worked it out. Back off. 

                                 NATE
                        She doesn’t trust you. She wants me 
                        in the mix. 

                                 BEN
                        Fuck you. 
                             (beat)
                        All you had to do was stay home. 
                        Wait for your checks. Blow it on 
                        booze, blow - I don’t give a shit.

                                 NATE
                        I own as much of this business as 
                        you and it’s dying. 

           Ben shakes his head at him. 

                                 BEN
                        All that garbage you put Mom and 
                        Dad through... Can’t just jump in 
                        and be the swingin’ dick now, 
                        Nathan. You lost your shot.
                                 NATE
                        Past is the past, Ben...

           Ben doesn’t bother looking up from his computer screen as 
           Nate leaves, frustrated and unheard by his younger brother. 

           INT. GALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Griggs sits with the men as they shovel food in their maws - 
           desperate for the protein. 

           Nate angrily bounds down the stairs, doesn’t bother even 
           looking at the crew as he heads for the equipment room.

           Montoya chuckles under his breath. 

                                 CLIFF
                        And big bro gets put in his place. 

                                 GRIGGS
                        What’s the deal? You guys all treat 
                        Nate like shit. 

                                 PETE
                        He’s a fuck up -

                                 CLIFF
                        Just like you, Griggs. 

           Sol shakes his head at the turn of conversation. 

                                 SOL
                        You’re a bunch of teenage girls. 

           Cliff ignores Sol. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Asshole fell asleep at the wheel, 
                        filling in for his daddy. Rolled 
                        the ship off St. Paul’s. 

                                 GRIGGS
                        No shit? 

                                 CLIFF
                        Lost our engineer. 

           Montoya crosses himself. 

                                 PETE
                        And my fucking finger. 
                                 CLIFF
                        I don’t trust him. 

                                 MONTOYA
                        Bad mojo for sure. 

           Griggs doesn’t look too happy with the new info.

                                 SOL
                        Fuck you and your mojo. I’ve known 
                        the Larsen kids longer than you’ve 
                        been diddling your wee peckers.

           Sol looks to Griggs.

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        Ever a man you wanted watching your 
                        back at sea, it’s Nate. Poor guy 
                        was in the wrong place at the wrong 
                        time. Nothing more. It’s fishing. 
                        It’s dangerous. 

           The men are silent as Sol gets up from the table. 

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - SAME

           OUTSIDE BEN’S WINDOW - The swells have gotten worse. Freezing 
           rain and sleet coming down harder. Bad things are brewin’...

           But Ben isn’t focussing on that...

           Instead, his eyes are glued to his monitor. He brings up a 
           new map on the screen.

           A RADIO SUDDENLY COMES TO LIFE WITH A ‘VHF’ BROADCAST - 

                                 AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        WEATHER. ALERT. 

           It’s a modulated, text-to-voice weather-bot from the National 
           Weather Service. 

                                 AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        TO-NIGHT THROUGH TO-MORROW. SEVERE 
                        STORM WARNING. ICING CONDITIONS - 

           Ben turns the broadcast down as he gets back to steering his 
           ROCKING AND ROLLING ship.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. BERING SEA - LATER

           The storm bears down with full-force. Clouds of thick snow 
           and spray descend on the Maggie May as it PLOWS through white 
           caps, hunting for its last few precious and most likely empty 
           pots. 

           BRIGHT ORANGE SODIUM LIGHTS attempt to create some visibility 
           in the near white-out...creating a surreal ORANGE CURTAIN OF 
           SNOW cutting across the deck. 

           ICE covers every surface of the ship. It’s like alien 
           terrain. 

           BARELY VISIBLE IN THE DISTANCE...the field of broken, rapidly 
           solidifying ice rolls slowly and ominously in the rough seas. 

           Time’s running out. 

           EXT. SHIP’S DECK - CONTINUOUS

           The crew continues the monotonous grind, hauling the empty 
           pots from the churning water like Zombies on autopilot. 

           Despite the conditions, the exhaustion has gotten them in a 
           kind of rhythm as they slip and slide on their sea legs. 

           EXT. WHEELHOUSE ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           No longer needed as bait boy, Griggs now chops at the ice   
           covering the TOP OF THE WHEELHOUSE with an axe...getting 
           perilously close to the edge - FIVE STORIES ABOVE THE WATER. 

           Griggs slips on his ass, luckily grabs the wire-railing to 
           steady himself. 

           EXT. MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Cliff watches Griggs, shaking his head at the greenhorn’s 
           perceived ineptitude. 

           EXT. WHEELHOUSE ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           Griggs moves closer to a THERMOS-SIZED YELLOW canister on the 
           edge of the roof - COATED WITH ICE. 

           IT’S AN EPIRB: Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon. As 
           soon as it leaves its cradle, it emits a signal to the Coast 
           Guard for rescue...
           Griggs swings the axe over his head to smite the ice around 
           the EPIRB - 

           EXT. MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Cliff panics at the sight. He SCREAMS up to the greenhorn. 

                                 CLIFF
                        What the fuck are you doing?!

           Griggs doesn’t hear him...SLIPS once again on the ice - 
           stalling his axe strike. 

           Cliff runs for the wheelhouse. 

           AT THE HYDRAULICS

           A cigarette hangs loosely from Sol’s mouth as he guides the 
           latest empty pot, positioning it above

           A STACK OF POTS NOW THREE-STORIES ABOVE THE ROLLING DECK, 
           nearly obscuring the bow from view. 

           Where Nate stands, fearlessly guiding the 800 lb pot to rest 
           without even a life-vest or safety-line...he relies on his 
           legs to absorb the rolling waves, CRASHING into the Maggie 
           May below. 

           Nate moves away from the SWINGING POT as the SHIP DIPS into a 
           huge trough between thirty-foot waves. 

           Nate goes to all fours for stability, watches with excitement 
           as he gets a bird’s eye view of the WATER SWAMPING THE BOW. 

           EXT. WHEELHOUSE ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           Cliff appears at the top of the ladder. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Griggs. Goddammit. 

           Griggs is surprised as Cliff pulls the axe from his hands and 
           points to the EPIRB. 

                                 CLIFF (CONT’D)
                        That thing leaves the roof, our 
                        Coast Guard will start trying to 
                        search and rescue our asses and 
                        everyone will know we’re in illegal 
                        waters. 

           He shoves Griggs towards the ladder. 
                                 CLIFF (CONT’D)
                        You’re done up here. Move. 

           Ben’s voice BOOMS from the PA System. 

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        Big one. Watch it.  

           Cliff and Griggs brace themselves in the face of the five 
           story white water. 

           EXT. STACK - CONTINUOUS

           The Maggie May crests the wave like a roller coaster, coming 
           down at a near 45 degree angle...giving Nate a momentary, 
           panoramic view of the surrounding sea. It’s both beautiful 
           and frightening. 

           Nate’s eyes widen as he sees a glimpse of something...

           OUT IN THE OPEN WATER...a glimpse of A BRIGHT ORANGE LIFE 
           RAFT, briefly illuminated by A WEAK, FLASHING BEACON...

           The Maggie May evens out...erasing the object from sight. 

           The pot starts moving again as Sol gets back to work with the  
           crane hydraulics, oblivious. 

           Nate starts waving frantically from his perch - 

                                 NATE
                        Man overboard! Man overboard!

           EXT. WHEELHOUSE ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           Cliff notices that Nate isn’t assisting...can’t hear what 
           he’s screaming over the DIN OF ENGINES, WEATHER AND WAVES.  

                                 CLIFF
                        Awwww, come on. What the fuck is 
                        wrong with him? 

           ON THE MAIN DECK

           Pete, Sol and Montoya also pause to look up to Nate...who 
           scrambles off the stack like a monkey. 

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ben rips open a fresh pack of cigarettes...his hair and hat 
           askew - as he notices that work has halted...
           ...and looks out his window at Nate scrambling to the deck. 

           He gets on the PA System -  

                                 BEN
                             (into mic)
                        We got buoys comin’ up. What the 
                        hell are you doing? 

           THROUGH HIS WINDOW - Nate is POINTING into the distant water 
           ahead of the ship, still SCREAMING. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        For fuck’s sake...

           Ben opens the door, steps out into the driving sleet, onto 
           the CATWALK extending from the wheelhouse to hear Nate.

           EXT. WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ben calls out over the wind as snow coats his face and hair. 

                                 BEN
                        What?!

                                 NATE
                        There’s a raft out there!

           Nate points into the distance as A SERIES OF WAVES HITS.

           The men collectively react...panic in their eyes as the mood 
           switches on a dime.   

                                 BEN
                        I need every set of eyes on the 
                        water! 

           Ben turns and runs back inside the wheelhouse as the crew 
           switches gears. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BERING SEA - MOMENTS LATER

           The Maggie May carefully moves across the violent water. 

           SPOTLIGHTS SHINE from the bow, manned by Griggs and 
           Nate...they rake the churning water with the light - briefly 
           illuminating the snow spray as they home in on...

           A BRIGHT ORANGE, CANOPIED LIFE RAFT...it’s big, capable of 
           holding eight people...and it’s sinking in the water.
           STENCILED IN BLACK ON ITS SIDE: CYRILLIC LETTERS...RUSSIAN... 
           unseen by the crew. 

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Brady stands beside Ben as he maneuvers the ship towards the 
           raft...delicately. He doesn’t want to run it over. 

                                 BRADY
                        No word on any ships going down?

           Ben shakes his head ‘no’, he’s tense. 

                                 BRADY (CONT’D)
                        You’d think the Russian Navy’d be 
                        on that raft’s beacon in a 
                        heartbeat if a ship had gone down - 

                                 BEN
                        Brady, please. 

           EXT. SHIP’S DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Pete helps Cliff as he frantically finishes zipping himself 
           into a RED SURVIVAL SUIT...a ‘dry’ suit designed specifically 
           for survival in cold water...it covers every part of the body 
           - including face.  

           Sol assists Montoya with the gloves on his suit... 

           BOTH MEN HAVE SAFETY LINES AROUND THEIR WAISTS. 

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        Raft’s comin’ up, starboard. Any 
                        sign of life? 

           ON THE BOW - Nate and Griggs shake their heads ‘no’...

           As Cliff and Montoya rush to the starboard rail...they watch 
           the approaching raft as MORE WAVES CRASH AGAINST THE SHIP. 

                                 BEN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Watch it. 

           Sol hands Cliff A LENGTH OF ROPE as Cliff turns to Montoya. 

                                 CLIFF
                        I’ll go in first and tie the raft 
                        off. 

           Montoya nods as Cliff takes a few deep breaths, preparing 
           himself for the freezing, turbulent water. 
           IN THE WATER - A MOMENT LATER

           The sagging raft bucks up against the side of the ship...it’s 
           roof draped loosely over the interior compartment - 

           Cliff SPLASHES into the water next to the raft...ties it off 
           with Sol’s line. 

           Cliff gives the THUMBS UP TO SOL...

           But then is nearly swamped by the SINKING RAFT as a WAVE 
           shoves it against the Maggie May, pinning him between the 
           raft and the metal hull of the ship. 

           THE ROAR OF THE WEATHER drowns everything out. 

           ON THE SHIP’S DECK 

           Sol tosses the line, now tied to the raft, to Nate who 
           frantically runs it through the CRAB POT HAULER and HITS THE 
           HYDRAULICS...spooling the line, reeling the raft in. 

           IN THE WATER

           The raft is TUGGED CLOSE TO THE SHIP by the now taut line. 

           Even in his drysuit, Cliff nearly hyperventilates as he 
           struggles to get a look under the canopy of the raft...

           INT. RAFT - CONTINUOUS

           Cliff gets half his body inside the canopy...the interior is 
           dark - only FLASHES OF ORANGE LIGHT from the Maggie May 
           illuminate the scene inside - 

           He sees TWO MEN IN SURVIVAL SUITS...both faces opaque white.

           They’re laying in a growing pool of icy water...

                                 CLIFF
                        Can you hear me?

           No response. Cliff shakes them...ONE MAN SPUTTERS WEAKLY. 

           Cliff’s adrenaline spikes when he sees the vital signs...

           EXT. SHIP’S DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Montoya watches as Cliff emerges from the raft, calls up -
                                 CLIFF
                        Two guys. One alive! Throw me a 
                        lifeline. 

           Montoya throws A LINE down to Cliff - 

           INT. RAFT - A MOMENT LATER

           Cliff TIES THE LINE UNDER THE BREATHING MAN’S ARMPITS...ties 
           it off...tries to yank him out of the raft, but the floor is 
           sinking even more rapidly from their combined weight. Like 
           quicksand.  

           Cliff pulls harder...but realizes MORE ROPE is tangled around 
           the unconscious men, attached to their suits...and leading to

           SMALL METAL LOCKBOXES...a dozen of them...the combined weight 
           pulling the floor even further into the frigid water. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Aww shit.

           Every second he wastes is one closer to being sucked under 
           water with the overladen raft. 

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ben looks out his window, frantic. He gets back on the PA.

                                 BEN
                             (into mic)
                        Get Cliff out of there!

           ON THE DECK BELOW

           In his own dry suit, Montoya dives over the rail and into the 
           water to help Cliff - 

           INT. RAFT - CONTINUOUS

           Cliff struggles with the unconscious man as Montoya appears - 

                                 CLIFF
                        They’re wrapped up in line - 

           Montoya struggles with the unconscious men as well...no luck. 

           ANOTHER WAVE CRUSHES THE RAFT - 

           CATAPULTING THE FOUR OF THEM INTO THE SIDE OF THE SHIP.
                                 CLIFF (CONT’D)
                        Goddammit. 

           THE RAFT IS RAPIDLY FILLING WITH FREEZING WATER.

           EXT. SHIP’S DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Pete, Sol, Griggs and Nate watch helplessly as the raft below 
           begins to sink...with Cliff and Montoya stuck inside.

           Pete and Sol grab Cliff and Montoya’s safety lines...trying 
           to pull them out. 

           THE SHIP BUCKS AGAINST A THIRTY FOOT WAVE...once again 
           slamming the raft against the metal hull and COVERING THE 
           DECK IN WHITE WATER. 

           Every man is knocked off their feet. 

           ON PETE as he’s washed over the side of the ship in nothing 
           but his weather gear. He desperately tries to grab the rail, 
           but no dice. 

           A LOOK OF HORROR ON HIS FACE as he disappears into the sea.

           IN THE WHEELHOUSE 

           Ben anxiously watches the water recede...as the men slowly 
           recover from the dousing...EVERYONE EXCEPT FOR PETE, WHO’S 
           DISAPPEARED. 

                                 BEN
                        Oh no. 

                                 BRADY
                        What? 

           Ben gets on the PA, immediately begins turning the ship.

                                 BEN 
                             (over the PA)
                        Man overboard! Pete’s gone over the 
                        side, I need eyes starboard! 
                             (to Brady)
                        Get on the spotlight. 

           Brady runs to the exterior catwalk and flips on a powerful 
           halogen light, begins panning it across the surging water. 
           EXT. SHIP’S DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Sol immediately throws flotation devices overboard as he 
           dashes back to the railing, looking for Pete in the water. 

           Griggs follows Sol’s lead as Nate looks to the - 

           CRANE ARM - HANGING ABOVE THE SCENE... 

           Ben’s handling the new problem, Nate needs to solve the first 
           one. 

           Nate moves fast...TIES ANOTHER LENGTH OF ROPE to the line 
           already holding the raft to the side of the Maggie May...

           HE LOOPS IT OVER A HOOK DANGLING FROM THE CRANE ARM. 

           And moves to the crane controls - 

           IN THE WATER 

           The raft is swamped with more waves as it BEGINS TO SLOWLY 
           RISE OUT OF THE SEA with Cliff and Montoya trapped inside. 

           The heavy fabric BENDING and BOWING from the weight within.  

           IN THE DECKHOUSE

           Ben watches, worried...as the crane GRINDS, struggling under 
           the load of men, water...and who knows what else. 

           Ben slows the engines as he turns the ship around...

           He glances up at a digital clock...at the precious seconds 
           elapsed since Pete went overboard. 

           Worry is etched across his face as everything slips towards 
           chaos. 

           ON DECK

           Nate drops the sagging raft to the pitching deck with a 
           CRASH.

           Montoya and Cliff pull themselves out of the raft. 

           Cliff sees Griggs and Sol staring into the water - 

                                 CLIFF
                        What happened? 

                                 SOL
                        Pete’s gone over. 
                                 MONTOYA
                        For fuck’s sake. 

           Cliff and Montoya run back to the rail, followed by Sol, 
           frantically searching the starboard side waves.

           BEHIND THEM 

           Nate runs to the tangled raft, sees the two men inside. 

           He looks for help, sees Griggs -

                                 NATE
                        Griggs! Get these guys below deck. 

           Griggs nods as Nate joins the other men looking for Pete. 

           The greenhorn probes at the deflated raft - can’t make his 
           way through the raft’s tangled entrance. 

           Brady suddenly appears, pulls him away from the entrance...

           Brady pulls his knife, uses it to slice part of the roof away 
           - exposing the two men inside, tangled in ropes...AMID A 
           DOZEN METAL LOCKBOXES - JAPANESE MARKINGS ON THEIR SIDES.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Griggs hurriedly drags the UNCONSCIOUS MAN from the life raft 
           to the vinyl booth...

           Where Brady is already pulling the mask off his RAFT MATE. 
           The man’s eyes are clouded by death.

                                 BRADY
                        This one’s gone. 

           However, the Unconscious Man is still breathing...barely.

           Brady nods - 

                                 BRADY (CONT’D)
                        Strip him. 

           Griggs hesitates for a moment as 

           Brady opens a storage bin, pulls a stack of blankets, towels 
           and a medical kit. 
                                 BRADY (CONT’D)
                        Griggs. Now. 

           Griggs begins unzipping the man’s dry suit - 

           EXT. MAIN DECK - SAME

           The weather HOWLS as Sol, Montoya and Cliff stand at the 
           rail, straining to find Pete through SNOWFALL and WHITECAPS. 

           Nate positions a bright HALOGEN LAMP, panning it over the 
           water...but the light can only illuminate a thickening wall 
           of snow. It turns an eerie ORANGE as it reflects the light. 

           Cliff screams himself hoarse against the noise, calling out 
           to his friend.

                                 CLIFF
                        Pete! Pete!

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - SAME

           Ben desperately pilots the ship in a slow, wide circle.

                             (sotto)
                        Ten minutes ago the only worry we 
                        had was some fucking lost pots...

           EXT. MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Sol shakes his head sadly, but doesn’t take his eyes off the  
           water.

                                 MONTOYA
                        How long’s it been? 

                                 SOL
                        For a guy in a slicker, too long.  

           INT. GALLEY - SAME

           As the survival suit comes off, Brady takes note of the 
           CYRILLIC LETTERS STENCILED ON THE SUIT. 

                                 BRADY
                        Russians. 

           The barely conscious Russian begins SHIVERING INTENSELY.
                                 BRADY (CONT’D)
                        ...his clothes are wet. Strip it 
                        all off. 

                                 GRIGGS
                        Fuck that. 

           Brady holds up his one good hand. 

                                 BRADY
                        Goddammit. Strip him or he’s dead. 

           Brady starts awkwardly pulling at the wet clothes. 

           Griggs reluctantly strips more of the Russian’s soaked 
           clothes as the shivering worsens.

                                 BRADY (CONT’D)
                        Hypothermic.

           ...more clothes come off...revealing PALE BLUE TATTOOS 
           covering half of his body. 

                                 GRIGGS
                        Fuck...that’s a shitload of ink. 

           MULTIPLE FOUR-POINTED STARS cover his knees...BUTTERFLIES 
           across his chest...CANDLESTICKS on his abdomen...BARBED WIRE 
           across his arms...

           Brady takes note of the tattoos before spreading more 
           blankets and carefully swaddling the freezing Russian.

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ben nervously runs a hand through his hair - dread plastered 
           across his face. 

                                 BEN
                        Christ. 

           Ben puts the boat in neutral, picks up the mic.

                             (into the mic)
                        Sol, take the wheel. 

           Ben leaves the wheelhouse as Sol heads up the exterior stairs 
           to continue piloting the search. 
           INT. GALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Ben bounds down the stairs as Brady goes through the 
           Russian’s pockets...

           He and Griggs look to Ben. 

                                 BRADY
                        Pete?

           Ben shakes his head...Brady deflates.  

           Ben immediately focusses on the bundled stranger. 

                                 BEN
                        Any I.D.?

                        Nada. 

                                 GRIGGS
                        Russian prison ink. 

           He points out specific ‘candlesticks’ on the Russian’s 
           stomach. 

                                 GRIGGS (CONT’D)
                        These candlesticks don’t mean he 
                        was a candlestick maker. 
                             (beat)
                        Means he’ll snuff anyone out for a 
                        price. 

           They look at Griggs in surprise. 

                                 BEN
                        How the fuck do you know? 

                                 GRIGGS
                        Because I shared cells with guys 
                        like these. Bad dudes.

           Ben and Brady share a look. 

                                 BRADY
                        We need to get these guys off our 
                        hands. 

           Ben nods. ‘No shit.’

                                 BEN
                        When we get back to U.S. waters. 
                             (beat)

                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                        And I’ll have to call the Guard 
                        about Pete...what a clusterfuck. 

           EXT. MAIN DECK - SAME

           Sol continues to pilot the ship in a wide arc. 

           At the rail, Cliff continues to scan the turbulent 
           water...but there’s close to zero visibility as the snow 
           comes down even harder. 

           Montoya shrugs helplessly. 

                                 NATE
                        We can’t see shit in this weather.

                                 CLIFF
                        Hope to fuck you wouldn’t give up 
                        this quickly if it was me who went 
                        over. 

                                 NATE
                        Of course not. 

           Cliff’s not even listening. 

                                 CLIFF
                        We need a fucking chopper. We need 
                        to call the fucking Coast Guard. 

                                 NATE
                        Cliff. We’re in Russian waters. 
                        We’re not even supposed to be here. 

                                 CLIFF
                        This is fucked up. 

           Montoya trades a look with Nate, both know this is useless. 

           Montoya climbs the stack to continue the search. 

           Cliff pounds the rail with his fist as he holds back tears. 

                                 CLIFF (CONT’D)
                        Goddammit.

           Nate moves towards the SHREDDED RAFT. 

           A BRIGHT GLINT AMONG THE STRANGE METAL BOXES CATCHES HIS EYE 
           THROUGH THE FALLING SNOW. 

           He kneels down to inspect a box...opens one. 
           ANGLE ON HIS EYES as they widen with surprise. 

                                 NATE
                             (sotto)
                        Holy shit.

           INT. GALLEY - SAME

           A DRIPPING sound gets Ben, Griggs’ and Brady’s attention.

           It’s coming from the DEAD RUSSIAN laying on the other side of 
           the vinyl u-shaped booth. A DARK PUDDLE forms under his body.

           A SWELL ROLLS THE SHIP...KNOCKING THE DEAD MAN’S HEAD FROM 
           THE CUSHIONS...

           Angling the body downward...head under the table. 

           ALLOWING A TORRENT OF BLOOD TO EMPTY FROM THE SUIT... 
           SPLASHING TO THE FLOOR OF THE GALLEY. 

           The men stare in disbelief as Brady moves to the dead man, to 
           unzip the dry suit. 

                                 BEN
                        Don’t -

           Brady ignores him...OPENS THE SUIT - just enough to expose -

           Just as many tattoos as the man’s living counterpart...

           AND A BULLET WOUND IN THE DEAD MAN’S CHEST. 

                                 GRIGGS
                        Oh, man.  

           Everyone continues to stare, rooted in place as Nate enters - 
           oblivious. 

                                 NATE
                        Ben, you gotta see this - 

                                 BEN
                        Not now.  

                                 NATE
                        No. Seriously. 

           Nate shoves something in Ben’s hands...Ben finally looks down 
           at it...

           And stops cold - staring at this object...eyes suddenly wide. 
           BEHIND THEM

           Unseen by everyone, the Russian’s eyes briefly open...more 
           alert than we’ve seen...sizing up the situation....

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The small room is crammed with everyone. 

           They all SWAY and compensate for the WEATHER, VIOLENTLY 
           ROLLING THE SHIP...spray lashes the windows. 

           No one seems to mind though...thoughts of mortality have gone 
           out the window - as they all stare down at:

           ALL OF THE OLIVE-DRAB, RUSTED LOCK BOXES. 

           They’re all open: 

           - HALF THE BOXES FILLED WITH GOLD BARS.

           - THE OTHER HALF FILLED WITH DIAMONDS. 

           A PISTOL rests atop one pile of diamonds.

           They’re mesmerized as it all GLITTERS under the cabin lights.

           Cliff observes...but remains downbeat about it all. 

           Brady picks up the gun, toys with it as he eyes the prize. 

                                 BRADY
                        How much you think it’s worth? 

                                 MONTOYA
                        A lot. 

                                 BRADY
                        We’re gonna split this shit right? 

                                 MONTOYA
                        Of course, man. 

           Montoya looks to Ben, their leader, he’s nervous - still 
           focussing on piloting the ship through the weather, getting 
           out of Russian waters. 

                                 MONTOYA (CONT’D)
                        We get more though, right? Cuz 
                        we’re at full share - 

                                 GRIGGS
                        Bullshit, you do.  
                                 MONTOYA
                        Shut the fuck up. You automatically 
                        get less, greenhorn -  

                                 BEN 
                        Who’s watching the fucking Russian? 

           Ben’s focus is far from the money.

                                 BRADY
                        ...the guy’s unconscious - 

                                 BEN
                        Go down and tie him up. 

                                 BRADY
                        He’s half-dead, man - 

                                 BEN
                        I don’t give a shit. Who knows who 
                        the hell he is.  

           Brady hesitates, preferring to stare at the loot. 

           Brady sulks as he sets the found pistol down.

                                 MONTOYA
                        Brady. If he wakes up, pretend he’s 
                        Sue and clock his ass. 

                                 BRADY
                        Montoya, I swear to God - 

                                 BEN
                        Brady. Now. 

           Brady relents, heads down as Montoya grabs a bar of 
           gold...eyes a STAMP on the surface. 

           CLOSE ON THE STAMP - Japanese characters...

                                 MONTOYA
                        ...Chinese? 

                                 NATE
                        Japanese. 

           Nate kicks one of the boxes...indicating FADED JAPANESE 
           STENCILING...

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been fishing around the 
                        Pacific for ten years and you still 
                        can’t recognize Japanese.
           Sol backs away from it, like it’s radioactive. 

                                 MONTOYA
                        Fine. What the hell is it doing 
                        here? 

                                 SOL
                        That’s an Imperial stamp. 

           Everyone looks to Sol. 

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        Jap navy. World War Two... 

                                 MONTOYA
                        Still doesn’t answer my question. 
                        Where did the Russians get it - ?

                                 SOL
                        Only two kinds of people in this 
                        part of the world. Crabbers and 
                        scavengers. 
                             (beat)
                        Someone probly dug it up from some 
                        sunken ship. Maybe these Russians 
                        took it from some treasure hunters. 
                        My Daddy told me that when Japs 
                        controlled Attu they used to make 
                        Arctic runs from Germany -

                                 GRIGGS
                        Who gives a shit? It’s ours.

           Griggs goes to dip his hands in a box of diamonds - and is 
           stopped short by Cliff. 

           Griggs rips his hand from Cliff’s. 

                                 GRIGGS (CONT’D)
                        Don’t touch me. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Then don’t touch shit that doesn’t 
                        belong to you.  

           Nate turns to Ben. 

                                 NATE
                        We need get this mess off our 
                        hands. 
                             (beat)
                        We got two dead men - 
                                 CLIFF
                        One missing. 

           Montoya shakes his head. Cliff stares him down.

                                 NATE
                        One missing. 
                             (beat)
                        One dead...and another near dead 
                        and a load of stolen loot. I’m done 
                        doing prison time. 

           Ben’s frantically running his hand through his hair as he 
           chains another smoke...on the verge of panic as he 
           contemplates it all. 

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        Ben?

                                 BEN
                        We can’t call any friendly help til 
                        we get a hundred and fifty miles 
                        east of here. 

           He SHOVES THE THROTTLE TOGGLE all the way forward. 

           The ship VIBRATES as the ENGINES ROAR. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        That’s five hours. 

                                 CLIFF
                        And Pete’s body? We need to at 
                        least try and recover his body - 

                                 BEN
                        We report it all in five hours. 

           Cliff reacts, but Ben shuts him down. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Cliff. I loved Pete like family, 
                        and I know it’s hard to hear, but 
                        he’s dead and gone. He had thirty 
                        seconds out there, no way even the 
                        Coast Guard is going to get him. 
                        And we can’t even get them involved 
                        out here.  

           Cliff drops his head. 

                                 CLIFF
                        It ain’t right. 
                                 MONTOYA
                        What’s right is giving his family a 
                        share of that loot. 

                                 GRIGGS
                        You’re serious?

           Everyone stares at Griggs...this is non-negotiable.

                                 NATE
                        And the man who’s still alive 
                        downstairs? What about him?

                                 MONTOYA
                        If he dies, he dies...it’s all 
                        ours. No one else needs to know.

           Nate’s taken aback by the cold response. He looks to the rest 
           of the men...only Sol looks him in the eyes.

           Ben listens as he stares out the window at the raging 
           weather.

           Nate looks to him, but Ben reserves judgement. 

                                 NATE
                        You’d let someone die over this? 

                                 MONTOYA
                        Fuck him. Finders keepers. All I 
                        know is that I’m not the only guy 
                        out here who’s broke. 

           Everyone nods, except Nate, Sol...and Ben. 

           INT. GALLEY - SAME

           The Russian’s ankles are now bound with a length of rope. 

           Brady finishes cutting another LENGTH OF ROPE, his back to 
           the Russian.

           The Russian’s eyes cautiously open. He takes note of the rope 
           and knife. 

           He closes his eyes as Brady turns to face him.

           Nate turns to Ben.

                        You can’t be agreeing with this 
                        shit. Say something...

                        Maybe they’ve got a point. 

           Nate’s shocked.

                                 NATE
                        This ain’t the way to get the ship 
                        out of the hole.

                        While you’ve been away for the past 
                        five years, we’ve been hauling this 
                        rusty tub of shit. Supporting half 
                        the family.  
                             (beat)
                        This could be the lucky break we’ve 
                        been waiting on. 

           Cliff acknowledges it with a silent nod. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Pete’s share could take care of his 
                        kid for life. 

                                 NATE
                        Then what’s the plan if the Russian 
                        wakes up and wants to know where 
                        the fuck his loot went?

                                 GRIGGS
                        Then we kill him. 

           Everyone stares at Griggs for a long beat, dumbstruck by his 
           blunt assessment. 

                                 CLIFF

                                 GRIGGS
                        I’m done taking your shit - 

           Griggs steps up to Cliff...a much bigger guy.

                        No, psycho. You’re not.

                        Jesus. All of you, calm down. We’re 
                        not gonna murder anyone. 

                                 MONTOYA
                        Then what do we do?

           Ben hesitates. He doesn’t really know the answer. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Maybe we just put them back in 
                        their raft...

           Ben reluctantly nods as Nate shakes his head in disgust.

           INT. GALLEY - SAME

           Brady has moved onto the booth, behind the Russian who is 
           still stretched out along the bench. 

           He begins wrapping the Russian’s wrists...coiling the rope 
           first around the left and then the right...

           His head hangs over the Russians, reversed. 

           The Russian’s eyes open once more -

           STARING STRAIGHT INTO BRADY’S EYES. 

           His bound hands shoot straight up, wrapping the rope around 
           Brady’s neck before the smaller American can react. 

           Brady has unwittingly helped the Russian create a garrotte. 

           ...Brady tries to scream but the Russian PULLS HIS WRISTS 
           APART with all his diminished strength. 

           The rope SCISSORS ACROSS BRADY’S NECK as his face turns 
           purple...he claws helplessly at the rough line as the Russian 
           pull him within inches of his own face. 

           Brady kicks helplessly, searches for leverage but finds none. 

           He reaches for his KNIFE, resting on the table...he finally 
           gets a finger on it...BUT KNOCKS IT TO THE FLOOR.

                        How’s putting them in a raft any 
                        different than murder?
           Ben doesn’t have a response. Nate has a point.

                        I don’t care who he is. We need to 
                        get him medical attention. It’s the 
                        rule of the sea. Situation was

           Ben taps a lockbox with his foot.

                        But, this is mighty tempting. 
                        There’s millions of exceptions to 
                        the rule of the sea right there.

           Sol’s not swayed.

                        Nothing wrong with working for a

           Nate looks to each man...no one on his side except for Sol. 

           A long beat of silence before Montoya breaks the tension. 

                                 MONTOYA

                        Putting a bullet in his head or 
                        putting him back on the raft is the 
                        same thing. Murder. You ready for 
                        that?

           Ben, Cliff and Montoya look unsure.

                        That’s what I thought. You have no 
                        idea what it’s like to kill

                        What about you? 

           Nate doesn’t answer. 

           Griggs is unflinching.

           Nate bites his tongue as Ben pushes the throttle further 
           forward, nearly red-lining the engines.

           Montoya looks across the empty galley, confused.

                                 MONTOYA
                        Brady?

           Montoya sees two feet sticking out of the galley booth.

           He approaches the booth cautiously, sees Brady’s lifeless 
           body slumped in the booth - his dead eyes open and empty, his 
           neck swollen with purple abrasions from the rope.

           Montoya sees the ropes and blankets discarded by the Russian, 
           looks around wildly, but still no sign of the intruder.

           He quickly backs away from Brady’s corpse, stumbling over the 
           dead body of other Russian.

           The equipment room for the crew...orange slickers, pants, 
           boots, gloves, hats and HAND-AXES sway from hooks with the 
           motion of the ship. 

           The weakened, naked Russian shivers violently, struggles to 
           stay on his bare feet as the ship SWAYS. He doesn’t have his 
           sea legs yet.  

           He grabs some clothing...and a HAND AXE.

           Ben grabs the Russian’s gun, still resting on the crates. 

           He chambers a round, puts it in his waistband as he looks to 
           Nate. 

                                 BEN
                        Looks like this guy made the 
                        decision for us. 

           Ben turns to a console, opens a wide, narrow drawer that 
           contains a messy stack of unfurled maps and charts.  

           He pulls out a blueprint of the ship, spreads it out on top 
           of the console.

           CLOSE ON the ship’s blueprint as Ben points to the aft 
           sections of the ship, where the wheelhouse and living 
           quarters are laid out.

           He points to it for Griggs’ benefit.

                        You get lost, we may never fucking 
                        find you. 

           Ben looks at his crew as he points to the map...everyone 
           starting their search at the back of the ship. 

                                 BEN
                        Aft to bow. Leave no place 
                        unchecked. If anything, we flush 
                        him forward and corner him at the 
                        front of the ship. 

           EXT. BERING SEA - SAME

           FROM A DISTANCE - the growing sheet of ice blankets the rough 
           water as the storm grows in intensity...pushing the ice 
           further south through the Bering Sea.  

           HEAVY SNOW AND SLEET are blown nearly horizontally by the 
           powerful winds as we glimpse - 

           SMALL, DIM LIGHTS amidst the darkness...the tiny MAGGIE MAY 
           bobs like a toy in the water, racing the encroaching danger. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Nate, Griggs, Montoya and Sol watch Cliff use Ben’s ring of 
           keys to open A GUN SAFE over Ben’s desk...

           REVEALING a single SHOTGUN. 

                                 GRIGGS
                        That’s all we’ve got? 

                                 CLIFF
                        We’re fishermen, not mercs, moron. 

                                 GRIGGS
                        Who gets it? 

                                 CLIFF
                             (to Montoya)
                        You were a Marine, right?
                                 MONTOYA
                        Yeah. I mean...for a minute. I can 
                        clean my boots and stuff -

           Cliff tosses Montoya the shotgun. Montoya doesn’t look too 
           excited to be handling it. 

           Nate can’t believe this is happening. 

           CLIFF SLAMS THE SAFE SHUT - 

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. BUNK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           BOOM - the door flies open, revealing Griggs, holding his 
           knife like Rambo. 

                                 GRIGGS
                        Come on, motherfucker. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STORAGE ROOM - SAME

           BOOM - the door flies open, revealing Montoya...a trace of 
           fear in his eyes. 

           He haphazardly tosses boxes aside, shotgun at the ready. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GALLEY - SAME

           Nate focusses on Brady’s dead body...laying across from the 
           Dead Russian. 

           He moves to the stairs, back up to - 

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Nate comes up the stairs, surprising Ben who’s securing the 
           lockboxes. He turns the gun on Nate. 

                                 BEN
                        Jesus. 

           Nate puts his hands up as Ben puts it back in his waistband. 
                                 NATE
                        We need to call the Guard. Now. 

                                 BEN
                        We can’t, Nate - 

                                 NATE
                        Russian or American, I don’t give a 
                        fuck. We’ve got a killer on the 
                        ship - 

                                 BEN
                        We call out for help at this point 
                        and the Russians will either take 
                        the loot or confiscate the 
                        ship...or both.
                             (beat)
                        You really want to try out a 
                        Russian prison this time around, 
                        Nate? 

                                 NATE
                        I don’t give a shit. I’d rather 
                        live to see Spring - 

                                 BEN
                        If we don’t get out of this on our 
                        own we’re done for. You understand? 
                        Wouldn’t even matter if we were in 
                        American waters, the ship is now a 
                        fucking crime scene and we need to 
                        clean it up on our own. 
                             (beat)
                        Now get the hell out of the 
                        wheelhouse.  

                                 NATE
                             (sotto)
                        Fuck this. 

           Nate lunges for the radios. 

           Ben shoves him back as they tussle -  

           INT. DECK HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Sol enters slowly...the SLICKERS SWAYING AROUND HIM...

           He immediately notices EMPTY HOOKS...an EMPTY HAND-AXE SHEATH 
           on the floor...

           ANOTHER DOOR is partially open, the watertight fasteners 
           UNLOCKED. 
           A sign proclaims that the door leads downstairs to the ENGINE 
           ROOM. 

           He keeps an eye on the unlocked door...grabs the WALL PHONE.

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The PHONE BUZZES as the brothers continue to wrestle. 

           Ben finally knocks Nate on his ass, stunning him momentarily.

           Ben reaches up, grabs the PHONE. 

                                 BEN
                             (into phone)
                        What? 

           INT. DECK HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                                 SOL
                             (into phone)
                        Guy’s in the engine -

           Sol’s able to get off a few words, before -

           ZZZZZFFFT...BLACKOUT. 

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - SAME

           ZZZZZFFFT...POWER SURGES....then...BLACK. 

           Radar screen...interior lights...and EXTERIOR DECK LIGHTS. 

           ALL OUT. 

           Ben absorbs it in silence for a beat, the phone still pressed 
           to his ear. 

           A SWELL PUMMELS the ship - sending dark, invisible spray 
           against his windows as

           EERIE BLUE, BATTERY POWERED EMERGENCY LIGHTS FLICKER ON...

           Though the engines continue to drone...the darkness outside 
           leaves him blind to navigate.

                                 BEN
                        Fuck me. He’s in the engine room.  

           Both Ben and Nate are suddenly captivated by a strange, 
           PULSING RED GLOW coming from one of the boxes of diamonds.
           Nate digs into the diamonds...

           AND RETRIEVES A SMALL GPS DEVICE. 

           The brothers pause to stare at it -

                                 NATE
                        GPS.

           Ben barely reacts.

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        He’s slowing us down so his friends 
                        can catch up. 
                             (beat)
                        And how long you think he’s been in 
                        the water? A few days...who knows 
                        how close they are. 

           Nate’s horrified. 

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        Ben. You should’ve called in the 
                        fucking cavalry. 

           Ben absorbs the info...but shakes his head, ‘no’, as he takes 
           the GPS device and

           SMASHES it with the butt of the pistol. 

                                 BEN
                        Doesn’t matter now. We’ll outrun 
                        ‘em. It’s worth the risk. 

                                 NATE
                        No. It’s not. 

           INT. GALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           The SOUNDS of the kitchen being torn apart as Griggs stumbles 
           around in the dark. 

                                 GRIGGS (O.S.)
                        Shit - 

           We hear a WET THUD...

           THE BLUE EMERGENCY LIGHTING KICKS ON...

           ILLUMINATES GRIGGS...blocking his eyes from the bright light 
           with a blood covered hand as he slips and slides...

           The ship rolls as he attempts to stand -
           IN THE DEAD RUSSIAN’S POOL OF BLOOD AND GORE. 

           A FLASHLIGHT cuts across the scene, shining in Griggs’ face. 

           REVEAL CLIFF holding the light, accompanied by Montoya. 

                                 GRIGGS (CONT’D)
                        What happened? 

                                 CLIFF
                        Power’s out, you tampon. 

                                 MONTOYA
                        Christ, that’s nasty. 

           Montoya dry-heaves as Griggs realizes that he’s COVERED IN 
           BLOOD...an odd purple in the emergency light glow.  

                                 GRIGGS
                        Get that shit out of my face. 

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        Griggs, get up here and take the 
                        wheel. 

           INT. ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The ENGINE DRONE is deafening, echoing through the cavernous 
           space bordered by pipes, tubes and hoses...a strange 
           mechanical maze...made all the worse by the rolling seas 
           breaking against the hull. 

           All is illuminated by the narrow beam of a high-powered 
           flashlight, wielded by Sol.

           He cautiously moves forward...knife in one hand, flashlight 
           in the other as he attempts to ignore the STRANGE SHADOWS and 
           the cubby holes where the Russian could be hiding. 

           Sol finds himself at the end of one of the TWO LONG, 16 
           CYLINDER ENGINE BLOCKS. 

           The engine VIBRATES as it strains...STEAM AND SMOKE wafting 
           from the cylinders...something’s not right. 

           UP AHEAD

           His FLASHLIGHT illuminates the other end of the block...near 
           a BUNDLE OF SEVERED COOLANT HOSES...

           LIQUID SPRAYS in silhouette against the light. 
           Sol’s breath catches as he pauses - he draws the knife 
           higher, switching his grip he looks more like a knife-fighter 
           now...older, grizzled - but still formidable. 

           He moves slower, edges closer to the other end of the engine.

           INT. DECKHOUSE PASSAGEWAY - A MOMENT LATER

           Ben rushes towards the ENGINE ROOM with the aid of a lantern. 
           Nate, Cliff and Montoya follow closely. 

                                 BEN
                        He’s in the engine room. We’ll trap 
                        him down there. 

           INT. ENGINE ROOM - SAME

           Sol pauses cautiously as - 

           THE ENGINE SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY...SCRAPING, SUPERHEATED METAL 
           CYLINDERS OPERATING WITHOUT OIL OR COOLANT...

           A SHRILL SQUEAL fills the room as the engine SEIZES UP.

           INT. DECK HOUSE PASSAGEWAY - SAME

           The ship LURCHES and SHUDDERS...the STRAINING ENGINE NOISE 
           making its way to the upper deck. 

           Ben’s face turns even more grim. 

                                 BEN
                        ...one of the engines is down. 

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - SAME

           Griggs is rattled in the captain’s chair as - 

           The JOG-LEVER vibrates in Griggs’ hand. He’s panicked as the 
           ship shudders...SLOWS DOWN DRAMATICALLY. 

           INT. ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sol reaches for the engine shutdown lever - 

           AS AN AXE BLADE FLIES INTO FRAME - REMOVING FOUR OF SOL’S 
           FINGERS AT THE FIRST KNUCKLE. 
           Sol stares at his hand in shock as the Russian swings the axe 
           again...at his head.

           Sol dodges instinctively - cradling his stump as he 
           desperately lashes out with his own knife. 

           Sol’s blade catches the Russian off-guard, SLASHING A GOUGE 
           across the man’s forearm.

           The Russian reflexively drops the axe and is defenseless for 
           the moment...

           But Sol slips on the oil-slicked steel floor...loses his 
           leverage. 

           The Russian spins to the side, deceptively agile and strong - 
           dodges Sol’s blade as the older man slashes at the air - 

           The Russian uses a combination of sticky hands and down and 
           dirty prison-yard brawling. 

           He pivots Sol’s momentum, almost like a bullfighter, 
           launching the older man forward in the cramped space. 

           Sol goes head-first with a CRUNCH against the OVERHEATING 
           ENGINE. 

           Sol slowly pulls himself up, braces himself on the engine 
           with his good hand. 

           CLOSE ON HIS HAND as it SIZZLES AGAINST THE METAL. 

           The Russian, finds new strength. 

           He dodges a few swipes of Sol’s knife, then blocks a jab, 
           returns a blow to Sol’s temple with the STEEL FLASHLIGHT. 

           Sol drops his knife...as the Russian follows through with the 
           heel of his palm to Sol’s nose - BREAKING IT WITH A CRUNCH. 

           Sol is knocked back onto the smoking, vibrating engine block.

           Blood STREAMS from Sol’s face...he’s dazed. 

           The Russian picks his ice axe from the dirty floor...

           He holds Sol at bay as he hisses under the noise, his face 
           filled with rage - 

                                 RUSSIAN
                             (subtitled)
                        Gold...diamonds. Where the fuck is 
                        it?
           Sol doesn’t understand, incomprehension in his eyes. 

           The Russian growls in frustration. 

                                 SOL
                        Fuck you. 

           This, the Russian understands. 

           The Russian SWINGS THE FILTHY AXE into Sol’s belly...RIPS 
           UPWARD...eye to eye with Sol. 

           He stares into Sol’s eyes as the older man GASPS in shock. 

           The Russian looms over him, slowly withdraws the serrated 
           blade - ready to finish the American off, when...

           FLASHLIGHTS AND SHOUTS from the stairway behind them.

                                 NATE (O.S.)
                        Sol!?

           The Russian quickly backs into the shadows, further into a

           NARROW MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR running below the waterline, the 
           length of the hull, towards the bow...

           AT THE STAIRS

           Ben, Cliff, and Montoya, bound into the compartment, 
           FLASHLIGHTS cutting through the SMOKE AND STEAM. 

           Ben shouts over the engine noise.

                                 BEN
                        Solly, you down there!?

           As the three move into the compartment, Cliff shines his 
           light on the ELECTRICAL PANEL on the nearby bulkhead.

           The panel’s door is open, the inside WIRING SLASHED AND 
           SHREDDED.

                                 NATE
                        Shit. Panel’s cooked.

           Ben finally pulls the SHUTDOWN LEVER...shutting the damaged 
           motor down...the second motor struggles to pull the ship 
           through the storm. 

           FURTHER IN THE ENGINE ROOM, Montoya’s light finds Sol, 
           slumped against the engine block, clutching his lacerated 
           stomach.
                                 MONTOYA
                        Oh man... 

           Montoya, Ben, and Cliff converge on Sol...they see the blood 
           pouring from his face...his severed fingers.

           Sol looks down to his hands covering his belly, seeping red - 

           He grits his teeth in pain, moves his hands enough for Ben 
           and the others to see the deep wound. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Ah Jesus.

                                 BEN
                        Where is he?

           Sol nods toward the MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR.

                                 SOL
                        I think the fucker really wants his 
                        gold. 

           Sol passes out as Ben pulls the Russian’s pistol from his 
           waistband, checks the clip as...

           He peers down the darkened MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR that 
           disappears into the bowels of the ship...more like an 
           insulated cave to nowhere.

           Cliff starts to panic. 

                                 CLIFF
                        We’re so fucked. Game over, man. 

                                 BEN
                        Just shut up and focus. 
                             (beat)
                        He gets far enough forward, he 
                        could open the saltwater pumps, 
                        flood the ship, who knows what 
                        else. 

                                 NATE
                        Or he could end up on deck and 
                        double back to the wheelhouse. In 
                        which case it really is game over - 

           Ben turns to Montoya. 

                                 BEN
                        We’ll try and trap him in between.
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                        You take the top deck, I’ll take 
                        the low. Make sure he doesn’t move 
                        forward and get back up top through 
                        the hatch under the weather deck in 
                        the bow. Last thing I want is that 
                        fucker doing something with the 
                        pots. 
                             (beat)
                        He destabilizes the stack, it’ll 
                        sink us faster than the ice. 

           Montoya hesitates as he stares at Sol’s horrific injuries.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        What are you waiting on?

           Montoya looks between Nate, Ben and Sol...unsure. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got a gun, I’ve got a gun. 
                        Ivan’s got an axe. If you won’t man 
                        up, I bet the greenhorn would be 
                        more than eager. 

           Montoya finally snaps out of it...

                                 MONTOYA
                        Fuck that.  

           He moves back up the stairs. 

                                 NATE
                        Make sure you’ve got a clear shot, 
                        do not aim near the hull or pipes. 
                        We don’t need to help the Bering 
                        kill us - 

           Montoya waves him off, annoyed. 

           Ben surveys the engine damage as Cliff checks Sol’s 
           vitals...slipping into panic. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Shit man, he needs a doctor - 

           Ben ignores him, looks towards the shredded electrical box. 

                                 BEN
                        Nate, get that box rewired, then 
                        get some spare hose. We get this 
                        engine running, we’ll be fine - 

           Cliff gets in Ben’s face, officially panicking. 
                                 CLIFF
                        What about Sol?! We can’t just 
                        leave him down here!

                                 BEN
                        What the hell do you want from me? 
                        He’s fucked up. Right now I’m 
                        trying to make sure the rest of us 
                        get out of this alive - 

                                 CLIFF
                        We’re not talking about cutting 
                        dead loss, asshole. Sol isn’t some 
                        rotten crab stinkin’ up the tank. 

           Ben grabs Cliff by the throat, shoves him against the 
           bulkhead...the wheels have officially come off. 

                                 BEN
                        I care as much about Sol as you do. 
                        But if we don’t get this shit 
                        working in the next few minutes, 
                        we’re all gonna be under a sheet of 
                        ice. Got it?
                             (beat)
                        You wanted to be deckboss so bad? 
                        Act like one. 

           Cliff is cold and stubborn, he looks to Nate.  

                                 CLIFF
                        Nate was right, we should’ve called 
                        for help -

           They stare eye to eye...the ship HEAVING around them. 

                                 BEN
                        You and Nate are in this with the 
                        rest of us. Power’s out. We can’t 
                        call anyone. We need to fix this 
                        ourselves or go down swingin’. 

           Cliff won’t budge. 

           Ben finally looks to Sol.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Take Sol to the galley. Then get 
                        down here to help Nate fix this 
                        shit. One engine ain’t gonna keep 
                        us clear of the weather and ice.

           Cliff doesn’t acknowledge him...Ben maintains his iron grip.
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Get your head straight.

           Cliff finally nods. 

           Ben moves past Nate - into the bowels of the ship...leaving 
           Cliff and Nate to reassess one another. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DECKHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The gear sways on hooks around him as the ship shifts. 

           Montoya refuses to let the shotgun go as he puts on a 
           weatherproof jacket. 

           He mumbles to himself as he prepares to head outside. 

                                 MONTOYA
                             (sotto)
                        Motherfucking...commie piece of 
                        shit. I’m a fucking U.S. Marine - 

           He pulls the hood over his head...

           EXT. MAIN DECK - A MOMENT LATER

           WAVES CRASH OVER THE RAILING, mixing with FREEZING SPRAY AND 
           SNOW...layering every surface in a coat of crystalline ice.

           The rails, the deck...

           AND THE TWO-STORY TOWER OF 150 CRAB POTS...EACH WEIGHING 
           800lb... tethered by thin, brittle chains.

           The stack CREAKS AND GROANS, fighting gravity as the deck 
           RISES AND FALLS like a GIANT SEE-SAW. 

           The stack covers most of the forward deck...near the bow. A 
           few narrow, man-sized ‘corridors’ in the labyrinthine stack 
           allow for access to the 

           FORWARD WEATHER DECK - a small enclosure near the bow that 
           holds anchor gear and line...and the hatch that is the only 
           exit from the Maintenance Corridor running the length of the 
           ship. 

           Montoya exits the deckhouse, squints his eyes from the 
           blowing spray and snow...peers into the darkened stack.
                                 MONTOYA
                        Come on, Boris. Come out to play, 
                        bitch. 

           He raises the shotgun and flashlight...begins to move 
           cautiously across the deck towards the stack and the weather 
           deck behind it, in the bow. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           Ben’s flashlight barely cuts through the inky darkness as he 
           slowly moves forward within the bowels of the ship...

           Insulated crab tanks make up the walls to both sides. 

           The SOUND OF SLOSHING WATER permeates the claustrophobic 
           space as the ship ROLLS...knocking him back and forth against 
           the walls. 

           He mops sweat from his brow, keeps the Russian’s pistol 
           pointed forward...

           The flashlight reveals nothing but more labyrinthine pipes 
           ahead...

           A DARK SHADOW suddenly darts between pipes at the end of the 
           corridor. 

           The SHIP ROCKS from the storm - 

           Causing Ben to drop the flashlight in his rush to raise the 
           pistol - 

           Finger on trigger - he stops himself...looking to the pipes 
           around his head...ALL FULL WITH SLOSHING SEAWATER FOR THE 
           CRAB TANKS. 

           ON THE FLOOR - the flashlight rolls with the ship...arcing 
           light over the dark space. 

           Ben shouts in frustration - 

                                 BEN
                        Shit. 

           He bends to pick up the flashlight...

           AS AN EERIE CHUCKLE sounds from further down the corridor 
           toward the front of the ship. 

           Ben freezes...scared shitless. 
           INT. GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           By the blue glare of the emergency lights - 

           Cliff lays Sol across the cushions where the homicidal 
           Russian had been only thirty minutes before. 

           The ship GROANS as waves crash against it...rocking it like a 
           cork in the ocean as the single remaining engine STRUGGLES 
           AND VIBRATES below deck.

           BLOOD soaks Sol’s shredded shirt...DRIP. DRIP. DRIPPING to 
           the floor from the vinyl and mingling with the  

           PUDDLE OF BLOOD from the dead Russian, still laying there in 
           the adjoining seat, lifeless and cold.  

           The Sol’s breathing is ragged...it catches as he looks to 
           Brady’s dead body on the floor.

           Cliff grabs a towel from the kitchen, presses it into Sol’s 
           hands still covering the axe wound.  

                                 CLIFF
                        Keep it pressed tight, we’ll get 
                        you some help soon. 

           Sol’s unconvinced. 

                                 SOL
                        Yeah, right. 

           INT. ENGINE ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

           The room is pitch black. Nate uses his flashlight to 
           illuminate the electrical box. He struggles to make sense of 
           the shredded wires...especially through the acrid oil smoke. 

           Cliff emerges from the stairs. 

                                 CLIFF
                        You were right...about all of it. 

           Cliff shakes his head in shame. 

                                 CLIFF (CONT’D)
                        I’d rather live and take the blame 
                        with the rest of these assholes 
                        than die out here.

                                 NATE
                        Too little, too late, Cliff. 
                                 CLIFF
                        We could use the sat phone, call 
                        911, get the Guard out here -

           Nate shakes his head.

                                 NATE
                        What part about power outage don’t 
                        you get? Sat phone needs power like 
                        everything else on the ship. No 
                        juice, no phone. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Should’ve listened to you. Sol knew 
                        it too. Known the guy longer than I 
                        knew my own dad...he’s fucking 
                        bleeding out on the galley floor - 

           Then it hits Nate. 

                                 NATE
                             (interrupting)
                        The EPIRB...Get the EPIRB off the 
                        roof. It’ll send a signal to the 
                        Guard. 

           Cliff calms slightly. 

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take care of this shit, you 
                        take care of the EPIRB. 

           Cliff nods. 

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        Do it now. Who knows how long it’ll 
                        take help to get out here. 

           Cliff bounds up the stairs.

           EXT. BERING SEA - CONTINUOUS

           The Maggie May limps away from the encroaching ice...SWELLS 
           batting the ship as it struggles to stay its course. It’s a 
           big ship, but the seas are bigger. 

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - SAME

           Griggs grips the JOG LEVER and THROTTLE with white knuckles 
           as he intently watches the dark horizon...the nub of a dying 
           cigarette hangs from his lips...
           He nervously, rapidly looks between a half-full pack on the 
           dash and the dark horizon outside the window...too afraid to 
           miss something in the darkness. 

           ON THE DECK BELOW...Montoya moves forward with his flashlight 
           against the snow and sleet. 

           BEHIND GRIGGS

           Cliff appears at the top of the stairs.

                                 CLIFF
                        That shit ain’t good for you. 

           Griggs jumps, grabs his knife as Cliff approaches him. 

                                 GRIGGS
                        Don’t sneak up on me -

                                 CLIFF
                        Put it out. 

                                 GRIGGS
                        What? 

           Cliff yanks the cigarette from his mouth, CRUSHES IT IN HIS 
           HAND. 

                                 CLIFF
                        The cherry on the end of your faggy 
                        menthols are ruining your night-
                        vision. 

           Cliff heads to the DOOR BEHIND GRIGGS, TOWARDS THE EXTERIOR 
           CATWALK. 

                                 GRIGGS
                        Where you goin’?

                                 CLIFF
                        Keep your eyes on the ice. 

           Griggs stares Cliff down, rage welling in his eyes. 

           Cliff takes a menacing step towards him. 

                                 CLIFF (CONT’D)
                        What...? 

           Griggs keeps his mouth shut, but doesn’t look happy about it.  

                                 CLIFF (CONT’D)
                        Eyes front, fuck-face.
           Griggs’ looks to the stacked gold for motivation to focus on 
           the task at hand. 

           His face darkens as he returns his gaze to the black, surging 
           seas ahead.  

           BEHIND HIM, Cliff exits the wheelhouse, starts to climb the 
           icy outside ladder to the roof.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR - SAME

           Ben cautiously continues down the claustrophobic tunnel below 
           the waterline. His flashlight and pistol are aimed forward in 
           the darkness.

           Having passed crab tanks, he enters a new -  

           WATER TIGHT COMPARTMENT

           Ahead on his right, sits a tight bundle of refrigeration 
           compressors and pipes - all powerless and eerily 
           silent...casting strange shadows on the walls. 

           Ahead on his left, an open entry to a cavernous - 

           DRY HOLD  

           Ben presses his back to the bulkhead next to the open 
           entryway, grips his light and gun, readying for what lies 
           around the corner...

           With a quick motion, he swings his light and gun around, 
           frantically scanning the interior of the dry hold, like a bad 
           TV cop. 

           But no Russian - only ancient boxes on the shelves.

           Ben exhales, nervous, relieved for a moment...

           Until he shines his light into the far corner between the 
           shelves, where his light disappears into blackness of a hole 
           that leads to some sealed up, long-forgotten compartment.  

           Ben cautiously crosses the dry hold to the corner where a gap 
           in the steel bulkheads has left an open, irregular-shaped 
           crawlspace.

           Ben squats down and shines his light through the crawlspace 
           entrance, but can’t see very far into the dark void 
           beyond...the guts of the ship. 
           He gets on his stomach, inches his way into the

           CRAWLSPACE

           A narrow, pitch black duct running through the ribs of the 
           big ship, meant for hull repairs. 

           He’s extremely vulnerable - literally inches from the water 
           on the other side of the curving, thin metal hull beside his 
           head. 

           Ben does his best to keep his flashlight and gun pointed in 
           front of him while in this vulnerable position.

           REVERSE POV from inside the darkness, Ben’s head illuminated 
           by his flashlight slides into view, hovering eerily in a sea 
           of blackness.

           Ben’s heart races, his breath quickens, as the ship’s 
           superstructure CREAKS and MOANS against the storm surge.

           With every reverberating STEEL POP, Ben frantically swings 
           his flashlight around from his prone position, looking 
           desperately for the Russian...

           FOOTSTEPS pound on the metal floor...seemingly all around 
           him...but he can’t trace the movement...

           Ben finally slides out of the far end of the space, returns 
           to the service tunnel and continues forward.

           Ahead of him, the end of the maintenance corridor is now 
           visible....a small, angular room - the collision bulkhead and 
           a wider open space around a metal ladder to the upper deck.

           Ben inches forward - 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MAIN DECK - SAME

           Montoya cautiously makes his way through the weather and 
           across the open fishing deck, as the ship continues its rough 
           undulations.

           RUSSIAN’S POV - FROM THE RECESSES OF THE CRAB-POT MAZE - we 
           watch Montoya make his way forward...hesitant to move within 
           the CREAKING pots...

           Montoya steps carefully across the deck’s icy surface, trying 
           to keep both his flashlight and shotgun aimed ahead.
           Montoya pauses mid-deck, pans his light across the looming 
           stack of steel pots in front of him, searching for signs of 
           the Russian... seeing nothing.

           SUDDENLY A METALLIC CLANG behind Montoya.

           Montoya whips around, ready to fire...

           MORE BANGING and Montoya sees that it’s only the CRANE’S 
           BLOCK AND TACKLE - BANGING into the bulwark.  

           Montoya shakes it off, continues forward toward the stack, 
           carefully skirting the OPEN HOLE IN THE CENTER OF THE DECK, 
           sloshing opening of the water-filled crab tank.

           As Montoya eyes the tank hole, A SHADOW flashes through the 
           maze of pots ahead of him. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ENGINE ROOM  - SAME

           Nate gives up on the electrical panel and moves further into 
           the engine room, filled with thick, acrid smoke.   

           For the first time Nate sees the extent of the engine damage.

                                 NATE
                        Jesus.

           He grabs a TOOL BELT from the wall, chock full of 
           SCREWDRIVERS AND WRENCHES, slings it over his shoulder as he 
           wades into the problem. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WHEELHOUSE ROOF - SAME

           Cliff battles the wind and ice as he mounts the top of the 
           ladder leading to the roof of the wheelhouse.

           BEHIND HIM - the Bering Sea plunges up and down five stories 
           below. 

           As he reaches the roof, he slips on the icy surface, falling 
           to his knees...

           HE SLIDES ON THE ICE towards the edge - 
           INT. WHEELHOUSE - SAME

           Griggs reacts to the THUMP on the roof above his head. 

           EXT. WHEELHOUSE ROOF - SAME

           Cliff gropes for the safety cable strung across the rooftop 
           perimeter - the only thing between him and the icy water. 

           Cliff pulls himself to his feet, looks at the blanket of 
           darkness around him.  

           HEAVY WIND AND SNOW whips his face and rain gear...

           We can barely make out the ghostly white shapes of ice 
           floating alongside the Maggie May as she rides the steep 
           troughs and swells.

           The freezing spray stings Cliff’s face as he gets his 
           balance, looks across the rooftop, sees what he came for...

           ON THE ROOF’S LOWER STEP, next to two large plastic barrels 
           containing the inflatable life-rafts...

           THE EPIRB

           Cliff grips the cable, rides the roof as if it were a bronco 
           as he starts making his way toward the EPIRB.

           BEHIND CLIFF - a head appears at the top of the ladder...

           It’s Griggs. 

                                 GRIGGS 
                        What are you doing? 

                                 CLIFF
                        Same to you. Who’s watching the 
                        helm?

           Griggs staggers toward Cliff, keeps his eyes on him.

                                 GRIGGS
                        You aren’t touching the EPIRB.

                                 CLIFF
                        Get back downstairs. 

           Griggs continues toward Cliff, when suddenly - 

           THE ENTIRE WHEELHOUSE BUCKS SIDEWAYS...
           Cliff is thrown away from the railing, lands hard on Griggs 
           as the ship SHUDDERS AND GROANS...

           EXT. MAGGIE MAY - SAME

           The starboard-side bow of the ship rakes across an ICE BERG 
           THE SIZE OF A TRUCK... 

           EXT. UNDERWATER - SAME

           ...below water, the ice is ten times as big. It’s ragged 
           underside RIPS into the Maggie May’s thin hull. 

           EXT. MAGGIE MAY - CONTINUOUS

           The collision doesn’t budge the berg, instead the Maggie May 
           is lifted roughly out of the water and shunted to the side 
           like a toy. 

           Everyone and everything on board is rocked violently.

           QUICK SHOTS FROM AROUND THE SHIP: 

           - THE MAIN DECK 

           Montoya is knocked off his feet, tumbles across the icy deck 
           and slides into the gaping opening of the crab tank.

           His flashlight and shotgun skitter across the deck as he 
           plunges into the frigid waters of the saltwater tank.

           INT. CRAB TANK - CONTINUOUS

           Montoya struggles under the dark, cold saltwater of the tank. 

           His feet kick around the GRASPING CRAB, piled around the 
           bottom of the tank. 

           He kicks them off...bubbles stream from his mouth as he 
           SCREAMS under water. 

           - THE MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR

           Ben is knocked out of the corridor into the dark open space 
           around the ladder leading up to the main deck.

           Caught off-guard, he scrambles to aim his light and gun into 
           the new surroundings, wary of the lurking Russian.

           - THE ENGINE ROOM
           Nate is jolted sideways, crashes hard into the overheated 
           engine as spare parts come crashing off the shelves.

           INT. CRAB TANK - SAME

           Montoya struggles in the freezing water. 

           He swims upward towards the NARROW CIRCLE OF LIGHT above his 
           head, like a hole in an icy pond. 

           The water SLOSHES and SWAYS with the motion of the ship, 
           frustrating his efforts...

           With a huge effort, he finally gains a hold on the edge of 
           the hole...pulls himself up - 

           EXT. MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Montoya quickly surfaces, gasping for breath, shocked by the 
           temperature, hands grasping for purchase on the icy deck.

           EXT. WHEELHOUSE ROOF - SAME

           Cliff disentangles himself from Griggs, looks frantically 
           toward the bow of the ship and sees the over-sized chunk of 
           ice slide by in the water.

           Griggs gets on his feet, but Cliff is on him, venting his 
           rage. 

           He pummels Griggs, whaling on him relentlessly. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Stupid motherfucker...

           EXT. MAIN DECK - SAME

           Montoya still struggles futilely to pull himself out of the 
           freezing water of the crab tank and onto to the deck.

           BEHIND HIM, the Russian emerges from his hiding place within 
           the stack of pots, axe in hand.

           The Russian sees Montoya’s vulnerable situation, pauses at 
           the base of the stack.

           He abruptly lifts the axe and swings...

           The axe connects with one of the icy chains tethering the 
           stack of pots in place.
           The chain SNAPS and the entire port-side stack of pots 
           lurches, CAUSING A CHAIN REACTION...

           OTHER BRITTLE CHAINS BREAK FREE...

           But the stack holds....barely. Montoya panics at the sight of 
           the leaning tower of pots - looming ominously over his head.

                                 MONTOYA
                             (sotto)
                        Oh shit oh shit oh shit...

           He struggles to pull himself out of the saltwater tank.  

           The Russian stoically eyes the stack...this wasn’t the 
           intended effect...

           CLOSE ON THE RUSTED CLEAT, BARELY WELDED TO THE DECK...

           A single chain is wrapped around the GROANING cleat...IT 
           HOLDS THE ENTIRE STACK IN PLACE... 

           With a loud PING, the chain finally SNAPS - whipping across 
           the deck and releasing the energy stored in the two story 
           stack of metal. 

           Pots tumble down like a house of cards...

           A VAST MAJORITY slide across the icy deck like an avalanche. 

           Montoya only halfway out of the hole, has no time to react as 
           the steel cages come racing toward him at high speed.

           Montoya lets out a scream that’s immediately silenced, as a 
           few tons of steel crash into his exposed upper body.

           Still half submerged in the hole, Montoya’s body is ripped  
           in half.  

           His upper torso is dragged across the full length of the deck 
           by the careening pots, leaving a red streak of blood and gore 
           across the white ice.

           INSIDE THE CRAB TANK - a FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals Montoya’s 
           severed lower half...it bloodies the water as it slowly 
           settles to the bottom of the tank among the pale pink Opilio 
           crabs...already scrambling for bits of his flesh. 

           EXT. WHEELHOUSE ROOFTOP - SAME

           The commotion below interrupts Cliff beating on Griggs. He 
           turns, sees the pots crashing across the deck.
                                 CLIFF
                        Holy shit.

           Behind him, Griggs wheezes for breath, coughs out a rope of 
           bloody saliva.

           Griggs rights himself, then seizes the moment, using the 
           distraction to catch Cliff off-guard.

           In one fluid motion, Griggs grabs Cliff by the belt and 
           slicker from the back, hauls him sideways, and with a grunt 
           shoves him over the cable-railing.

           CLIFF FLAILS AND SCREAMS AS HE PLUMMETS FIVE STORIES TO THE 
           DARK, ICY WATER BELOW.  

           Griggs catches his breath, still recovering from his 
           punishment, and stares wide-eyed at the inky blackness below.

           For the briefest moment, he catches sight of Cliff’s bobbing 
           body...

           And then a rolling, ice-filled wave carries Cliff off into 
           oblivion, his FRANTIC SHOUTS drowned by the ROAR of the 
           ocean...

           Griggs looks stunned for a moment, watching Cliff 
           disappear...as if he can’t believe what he just did. 

           Griggs looks to the EPIRB...still secure in its cradle... 

           As the ship GRINDS off the ice...REVERBERATING throughout the 
           hull...

           He looks over the roof’s edge towards the MAIN DECK and the 
           collapsed mountain of pots...

           A STREAK OF BLOOD ACROSS THE ICE. 

           He scrambles to the ladder.

           INT. DRY HOLD - CONTINUOUS

           THE THIN STEEL HULL HAS RUPTURED. 

           FREEZING WATER POURS INTO THE HOLD...already forming a pool, 
           running the length of the 

           MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR...the water surges aft towards
           INT. ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Nate pulls himself from the floor as COLD WATER pools at his 
           feet. 

           He sprints through the water, SLOSHING his way forward down 
           the Maintenance Corridor...toolbelt slung over his shoulder 
           as he searches for the hull rupture.  

           EXT. MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Seemingly impervious to the ice and snow, the Russian emerges 
           from the fallen stack of pots...he moves towards the STREAK 
           OF MONTOYA’S GORE...

           He tracks the trail towards a mountain of bent and twisted 
           pots...where Montoya’s mangled corpse rests somewhere inside. 

           The Russian picks up the stray shotgun. 

           BOOM - BOOM.

           BULLETS RICOCHET AROUND HIM. 

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        DIE. YOU PIECE OF SHIT.

           The Russian turns to find Ben clambering out of the hatch in 
           the forward WEATHER DECK...over the toppled pots and FIRES 
           the Russian’s pistol from the hip. 

           The shots are surprisingly close given the rough seas. Ben’s 
           got sea legs from years on the water...

           The Russian raises the shotgun to fire, but he doesn’t have 
           Ben’s balance. BOOM as his shot goes wild. - 

           Ben fearlessly stalks towards the Russian - pushed over the 
           edge.

           BOOM. 

           The Russian is hit in the thigh...he goes down on the icy 
           deck, grimacing in pain...BLOOD SPRAYING from the wound. 

           EXT. WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Griggs nearly slips off the ladder as the GUNSHOTS echo. 

           He leaps off the remaining steps...crawls through the door 
           into the Wheelhouse. 
           EXT. MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Ben slips over the icy pots as A WAVE SLAMS THE SHIP... 
           DOUSING HIM WITH FRIGID WHITE WATER.  

           The Russian grips the shotgun, uses his other hand to pull 
           himself across the deck and into the DECK HOUSE. 

           Ben lets off another wild round - STRIKING THE GLASS OF THE 
           WHEELHOUSE. 

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - SAME

           Griggs stays low as the GLASS SHATTERS...THE BULLET COMING TO 
           REST IN THE CAPTAIN’S CHAIR.

           He crawls under the dash for protection.

           INT. DECKHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The Russian drags himself into the equipment room...BLOOD 
           SEEPING FROM HIS WOUNDED LEG...

           The blood leaves a RAGGED SMEAR across the white linoleum as 
           he drags himself down another set of stairs towards the 
           galley. 

           EXT. MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Ben slips and slides, sprinting over the blood covered ice to 
           the deckhouse in pursuit of the Russian. 

           INT. DRY HOLD - CONTINUOUS

           Deep below the waterline, Nate struggles through the 
           water...SHIVERS in the cold. 

           The ENGINE NOISE and RUSHING WATER make him oblivious to the 
           gunfight above. 

           He shakes his head in frustration at the size of the hole - 
           moves back down the Maintenance Corridor...towards the engine 
           room. 

           INT. STAIRS/GALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           The Russian pulls himself into the warmth of the galley...as
           BEN APPEARS AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS 

           BOOM - BOOM - Ben and the Russian FIRE SIMULTANEOUSLY. 

           Ben misses by a mile...but the wood paneling beside his head 
           EXPLODES IN SPLINTERS. 

           He falls back with a SCREAM, HIS EYES STUNG BY WOOD CHIPS. 

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Above the action, Griggs can’t squeeze himself any closer to 
           the wall, trying to stay under cover. 

           INT. GALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           The Russian falls back behind cover with a mysterious smile.

           He starts SOFTLY CHUCKLING to himself. 

           The Russian pulls himself to his feet. His shotgun is loosely 
           trained on the corridor entrance, at Ben’s hiding spot, as he 
           looks behind him at the cold, dead body of his companion.

           Then to Sol, gasping for breath - HIS EYES LIKE DAGGERS. 

           The Russian smiles as he moves over to Sol...JABS his seeping 
           belly wound with the shotgun. 

           Sol GROANS IN PAIN. 

                                 SOL
                        ...should’ve killed you in the 
                        first place. 

           Sol weakly bats the barrel away...the Russian only smiles, 
           condescending.

           Ben suddenly appears at the door - pistol aimed at the 
           Russian’s back. 

                                 RUSSIAN
                             (Russian with subtitles)
                        Empty.  

           The Russian doesn’t even bother to turn as 

           Ben wastes no time in PULLING THE TRIGGER...

           CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. 

           The Russian slowly turns, favoring his good leg.  
           Ben pulls the trigger again out of desperation. CLICK. 

           The Russian winks, indicates the useless gun in Ben’s hand...

                                 RUSSIAN (CONT’D)
                             (subtitled)
                        My gun. I used half the clip for 
                        the gold.  

           Ben is frozen in place. 

                                 RUSSIAN (CONT’D)
                             (subtitled)
                        Where is it?

           He raises the shotgun to Ben’s head. 

                                 BEN
                        I don’t understand - 

           The Russian snaps to anger. He racks the shotgun, loading 
           another round. 

                                 RUSSIAN
                             (subtitled)
                        THE GOLD. 

           He jabs the shotgun towards Ben’s forehead. 

           Sol watches the exchange...desperately wishing he could do 
           something...PAIN AND FRUSTRATION flash through his eyes...

           THE SHIP ROCKS UNDER A FRESH SWELL OF WAVES... 

           Ben and the Russian maintain their balance...SOL FALLS TO THE 
           FLOOR. 

           The Russian doesn’t let up - 

                                 RUSSIAN (CONT’D)
                             (subtitled)
                        THE FUCKING GOLD. THE DIAMONDS.  

           ON THE FLOOR - Sol GASPS in pain, HIS EYES LOCK ONTO THE PEN-
           KNIFE...he grabs it - 

                                 BEN
                        I DON’T SPEAK RUSSIAN, 
                        MOTHERFUCKER. IF YOU’RE GONNA 
                        SHOOT, PULL THE FUCKING TRIGGER -

           The Russian suddenly SCREAMS IN AGONY...his arms go up 
           reflexively...
           ...thankfully moving the shotgun a half-inch off Ben’s 
           forehead. 

           Ben just starts to dodge as - BOOOOOOM. 

           ON THE FLOOR - Sol has slashed at the Russian’s exposed 
           ankle, EMBEDDING the knife in his Achilles tendon. It SNAPS 
           AUDIBLY.  

           WE WATCH AS THE LIGAMENT AND MUSCLE RETRACT UP THE MAN’S LEG. 

           The Russian COLLAPSES to the floor beside - 

           Ben, GROANING through his own pain...gingerly holding the 
           bloody hole that was once his right ear.

           Ben sees the shotgun, goes for it - 

           He and the Russian grapple for the weapon. 

           Each slips and slides over the slick PUDDLE OF BLOOD...the 
           penknife still protruding from the Russian’s ankle.  

           Ben gets the upper hand, rolling on top of the Russian.

           Ben puts all his weight on the shotgun, a bar across the 
           Russian’s throat.

           The Russian’s eyes bulge, filling with blood as he loses the 
           fight...

           ...THE RUSSIAN FINDS HIMSELF STARING AT BRADY’S DEAD EYES...

           He turns his head as he struggles to pull the KNIFE from his 
           own ankle...but he’s slowly losing strength. 

           The Russian GASPS and GURGLES as Ben presses harder, eyes 
           wide, SCREAMING MANIACALLY in the killer’s face.  

           And then with a SICKENING CRUNCH the Russian STOPS 
           STRUGGLING...his hand only inches from the knife still 
           embedded in his ankle.   

           Ben doesn’t care, he keeps strangling the man who seemed 
           invincible. 

                                 SOL
                        Ben. 

           Ben doesn’t hear him.

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        BEN. 
           Ben suddenly looks up to Sol. Realizes the Russian is 
           finally, fucking dead. 

           He rolls off the Russian, exhausted, struggling to breathe. 

           REVEALING NATE...just entering the galley. 

           Nate looks between Ben, Sol and the Russian - clearly shocked 
           at the aftermath. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MAGGIE MAY - PRE-DAWN

           The storm is over and the clouds have started to recede, 
           revealing a few dim stars in the sky above. The sea is glass.

           For the first time, it’s serene and beautiful out here. 

           On the horizon, a hint of clear, blue daybreak, illuminating 
           the dark silhouette of 

           ATTU ISLAND - Alaska’s western-most Aleutian Island. 

           Extending out from and surrounding Attu is a frozen white 
           expanse...like an enormous frozen desert plain dotted with 
           car-sized berms of ice (known as ‘boxcars’). 

           This is a part of the ice pack - the dreaded mass of solid 
           ice covering the Bering Sea in all directions.

           A few miles away, the Maggie May slowly putters through the 
           ice-covered seas toward Attu and the ice pack.

           The ship is clearly crippled...she lists heavily on her 
           starboard side as she heads for a small bay. 

           EXT. BAY - FROM ABOVE

           The Maggie May is closing in on the edge of the mostly solid 
           ice blocking access to the rest of the inlet. 

           INT. ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Half-way down the steps, Nate shines a light into the now-
           flooded engine compartment.

           The murky water level is even higher than before, sloshing 
           perilously close to the single functioning engine block.
           INT. WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ben is back at the helm, the bone-chilling wind whips through 
           the broken glass as he navigates the ship through the ice. 

           The shotgun rests at Ben’s side, his bloodied earhole now 
           dressed with a makeshift bandage of gauze and duct tape.

           This had been a very long day for the Captain. 

           He keeps one eye on the sea ahead, one eye on...

           EXT. MAIN DECK - SAME

           Griggs labors in weather gear...

           He struggles to maintain his balance on the listing ship’s 
           slanted deck.

           REVEAL that he’s shoving Brady’s stiff, dead body into one of 
           the steel crab pots. 

           ANOTHER POT beside him already contains the dead Russians. 

           Both pots are tied off to the high side of the deck. 

           He eyes the starboard rail warily...the low side of the 
           angled deck...where WATER LAPS dangerously.

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        Make sure to get clear of those 
                        pots when you cut ‘em free. 

           REVEAL BEN shouting from the shattered wheelhouse window 
           above. 

           Griggs nods, doesn’t stop working.

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Nate comes up the stairwell from below, watches Griggs for a 
           few moments, doesn’t acknowledge Ben. 

                                 NATE 
                        You really think Cliff slipped off 
                        the roof?

                                 BEN
                        Not for a minute. 

           Both men seem numb as they stare at Griggs on deck.  
                                 NATE
                        The kid’s psychotic.  

           Ben checks that his shotgun is loaded. 

                                 BEN 
                        We’ll sort it out on land.

                                 NATE
                        We’re not gonna make land. 

           Ben eyes the ice around the ship...already thickening...not 
           allowing the ship to make much more forward progress. 

                                 BEN
                        Then we walk the rest of the way to 
                        the island.

                                 NATE
                        Dragging a half ton of gold?

           Ben nods. 

                                 BEN
                        The ice should be thick enough. 
                        We’ll bury it and come back after 
                        the thaw. 

           Nate shakes his head...not wanting any part of it. 

                                 NATE
                        I’ll launch the EPIRB, get the 
                        Guard on their way for Sol. 

                                 BEN
                        You walk ahead, take Sol to Attu. 
                             (beat)
                        But the EPIRB’ll go off when the 
                        ship goes does down. We need a head 
                        start - 

                                 NATE
                        That’s too long.  

           Ben’s temper rises. 

                                 BEN
                        We lose that loot, we lose 
                        everything...

           Nate moves past Ben...headed to the outer catwalk and the 
           ladder that leads to the roof of the wheelhouse.
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Do not touch the EPIRB. You owe me 
                        and the family that much. 

                                 NATE
                             (incredulous)
                        What? 

                                 BEN
                        We’ve been trying to climb out of a 
                        pit since that night you fucked 
                        up...all that motherfucking stress 
                        you put on us.
                             (beat)
                        All your bullshit...it killed him.

                                 NATE
                        What the hell are you talking 
                        about?

                                 BEN
                        You...fucking killed Dad. 

           Nate takes a step away from the ladder - moves towards Ben. 
           Menacing. 

                                 NATE
                        What did you just say?

                                 BEN
                        You heard me. 

                                 NATE
                        I don’t owe you or anyone else 
                        anything. And you don’t know shit 
                        about what really happened... 

                                 BEN
                        The fuck I don’t...

           Ben’s unsure as Nate turns his back, moves to the ladder. 

           Ben’s hand reflexively moves to the shotgun in a not so 
           subtle gesture.

                                 NATE
                        Shoot me. 

           Ben can’t bring himself to put the shotgun on his brother.

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        When this is all over, we go our 
                        separate ways. 
                                 BEN
                        Nate, you just don’t fucking get 
                        it. It was never just about us. 
                        This money is gonna go a long way 
                        for the guys’ families. 

           Nate pauses in thought, his back still turned. 

           But he’s still got Sol to think about. He heads up the ladder 
           to release the EPIRB. 

           EXT. WHEELHOUSE ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           Nate steps up to the sloping, slick roof. 

           He moves to the EPIRB at the roof’s edge - 

           EXT. MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Griggs watches as Nate goes for the EPIRB...UNLATCHES IT FROM 
           ITS CRADLE.

           Griggs looks up to Ben...not doing anything about it. 

           Ben shouts down to Griggs. 

                                 BEN
                        Guard’ll be here in a few hours. 

           Griggs gives one last shove, nearly slips on his ass but gets 
           Brady’s body in the trap. 

           He rights himself and grabs an AXE - swings it high...

           Severs the rope holding the traps and their gruesome cargo to 
           the angled deck.

           BOTH TRAPS SLIDE ACROSS THE ICY DECK AND INTO THE BERING. 

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ben watches the bodies sink into the blackness....

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ICE PACK - LATER

           The bright sunrise is surreal...reflecting off a mile of 
           broken ice and boxcars surrounding the tiny, deserted island. 
           If it wasn’t for the crystal blue skies, the scene could be 
           mistaken for the surface of the moon. 

           A HOWLING wind whips across the icy deck, now angled 45 
           degrees and deep into the water...and slipping further by the 
           second...the freezing water now laps across it like an 
           artificial beach. 

           Ben and Griggs STAND ON THE ICE. 

           They’ve insulated themselves against the elements as much as 
           possible - layering their DECK WEAR and DOWN COATS over their 
           DRY SUITS.

           They tie on makeshift harnesses...heavy duty line strapped 
           across their chests and attached to TWO SEPARATE MAGGIE MAY 
           LIFE RAFTS...EACH FILLED WITH SIX JAPANESE EMBLAZONED 
           LOCKBOXES. 

           The rafts are held in place and out of the water by multiple 
           ropes, tied to the port side rail, angled high in the air. 

           Griggs tests the ropes...looks first to the treasure laden 
           rafts and then across the white, rugged expanse to the 
           island...seemingly an infinity away. 

           He looks worried as he shifts his steps on the crunching ice.  

                                 GRIGGS
                        Why can’t we just drop this loot in 
                        a pot with a buoy...come back for 
                        it later?

                                 BEN
                        Because the ice’ll pop the buoy and 
                        drag this shit halfway back to 
                        Russia. 

           Griggs nods to himself...still worried as he looks to the 
           shoreline ahead. 

           Ben points straight ahead...NORTH, beyond the bay, to a 
           distant treeline, past the ice-locked beach...

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        That’s where we bury it. 
                             (off Griggs’ skepticism)
                        The ice is thicker than it looks. 
                        We already split the load so the 
                        weight’ll be less concentrated. If 
                        we keep moving, we won’t have to 
                        worry.

           Griggs watches as Ben duct-tapes the shotgun to his forearm. 
                                 GRIGGS
                        What’s that for?

                                 BEN
                        Just in case. 

           Griggs isn’t convinced. 

           AT THE DECKHOUSE

           Nate suddenly appears from the door, now at the top of the 
           angled deck...SOL OVER HIS SHOULDERS in a fireman’s carry...

           He ignores Ben and Griggs as 

           Nate carefully picks his way down to the edge of the 
           deck...Sol perched precariously above it all...

           Nate pauses at the ice...the surreality of the situation 
           seeping in. 

           Ben watches closely as 

           Nate takes his first step onto the CREAKING, SNOW-COVERED 
           ICE.

           He begins carefully walking NORTH, straight for the shore...a 
           mound of white in the distance. 

           Ben moves to the ice as well, followed by Griggs. 

           Ben pulls an axe - Griggs holds his ‘harness ropes’ fearfully 
           as Ben readies to chop the ropes holding the half-ton life 
           rafts in place. 

           If the rafts sink, so do he and Ben. 

           Ben finally CHOPS.

           The rafts slide down the icy deck...COME TO REST ON THE ICE 
           BEHIND THEM.  

           THE ICE CREAKS UNDER THE WEIGHT. 

           EXT. ICE PACK - CONTINUOUS

           Nate turns at the sound of the rafts hitting the ice...

           Ben and Griggs start pulling like sled dogs...Griggs sticks a 
           little too close to Ben. 
                                 BEN
                        Don’t bunch up, we need to spread 
                        the weight out. 

           Nate turns away from them, starts trudging towards the island 
           as Sol WHEEZES faintly, his face only inches from Nate’s... 

           THE ISLAND SEEMS TINY...FAR AWAY...

           EXT. BAY - FROM HIGH ABOVE

           We watch the two parties move north on the same path from the 
           crippled ship.

           Even with Sol on his back, Nate rapidly outpaces Ben and 
           Griggs.  

                                                              BLEND TO:

           EXT. ICE PACK/ATTU SHORELINE - LATER

           The sun is higher in the sky...

           Parts of the ice sheet melt under the heat of the rising sun.

           Making Nate’s labored steps even more treacherous as he 
           finally gets close to the ‘shore’.  

           He heaves and pants...willing his legs to move across the 
           crackling, treacherous landscape...

           ANGLE ON ATTU ISLAND

           The island looms large ahead...its frozen treeline and craggy 
           hills dominating the skyline now...

           Only a few yards to the ‘beach’...and a safe place to wait 
           for rescue. 

           Nate moves past a large ice ‘boxcar’. 

           He struggles for breath as he places Sol gently on the snow 
           behind the berm.  

           He shields his eyes from the glare and wind-whipped snow as 
           he looks over his shoulder, back towards the water.

           ANGLE ON THE WATER IN THE DISTANCE

           Ben and Griggs are tiny, red figurines dragging their rafts 
           towards Nate and Sol. 
           Nate looks past them, towards THE MAGGIE MAY

           The family ship is half-sunk...leaning on the melting ice-
           floe...its deck exposed to the sun...

           Nate turns back to Sol.

                                 NATE
                        Sol. 

           He eats some snow as he tries to regain some fluids...scoops 
           some for Sol, who’s motionless. 

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        Sol. We fucking made it. 

           He leans down to the older man, pries open his eyes - 

           CLOUDED AND UNBLINKING...SOL IS DEAD. 

           Nate struggles to catch his breath as he falls back against 
           the boxcar. Utterly defeated. 

           He cranes his neck around the boxcar to see Griggs and Ben, 
           still far in the distance behind him. 

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        Motherfuckers. 

           ON BEN AND GRIGGS - CONTINUOUS

           The men are exhausted and sunburned...sweating profusely in 
           the sun.  

           They trudge through a maze of knee-high boxcars...dragging 
           the heavy rafts over the ice...like a white desert. 

           THE ICE CRACKS AND SWAYS AS THEY MOVE...but neither has the 
           strength to worry anymore. 

           Ben looks to Griggs, who’s halted and staring in confusion at 
           the carcass of the Maggie May. 

           The ICE SHIFTS.  

                                 BEN
                        Griggs. Keep moving. 

           Griggs doesn’t move, too distracted by what he’s seeing. 

                                 GRIGGS
                        What the fuck?
           Ben finally follows Griggs’ gaze. 

           ON THE MAGGIE MAY - IN THE DISTANCE 

           A FIGURE stands on the nearly horizontal wheelhouse. 

           A MAN...dark against the blue sky...GHOSTLIKE.

           ON NATE - 

           He sees the same Figure appear at the Maggie May. 

           BACK ON GRIGGS AND BEN - 

           Something glints near the Figure’s ‘face’...

                                 GRIGGS (CONT’D)
                        Is that - ?

           SW-FFFFFT...THUMP. 

           A CLOUD OF BLOOD AND FEATHERS ERUPTS FROM THE BACK OF GRIGGS’ 
           DOWN JACKET. 

           ...the CRACK of the distant rifle finally catches up to its 
           destruction a split second later...

           ...as both Ben and Griggs stare in disbelief at a large 
           bloody hole in Griggs’ chest. 

           The snow behind Griggs resembles a modern-art blood slushy.  

           ON NATE

           He reacts to the rifle’s report...ECHOING ACROSS THE ICE. 

           He watches Griggs’ body fall to its knees in the snow. 

           ON BEN

           SW-FFFFT. A bullet SMACKS into the boxcar beside Ben’s head.

           He dives behind the barrier as TWO MORE ROUNDS hit the ice...

           ...AND THE RAFTS...PUNCTURING THEM. 

           AIR HISSES from the heavy rafts as Ben cowers. 

           TWENTY FEET AWAY -

           FISSURES FORM IN THE ICE AROUND GRIGGS’ RAFT...

           Griggs, still on his knees, weakly tries to stand...blood 
           frothing at his lips...
           EXT. MAGGIE MAY - CONTINUOUS

           Standing on the upended port side rail of the sinking 
           ship...A MAN in black arctic gear and mirrored sunglasses 
           holds a SNIPER RIFLE WITH SCOPE. 

           Beside him, a MAN IN A BASEBALL CAP uses binoculars to act as 
           spotter. 

           REVEAL BEHIND HIM - 

           ANOTHER SHIP has pulled in just behind the sinking Maggie 
           May...Cyrillic name on its bow. The ship is hidden from the 
           view of the Americans on the ice. 

           The ship is nearly as wrecked as the Maggie May...with the 
           exception that it’s still afloat. The storm wasn’t kind to 
           the Russians either...

           A HALF-DOZEN, EXHAUSTED, ARMED MEN stand on the bow, a few 
           chuckle as they watch ONE OF THEIR COMRADES, CONTINUOUSLY 
           PUKING OVER THE SIDE...

           They all wear high-end arctic gear, carry assault rifles. 
           These guys have come loaded for bear. 

           They make our dead Russians look like errand boys. 

           ON THE MAGGIE MAY

           ANOTHER MAN, their LEADER, steps from the angled wheelhouse. 

                                 LEADER
                             (subtitled)
                        How many? 

                                 SNIPER
                        Two. One alive...one dead. 

           The Leader cocks an eyebrow. 

                                 SNIPER (CONT’D)
                        Fucking boat moved. 

           The Leader nods. Wordlessly steps onto the ice. 

           The rest of his men follow his lead onto the ice, trudging 
           towards Ben’s position. 

           ON GRIGGS

           He’s alive. Barely. His eyes widen as he hears the SOUND OF 
           CRACKING ICE. 
           Griggs looks to the raft, just as - 

           THE OVERLADEN, DEFLATED RAFT PUNCHES THROUGH THE ICE AND 
           FALLS THROUGH INTO THE DARK WATER.  

           BEN watches helplessly from behind cover as Griggs’ HARNESS 
           GOES TAUT. 

           Griggs’ eyes go wide as a quarter ton of treasure YANKS HIM 
           OFF HIS KNEES and across the ice -

           Griggs leaves a RED STREAK as he’s dragged towards the edge 
           by the sinking raft - 

                                 GRIGGS
                        NO -

           And then Griggs is gone, over the jagged lip. 

           CLOSE ON THE ICE HOLE

           We get one last glimpse of Griggs’ horrified face UNDER THE 
           FRIGID WATER before he disappears in the inky darkness. 

           ON BEN

           As he looks around the boxcar to see half a dozen armed men 
           moving across the ice towards him. 

           He looks to his raft...rapidly deflating and lopsided...

           THE ICE BEGINS TO CRACK from the dead weight...

           HE PULLS ON HIS ROPES as hard as he can...trying to pull the 
           quarter-ton of loot towards him, away from the breaking ice 
           and out of the line of fire. 

           ON NATE

           He’s been watching the scene unfold from the shadow of the 
           island...

           Nate’s only a few hundred yards from warmth and safety - the 
           Russians seem to have no idea he’s even there. 

           ON THE RUSSIANS

           They jog in a line towards Ben’s hiding spot.

                                 LEADER
                        Hold your fire. The ice is fragile - 

           A COCKY RUSSIAN UNLOADS HIS CLIP AT THE RAFT AND THE ICE 
           SHIELDING BEN. 
           The Sniper and Baseball Cap shake their heads in frustration. 

           ON BEN

           He cringes as the gunfire CRACKS around him - hitting the 
           raft multiple times and speeding up the deflation. 

           BEN STRAINS as he hauls on the ropes...but it’s a losing 
           battle as the ice cracks more - 

           He finally pulls the shotgun, places it over the edge of the 
           boxcar. 

           ON THE RUSSIANS

           As the Sniper sees the barrel of the shotgun first...

           BOOM - BOOM. 

           Baseball Cap is hit in the leg by the spray. 

           The Russians scatter, taking cover behind broken ice berms.

           ON BEN

           He looks to the raft of loot...EXPOSED IN THE OPEN. 

           Ben looks back to the ice berms and boxcars where the 
           Russians have ducked out of sight...

           ...back to the sinking lockboxes. 

           Ben takes a deep breath. Puts the shotgun down - AND DIVES 
           FOR THE RAFT. 

           ON THE RAFT

           He leaps for an exposed lockbox - 

           ON THE RUSSIANS

           The Cocky Russian peeks over his berm, spots Ben.

           He FIRES - 

           STRIKING BEN IN THE SIDE. 

           As Ben is blown backwards from the raft - STRAY DIAMONDS 
           SCATTER AMIDST THE SNOW AND ICE...now indistinguishable... 

           Ben’s body strikes the ice around the raft - 

           WITH A TREMENDOUS CRACK - THE ICE FINALLY BREAKS FREE. 
           The raft begins to sink into the icy water below...

           Ben weakly crawls behind the berm, bleeding out over the 
           white. 

           ON THE RUSSIANS 

           The Leader watches the raft falling into the water...

           He shakes his head at Cocky.

                                 LEADER (CONT’D)
                        Idiot. 

           Cocky rises up - testing to see if Ben will return fire. 
           Nothing. 

                                 COCKY
                        He’s down. It’s ours.  

           The rest of the men cautiously eye the cracking ice.

           ON BEN

           Weakly dragging himself away from the raft...

           But the weight of the raft is sinking further...pulling the 
           harness ropes into the water...

           And dragging Ben towards the RAPIDLY GROWING HOLE as well. 

           Lockboxes are no longer visible, SINKING BELOW THE ICE LINE. 

                                 BEN
                        No no no no - 

           He tries to reach HIS KNIFE, strapped to his ankle - 

           SUDDENLY, THERE’S HANDS UNDER HIS ARMS...fighting to pull him 
           from the raft. 

           Ben looks up - finds Nate there. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        ...MY ANKLE...MY ANKLE -  

           Nate grabs the knife, starts sawing at the ropes...

           ON THE RUSSIANS

           Cocky calmly walks towards Ben’s cover, the injured man’s 
           legs sliding towards the hole in the ice. 

           He smirks sadistically. Unafraid, full of bravado. 
           He fires haphazardly around Ben’s exposed legs...

           ON NATE AND BEN

           Nate ducks as gunfire peppers the ice. 

           Ben SCREAMS IN PAIN as he’s struck in the leg. 

           Nate sees Ben’s shotgun. 

           ON COCKY

           Moving fearlessly, gun aimed at where he believes Ben to be. 

           Until Nate appears, aiming at him from the top of the ice 
           berm.  

           Cocky pauses in surprise. 

           BOOM. 

           The cocky Russian gets both barrels in the chest. 

           He’s blown backwards to the snow by the blast. 

           ON THE RUSSIANS

           No one seems to care...a few chuckle to themselves.  

                                 LEADER
                        You said there were only two.

           The Sniper shrugs. 

                                 SNIPER
                        I was wrong...

           A few more chuckles from the group. 

                                 BASEBALL CAP
                        Fuck him. 

           No one disagrees. 

           He nods his men to the right and the left...they begin 
           scrambling from berm to berm - moving to flank Nate and Ben. 

           ON NATE AND BEN

           Nate peeks his head above the boxcar...glimpses the Russians 
           moving to surround them. 

           ROUNDS SMACK INTO THE ICE around his head. 
           He ducks back down for cover once again. 

           Ben bleeds out beside him, finally cut free of the sinking 
           raft - which he still watches forlornly. 

           He looks to Ben - whose attention is elsewhere. 

                                 NATE
                        This count as dying at sea? 

           Ben looks at him for a beat...then WHEEZES OUT A LAUGH. 

           ...until blood froths at his lips. 

           Nate watches him, resigned to their shared fate. 

                                 BEN
                        Thanks for coming back. 

           Ben smiles...BLOOD STAINS HIS TEETH. 

                                 NATE
                        Bet you feel like a douchebag. 

           Ben stares at him for a beat. 

                                 BEN
                        What did you mean?

                                 NATE
                        Huh?

                                 BEN
                        On the ship...about what happened 
                        with Dad...? 

           Nate tries to shrug it off.  

                                 NATE
                        Forget I said it. 

           Ben grabs him as he coughs up more blood. 

                                 BEN
                        Nathan -

           He won’t let go of Nate’s arm. Ben relents. 

                                 NATE
                        That night. That you never fucking 
                        let me live down.  
                             (beat)
                        I wasn’t at the wheel.
                                 BEN
                        What?

                                 NATE
                        Dad was. Ship rolled and I took the 
                        fall. 

                                 BEN
                        Bullshit - 

           Ben has a fit of coughing, BLOOD SPRAYS the snow. 

           Nate steadies him - 

                                 NATE
                        I woke up. Ship was hitting heavy 
                        chop. Went to check on him. Old man 
                        was dead asleep at the helm. 
                             (beat)
                        And then the wave hit - 

                                 BEN
                        Fucking liar...Dad corroborated... 
                        Coast Guard found shit in your 
                        system...

           Nate nods sadly. 

                                 NATE
                        You’re right. I had pain pills in 
                        me...
                             (beat)
                        ...but so did he. Guard never 
                        checked him. 

                                 BEN
                        What...?

                                 NATE
                        If he’d gotten nailed for that 
                        accident, he wouldn’t have been 
                        able to live another day. 

           Ben looks at him in shock. 

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        I was just helping the old man out. 
                        Never thought I’d be tossed in 
                        jail. 
                             (beat)
                        Wonderful, ain’t it? 

           Ben digests it all...can’t believe the truth. 
                                 BEN
                        And no one else knew...

                                 NATE
                        Well. 
                             (beat)
                        Sol. 

           Ben goes quiet...

           ON THE RUSSIANS

           They’re circling in on Ben and Nate. 

           Baseball Cap is parallel to them, limping behind cover...

           ON NATE AND BEN

           Nate spots Baseball Cap...

           He racks the shotgun, raises it...FIRES OFF BOTH BARRELS. 

           It hammers the ice - pushing Baseball Cap back and away. 

           ON THE RUSSIANS

           They all duck and cover behind their berms. 

           ON BEN AND NATE

           Another Russian pops up to the other side of their cover, 
           FIRES at them...

           Nate FIRES OFF ONE ROUND...pushing the Russian back. 

           Then CLICK. 

           He pulls Ben behind more cover as the Russian unloads. 

           Ben and Nate cower under the spray of ice. 

           ON THE SNIPER AND THE LEADER

           The Sniper angles for a head shot on Nate...who bounces in 
           and out of the crosshairs. 

           When...out of the silence of the ice field...

           WHUMP-WHUMP-WHUMP-WHUMP...

           All eyes go to the sky. 

           IN THE DISTANCE...THE TINIEST TRACE OF A HELICOPTER MOVING 
           OVER OPEN OCEAN IN THEIR DIRECTION.  
           ON NATE AND BEN

           Nate’s suddenly got a light back in his eyes. 

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        ...that is the sweetest fucking 
                        sound I’ve ever heard.

           Ben is HACKING UP BLOOD...his face a pasty white. 

           ON THE RUSSIANS - they all look towards their Leader. 

           The Leader looks to the hole where the lockboxes have long 
           since sunken back into the Bering Sea. 

                                 LEADER
                        Mark the spot. It will still be 
                        here after the thaw. 

           He gets up, starts moving back in the direction of his ship. 

           However, the Sniper lingers...Nate finally in his sights...

                                 LEADER (CONT’D)
                        NOW. 

           The Sniper sighs in frustration...does as he’s told.  

           Nate is spared. 

           ALL OF THE RUSSIANS ABANDON THEIR POSITIONS, FOLLOW THEIR 
           LEADER BACK TO THEIR SHIP. 

           ...As the helicopter grows louder...more defined in the sky 
           as it approaches. 

           ON NATE AND BEN

           Nate watches the Russians retreating. He seeks out the rescue 
           chopper in the sky. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COAST GUARD HELICOPTER - LATER

           THE ENGINE AND WIND NOISE IS UNBEARABLY LOUD. 

           The PILOT and COPILOT maneuver through the low clouds of a 
           newly gathering storm.

           TWO MEDICS hover over Ben...administering first aid.
           Swaddled in blankets, Nate observes from the corner as they 
           stabilize his brother. 

           It’s rough, but Ben’s going to live. 

           Nate’s eyes fill with emotion as he reaches for Ben’s hand... 

           Tears stream from his eyes as they fall on Ben’s clothing, 
           stripped and laying in a pile at his feet...

           Something GLINTS in the fading sunlight...

           He slowly reaches out...grabs Ben’s jacket...looks inside a 
           pocket...

           CLOSE ON NATE’S FACE...speckled sunlight reflected back onto 
           his face - 

           REVEAL a large pile of DIAMONDS...

           Nate stares at them for a beat, mesmerized...what’s he going 
           to do...?

           He looks to Ben, they lock eyes for a LONG BEAT. 

           ...and Nate ZIPS THE POCKET.

           Nate pulls the jacket closer, protectively, as he looks out 
           the window to the gathering storm. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ATTU ISLAND - DUSK

           WIND AND DARK CLOUDS signal a gathering storm. 

           CLOSE ON the last bit of the Maggie May, the FADED FAMILY 
           CREST over the wheelhouse windows...finally slips below the 
           water line. 

                                                         CUT TO BLACK.
