           INT MARGOT’S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

           Nouvelle Vague's Loungey version of "This is Not A Love Song" 
           plays on the stereo as Margot, 28, mixes muffin batter. It’s 
           sweltering hot. She wipes sweat from her forehead. She pours 
           the batter into a muffin tin, very carefully. She puts the 
           tin in the oven.

           Margot switches on the oven light. She bends down to look at 
           the muffins rising. The shadow of a man passes her. He walks 
           to the window at the back of the kitchen and stands there. We 
           see only his outline, out of focus in the back of the frame. 
           Margot sits down on the floor beside the oven. Leans her 
           head, and rests it on the oven door, lit by the warm glow of 
           the light. The muffins rise. She watches them, the expression 
           on her face a curious mixture of peace,  yearning, 
           contentment,and longing. The man puts his hand on the window. 
           Shafts of light fall on the floor.

           The song plays over this and the next scene.

           "This is not a love song. This is not a love song.

           I'm adaptable and I like my new role, I'm getting better and 
           better, I have a new goal, I'm changing my ways, where money 
           applies, this is not a love song.

           This is not a love song. This is not a love song."

           INT MARGOT’S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Well choreographed, familiar sex. We watch Margot and her 
           husband Lou make love. There’s a certain routine about it. 
           Occasionally Margot seems distracted. Seems to be thinking 
           too much about the movements. Lou is on top of her. She tries 
           to maneouver him onto his back. He isn’t picking up on her 
           intention. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Maybe we could-

                                 LOU
                        What?

                                 MARGOT
                        Let me get on top.

                                 LOU
                        Oh. Okay.

           They awkwardly roll into position. She starts fucking him 
           energetically. He looks weirdly uncomfortable. She becomes 
           self conscious. They both do. She slows down.

           He moves her back onto her back. Goes back to what he was 
           doing. It’s enjoyable, but slightly self conscious for both 
           of them.

           INT MARGOT’S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Margot lies on her side, naked. We see the blurry shape of 
           Lou behind her. She is sweaty. Lou rolls onto his back.

                                 MARGOT
                        This morning when I was lying on 
                        the deck. I looked up and there 
                        were about twenty seagulls circling 
                        above me. 

                                 LOU
                        We’re close to the lake.

                                 MARGOT
                        Not that close. I looked around and 
                        there weren’t any others in the 
                        sky. Maybe something was dead.

                                 LOU
                        You would have smelled it wouldn’t 
                        you?

                                 MARGOT
                        There weren’t any others in the 
                        sky.

                                 LOU
                        Maybe they thought you were dead.

                                 MARGOT
                        Yeah.

           He gets up and goes to the bathroom. She listens to the sound 
           of him peeing.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        I should check on the muffins.

           Credits over this sequence:

           "Fire" by Jason Collett plays as Margot leaves her house and 
           walks along College St. She walks through Little Portugal, 
           Little Italy, up to Little Korea. She looks in many windows, 
           stares at many passing faces. She seems to be looking for 
           something. Or nothing in particular.

           INT MARGOT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margot lies in Lou's arms at the end of the day.

           INT MARGOT’S BEDROOM - DAWN

           Margot is fully dressed. A suitcase ready to go beside her. 
           She puts her hand on Lou’s side. He smiles as he slowly opens 
           his eyes. Strokes her hair paternally. She uses a strange 
           “baby voice” with him here. As though she’s two or three 
           years old. He seems unperturbed. Responds in kind with a very 
           paternal voice.

                                 MARGOT
                        No one’s even making me bwekfast. I 
                        mad at you.

                                 LOU
                        Okay stinky. I’m coming.

           INT BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Margot is taking a shower. Suddenly a spurt of cold water 
           hits her. She yelps.

                                 MARGOT
                        Lou! We have to get this looked at! 
                        I keep getting these spurts of cold 
                        water!

           EXT MARGOT’S PORCH - EARLY MORNING

           An airport limo waits at the curb. Lou hugs Margot warmly.

                                 LOU
                        Don’t be nervous. Just remember. 
                        Even stupid people figure out 
                        airports.

                                 MARGOT
                        That just means I’m even worse than 
                        I thought.

                                 LOU
                        I love you so much I'm going to 
                        mash your head in with a potato 
                        masher.

                        I love you so much I want to put 
                        your spleen through a meat grinder.

                                 LOU
                        Um. Um... I love you so much I'd 
                        like to inject your face with a 
                        curious combination of ebola and 
                        swine flu.

           Margot laughs.

                                 MARGOT
                        You've won this round my friend...

           He kisses her head sweetly.

                                 LOU
                        You’re fine. You’re good. Call me 
                        when you get there.

                                 MARGOT
                        Bye.

           They kiss. He kisses her forehead and puts her suitcase into 
           the trunk of the waiting airport limo. She gets in and it 
           drives off. She waves until it is completely out of sight.

           INT PEARSON AIRPORT - MORNING

           Margot enters the airport and begins to walk towards the 
           check -in desk with a pronounced limp. ( We haven’t noticed 
           this before.)She goes to wait in line. Only one person in 
           front of her. She looks incredibly anxious. Her turn to go to 
           the counter. She approaches with the limp.

           Margot is wheeled off the plane and arrives in the hallway 
           with the other passengers, pushed along by an Air Canada rep 
           in a wheelchair. Margot Looks anxiously around. Looks at her

                        to terminal 3. You can just relax.

           INT TERMINAL 3 - AFTERNOON

           Margot arrives at her gate. There is no one else there. She 
           sits and waits. Slowly, in a series of dissolves, we see 
           people begin to arrive and she boards the plane.

           A Plane touches down at sunset.

           Margot drives a rental car through the landscape. She is 
           calmer now, staring out at the stunning landscape of cliffs 
           and ocean.
           INT BED AND BREAKFAST - NIGHT

           Margot talks on the phone to Lou.

                                 MARGOT
                        It was weelly weelly hard. Cause I 
                        had to go in a big scary airport.

           She suddenly shifts again back into adult talk.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        Yeah. I think I’m going to nap a 
                        little bit. The fortress isn't open 
                        til tomorrow. Good planning eh?

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        I wuv you too. You’re soooo nice. 

           Back to adult voice.

                        ‘Kay. Love you too. Yup. Bye.

           Margot leans back on the headboard. Sighs. A certain 
           emptiness coming over her.

           EXT LOUISBOURG ROAD

           Margot walks with her back pack through the town of 
           Louisbourg. It's a small, fog trapped fishing town. She walks 
           down a road with a sign that reads Louisbourg Fortress. 

           INT LOUISBOURG FORTRESS INFO CENTRE.

           Margot buys a ticket to the fortress.

                        That will be 17 dollars.

           Margot pulls out a badge and some paperwork.

           INT BUS

           A Bus transports Margot from the info centre to the fortress, 
           winding through lush fields with wildflowers and a view of 
           the ocean. Margot stares at the other tourists, mostly older 
           couples with cameras around their necks. A calm, soothing 
           female narrator plays over the ride through the bus speaker. 
           The landscape is breathtakingly beautiful.

                        The Fortress of Louisbourg National 
                        Historic Site was once a busy 
                        fortified seaport. From its 
                        founding by the French in 1713 to 
                        its abandonment by the British in 
                        1768, Louisbourg was a place of 
                        profound significance in the Franco-
                        British struggle for empire. During 
                        its heydey, Louisbourg was the 
                        administrative capital of French 
                        holdings in Atlantic Canada, a 
                        military stronghold and naval base 
                        to protect French interests in the 
                        region, and an Anglo-French 
                        battleground in both 1745 and 1758. 
                        Each summer the Fortress springs to 
                        life as dozens of costumed 
                        animators become the town's 
                        residents of the summer of 1744. 
                        You'll see engineers, musicians, 
                        soldiers, merchants, street 
                        vendors, bakers, servants and 
                        fisherman. Watch demonstrations of 
                        dance, music, cooking, gardening,

           We hear the same thing read in French. The bus arrives at 
           it's destination and the passengers line up to get out.

           As the bus driver lets the passengers out he calmly 
           announces:

           Margot watches as a woman in a costume from the 1800's makes 
           lace and describes to a tour group how she is doing it. 

           EXT LOUISBOURG FORTRESS

           Margot watches as cannons are fired by reinactors.

           EXT LOUISBOURG FORTRESS

           Margot is walking in the little replicated village, making 
           notes when a man in garb from the 1700's walks by yelling.

                                 REINACTOR#1
                        Public Punishment! Public 
                        Punishment! Everyone gather in the 
                        square for the public punishment!

           Margot's curiousity is piqued. She hurriedly follows the man 
           through the winding streets, alongside other bloodthirsty 
           tourists.

           EXT LOUISBOURG FORTRESS - PUBLIC SQUARE

           Margot and other tourists while a "criminal" is jostled back 
           and forth between "soldiers.

                                 SOLDIER
                        This here cretin stole a loaf of 
                        bread from the Smith household! He 
                        shall be subjected to a lashing the 
                        likes of which he's never 
                        experienced in all his days!!!

           The weird tourists cheer. The soldier begins lashing him. The 
           Criminal cries out in mock pain. It goes on a while. Longer 
           than is comfortable. Margot shifts uncomfortably.

                                 SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        Ah. I see a lady who would like to 
                        try her hand at a thrashing do I 
                        not?

           Margot looks behind her. Shit. He's looking at her.

                                 SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        Why I'm sure this cretin wouldn't 
                        mind a thrashing from a lovely lady 
                        now would he?

           The Criminal looks pleadingly at Margot. She is mortally 
           embarrassed. An older male tourist turns to her.

                                 TOURIST
                        Go for it darlin. I'd do it if 
                        they'd give me half a chance.

           She looks at him like he's insane. She turns to the soldier.

                                 MARGOT
                        I think this gentleman here seems 
                        interested.

           A man in the crowd, SETH, in his early 30's calls out.

                                 SETH
                        No! Make the woman do it! She wants 
                        to! You can tell!

           Margot turns around to glare at him. Mortified. He smiles at 
           her. She reluctantly takes the whip. Gives the criminal a 
           couple of half hearted lashings.

                                 SETH (CONT’D)
                        Well done. But put your back into 
                        it more!

           Margot laughs. 

                                 SOLDIER
                        Right! And now we'll put him in the 
                        stocks!

           The soldier forces the man into the stocks. Margot slinks 
           back into the crowd. Her face bright red. Seth passes her.

                                 SETH

           EXT LOUISBOURG CLIFFS

           Margot sits looking out at the ocean. SETH, the man from 
           earlier approaches from behind.  He is in his late twenties. 
           Dark, tousled hair. Strange and attractive. He is looking out 
           at the ocean too, lost in his own thoughts.

                                 SETH
                        What are you thinking about?

           She turns and sees him.

                                 MARGOT
                        Oh. I don't know. What I want I 
                        guess.

                                 SETH
                        You're lucky.

                        Sure. Most people are just trying 
                        to figure out what they need.

           She smiles. He keeps walking. Down the coast. She watches him 
           for a moment and goes back to her thoughts. Suddenly a huge 
           breakwave crashes over her. She yelps and jumps back. Seth 
           looks back. She is drenched. They both laugh. Margot shrugs, 
           embarrassed. Tries to shake some of the water off. They walk 
           in opposite directions.

           INT HALIFAX AIRPORT - DAY

           Margot gets off the plane for her connection in Halifax. She 
           is, again, met by an Air Canada Rep with a wheelchair. As she 
           is wheeled off, another person we recognize gets off the 
           plane. This is Seth, the man we saw in Louisbourg.He looks 
           after her, puzzled.

           INT HALIFAX AIRPORT - TORONTO GATE - DAY

           Passengers are boarding the flight to Toronto. Seth watches 
           as Margot is "helped" out of her wheelchair and limps down 
           the corridor to the plane. He furrows his brow, thinking.
           INT PLANE - DAY

           Margot is seated comfortably in the window seat. Relaxed, 
           reading a book of Daphne Merkin essays. Seth, checking his 
           seat number, sits next to her. She looks up. Does a double 
           take.

                                 MARGOT

           group of passengers waiting for their flight. They are behind 
           glass so it is totally silent, but they watch as the 
           passengers talk, flirt, play with and scold children, eat 
           alone, etc. They walk, not looking at each other, freaked by 
           their conversation, each other, being beside each other. They 
           are both in their own worlds, and irreparably aware of the 
           body next to them.

           turns away and opens the door to her house and without 
           looking back goes in. Seth shakes his head. Takes out a pack 
           of cigarettes and sits on his front stoop, smoking, and 
           glancing up at Margot's house.

           FADE OUT.

           seven brothers and sisters. A lot of kids running around. 
           Margot holds a three year old girl named Tony on her lap, 
           playing a raucous game of swinging and bumping her on her 
           knee. Lou glances over and catches Margot's eye. They smile 
           at each other. He watches her play with Tony with tenderness. 
           Margot wanders through, talking and joking with Lou's family, 
           Tony on her hip. There's a lot of warmth here, and Margot 
           fits right in. She goes into the kitchen and we follow her.

           INT KITCHEN - MORNING

           Margot gets Tony some juice.

                        Auntie Margot you're a happy lady.

           Margot looks down at her and smiles.

                                 MARGOT
                        Yes I am. Are you a happy lady 
                        Tony?

                                 TONY
                        A lot of the time. Uh-huh.

           Margot looks out at the livingroom, at the chaos of this huge 
           family. She looks comforted. Happy.

                                 MARGOT
                        Yeah. I am a lot of the time too.

           INT MARGOT'S LIVINGROOM - MORNING

           Margot hands Tony off to GERALDINE, her mother, Lou's sister.

                                 MARGOT
                        How's it goin?

           Geraldine smiles. Wants to talk more. Turns into the room.

                                 GERALDINE
                        Who wants to play with Tony?!

           EXT MARGOT'S PORCH - MORNING

           Geraldine has a smoke and talks to Margot.

                                 GERALDINE
                        I'll tell you what doesn't help me. 
                        Every book you read about it 
                        involves people falling off the 
                        wagon like, eight times. So it's 
                        good. I mean, it's really good. but 
                        there's this sense of just kind 
                        of...waiting to fail.

           Margot listens compassionately.

                                 MARGOT
                        You look so well.

                        look in the mirror I wanna fuck 
                        myself. I think I look better than 
                        I did before Tony.

           Pause.

                                 GERALDINE (CONT'D)
                        Thoughts?

                        Yeah. That's the kind of moment 
                        where you should, you know, chime

                        I don't think you're going to fail.

                                 GERALDINE
                        Don't look at me like that. All 
                        earnest like. Next time I wake up 
                        in a pile of my own vomit I'll have 
                        to feel guilty about you too.

           Margot laughs.

                                 MARGOT
                        Don't then.

           Geraldine looks at her questioningly.

           INT MARGOT'S HALLWAY - DAY

           Lou's family packs up to go. Geraldine picks up Tony, gives 
           her a kiss. Margot kisses Tony and Geraldine goodbye. As they 
           exit, Lou and Margot watch them go from the doorway and wave.

           INT MARGOT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margot and Lou crawl into bed, exhausted.

                                 LOU
                        Dear God that's a lot of work.

                                 MARGOT
                        You love it.

                        Yeah. With you I love it. It's 
                        easier to handle than it used to be 
                        that's for sure.

           Margot smiles. He holds her from behind, nuzzles into her 
           neck and closes his eyes. Margot holds his hand around her 
           waist. Clutches it just a little too urgently.

                                 LOU (CONT’D)

           She closes her eyes, holding his arm around her.

                        I know.

           She drifts off. He watches her a moment. Then turns out the 
           light.
           EXT SETH'S BASEMENT APARTMENT.

           Seth smokes a cigarette on his front stoop. He sees the light 
           go out it Margot's room. He stubs out his cigarette and goes 
           inside.

           EXT COLLEGE ST. STREETCAR STOP - DAY

           Margo waits for the streetcar in Little Italy. Cars whiz 
           past, old men sit smoking in outdoor cafes. The colour of the 
           city is vibrant and gorgeous. We see Margot from across the 
           street as a car whizzes past her. When it leaves frame we see 
           that Seth has appeared beside her, a rickshaw on his back, 
           but she hasn't noticed him yet. They stand beside each other 
           in silence for a bit. Margot feels a presence beside her and 
           slowly turns to face him. She is startled.

                                 MARGOT

           Margot hesitates. Then gets in tentatively. He begins to run 
           with her down the city streets. She smiles, closes her eyes. 
           The wind beats into her face. We see a montage of their ride 
           through the city. Seth expertly manouvers through traffic, we 
           see the colours of the city whiz by. We hear little snippets 
           of their conversation.

           Margot looks at him fondly.

                        See ya. Thanks a lot.

           He salutes her. Disappears again into the traffic.

           Margot is sitting in a cubicle, writing. Her boss, Patrick 
           comes by.

                        I'll leave you with it.

           INT MARGOT'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Margot sits at the kitchen table while Lou prepares an 
           elaborate chicken recipe. It's comfortable, easy, they 
           chatter contentedly about their separate days.

                                 LOU
                        So are you going to make the 
                        changes?

                                 MARGOT
                        Yeah. I don't know. I shouldn't get 
                        so attached to the wording anyway. 
                        It's just a stupid pamphlet. Maybe 
                        if I spin my wheels for a bit they 
                        won't even notice.

                                 LOU
                        You can't get away with that in 
                        cookbooks.

                        Why, cause people are smarter?

                        you're not making chicken.

                        getting kind of restless. It's too

                        day.

                        Yeah. Chicken is weird. Maybe you 
                        should do something else as well.

                        You're projecting. What's the big

                        you don't hate, and then you have 
                        more money to eventually take the 
                        time to write your novel.

                        "eventually?"

           Lou snuggles up behind her.

                                 LOU
                        You are an impatient person.

                                 MARGOT
                        I just want to make sure I'm still 
                        breathing in a few years.

                                 LOU
                        I'll give you CPR if you're not.

           He jumps on her. She squeals. He pretends to give her CPR.
           INT MARGOT'S TV ROOM - NIGHT

           Lou and Margot eat dinner in front of the TV. They watch the 
           news. 

                                 LOU
                        What do you think?

                        It's better.

           Margot isn't really paying attention. Lou picks up on this.

                                 LOU
                        Why?

                        Well take a sec. See if you can 
                        isolate the flavours.

           Lou kind of sighs a bit.

                                 LOU
                        No. Never mind. Can I turn back 
                        now?

                                 MARGOT
                        Sure.

           He turns it to a cooking show. The host is making chicken.

                                 LOU
                        Well. What do you know.

           Margot sighs.

           They eat in silence, the TV flicker on their faces.

           EXT SETH'S BASEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Seth is smoking on his front stoop. Notices the TV flicker 
           from the window.
           INT SETH'S BASEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Seth's apartment is littered with photographs, art projects. 
           In the foreground there are several huge black and white 
           landscapes from Iceland. Seth paints a portrait of Margot. 
           It's odd, impressionistic. Two very different faces meeting 
           in one. One side is full of hope and vitality, the other 
           deadened and bored. He plays "Close Your Eyes," by Micah P. 
           Hinson on his stereo.

           INT MARGOT'S BEDROOM - DAWN

           Margot stirs awake. She tenderly watches Lou sleep. Stretches 
           and looks at the ceiling.

           EXT MARGOT'S HOUSE - DAWN

           Margot pulls her blue robe around her as she walks out on the 
           porch. She sits on the porch chair and stares at Seth's door. 
           The light changes from dawn to morning. She sits still, full 
           of her thoughts.

           Seth comes out of his apartment. Doesn't see Margot watching 
           him. He disappears into the alley, rigs up his rickshaw, 
           makes his way down the street. Margot watches him, 
           transfixed. As he disappears out of view Lou comes out in his 
           bathrobe.

                                 LOU
                        Hey.

           He nuzzles in behind her, kisses her ear.

                            (baby voice)

                        making me for breakfast.

           Lou smiles.

                                 LOU
                        I don't even know what you're 
                        making ME for breakfast.

           She turns her head into his chest. Begins to kiss him. He 
           kisses back, casual and innocent. She begins another kiss, 
           trying to enter sexual territory. He seems unwilling to go 
           there. She pushes harder. He doesn't really respond.

                                 MARGOT
                        What?

           She turns away, looks out at the street.

                        Nothing.

           INT KITCHEN - MORNING

           Lou is making breakfast. "Secret Heart" by Feist plays on the 
           stereo. Margot makes coffee. Lou watches her for a moment. 
           Smiles.

                                 MARGOT

                        Yeah?

           She goes over to him, tackles him to the ground playfully. 
           Kisses him, hard.

                        Okay.

           Lou sighs, loud. Margot gathers herself up and leaves the 
           kitchen.

           INT MARGOT'S TV ROOM - NIGHT

           Lou and Margot watch TV while they eat their dinner in 
           silence. They both look a little numb.

           INT MARGOT'S BEDROOM - DAWN

           Margot slowly stirs awake. Watches Lou for a moment. Checks 
           the time. Let's her head fall back onto the pillow heavily. 
           Stares at the ceiling. Seems to be weighing something. 
           Suddenly she gets out of bed. Pulls on some clothes.

           EXT MARGOT'S PORCH - DAWN

           Margot opens the door in time to see Seth rigging up his 
           rickshaw. She does her best to avoid eye contact as she walks 
           up the street. Seth notices her and pulls up beside her as 
           she walks.

                        So... do you?

                                 MARGOT
                        Not now. Not yet. Well - sort of. 
                        Not what I want to write. But yes.

                                 SETH
                        So why don't you just... What's the 
                        hold up?

           He lights a cigarette. Watches her continue to pace. 
           Amused.She paces some more. Sits down across from him.

                        What's the matter with you. 
                        Generally? You seem restless. Not 
                        just now. In a kind of permanent 
                        way.

           She sits down. Takes a breath. Looks at him.

                                 MARGOT
                        I remember when Tony, my niece was 
                        a newborn.

                        And when I'd babysit sometimes 
                        she'd cry - like babies do, and I'd 
                        do everything I could to identify 
                        the source of the problem. Was she 
                        hungry? Was she tired? Did she have 
                        a rash? 9 times out of 10 I could 
                        solve the problem and figure it 
                        out. But sometimes...I don't know. 
                        Sometimes I'm walking along the 
                        street and a shaft of sunlight 
                        falls a certain way across the 
                        pavement, and I just want to cry. 
                        And a second later it's over. I 
                        decide, since I'm an adult, to not 
                        succumb to this...momentary 
                        melancholy. Sometimes I thought 
                        with Tony, that she just had a 
                        moment like this. A moment of not 
                        knowing why or how, and she let 
                        herself go into it. And there was 
                        nothing anyone could do to make it 
                        better. It was just her, and the 
                        fact of being alive, colliding.

           Seth thinks about this for a bit.

                                 SETH
                        Or maybe you just didn't figure out 
                        what it was.

           Margot nods to herself, a bit deflated.

                                 MARGOT
                        Yeah. I suppose that's possible.

           She gets up to leave.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        Well. I guess I'll run into you 
                        again.

                                 SETH
                        Seems inevitable.

           She leaves. Seth sits for a while thinking.

           10 mm lens. ECU Lou's face, his tongue hanging out - so close 
           we've lost focus. We hear him say,

                        There's something in your eye.

           CONTINUED:

           10 mm lens again. ECU Margot's face - her tongue hanging out, 
           also way too close and fisheyed.

                                 MARGOT
                        No there's something in your eye.

           From above them we now see that their faces are a millimeter 
           away from each other - they take turns talking right into the 
           others eyes, making each other laugh.

                                 LOU
                        ( putting his mouth at her eye 
                        level again.)
                        No. I'm pretty sure there's 
                        something in your eye.

                                 MARGOT
                        Make me coffee.

                                 LOU
                        Okay.

           And it's all business, the game left behind. Lou leaves the 
           bedroom to go make the coffee, Margot watches him go, 
           smiling.

           INT MARGOT'S SHOWER - MORNING

           Margot takes a shower, closing her eyes, letting the hot 
           water pour over her. We see what she doesn't - Lou sneaks up 
           and throws a cup of cold water over her. Margot yelps.

                                 MARGOT
                        AH! Lou! The shower is driving me 
                        crazy!

           Lou hightails it out of the bathroom down to the kitchen.

                        What happened?!!

           INT MARGOT'S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Margot sits with her coffee at her desk. Her desk overlooks 
           the street. She is rewriting the pamphlet on Louisbourg. We 
           see what she is writing. Something on the street catches her 
           eye. It's Seth, walking down the street. He glances towards 
           her house. She starts out of her chair, about to run outside. 
           She stops herself. Turns back toward the desk. Back towards 
           the stairs. Back towards the desk. Sits down and watches him 
           leave, wistfully. He disappears from view.

                                 MARGOT
                        Lou!

           Lou calls up from downstairs.

                                 LOU
                        I'm writing the Kiev recipe!

                        I know. Can we have your family 
                        over on Saturday?!

                                 LOU
                        I'm writing. Again?!

                                 MARGOT
                        Yeah! Again!

           INT MARGOT'S LIVINGROOM - AFTERNOON

           The livingroom is once again packed with Lou's family. There 
           are a huge myriad of chicken dishes on the dining room table. 
           Margot passes around tea and coffee.

                                 GERALDINE

                                 MARGOT
                        I like this. I like having you 
                        over.

           Lou's mother HARRIETT gives Margot a squeeze.

                                 HARRIETT
                        You'll make a fine matriarch when 
                        I'm gone love. Lou I love the Kiev.

           She takes a big bite out of the piece of chicken on her 
           plate.

                                 MARGOT
                        Me too. Let's go.

           Margot swings her onto her hip and they go upstairs.

           Margot and Tony look at all the family photos on the wall.

                        remembering that one.

           She gives Tony a big kiss on her chubby cheek.

           EXT MARGOT'S PORCH - AFTERNOON

           Lou is having a smoke on the porch. Margot comes out to join 
           him, checking first to make sure that Seth isn't around. She 
           comes up behind him and kisses his neck.

                                 MARGOT
                        I'm glad we did this.

           He squeezes her arms which are around his waist.

                        Maybe it means I love you more now.

           Margot is unsettled by this. Does the baby voice.

           Lou kisses the top of her head paternally.

           EXT MARGOT'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Margot leaves the house in her gym clothes. She checks to 
           make sure Seth isn't there, walks briskly up the street. A 
           few moments later Seth appears, watches her go. Follows in 
           the same direction.

           INT YMCA GYMNASIUM - AFTERNOON

           Margot takes part in an absurdly embarrassing "Muscleworks" 
           class in the gym. Around the top of the gym there is a 
           running track where joggers run around overhead. An 
           overzealous Jamaican woman leads the class as they make asses 
           of themselves. Twirling hoolahoops, doing sad little aerobic 
           dance routines. Margot is quite self conscious - but thank 
           god no one is watching - until of course she looks up and 
           sees Seth, in his street clothes, walking the length of the 
           jogging track overhead, watching her. He looks down at her 
           almost analytically, pondering her idiocy. She looks up - 
           humiliated beyond belief and sputters a laugh. He just shakes 
           his head. She continues on with the class, the instructor 
           getting more and more energetic and demanding. She can't help 
           stealing glances up to him though as he passes her overhead 
           going around and around her overhead, gaining speed, he 
           begins doing an impression of an overzealous jogger. From 
           Margot's POV, We pan around as he circles us.  She begins to 
           laugh crazily, getting looks from the other participants in 
           the class. At some point she actually becomes hysterical and 
           makes her way, in gales of laughter, out of the class.

           CONTINUED:

           He watches her go. Stays there, and waits for her to come 
           back, watching the gym from the track. She appears behind 
           him, up on the track screaming and laughing.

                                 MARGOT
                        Asshole!!! 

           She runs at him. He gives chase and they run around the track 
           together, her chasing him, both laughing their heads off. The 
           Muscleworks class watches in astonishment, hoolahoops dropped 
           around their ankles.

           EXT STREET - AFTERNOON

           Margot walks ahead of Seth. She's still bright red, laughing.

                        You're misinterpreting. I was 
                        admiring your form.

                                 MARGOT
                        My form. You were admiring my form.

                                 SETH
                        Yes. Particularly with the 
                        hoolahoop. It was awe inspiring.

           She whacks him with her back.

                                 MARGOT
                        I fucking hate you more than anyone

                        thouroughly as well.

           They look at each other, smiling. It lingers.

           They sit facing each other - untouched martinis in front of 
           them.

                        I just kissed the top of your head, 
                        ever so gently.

           She looks up, meets his gaze.

                                 MARGOT
                        You did?

                                 SETH
                        Yes. And then I kissed your 
                        eyelids. And they fluttered 
                        underneath my lips. Just a little.

                        But because you're married I didn't 
                        dare kiss them.

                        No. Instead I worked my way slowly 
                        down your neck, and I kissed every 
                        inch of it, and I lingered over 
                        your birthmark on your left 
                        shoulder.

           Margot glances at her birthmark.

                        Yes. That one. And I kissed every 
                        inch of your neck and your 
                        shoulders and I smelled you. I 
                        really inhaled and I smelled you.

                        You smelled like you do. The way 
                        you smelled on the plane. The way 
                        you smell right now. A mixture of 
                        sweetness and fuck.

                                 MARGOT
                        Hmm.

                                 SETH
                        And I kissed your breasts, ever so 
                        gently. And I licked your nipples. 
                        And I spent about an hour there, 
                        and I was gentle at first, but I 
                        found out how they worked, and you 
                        weren't all that interested in me 
                        being gentle.

                                 MARGOT

                                 SETH
                        So then I thought to myself, I need 
                        to find out how she works. How 
                        every part of her works. And I 
                        spent about a week and a half with 
                        your body, and I began to learn and 
                        know it. Every detail of it. I 
                        played with you and figured out how 
                        you worked before I entered you. 
                        Before I spread your legs and 
                        fucked you hard and loved you.

                                 MARGOT
                        Right.

                        wanted to, but I couldn't help 
                        myself, and I pulled your hair 
                        gently while I rocked inside you, 
                        and I fucked your mouth and every 
                        part of you until we were both so 
                        intensely fevered we couldn't see 
                        straight and I filled you with my 
                        cum and I told you again and again 
                        that I love you. I love you.

           They stare at each other, shocked. For a long time. And then 
           Margot begins to laugh. Very hard. And so does Seth.

                                 MARGOT

                        Okay. Well. I'm going to leave some 
                        money. And then I'm going to leave. 
                        And I'm going home to clean myself

           He lights a smoke and watches her while she pulls some money 
           out of her wallet, very fumbly, and plunks it down on the 
           table.

           Seth is silent. Slowly nods.

           She grabs her purse, dropping it on the floor. She picks it 
           up, bright red with embarrassment. He watches her go.

           INT MARGOT'S BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

           Margot bursts into the bathroom, sits on the toilet and pees. 
           She lets out a long exhale. Lou comes in. There is no 
           awkwardness about this.

                                 LOU

           Lou brushes his teeth. Margot watches him. Turns on the 
           shower. Lou comes up to her, gives her a peck on the cheek. 
           Margot flinches a bit.

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        Don't. I'm gross from the gym. I 
                        need a shower.

                        No. I think I'm going to accept the

                                 LOU
                        Okay.

           She undresses and gets into the shower. Lou leaves the room. 
           Margot lets the water pour over her face. A spurt of cold 
           water hits her. She yelps.

           Lou giggles to himself as he exits the bathroom with a cup in 
           his hand.

           INT MARGOT'S LIVINGROOM - AFTERNOON

           Lou makes a business call. Margot comes in in her bathrobe. 
           She tries to distract him. Doing absurd faces, weird little 
           dances. He smiles occasionally, but this is something she 
           does often - he's not particularly distracted by it one way 
           or another. She gets bored and leaves the room.

           INT MARGOT'S TV ROOM - NIGHT

           Margot is curled in front of the TV. Lou comes in and cuddles 
           up next to her. She buries her face in his sweater.

                                 MARGOT
                        Hmmm.

                                 LOU
                        Scooch over a bit.

           She does. They settle in cosily and watch TV.

                                 MARGOT
                        I love you.

           He distractedly pats her head, a bit paternally.

                                 LOU
                        I love you too.

                                 MARGOT
                        I should probably...I have a 
                        pamphlet on Fort York to write.

                                 LOU
                        Sounds interesting.

                                 MARGOT
                        Really?

           INT FORT YORK

           Margot goes on a tour of the Armoury of Fort York. A tour 
           guide drones on. Margot makes notes distractedly.

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        Fort York was build by the British 
                        Army and Canadian troops in the 
                        late 1700's and early 1800's to 
                        defend the settlement and the new 
                        capital of the Upper Canada region 
                        from the threat of military attack, 
                        principally from the newly 
                        independent United States. During 
                        the war of 1812, on April 27, 1813 
                        combined U.S. Army and naval forces 
                        attacked York from Lake Ontario, 
                        overrunning Fort York. As the 
                        British abandoned the fort, they 
                        set the powder magazine to blow up, 
                        killing and wounding several 
                        hundred U.S. soldiers. 

           Margot wanders off. We follow her as she makes her way out of 
           the Fort, over a green field, and into, surprisingly - city 
           traffic. She looks through the traffic confused and thinking.

           EXT MARGOT'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Margot walks past Seth's door. Stops. Turns around and 
           purposefully knocks on it. Seth answers.

                                 MARGOT
                        Why do I write pamphlets on 
                        Fortresses?

                        Yes.

           Seth starts laughing.

           Seth smiles at her. Begins to close the door.

                        Please. I'm begging you.

           As he closes the door in her face.

                        We shall see you later. I hope

                        hope there's hoolahoops.

           The door shuts. She stands there staring at it amazed at the 
           mistake she just made.

           INT YMCA LOCKER ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Geraldine, Margot and Karen all get changed into their 
           bathing suits. Margot is nervous.

                        Of course it's embarrassing. It's 
                        aquafit.

                        It shouldn't even feel like a 
                        workout until you're in your mid 
                        seventies. And none of us will be 
                        able to walk in the morning.

                                 MARGOT
                        There's glass? What glass?

           INT POOL - MORNING

           There is a large panel of glass where people entering the 
           YMCA can look directly into the aquafit class. Margot, in the 
           pool with Geraldine and Karen, stares at it with a sense of 
           forboding. And the music begins, and it's the worst music in 
           the world, and the fabulously queenie aquafit instructor 
           begins barking very enthusiastic instructions.

                                 AQUAFIT INSTRUCTOR
                        Okay people!!! Are we ready!!! 
                        We're going to rock!!! Start 
                        walking! That's right! Start 
                        walking in a circle!!!

           The class moves through the water at a snails pace, making 
           big walking motions underwater.

                                 AQUAFIT INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
                        And get your arms into it!!! Say 
                        YEAH!

                                 CLASS
                        YEAH!!!

           The older ladies giggle. Margot can't believe what's 
           happening, and the walking circle is taking her away from the 
           glass, so she keeps anxiously turning to make sure Seth isn't 
           there. The aquafit instructor gets more and more animated, 
           the motions more and more ridiculous. Margot makes a face at 
           Geraldine and Karen who shrug back at her.

                                 AQUAFIT INSTRUCTOR
                        Okay stop where you are now!!! Lean 
                        against the wall!! And KICK KICK 
                        KICK!!!

           The class wildly kick their legs, creating a shower of spray. 
           Margot can barely see now - though she is facing the glass at 
           this point. Through the spray, she makes out the unmistakable 
           figure of Seth, staring in at her, trying not to laugh and 
           not succeeding at all.

                                 AQUAFIT INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
                        And arms in circles arms in 
                        circles!!!

           Margot half heartedly does the motion, glances at Geraldine 
           and Karen who are not looking in the direction of Seth. As 
           the aquafit instructor gets more and more intense and 
           animated, Margot begins to laugh, and seeing Seth laugh, 
           becomes uncontrollable. She's beginning to attract attention, 
           as she desperately tries to continue the exercises despite 
           the shrieking laughter that keeps escaping from her. This 
           starts to make Geraldine and Karen laugh also. Geraldine 
           briefly follows Margot's gaze to see Seth there, and then 
           looks back to see Margot blushing wildly in the middle of her 
           laughter. She clocks this. By this point Margot has made a 
           scene. Karen is now laughing her head off too.

                                 AQUAFIT INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Okay honey, try to focus.

           Margot sidles up to Geraldine.

                                 MARGOT
                        Oh God. Oh God. I think I'm going 
                        to pee.

                                 MARGOT
                        Oh no.

           A cloud of purple ripples it's way around Margot indicating 
           the generous dispersal of her urine. The older ladies shake 
           their heads, a few get out of the pool. Karen and Geraldine 
           help Margot out, the three of them laughing insanely. Margot 
           looks back to catch Seth's eyes. He shakes his head 
           disapprovingly. She gives him the finger. Geraldine clocks 
           this once again.

                        Well at least we got a good workout 
                        for our stomach muscles.

                        You guys didn't have to come with 
                        me. You could have finished the 
                        class.

                        Margot - I love you. Not enough to 
                        bathe in your urine.

           They laugh. For a few moments they are silent as they go 
           about the business of female grooming. Shaving, washing, 
           exfoliating. We get a good peek around the rest of the shower 
           area where women of all shapes and sizes enter into their own 
           private world of washing themselves.

                        I sometimes wonder if there's any 
                        point to shaving my legs. I'm 
                        pretty certain James wouldn't 
                        notice either way. I sometimes 
                        wonder who I'm doing it for?

                                 GERALDINE
                        Yeah. It's kind of depressing. But 
                        sometimes I think to myself - after 
                        10 years, no man would probably 
                        take a really active interest in 
                        whether I shaved my legs or not. 
                        And at least, after all this time I 
                        still really like James. So would 
                        it be worth trading that in for 
                        something exciting with someone I 
                        might not like in 10 years? I don't 
                        know.

           Margot looks up at Geraldine. Geraldine looks right back at 
           her, knowingly. Margot looks down, feeling she's been 
           caught.An OLDER WOMAN in her 60's who is showering next to 
           them listens in.

                                 KAREN
                        Sometimes I'd just like something 
                        new though. New things are shiny.

                                 GERALDINE
                        Yeah. That's right. New things get 
                        old. Just like the old things did.

           A group of older women enter the shower area naked, and begin 
           washing and gossiping. The younger women steal glances at 
           them, at their bodies.

           EXT YMCA - MORNING

           Karen, Geraldine and Margot leave the Y and walk down the 
           street. Karen and Geraldine are heavily immersed in 
           conversation. Margot is looking around anxiously to see if 
           Seth is around.

                        Holy God though. What freaks we 
                        are. Women are freaks. Did you see 
                        that? That's what's going to happen 
                        to us?

                        kill yourself before you reach 65. 
                        Terrible things happen to women's 
                        bodies. She goes - "honestly - 
                        right now, as I'm standing here 
                        talking to you, my uterus is 
                        literally falling out of my cunt."

                                 KAREN
                        Holy God. It's amazing though isn't 
                        it? I love the Y for that. I love 
                        seeing women of all ages. What I'm 
                        going to look like.

                                 GERALDINE
                        I hate it. Scares the crap out of 
                        me. Makes me want to drink.

                                 KAREN
                        Don't say that. It's not funny.

                                 GERALDINE
                        You're telling me.

           Margot is not paying attention. She's anxiously looking to 
           see if Seth is there. When she finds that the coast is 
           definitely clear she feels oddly disappointed. She joins into 
           the conversation with Karen and Geraldine.

           EXT MARGOT'S HOUSE - MORNING

           Margot is about to enter her house. She pauses, looks back 
           towards Seth's apartment. She sees a light is on. She takes a 
           moment, trying to make herself go into her own house, but 
           unable to. She begins a slow, painful walk of shame across 
           the street, every part of her knowing better. She arrives at 
           his door and inhales. Knocks. The door opens - painfully 
           slowly. Seth appears. Tries to keep a straight face. They 
           both begin laughing so hard they're crying.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SETH
                        Thank you. Thank you. I've never 
                        seen a woman pee so early in a 
                        relationship. 

           She smacks him and he backs into the apartment.

           INT SETH'S BASEMENT APARTMENT - MORNING

           Seth stands in the middle of the livingroom, Margot has beat 
           him back into the middle of the room. Teddy Thompson's Shine 
           So Bright plays on Seth's stereo.

                                 SETH
                        Excellent. I got you into my 
                        apartment. All it took was a 
                        healthy beating. So. Tell me the 
                        history of my country. Starting 
                        with the fortresses.

                                 MARGOT
                        You are. By far. The worst person I 
                        have ever known.

           Seth looks right at her. So tenderly. As though she's just 
           told him she loves him. He sits on one end of the couch. She 
           watches him for a long beat. She sits at the far end, away 
           from him. They are silent.

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        So.

                                 SETH
                        So.

                                 MARGOT
                        There's this then.

                                 SETH
                        Absolutely. There is this. Find me 
                        a man to deny it.

           They are silent again. Margot lifts the white blanket off the 
           back of the couch and throws it over them. She stays at her 
           end of the couch and throws her feet up. So does he. They 
           stare at each other under the blanket, far apart, not 
           touching. The light is soft and gorgeous as it pours through 
           the white fabric.

                                 MARGOT
                        I made a fort.

           CONTINUED:

                                 SETH
                        So you did.

           Margot slowly, ever so slowly reaches out her fingers into 
           the space between them. He watches them, then slowly, ever so 
           slowly, reaches out his fingers to slowly meet hers in the 
           space. He doesn't quite touch them. His fingers are a 
           millimeter away from hers. She looks at him. He raises his 
           eyebrows as if to say he won't do anything more. She touches 
           the tips of his fingers. It's an explosion. They stare at 
           each other, breathing hard. They ever so tentatively explore 
           each others hands. They run their fingers along each others, 
           turn their hands over, etc. There is never the threat of it 
           going further than this. Just a thorough, almost unbearably 
           explosive exploration of each other's fingers. They are lit 
           by the sunlight filtered through the thin white blanket which 
           shrouds them. 

           Margot takes a long breath.

                                 MARGOT
                        I should go.

                                 SETH
                        Yeah.

                                 MARGOT
                        Bye.

                                 SETH
                        Bye.

           They stare at each other for ages. Finally Seth whips the 
           blanket off them. Margot, startled by the return to the real 
           light, the real room, steals her hand back quickly. She wipes 
           it on her jeans, leaves the apartment.

           INT MARGOT'S HOUSE - MORNING

           Margot enters her house, breathless. She pauses at the door.

                                 LOU (O.S.)
                        Hey! It's Cacciatore!

                        Cacciatore! Gotta make a whole 
                        lotta Cacciatore!

           Margot sighs.

           INT MARGOT'S KITCHEN - MORNING

           Lou cooks up a storm. There's a lot of vigour in him when 
           he's cooking. Margot enters the kitchen and watches him for a 
           while. Full of guilt, but also very stimulated from her 
           encounter with Seth. She comes up behind him, kisses the back 
           of his neck as he stirs.

                                 LOU
                        I put hot peppers in it this time. 
                        What do you think it'll be like 
                        with hot peppers?

           She keeps kissing him.

                                 MARGOT
                        I don't care.

           He's a bit miffed by this.

                                 LOU
                        Thanks.

           She begins kissing his arms, his biceps. He's not sure what 
           to do with this.

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Kay careful though. I'll splatter 
                        tomato sauce all over.

           Margot takes a moment. Hearing his evasive tone. She is 
           stung. Starts to walk out of the room.

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going? What?

           She turns back to face him, her face full of tears.

                                 MARGOT
                        Do you know - it takes courage to 
                        do that.

                                 LOU
                        To what?

                        be completely and utterly without

                                 LOU
                        That's ridiculous.

                                 MARGOT
                        Is it? Then why do you always prove 
                        that I was right - when I feel I'm 
                        taking a great risk - you 
                        consistently prove to me that I was 
                        right. And that it was a bigger 
                        risk than I could manage.

           He looks at her, dumbfounded.

                                 LOU
                        What. The fuck. Are you talking 
                        about. 

           They stare at each other.

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        I'm just making chicken.

           Margot cries.

                                 MARGOT
                        You're always just making chicken.

           She walks out of the room. He throws down his cooking utensil 
           and stares helplessly at the cacciatore.

           INT MARGOT'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           Margot lies on her bed staring at the ceiling. We see her in 
           profile as the light changes from day to dusk - the light 
           moving across her face. 
           EXT MARGOT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Margot goes out onto the porch. Stares at Seth's house. She 
           yells back into the house.

                                 MARGOT
                        I'm going for a swim!

           Seth appears in his doorway. Watches her walk down the 
           street. He follows her, maintaining a distance. They walk 
           through the city streets this way, she is aware of him 
           following her, he never tries to catch up.

           INT STREETCAR -NIGHT

           Margot and Seth ride in silence, Seth behind her in the 
           streetcar. It's night, and College St. is alive and well, 
           patios crowded, music drifting by. They watch the street pass 
           by them, charged by this silent game.

                                 SETH
                        I've never gone swimming this late.

                                 MARGOT
                        It's good and empty.

           INT POOL - NIGHT

           Margot goes to the end of the very empty pool area. Seth 
           appears and stays at the closer end.  The Y is empty at this 
           time of night, the pool room is a stunning royal blue in the 
           darkness. They stare at each other from opposite sides. Then 
           dive in. Underwater they swim past each other, snake around 
           each other, but never quite touch. It's magical, their eyes 
           are wide underneath the water, staring at each other, trying 
           to contain big laughter. Seth dives deep and grabs Margot's 
           ankle playfully. She panics, and quickly surfaces.

                        I have to get out.

           Margot climbs out of the pool. Seth stays in the water, 
           treading water.

                                 SETH
                        Afraid of being afraid.

           She dries herself off. Looks back at him.

                                 MARGOT
                        Sorry. It was a bad idea.

                        It was a great idea. It was a bad 
                        ending.

           She shrugs. Mad at herself. She leaves. Seth dives under the 
           water. He pushes himself off from the shallow end, and glides 
           through the water, watching the bottom fall away from him as 
           he enters the deep end.

           INT MARGOT'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Margot enters the kitchen, her hair wet. She sits down at the 
           table. The stereo is blasting Mazzy Star.  She watches the 
           many pots of chicken boiling on the stove. She puts her head 
           in her hands, looks up to see Lou outside on the back stoop 
           smoking. She watches him, sways a bit to the music, sings 
           softly to herself. Lou finally looks up and sees her. From 
           his point of view the scene is totally silent. Her lips 
           moving silently, her head swaying to an unheard tune. He 
           smiles at her. She smiles back. She goes to the glass and 
           kisses it. He opens the door, takes her in his arms. They 
           make love on the kitchen floor.

                                                     LATER:

           INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Lou turns down the burner, pours out some cacciatore onto a 
           big plate of rice. He hands it to Margot who is still on the 
           floor, naked and wrapped in a blanket.

                                 LOU
                        I'm going to cover you in chicken 
                        juices and feed you to the dogs.

                                 MARGOT
                        Gross.

           She takes a bite of the chicken.

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        It's delicious.

                                 LOU
                        You weren't gone long.

                                 MARGOT
                        I got in the water and didn't feel 
                        like swimming.

           He holds her while she eats. She looks endlessly relieved.
           EXT STREET - EVENING

           Margot is leaving the house. She walks down the street. 
           Glances casually towards Seth's apartment. To her relief, and 
           her disappointment, he isn't there. She keeps walking. As she 
           rounds the corner she sees him coming home with his rickshaw. 

                                 MARGOT

                        No need to apologize. I had a good

                        fortresses in this country. How 
                        bout you? Ever going to show anyone 
                        your work?

                                 SETH
                        No. But I've been doing it. 

                                 MARGOT
                        It's beautiful work. I don't know 
                        why you wouldn't want to show it 
                        somewhere.

                                 SETH
                        Well. My best work comes from my 
                        cowardice. So it's a bit of a catch 

                                 MARGOT
                        I um... I have to go.

           Seth looks a little hurt.

                                 SETH
                        Okay.

           This is awkward. The first time they've talked about Lou.

                                 MARGOT
                        Um. About five years now.

                        Why the quotes?

                                 SETH
                        Because the word husband is 
                        hilarious.

                                 MARGOT
                        He writes cookbooks.

                        cookbooks. Books on how to cook 
                        chicken.

           Seth is speechless.

                        Just chicken.

           Margot shrugs.

                        Just chicken.

                        You have no idea. 

           She smiles. Then feels ashamed.

                        Yeah. When it's in food form.

           Seth looks at her questioningly.

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        The house always smells good and 
                        comforting when it's cooking. But 
                        the smell of chicken garbage is 
                        pretty gross.

           A cab pulls up from the opposite direction. It stops. Lou 
           waves out the window as he pays the driver.

                                 LOU
                        Hey! Wait there. I'll get out.

           Margot looks caught. Seth does too. It's too awkward for him 
           to leave suddenly now. Lou gives Seth a friendly smile as he 
           gets out of the cab.

                                 LOU (CONT’D)

           Margot looks stunned. Lou smiles.

                                 LOU
                        Really? That would be great. Never

           Margot looks at him horrified.

                        I think we'll make it if we walk.

           Lou is already climbing in. Seth turns to her.

                        You won't. Get in. It's your 
                        anniversary.

           Margot reluctantly gets in the back with Lou. Seth begins 
           running with them down the street. Margot can't help but 
           watch his body as it pulls the weight of the rickshaw.
           EXT STREETS - EVENING

           Seth has picked up the pace. Lou grabs Margots hand, kisses 
           her cheek. Margot tries to return but it feels so strange 
           with Seth right there. Seth occasionally steals a glance back 
           at them. He begins doing tricks, jumping in the air, so the 
           whole thing tilts backwards. Margot gasps, Lou laughs. Seth 
           looks back and smiles. Margot starts to feel really nervous. 
           He is going faster and faster.

           EXT CINEMATHEQUE - EVENING

           Finally they reach the Cinematheque. He stops the rickshaw.

           Lou smiles.

           Lou laughs but clocks this harshness. Brushes it away. Puts 
           his arm around Margot.

           INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Margot and Lou are at a nice, romantic restaurant. They eat 
           in silence.

                                 MARGOT
                        So we can have a conversation.

                                 LOU
                        I don't have anything to say.

                                 MARGOT
                        Great. That's a good sign.

                                 LOU
                        I'm not just going to say something 
                        for the sake of us feeling like 
                        we're having a conversation.

                                 MARGOT
                        Why don't you ask me how I'm doing?

           CONTINUED:

                                 LOU
                        I know how you're doing. Don't I?

                                 MARGOT
                        Yeah. I guess. Don't you think it's 
                        a bit weird that we've just kind of 
                        been sitting here without talking?

                                 LOU
                        What are we going to talk about? We 
                        live together. We know everything 
                        already.

                                 MARGOT
                        Then what is the point of going out 
                        to dinner.

                                 LOU
                        To eat good food. To be somewhere 
                        nice. It's not to "catch up."

           Margot puts her head in her hands. Lou feels badly, reaches 
           out.

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Hey. I love you. It's our 
                        anniversary. I love you.

           INT MARGOT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margot and Lou make love. It is much the same as we saw at 
           the beginning of the film. Tender, but somehow awkward. They 
           are both self conscious. Not quite in the moment. They lie 
           there for a while afterwards. We hear the sound of the 
           washing machine downstairs.

                                 LOU
                        I love you.

                                 MARGOT
                        I love you too.

                                 LOU
                        I can't believe we've been married 
                        for five years.

                                 MARGOT
                        Yeah.

           She curls into him.

                                 LOU
                        Shit. I left the stock on.

           He leaves the bed. Margot watches him go sadly.

           INT STREETCAR - DAY

           Margot rides the streetcar along Queen St. with Geraldine. We 
           see it pass by outside the windows. It is vibrant, grungy, 
           trendy, we pass a huge range of people and storefronts. They 
           hold some shopping bags.

                                 GERALDINE
                        Everything going okay at home?

                                 MARGOT
                        Yeah. Why?

                                 GERALDINE
                        I don't know. Just wanted to ask 
                        that.

                                 MARGOT
                        Yeah. It's amazing.

                                 GERALDINE
                            (she raises her eyebrows)
                        Amazing seems a bit much. You've 
                        been married for years. I'll buy 
                        content. I won't buy amazing.

                                 MARGOT
                        It is though. It's... he's the 
                        sweetest guy in the world.

                                 GERALDINE
                        Of course he is. But it gets hard 
                        to separate things when you live 
                        with someone for so long. 

           Margot thinks for a bit.

                                                              (CONTINUED)

                        It's just... you know that thing 
                        that happens I guess...this 
                        incredible man that I 
                        met...Lou...who was so magical, who 
                        IS so magical...somehow his voice 
                        is now inextricably linked to the 
                        sound of the washing machine.

           Geraldine smiles.

                                 GERALDINE (CONT’D
                        It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's 
                        just life. It doesn't mean there's 
                        anything wrong with either of you. 
                        It happens in relationships. People 
                        take it so personally.

           Margot lets out a wry laugh.

                                 MARGOT
                        I don't take it personally. But 
                        yeah, sometimes I miss the way he 
                        looked at me when we first met.

                                 GERALDINE
                        How did he look at you.

                                 MARGOT
                        He just...never didn't look at me.

                                 GERALDINE
                        Yeah.

                                 MARGOT
                        I really love him though. I'm not 
                        saying...

                                 GERALDINE
                        I know what you're saying.

           They ride in silence for a bit. Margot feels as though her 
           mind is being read.

           EXT MARGOT'S HOUSE - DAWN

           Margot walks out the door to her house. Walks down the 
           street.
           EXT LAKESHORE - DAWN

           Margot walks down the boardwalk. Looking to see if she can 
           find Seth. Doesn't see him. Sits down and hugs her knees into 
           her chest. Looks at the water. In the distance, she sees a 
           guy with a rickshaw heading her way. The sun glares behind 
           his figure as he gets closer.

                                 SETH
                        Hey. Now who's the stalker.

                                 MARGOT
                        So you met my husband. 

                                 SETH
                        I did. How was your anniversary.

                                 MARGOT
                        It was okay.

                                 SETH
                        "Okay?"

                                 MARGOT
                        Yeah.

           She puts her head down.

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        He's the kindest, gentlest person 
                        in the world.

                                 SETH
                        He seemed sweet. He seems to love 
                        you very much.

                                 MARGOT
                        He does. And I love him.

           A long pause.

                                 SETH
                        Is that what you came here to tell 
                        me? That you love your husband and 
                        your anniversary was "okay." Why 
                        was it "okay?"

           Margot sighs.

                        More or less terrified of dinner 
                        than changing planes.

                                 MARGOT
                        Same. It's the same fear. I'm 
                        terrified we won't have anything to 
                        say to each other. And then because 
                        I'm so terrified there's no way to 
                        have a normal conversation. 
                        Everything just gets so incredibly 
                        silent inside me.

           She looks up at him.

                        I feel there is no greater betrayal

           Margot quickly changes direction.

                                 MARGOT
                        So you know a bit about my life

                        something about you. 

                                 SETH
                        Ask away.

                                 MARGOT
                        What was your last relationship?

                        You didn't say "one." There was

                        Yeah.

           He looks directly at her. It causes him pain to talk about

                        of a story ever since.

                                 MARGOT
                        Why?

                        No. Why did she stop talking to 
                        you?

           Seth shrugs. Smiles.

                        She just stopped talking to you

                        terribly. I wrote letter after

                        No it was... if I loved someone so

                        And then, finally you begin to get 
                        a sense of what it means, you start 
                        to feel what it means to be inside

           INT CENTRE ISLAND SCRAMBLER - DAY

           Margot and Seth get buckled into a car in the scrambler. It 
           is dark, there are strobe lights. We hear the opening, 
           deceivingly soft strains of "Video Killed the Radio Star." 
           The ride starts, deceivingly slowly. Margot and Seth stare at 
           each other from opposite sides of the car. As it speeds up, 
           Margot is whipped over to Seth's side of the car. It gets 
           extremely fast. Because of the dark and the intermittent 
           strobe lights, other people's faces are lit up just when it 
           looks like you're about to crash into their cart. Margot 
           screams with elation, puts her arms out. They laugh 
           hysterically, seeing kids faces flash by them. Another couple 
           makes out passionately, one guy rides alone, a huge grin on 
           his face. They steal glances at each other, but mostly just 
           yell with joy as the ride whips them maniacally around.

           EXT TORONTO ISLAND FERRY - SUNSET

           Seth and Margot head back to the city. We see the Toronto 
           skyline at sunset in front of them.

           Margot looks out at the skyline. Ponders this.

                        I'll say I went to the island to go

           She looks at him. Exposing, for a moment, everything.

                        This is sadlarious.

           Seth smiles. He reaches out to touch Margot's hand. She pulls 
           it away. Stands slightly apart from him. He looks out at the 
           water. Frustrated.

           EXT MARGOT'S STREET - NIGHT

           Seth and Margot walk together silently towards their homes. 
           As they reach Seth's apartment, Margot turns to him to say 
           goodbye.

           They look at each other for a while. Seth moves towards his 
           door. Margot follows him.

           Margot goes and lies down on his bed, gets under the covers.

                        I can't hurt him. I can't hurt him.

           Seth helps her to sit up.

                        I think you need to go home now 
                        Margot.

           He helps her to stand as she sobs. He sees her to the door. 
           As she crosses the street, crying, Seth watches her go. As 
           she enters her house he takes a sharp inhale. Closes his 
           door. Lies down on his bed, thinking.

           INT MARGOT'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Margot and Lou set up the house for a party. They light 
           candles, set up glasses and booze.

           They work in silence but also in a kind of tandem. As they 
           pass each other Lou kisses her forehead, or squeezes her 
           hand.

           INT MARGOT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A large, boistrous crowd is packed into Margot's house. 
           Geraldine makes a speech from the stairs.

                                 GERALDINE
                        So the great thing about not 
                        getting totally absorbed into the 
                        AA community is that you still have 
                        friends and family who will throw 
                        you a huge drunken party to 
                        celebrate your sobriety. It's 
                        totally inappropriate and it's 
                        really awesome. So I raise my glass 
                        of Perrier to all of you who can 
                        still get shitfaced without guilt, 
                        to my amazing brother and sister-in-
                        law for getting me more than just a 
                        piece of sober cake, and to my 
                        amazing kids who aren't here 
                        tonight, for putting up with the 
                        worst years. And to my amazing 
                        husband for trusting me enough to 
                        be around you drunken idiots.

           Drunken hooting and hollering from the crowd. Lots of 
           clapping. The music turns on and people go back to dancing. 
           Margot dances with a bunch of friends to Leonard Cohen's 
           "Closing Time." 

           EXT MARGOT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lou greets a new guest on the porch. He notices Seth, sitting 
           on his stoop across the street having a smoke and watching 
           the party.

                                 LOU

           Seth shrugs, reluctantly comes over to the house.

           INT MARGOT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Margot dances with a partner to Closing Time. There are a lot 
           of good dancers here. "I swear it happened just like this, a 
           sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss..." Seth watches her as she 
           disappears and reappears between people. For a moment her 
           hands become free as she twirls around. Seth walks towards 
           her and grabs her hands and spins her around. She is 
           extremely thrown. She gives him a look of "what are you doing 
           here?" He shrugs. They continue to dance, becoming less self 
           conscious as the song goes on. Transfixed by each others 
           movements, the physical proximity, and the ease with which 
           they move together. "But the boss don't like these dizzy 
           heights, we're busted in the blinding lights." Margot looks 
           around self consciously. No one seems to have noticed.

                                 MARGOT
                        Um. Can I get you a drink?

                        took to get him over here.

           He holds up a tray of chicken skewers.

           guest.

           EXT BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Margot roots around in a bin for a beer for Seth. He lights 
           up a cigarette.

                        I've been thinking about that 
                        airport fear of yours. Of being in 
                        between things. I think I kind of 
                        hate it too. I know it's kind of 
                        the nature of being alive. But I'd 
                        like to avoid it wherever possible. 
                        I don't think I want to be in 
                        between things.

           He looks at her directly. Margot has a moment of fear at what 
           he might be saying. She brushes it off.

                                 MARGOT

           Margot dances with Lou and her friends. Seth makes his way 
           through the crowd to the door. She glances at him, and then 
           turns away. Lou calls out to Seth.

           Seth goes out the door. Margot tries to ignore his exit but 
           throws a glance to the door which Lou catches. And then 
           decides to ignore.

           A postcard comes through the mailslot.

           Margot wakes up groggily as she hears the sound. Gets up, 
           stretches. Goes downstairs.

           INT MARGOT'S FRONT HALLWAY - DAWN

           Margot picks up the postcard. It is a postcard of the 
           entrance to the Cabot Trail. She stares at it. Turns it over. 
           It reads "September 2nd. 2029. 3pm."

           She looks out the window. She is shocked by what she sees.

                        Where?

                                 SETH
                        Somewhere where I don't have to 
                        stare at your house of matrimony. 
                        Not too far. Far enough. And I'll 
                        do my best not to wait too long.

           He takes one last look at her. Tears roll down both of their 
           faces. Then he gets in the van and drives away, leaving her 
           staring after him. Staggered. We see Lou in the bedroom 
           window, watching her.

           INT MARGOT'S BEDROOM - DAWN

           Lou is in bed staring at the ceiling. He closes his eyes as 
           he hears her climb the stairs. He pretends to be asleep. 
           Margot climbs into bed next to him. She puts the postcard on 
           her bulletin board. She watches Lou for a while. Strokes his 
           face tenderly. She stares at the postcard on the wall, She 
           closes her eyes. In pain.

           INT CAPE BRETON BED AND BREAKFAST - AFTERNOON

           We hear the song "Don't Forget About Me," by Micah P. Hinson, 
           play over the next several scenes. 

           We see the back of the head of a woman in her forties. 
           Streaks of grey in her hair. She sits at a mirror, brushing 
           her hair carefully. We don't see her face. She slowly rises, 
           and we follow her, always staying behind her. We know this is 
           Margot, but she walks as though she is older, and years have 
           passed. We follow her out of the small hotel, down a long 
           road. We begin to recognize the image from the post card. We 
           see her figure grow smaller as we stay in position and she 
           keeps walking towards the entrance to the Cabot Trail. We see 
           the shape of a man, who we recognize as Seth, moving slowly 
           towards her. We watch them slowly cross the stunningly 
           beautiful landscape towards each other. As they approach each 
           other, their pace slows. When they reach each other they take 
           a long moment, taking the other in. It's been a long time. 
           They slowly move towards each other and their lips meet.

           INT MARGOT'S BEDROOM

           Margot's eyes snap open. She breathes hard, shaken by the 
           dream. Stares at the postcard. We continue to hear "Don't 
           Forget About Me" over:

                                                     CUT TO:

           INT MARGOT'S BEDROOM

           Margot has clearly just told Lou about Seth. They sit bolt 
           upright on opposite sides of the bed. Looking off into space. 
           In their own worlds. Lou looking shocked, trying to puzzle it 
           through, Margot looking guilt ridden and sad.

           INT MARGOT'S KITCHEN

           Lou sits at the table. The music swells over his face, as he 
           watches Margot, off camera. His face registers shock, 
           sadness, anger. We see his response to her telling him she is 
           in love with Seth in a series of jump cuts. In these scenes 
           we should get the sense that hours are passing, the light 
           changing. We are hearing snippets from an endless 
           conversation. An emotional disaster. We only hear the 
           occasional word or sentence.

           Lou looks at us stunned, shakes his head.

           TIME CUT:

           Lou looks down, fuming with anger.

                        I'm supposed to be doing here.

           TIME CUT:

           Lou stares at Margot's face. Realizing something.

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        I'd just be humiliating myself. If 
                        I begged you to stay. It's true 
                        isn't it?

           He can see by the look on her face that she has made up her 
           mind.

           Offscreen, she gives him a quizzical look which he responds 
           to.

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Just... Do me a favour.

           INT MARGOT'S BATHROOM

           Margot takes a shower, crying, the water running down her 
           face. A spurt of cold water hits her in the face. She 
           squeals. The shower curtain opens slowly. Lou stands there 
           facing her, glass of water in his hand. She looks at him, 
           looks at the glass. Puts it together.

                                 MARGOT
                        You...

                                 LOU

                        Every day.

           She lets out an incredulous laugh. Looks at him 
           questioningly.

                                 MARGOT
                        There's no...

                                 LOU
                        There's no problem with the water. 
                        Nothing to get fixed. I 
                        thought...when we're eighty I'll 
                        tell Margot I've been doing this 
                        for her whole life and it'll make 
                        her laugh. It was kind of a long 
                        term joke.

           Margot laughs. And cries a bit. Lou leaves the room.

           INT MARGOT'S KITCHEN

           LATER:

           CONTINUED:

           Margot sits at the kitchen table. She watches Lou through the 
           glass outside, smoking. It is an exact replica of the scene 
           we saw earlier where she bobbed her head to the music, except 
           the music is sadder and all domestic bliss is gone now. He 
           doesn't look at her. She watches him smoke. He turns towards 
           the glass. She can read his lips as he says.

                                 LOU
                        Go.

           Margot shakes her head vigourously. Crying. Lou nods. 
           Suddenly full of resolve and strength. But also with a 
           surprising gentleness he says:

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Go on. Go.

           Margot rises, trembling from the table. She walks slowly out 
           of the house, past the family photos on the wall, out the 
           door.

           EXT MARGOT'S HOUSE

           Margot walk speeds gradually up and she begins to run. And 
           run. And run. The music gets louder and louder, more frantic.

           EXT CITY STREETS

           Margot runs down College St, through Trinity Bellwoods Park, 
           down to the lakeshore.

           EXT LAKESHORE

           There is no one here. Margot sits down. Catches her breath. 
           Stares at the horizon. She hears a voice behind her.

                                 SETH
                        There you are.

           INT MARGOT AND SETH'S LOFT

           We hear the song "Take This Waltz," by Leonard Cohen over the 
           following

           MONTAGE -  In one, long tracking shot, we see Seth and Margot 
           making love over the course of a year together.

           Margot and Seth stand in the middle of a large, unfurnished 
           space. The walls are white, it is untouched. It is washed in 
           sunlight. In a wide shot, we slowly dolly in a circle around 
           them. They begin to kiss, to slowly undress each other, we 
           wipe past a wall. Another day. 

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           As we see them again, we see them making love on the floor. 
           We continue our circle around the room. Another day. They lie 
           naked in each others arms, staring at each other, there are 
           now a few pieces of furniture in the room. We wipe past the 
           wall again and when we find them again, (another day,) there 
           is another woman with them. The three of them kiss, and take 
           off each others clothes. We wipe past the wall again.

           Another day. Two feet pop up into frame. They are each 
           grabbed by two male hands that begin massaging them. We swing 
           up to the ceiling now to look down. We see that Seth and 
           Margot are now having a threesome with another guy. They both 
           stroke and kiss Margot and we continue our circle around 
           them. Our view obscured once again by a wall. We see them 
           again as we wipe past the wall. Another day. When we see them 
           this time, they are alone again, making love, this time 
           without the same urgency. The apartment is now fully 
           furnished. We slowly circle them. We wipe past the wall 
           again. When we find them again, they are sleeping, Margot 
           with her head on Seth's chest. Another wall, another day, 
           another reveal: Margot and Seth watch TV. Margot snuggles 
           into him.

                                 MARGOT
                            (in baby voice)
                        I wuv you.

           Seth looks at her quizzically. Smiles.

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                            (baby voice)
                        I said I wuv you.

           Seth brushes it off by leaning in for a grown up kiss.

           INT MARGOT AND SETH'S LOFT

           Seth brushes his teeth. Margot comes into the bathroom, sits 
           on the toilet and pees. Seth begins flossing, leaves the 
           room. Margot watches him go.

           EXT DOWNTOWN STREET

           Margot walks along the street with a grocery bag. She stops 
           suddenly. Aware of something. She sniffs the air. Something 
           familiar. She smiles faintly. Turns towards the direction it 
           is coming from. She sees that she is outside a cookbook 
           store. Inside the window there is a book launch, with many 
           different chicken dishes being served to the guests.

           She sees Lou in their midst. Smiling, talking to people. She 
           watches him through the window, and the throng of people 
           inside. She waits there for a few moments, wistful. Then 
           decides to keep walking.

           EXT TORONTO ISLAND FERRY

           Margot rides the ferry alone to the island. She looks pensive 
           as she looks out at the water. A man beside her notices her.

                                 MAN
                        What are you thinking about?

           Margot looks at him. Smiles to herself.

                                 MARGOT
                        Nothing. Really.

           He feels rebuffed and walks away. Margot breathes deeply.

           INT SCRAMBLER

           Margot is whipped around by herself in the darkness. We hear 
           once again "Video Killed The Radio Star." She closes her 
           eyes, sad.

           INT MARGOT AND SETH'S LOFT

           The place has now been lived in for some time. Margot is 
           lying on the couch, looking up at the skylight. She is 
           chewing on a candy. She takes the pink candy wrapper and 
           holds it up to the skylight. Watches the light glow through 
           the wrapper. Seth is painting. 

                                 MARGOT
                        We haven't been to the Cabot Trail 
                        yet.

           Seth looks up. Smiles.

                                 SETH
                        No we haven't.

           A pause.

                                 MARGOT
                        Do you want me to organize it?

           Margot lets out a barely perceptible sigh. She gets up and 
           starts looking for flights on the computer.

           EXT CABOT TRAIL

           We see the same image as we did in Margot's dream. The same 
           picture postcard image of the entrance to the Cabot Trail. 
           Except this time Seth and Margot walk together down the path. 
           They reach the edge of the cliff, take in their surroundings. 
           Then kiss.

                                 SETH
                        I'm glad we didn't wait.

           Margot smiles. There is a silence. They aren't sure what to 
           do next. They look around a little longer. Then head back 
           down the path.

           INT MARGOT AND SETH'S LOFT

           Margot lies on the couch staring at nothing. Seth busies 
           himself, getting ready to go to work. He comes over and 
           kisses her lightly on the head.

                                 SETH
                        See you tonight.

           Margot speaks to him in the baby voice.

                                 MARGOT
                        I'm going to make dinner!

                        I can pick something up.

           He strokes her head a bit paternally.

                                 MARGOT
                        No. Just get me garlic. I want 
                        garlic for dinner!

                                 SETH
                        Sure little baby.

           He packs up the last of his things.

                        See ya later.

           She looks a bit deflated by his leaving, his dropping of the 
           game.

           The door closes. Margot stares out at nothing. The phone 
           rings. Margot picks it up.

                                 MARGOT
                        Hello?

           She listens, jolted.

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                            (softly)
                        Yeah of course. I'll be right 
                        there.

           EXT MARGOT'S HOUSE

           Lou and most of his family wait on the porch. Geraldine is 
           noticeably absent. His mother holds Tony on her hip. There 
           are two cops with them. There is a silence about them. Margot 
           approaches the house.

                                 HARRIETT
                        Hi there Margot.

                                 MARGOT
                        Hi.

           Lou comes out, gives her an awkward hug. He talks to her 
           quietly out of earshot of his family.

                                 LOU
                        She just kind of disappeared. Tony 
                        got left alone for hours. James 
                        called the cops. I guess he's had 
                        it.

                                 MARGOT
                        Jesus. What's everyone doing out 
                        here?

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LOU
                        She called James on her cell and 
                        said she was coming over here. 

                                 MARGOT
                        What are they going to do? Arrest 
                        her?

                                 LOU
                        James has had it. Doesn't want to 
                        pick her up off the floor anymore.

           They walk up to the porch. Margot awkwardly says hello and 
           embraces the family. Lou's mother is quite reserved with her. 
           Tony reaches out for Margot and snuggles into her neck.

           Geraldine's car careens to a screeching halt in front of the 
           house. She stumbles out of the car, drunk. The cops calmly 
           approach her. She looks at them.

                                 GERALDINE
                        Oh god. Oh well. Just a sec. Just a 
                        sec.

           She opens the back door.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Ma'am. Miss O'Connor. We'd like you 
                        to come with us.

                                 GERALDINE
                        Yeah. Just a sec. Just a sec.

           She pulls a box out of the back seat. It's full of baby 
           chicks.

                                 GERALDINE (CONT’D)
                        Here. James. I got chicks.

           She hands them to her husband.

                                 GERALDINE (CONT’D)
                        They need. They need milk. I think.

                                 JAMES
                        What?

                                 GERALDINE
                        I got them at the pet store. 
                        They're for Tony. Hey Margot. You 
                        back? I missed you.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           She looks at the cops.

                                 GERALDINE (CONT’D)
                        Can I have a second? I want to talk 
                        to this lady.

           The cop nods. She pulls Margot to the corner of the house out 
           of earshot of the others.

                                 GERALDINE (CONT’D)
                        So how ya been?

                                 MARGOT
                        Okay. What happened Geraldine?

                                 GERALDINE
                        I'm an alcoholic you moron. Nothing 
                        happened to me. This is my natural 
                        state. Wait a second. What happened 
                        to ME? Really? Why wouldn't I ask 
                        that of you? You just disappeared 
                        Margot. You just went away. What a 
                        fuckin obvious move. You think that 
                        everything can be worked out if you 
                        just make the right move? Must be 
                        thrilling. I think it's thrilling. 
                        I don't agree.

           Margot looks away.

                                 GERALDINE (CONT’D)
                        Don't give me that. I'M the 
                        embarrassment? Me? We're both just 
                        doing the same fucking thing you 
                        know.

           Margot tries to remain calm. Speaks slowly.

                                 MARGOT
                        I don't understand what you're 
                        trying to say.

                                 GERALDINE
                        I do it with alcohol. You did it 
                        with love. You're an even bigger 
                        idiot than I am. I think you really 
                        fucked up Margot. In the big 
                        picture. Life has a gap in it 
                        Margot. It just does. You don't go 
                        fucking crazy and try to fill it 
                        like some lunatic. Speaking of 
                        fucking up...

           She holds out her wrists to the officers.

                                 GERALDINE (CONT’D)
                        Okay let's go. That was kind of 
                        fun. Harder to talk honestly with 
                        people when sober as I'm sure you 
                        can imagine officer. Hey you guys 
                        fuck any prostitutes lately? Smash 
                        any vegan faces in? Ha. See? So 
                        fun.

           The police lead her away towards their cruiser. The cop pulls 
           his car keys out.

                                 GERALDINE (CONT’D)
                        Whew! Can I drive?

           The cops help her into the cruiser. Margot watches with tears 
           in her eyes. Harriett takes Tony inside.

                                 TONY
                        Are those baby chicks for me 
                        Grandma?

           The family disperses. Lou sits, his head in his hands on the 
           steps. Margot comes and sits beside him.

                                 LOU
                        Sorry. I thought it might help if 
                        you were here. She's missed you.

                                 MARGOT
                        It was fine. I should have called. 
                        I just didn't know what to say...

                                 LOU
                        Yeah. Hard to know I guess.

                                 MARGOT
                        How are you?

                                 LOU
                        Okay actually. Shockingly. Finally 
                        okay.

                                 MARGOT
                        Your book did really well.

                                 LOU
                        Yeah. Who knew so many people like 
                        chicken so much?

                                 LOU
                        Yeah. We'll see how "Chicken: The 
                        Sequel" does.

                                 MARGOT
                        You're writing a sequel?

                                 LOU
                        No. Don't be ridiculous.

           Margot smiles. Lou smiles back at her.

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        It's on guinea hens and pheasants.

                                 MARGOT
                        Seriously?

                                 LOU
                        Of course not you moron.

           Margot laughs.

                                 MARGOT
                        The house looks good.

                                 LOU
                        You mean from the outside? Yeah. I 
                        guess.

           Margot looks up at it nostalgically. It hurts.

                                 MARGOT
                        How is your life?

           Lou breathes in. Takes stock of the question.

                                 LOU
                        You mean am I seeing anyone?

                                 MARGOT
                        No. Yeah.

                                 LOU
                        Sometimes. Not really.

           Margot looks away.

           A pause.

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        Do you think...

           Lou looks at her. A little shocked by the look in her eye.

                                 LOU
                        No I don't. I don't think so.

                                 MARGOT
                        But...you're not really seeing 
                        anyone you said.

           Lou sighs.

                                 LOU
                        Some things you do in life. They 
                        stick. 

           Margot nods to herself. Can't look at him.

                                 MARGOT
                        I'm so... If I had changed my mind, 
                        like a week, or a month later. Do 
                        you think you would have...

           Lou looks at her. A bit upset. Of course he would have.

                                 LOU
                        What do you think?

                                 MARGOT
                        I'm really...I'm so...

                                 LOU
                        No reason to be. You can't be sorry 
                        for doing what you had to do.

                                 MARGOT
                        But I-

                                 LOU
                        Margot, we didn't have this 
                        conversation then. I'm really not 
                        interested in having it now.

                        Lou.

           She gets up to go.

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        Will you call me if I can do 
                        anything? For Tony or Gerry? Or 
                        you?

                                 LOU
                        Yeah. I think we'll be okay.

           They're not sure how to say goodbye. Lou makes a move to hug 
           her. It's friendly and not at all intimate. It breaks 
           Margot's heart.

                                 MARGOT
                        Bye.

                        Bye Margot.

           She walks away down the street, humbled and ashamed. He calls 
           out to her.

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           Margot turns around.

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        I just got a melon baller and I'd 
                        like to gouge your eyeballs out 
                        with it.

           He smiles tenderly. She smiles back, tears in her eyes.

                                 MARGOT
                        Yeah. Me too. 

           She takes a deep, sharp inhale.

                        Bye.

           She keeps walking, tears streaming down her face.
           INT MARGOT AND SETH'S LOFT

           Margot stirs muffin batter. The kitchen is very similar in 
           design to the one in her house with Lou.

           Nouvelle Vague's Loungey version of "This is Not A Love Song" 
           plays on the stereo. It’s sweltering hot. She wipes sweat 
           from her forehead. She pours the batter into a muffin tin, 
           very carefully. She puts the tin in the oven. We realize 
           we've seen this scene before.

           Margot switches on the oven light. She bends down to look at 
           the muffins rising. The shadow of a man passes her. He walks 
           to the window at the back of the kitchen and stands there. As 
           before, we see only his outline, out of focus in the back of 
           the frame. But this time we realize that the man is, in fact, 
           Seth. Not Lou. Margot sits down on the floor beside the oven. 
           Leans her head, and rests it on the oven door, lit by the 
           warm glow of the light. The muffins rise. She watches them, 
           the expression on her face a curious mixture of peace,  
           yearning, contentment,and longing. In the background, Seth 
           puts his hand on the window. Shafts of light fall on the 
           floor.

           The End.
