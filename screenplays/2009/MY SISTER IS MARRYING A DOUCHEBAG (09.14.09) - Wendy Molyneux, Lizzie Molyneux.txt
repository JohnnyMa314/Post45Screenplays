           The camera pans down the row in the WOMEN’S WING.

           These are some tough looking ladies behind bars. 

           A big tattooed biker chick who’s crying like a baby.

           A skinny tweaker with a tattoo of a leprechaun stabbing a 
           unicorn. And then:  

           RUBY DUNCAN-COLFAX, early 30s, pretty, in a light pink 
           BRIDESMAID’S DRESS. Her hair is wild. Her face is smudged. 
           She’s missing a shoe. She stares into space.

           Her cellmates are three women who are obviously hookers.

           TAMMI, 21, pretty, in a plastic dress, pokes Ruby in the arm.

                                 TAMMI
                        Hey, Carrie. 

                                 RUBY
                        It’s Ruby.

                                 TAMMI
                        I just meant you looked like that 
                        movie Carrie. Where that crazy 
                        bitch ruins the prom by dumping all 
                        that blood on everyone. 

                                 RUBY
                        Wow. Thanks?

                                 TAMMI
                        You’re welcome. Look, we’re trying 
                        to settle a bet. What are you in 
                        for? I think you stabbed somebody. 
                        Carla thinks you’re a pillhead. And 
                        Cathy thinks you’re a rapist.

                                 RUBY
                        What? No! How would I even do that?

                                 TAMMI
                        Don’t mind Cathy, she’s got an 
                        overactive imagination.

           ANGLE ON CATHY, 40, overweight. She smiles sheepishly.

                                 CATHY
                        That is my cross to bear.
                                 TAMMI
                        So, which is it?

                                 RUBY
                        All right. You guys ready for this? 
                        Because I’m about to blow your 
                        mind. I’m in for transporting a 
                        fugitive across state lines, 
                        attempting to interfere with a 
                        bounty hunter...Oh! And larceny.

                                 TAMMI
                        Whoa.

                                 RUBY
                        Yeah, turns out if you do a runner 
                        out of the Vera Wang bridesmaid 
                        boutique while still wearing the 
                        dress, they consider it stolen.

                                 CARLA
                             (southern accent)
                        How’d you get mixed up in all that 
                        shit?

                                 CATHY
                        Did an international superspy 
                        seduce you and get you to commit 
                        terrible crimes on his behalf?

                                 RUBY
                        Good guess, Cathy. Very solid. But 
                        the truth is I was trying to stop 
                        my sister’s wedding. 

                                 CATHY
                        Because she was going to marry a  
                        cannibalistic serial killer! And--

                                 TAMMI
                        No, I bet you were just jealous 
                        that your sister found a man. I see 
                        that all the time. Two hos just 
                        scratching each other’s eyes out 
                        over a John.

                                 RUBY
                        Actually, I’m already married -- 
                        happily married --and I’d love the 
                        same thing for my sister Isabel. 
           INT. LAX AIRPORT -- SIX MONTHS EARLIER

           Ruby and her husband JOSHUA, 30s, cute and laid back, wait in 
           international arrivals. Ruby looks put-together, friendly and 
           sweet as she talks to to an OLD LADY IN A WHEELCHAIR.

                                 RUBY
                        I’d just like to see her settle 
                        down, you know? I mean she’s always 
                        traveling. It’s time to put down 
                        roots. Find a partner. I’d like to 
                        see her marry someone who gets her.

           The old lady nods, like she’s totally on the same page.

                                 OLD LADY IN A WHEELCHAIR
                        When my husband was away in the 
                        Great War, I had intercourse with a 
                        negro.

           The old lady’s nurse, CARLOTTA shakes her head.

                                 CARLOTTA
                        All right, Mrs. M., that’s enough.

           Ruby sighs and Josh laughs as the woman gets wheeled away.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Any other strangers you need to 
                        talk to? 

                                 RUBY
                        I’m just excited that my favorite 
                        person’s coming home.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Still not me, huh?

                                 RUBY
                        Oh, c’mon. You know the order.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Right. First your sister, then me.

                                 RUBY
                        Actually, the current order is: my 
                        sister, Michelle Obama, the new 
                        Captain Kirk, then you.

                                 JOSHUA
                             (pumps his fist)
                        Yes. I’m still in the top five.
                                 RUBY
                        Wait, almost forgot. Let’s get 
                        these babies on.

           Ruby pulls two GIANT FOAM NUMBER ONE FINGERS out of a bag.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Explain these again.

                                 RUBY
                        Our parents used to wear these to 
                        embarrass us when they’d pick us up 
                        from the airport.

                                 JOSHUA
                        I know I’m embarrassed.

                                 RUBY
                             (looking up)
                        Hey!

           Appearing at the top of the escalator is ISABEL DUNCAN, a 
           younger, pretty but slightly frumpier version of Ruby in beat-
           up jeans and a knapsack. She’s sporting a pixie haircut, 
           facial piercing and a sleeve tatoo.

           Isabel runs across the receiving area and launches herself 
           onto Ruby and Joshua.

                                 ISABEL
                        Hi! Oh my God, where did you find 
                        the foam fingers?

                                 RUBY
                        At the foam finger depot. 

                                 JOSHUA
                             (grimacing at a smell)
                        Did you fly home in a trash can?

                                 ISABEL
                        Yeah, there wasn’t a lot of 
                        showering in Nepal. Drink it in. 
                        It’s a fine musk.

           Isabel thrusts her armpit into Ruby’s face. Ruby laughs.

           As they walk out of the airport, ANGLE ON Ruby, content.
           INT. DON CUCO’S RESTAURANT-- LATER

           Crammed into a booth are Ruby, Joshua and Isabel, EVAN, 30s, 
           buff, and his boyfriend BRAD, 30s, a lanky black guy.

                                 JOSHUA
                             (raising a glass)
                        To the return of the prodigal 
                        sister, who taught the entire 
                        nation of Nepal to speak English. 

                                 ISABEL
                        And smoked a shitload of hash.

                                 EVAN
                        She went away a young girl, and 
                        came back a lady.

                                 ISABEL
                        As a non-profit worker it’s my duty 
                        to patronize local farmers.

                                 JOSHUA
                        My prediction was that you’d meet 
                        some crazy Maoist leader and never 
                        return.

                                 RUBY
                        Ooh! Speaking of which, Iz, I know 
                        you hate it when I set you up, but 
                        I swear, I met your future husband.

                                 ISABEL
                        Um...

                                 RUBY
                        His name is Hale. I met him at a 
                        zoo fund-raiser. He works for NPR, 
                        he plays soprano sax in a rap-folk 
                        fusion band, and he’s really 
                        interesting.

                                 JOSHUA
                        He sounds like a douche.

           Ruby elbows Joshua hard in the ribs.

                                 RUBY
                        You’re going out in two weeks.

                                 ISABEL
                        No I’m not. 
                                 RUBY
                        Sorry, can’t take no for an answer.

                                 ISABEL
                        You’re gonna have to. Because I met 
                        someone.

                                 RUBY
                        What?

                                 ISABEL
                        In Nepal. I met someone. He’s 
                        American, but I met him over there.

                                 EVAN
                        Uh oh.

                                 ISABEL
                        What?

                                 EVAN
                        Isabel, I love you, but you have 
                        got to admit that you have crazy 
                        taste in guys.

                                 ISABEL
                        I do not!

                                 BRAD
                        Isabel, you dated a street 
                        performer.

                                 RUBY
                        He was always painted gold. That 
                        was nice.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Did you date him before or after 
                        the meth addict?

                                 ISABEL
                        Correction. Rufus was not a meth 
                        addict, he was a meth dealer.

                                 EVAN
                        And there was turned-out-to-be-only-
                        seventeen-years-old guy.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Uh huh, I wrote him a college 
                        recommendation.
                                 ISABEL
                        Suck it, all of you. Suck a huge 
                        dick.

           The group laughs.

                                 ISABEL
                        Seriously, this one is different. 

                                 RUBY
                        Oh really? As in normal?

                                 ISABEL
                        Yes.

                                 RUBY
                        He has a house or other suitable 
                        domicile?

                                 ISABEL
                        Yes.

                                 RUBY
                        Job?

                                 ISABEL
                        Yes.

                                 BRAD
                        Is it the guy from Twilight?

                                 ISABEL
                        No.

                                 RUBY
                        Okay. Hmm. This could be good.

                                 ISABEL
                        It is good.

                                 RUBY
                        So when do we meet this Prince 
                        Charming?

                                 ISABEL
                        How about Friday?

           Ruby smiles as we PRE-LAP the voiceover.

                                 RUBY (V.O.)
                        The truth is, I was really happy to 
                        hear that Iz had met someone.
           INT. JAIL CELL

           Ruby continues talking to the prostitutes.

                                 RUBY
                        I thought that if she was dating 
                        someone she’d stay put for a while. 
                        Her non-profit work had been taking 
                        her further and further away:

           INSERT A QUICK SERIES OF FLASHBACKS:

           1. Isabel puts on a sombrero.

                                 ISABEL
                        Guess who’s going to go dig a well 
                        in Oaxaca for six weeks?

           2. Isabel dons an Anorak.

                                 ISABEL
                        Those Iditarod dogs aren’t going to 
                        massage their own tired legs.

           3. Isabel is totally invisible inside a Burkha.

                                 ISABEL
                        But I’ll be in the SAFE part of 
                        Iraq.

           BACK TO PRESENT

                                 RUBY
                        I figured a new relationship was 
                        just the thing to keep Iz close to 
                        home, so I was ready to give this 
                        guy a warm welcome...

           INT. A.O.C. RESTAURANT -- FRIDAY NIGHT

           An elegant small restaurant where fashionable L.A. types wait 
           at the wine bar. Ruby checks a text her phone.

                                 RUBY
                        Isabel’s running late. She said she 
                        fell asleep by accident while she 
                        was watching For The Love of Ray J. 

                                 JOSHUA
                        Man, I hope that guy finds love.
                                 RUBY
                        She said Cal will be here soon. Oh!

           Coming through the entrance is a tall blonde Ken-doll looking 
           guy. Ruby starts to greet him, but he gives her a weird look, 
           walks up to another girl and kisses her.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Wow, you liked him!

                                 RUBY
                        I thought that was Cal.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Really? Personally, I’m developing 
                        a bit of a crush on Larry The Cable 
                        Guy over there.

           Ruby giggles as Joshua points to a guy in shorts and a fanny 
           pack at the end of the bar. He’s wearing a cotton T-shirt 
           with a picture of a squirrel holding a royal flush that says 
           “The Nuts”. He has a cell phone and a pager clipped in 
           separate holders on his belt. 

           He hails the bartender.

                                 FANNY PACK GUY
                        Excuse me. I ordered the Zinfandel.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Yes, sir. That’s our Millglen 1998.

                                 FANNY PACK GUY
                        Oh, I meant to get the white one. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        White Zinfandel?

                                 FANNY PACK GUY
                        Yeah, that’s my favorite. Lemme 
                        switch.

                                 BARTENDER
                        I’m really sorry, but we don’t have 
                        white Zinfandel.

                                 FANNY PACK GUY
                        Ooookay. That’s weird. Um, I’ll 
                        have a Mike’s Hard Lemonade. And 
                        can I get some chips and salsa?
                                 BARTENDER
                             (staying polite)
                        Sir, may I offer you a Belgian ale?

                                 RUBY
                        We should send him over some 
                        Jalapeno poppers.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Is he wearing shorts?

                                 RUBY
                        I think you’d call those “jams.”

           ISABEL ENTERS behind them.

                                 ISABEL
                        Hey freaks. Is our table ready?

                                 RUBY
                        No Cal yet, but you should check 
                        out this piece of work down here...

           Ruby looks alarmed as the Fanny Pack Guy stands up and moves 
           toward them...

                                 JOSHUA
                             (warning)
                        Ruby.

           ...and puts his arm around Isabel.

                                 ISABEL
                        Hi!

           She gives Fanny Pack Guy, a.k.a. CAL PERDEW, 30s, a BIG KISS.

                                 RUBY
                        What? No. I mean, hello!

           Cal pulls Ruby into a big hug.

                                 CAL
                        So this is the big sis, huh? The 
                        good looks run in the family!

                                 RUBY
                        Thanks. This is Joshua.

                        It’s NIIIICE to meet you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CAL (cont'd)
                        I come all the way from Kazakhstan 
                        to have sex with your sister!

           He laughs at his own joke.

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        That’s from Borat. Have you seen 
                        it?

                                 JOSHUA
                        Yes. Several years ago, actually.

                                 CAL
                        I love that movie. Favorite movies. 
                        Top five. Go.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Me? Um. Let me think.

           He extends his fist for Josh to “pound it.”

           INT. A.O.C. -- LATER

           Cal examines the menu.

                                 RUBY
                        So what if we do the goat cheese, 
                        the bruss--

                                 CAL
                        Ugh, no. No goat cheese. You might 
                        as well pick up a a goat and just 
                        shove it in your mouth. These 
                        chairs are so tiny. Excuse me...

           He stops a passing waitress.

                                 CAL
                        Do you have any bigger chairs? 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Sorry?

                                 CAL
                        BIGGER CHAIRS.
                                 RUBY
                        You know what? Cal? Why don’t we 
                        just switch out and you can sit 
                        over here on the banquette?

           Ruby squeezes out to let Cal in so he’s next to Joshua.

                                 CAL
                        Hey look, we’re gay!

                        You guys look great together.

           Ruby and Joshua look down at their menus.

                                 CAL
                        I wish I knew how to quit you, 
                        Joshua.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Yes. Brokeback Mountain. Good.

                                 CAL
                        So, what’s the deal with this menu?

                                 RUBY
                        It’s French small plates.

                                 TAMMI (V.O.)
                        Wait, what?

           INT. JAIL

           Tammi stares at Ruby.

                                 TAMMI
                        What’s a French small plate?

                                 RUBY
                        It’s like tapas.

                                 TAMMI
                        What?

                                 RUBY
                        Like small portions of different 
                        dishes and then you have to share.

                                 TAMMI
                        So the portion is small AND you 
                        have to share?
                                 RUBY
                        Yes.

                                 TAMMI
                        That sounds awful.

                                 RUBY
                        The food is really good, I swear.

                                 TAMMI
                        Sounds terrible.

                                 RUBY
                        Do you want me to keep going?

                                 TAMMI
                        Yeah, but I don’t want any French 
                        small plates.

                                 RUBY
                        Fine, so we ordered dinner. Cal 
                        didn’t like anything--

           INT. A.O.C. -- LATER

           We see Cal reject a series of dishes:

           1. Cal refuses a plate from Ruby.

                                 CAL
                        Pork cheeks? No thanks, I don’t put 
                        parts of other thing’s mouths in my 
                        mouth. That’s like weird mouth 
                        cannibalism.

           2. Cal hands a plate of ceviche to a waitress.

                                 CAL
                        This “ceviche” is not cooked, my 
                        friend.

           3. The waitress hands Cal a plate of plain pasta with butter.

                                 CAL
                        Thanks you so much, Miss. I really 
                        appreciate it.

                                 WAITRESS
                        It’s no problem. The chefs make 
                        that for kids all the time.
                                 IZZY
                        I want a bite of that.

                                 CAL
                        Oh, and can we get some ketchup for 
                        the bread?

           Ruby cringes, but smiles.

           INT. A.O.C. -- LATER

           The waiter sets a pot of dessert fondue in the center of the 
           table, and gives everyone a weird tiny fork to eat it with.

                                 CAL
                        What’s that?

                                 JOSHUA
                        It’s a dessert cheese fondue.

           Ruby spears a piece of apple with a tiny fork and dips it in.

           Cal tries to follow suit, but his apple falls in. He tries 
           again, and pulls it out with a long string of cheese 
           attached, which he doesn’t notice, so it trails all the way 
           from his mouth back to the fondue pot.

           Joshua tries to break it off with his fork

                                 JOSHUA
                        You’ve got a...

           It breaks, so now Cal has a long cheese beard.

                                 CAL
                             (to Iz, pirate accent)
                        Look at me! I’m Cheesebeard! Aargh.

                                 ISABEL
                             (also talking pirate)
                        Cheese beard! The most feared 
                        pirate on the high seas.

                                 CAL
                        I be the only pirate permitted on 
                        the Atkins diet!

           They get louder, and a snotty looking woman at the next table 
           rolls her eyes at them.
                                 ISABEL
                        I be helpin’ ye prevent 
                        osteoporosis due to calcium loss.

           They laugh harder and louder as Ruby and Joshua eat quietly. 
           Cal laughs as he wipes most of the cheese beard off.

                                 RUBY
                        So, Cal, Izzy says you’re new in 
                        town?

                                 CAL
                             (keeping Borat going)
                        Yes, I come from Kazakhstan on 
                        donkey over ocean. Niiiice!
                             (dropping voice)
                        Naw, I’m just playing. Yep, 
                        transferred here from the 
                        Indianapolis branch about a year 
                        ago when I got promoted. I lived in 
                        Indy my whole life up until then. 

                                 RUBY
                        Indianapolis branch of...?

                                 CAL
                        T.G.I. Friday’s.

           Ruby flinches a little.

                                 RUBY
                        So, that’s your full-time gig? 
                        Managing a restaurant?

                                 CAL
                        Ruby, to answer your question, I am 
                        a co-manager and...

           Cal reaches in his pocket and pulls out a card.

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        ...from now on when you eat at any 
                        T.G.I.Friday’s, just present this 
                        friends and family card for fifteen 
                        percent off your entire bill 
                        excluding alcohol.

                                 RUBY
                        Wow, I will never...

           Joshua PINCHES her.
                                 JOSHUA
                        She will never forget this kind 
                        gesture, Cal. For as long as she 
                        lives.

                                 RUBY
                        And what were you doing in Nepal?

                                 CAL
                        Christian missionary work. The Lord 
                        called me to Nepal just so I could 
                        meet this hot little number.

           He reaches and squeezes Isabel’s boob, making a HONKING 
           SOUND.

           Isabel laughs, then honks her other boob.

                                 ISABEL
                        That one felt left out.

           She and Cal high-five. Ruby, smiley facade now gone, looks 
           horrified.

                                 RUBY
                        So, you’re really religious, huh?

                                 CAL 
                        Ruby, I’d say I’m pretty live and 
                        let live, but if you’d ever like to 
                        hear my personal witness about our 
                        Lord, I’d be happy to share. You 
                        guys down with Jesus?

                                 JOSHUA
                        I’m Jewish, so...

                                 CAL
                        Sweet. I love Woody Allen. 
                        Manhattan Murder Mystery is a 
                        classic.

                                 IZZY
                        Cal’s writing a book, too.

                                 JOSHUA
                             (bemused)
                        A writer, huh? What do you write?

                                 CAL
                        Well I try not to classify myself 
                        as any one type of writer.

                                 CAL (cont'd)
                        But for the sake of explanation you 
                        could call me a novelist. Just 
                        finished my first book. It’s in the 
                        can, as they say.

                                 RUBY
                             (in disbelief)
                        Wow. What’s your book about?

                                 CAL
                        It’s a 9/11 conspiracy theory 
                        centered around a biracial love 
                        triangle in the most classified 
                        sector of the CIA. It’s pretty bad-
                        ass.

                                 RUBY
                        I can’t wait to read it.

                                 CAL
                        That would be awesome, Rube, I 
                        could use some feedback. I’ll get 
                        your email and send it off later. 
                        Do you have high speed internets? 
                        Because it is a pretty big file. 

                                 RUBY
                        Yes, I think our internets are 
                        pretty fast.

                                 CAL
                        Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiice. 

           EXT. 3RD STREET, CURB -- CONTINUOUS

           The couples linger, saying their good-byes.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Well, Cal, it was really nice 
                        meeting you.

                                 CAL
                        What? Don’t you guys want to keep 
                        going? My T.G.I. Friday’s in Brea 
                        stays open till two. We could get 
                        mudslides.

                                 RUBY
                        Oh, we can’t, we have to...go home.
                                 CAL
                        All right, next time? Hon, I’ll see 
                        you back at your place. I’m parked 
                        around the corner. High fives!

           He makes a move as if to high five them, then does the 
           “psych” move where he pretends to comb his hair.

                                 CAL
                        Not!

           He laughs, spins on his heel, and vanishes. A beat.

                                 ISABEL
                        So, you like him? 

                                 RUBY
                             (plastered on smile)
                        Yeah.

                                 ISABEL
                        Be honest.

                                 JOSHUA
                             (forced)
                        He’s fun.

                                 ISABEL
                        You sound like you’re using your 
                        lying voice.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Why does she know about my lying 
                        voice?

                                 ISABEL
                        We’re girls. We talk. Look, I know 
                        he’s a little bit much at first. 
                        But once you get to know him, he’s 
                        such a great guy. I promise.

                                 RUBY
                             (taking Iz’s hand)
                        Listen, Iz. It’s not about us. If 
                        you’re happy, we’re happy.

           Suddenly, Cal appears from around the corner on his SEGWAY, 
           wearing a tiny helmet and a reflector vest.

                                 CAL
                             (calling out)
                        Lates, tools. I’m kidding. You guys 
                        are the best. K.I.T. Cal, out!
           INT. JOSHUA AND RUBY’S CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

                                 JOSHUA
                        She can’t be serious.

                                 RUBY
                        Well, I loved him.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Ha ha. I’m surprised you aren’t 
                        more freaked out.

                                 RUBY
                        Oh, don’t get me wrong. I mean, 
                        he’s the worst. The pager? I mean, 
                        a pager, seriously? What, he gets 
                        pages from the past? Hi, this is 
                        Biggie Smalls, calling from the 
                        past when I was still alive.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Wow, take it easy on Biggie Smalls.  

                                 RUBY
                        But to answer your question: I’m 
                        not panicking because we’re talking 
                        about Isabel here. And if Isabel’s 
                        romantic history teaches us 
                        anything it is that...

                          JOSHUA
                                                          RUBY
           We will never see that guy 
           again.
                                              We will never see that guy 
                                              again.

           INT. VILLAGE IDIOT PUB -- A FEW DAYS LATER

           Joshua and Ruby sit miserably jammed into a booth in the 
           upscale pub with Cal and Isabel.

                                 CAL
                        No, seriously...

           Cal points at a black guy sitting at the counter.

                                 CAL
                        That guy does look like Obama.
           EXT. PAN-PACIFIC PARK -- A FEW DAYS LATER

           Joshua, Ruby and Izzy set up a picnic as Cal comes up on his 
           Segway, wearing overalls with one strap unhooked and a Four 
           Non-Blondes T-shirt. He’s carrying a huge deli shrimp tray.

                                 CAL
                        What has two thumbs and a pound of 
                        shrimp?

           PAUSE. Cal tries to gesture towards himself.

                                 CAL
                        This guy!

           INT. JOSHUA AND RUBY’S HOUSE

           Cal freaks Isabel as he sings “YOU OUGHTTA KNOW” at the top 
           of his lungs on Rock Band.

           INT. HOUSE OF BILLIARDS - NIGHT

           Ruby, Brad and Evan shoot pool in a pool/arcade bar. When 
           they sit on the bench near their pool table, they are near a 
           bank of pinball machines, one of which is a “HOUSE OF HORROR” 
           machine.

                                 BRAD
                        Where’s Izzy tonight?

                                 RUBY
                        I didn’t invite her.

                                 BRAD
                        What? Why? 

                                 RUBY
                        I just feel so awkward around her 
                        ever since she started dating Cal. 
                        I hate faking that I like him. 

                                 BRAD
                        I feel the same way about Evan’s 
                        dad.

                                 EVAN
                        Me too.

                                 RUBY
                        I don’t know what to do about it.
                                 BRAD
                        Here’s a radical idea: Why don’t 
                        you just talk to her about it?

                                 RUBY
                        Are you insane? 

                                 BRAD
                        Look I know it might suck, but 
                        sooner or later you’ve got to bite 
                        the bullet. You don’t want to end 
                        up with a Michael Hershman 
                        situation.

                                 RUBY
                        Who’s Michael Hershman?

                                 EVAN
                        Brad’s sister’s husband.

                                 RUBY
                        What? Brad doesn’t have a sister.

                                 EVAN
                        Yes he does.

                                 RUBY
                        Why don’t I know about her?

                                 EVAN
                        Because they don’t speak.

                                 BRAD
                        And we used to be close. We used to 
                        be best friends. But that was 
                        before Michael Hershman. 

                                 EVAN
                             (ominously)
                        Michael Hershman.

           The “House of Horror” machine lets out a HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM.

                                 RUBY
                        Stop it you guys. You’re scaring 
                        me.

                                 BRAD
                        Good. You should be scared. My 
                        family is small like yours. Just 
                        me, my mom and my sister. But once 
                        you start adding on, things can get 
                        really weird, really fast.
                                 EVAN
                             (whispering to Brad)
                        It’s going to be even worse for 
                        Ruby, you know since her parents 
                        are D, E, A, D.

                                 RUBY
                        Evan, I know how to spell.

                                 BRAD
                        Death makes Evan nervous.

                                 EVAN
                        I’m still not over M, I, C, H, A, 
                        E, L, J, A, C, K, S, O, N.

                                 RUBY
                        Right. So tell me what happened? 

                                 BRAD
                        It was eight years ago when my 
                        sister met Michael Hershman. My mom 
                        and I didn’t really like him, but 
                        we figured we’d go along to get 
                        along. Big mistake. 

                                 RUBY
                        What was so bad about him?

                                 BRAD
                        It was hard to put your finger on. 
                        Inappropriate comments. Weird 
                        habits. 

                                 EVAN
                        He had a hot pink pager. 

                                 BRAD
                        He ate ketchup on bread.

                                 RUBY
                        Oh no.

                                 EVAN
                        Over time, the annoyance with 
                        Michael Hershman turned to hate. 
                        Brad’s mom broke first. She didn’t 
                        invite his sister and Michael to 
                        Thanksgiving. Claimed she’d be on a 
                        cruise. But really, she was home.

           Ruby GASPS.
                                 BRAD
                        My sister found out, then blamed 
                        me. Then I got mad at my mom for 
                        not defending me. Then we all just 
                        stopped talking. That was five 
                        years ago. 

                                 BRAD
                        And now, on Thanksgiving, we eat 
                        take-out from a Chinese restaurant 
                        and wait for the phone to ring.

                                 RUBY
                             (petrified whisper)
                        No.

                                 EVAN
                        Yes.

           Brad and Evan both sit near the “House of Horror” pinball 
           machine. It casts out an ominous blue light, and the sound of 
           a GHOST SHRIEKING.

                                 BRAD
                        Talk to her.

           EXT. FARMER’S MARKET

           Ruby and Isabel shop for produce in the outdoor market.

                                 RUBY
                        So, you and Cal are seeing a lot of 
                        each other.

                                 ISABEL
                        Yeah, he’s pretty much seen all of 
                        me. Zing!

                                 RUBY
                        Good one.

                                 ISABEL
                        You don’t like him.

                                 RUBY
                        What, no! I just...don’t get it.

                                 ISABEL
                        He’s really nice to me. And he 
                        doesn’t judge me for not finishing 
                        college. He thinks I’m the 
                        prettiest person in the world. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ISABEL (cont'd)
                        He’s not a snob. I don’t feel weird 
                        about being myself around him. I 
                        mean, our first official date was a 
                        disaster. I thought he was kind of 
                        a weirdo.

                                 RUBY
                        Right! I mean, what changed?

                                 ISABEL
                        I dunno, each date got better and 
                        better. He likes to do things, and 
                        meet people, and explore new 
                        places. And - and I can’t emphasize 
                        the importance of this enough - he 
                        is not a dick to me. 

                                 RUBY
                             (not convinced)
                        That’s good. I just, you know, we 
                        just have such a great group of 
                        friends. I just want you to be 
                        comfortable with the guy you 
                        choose.

                                 ISABEL
                        I guess I’m surprised that you’re 
                        so concerned about me having a real 
                        relationship. You’re the one who 
                        always wants me to get married.

                                 RUBY
                        Right.
                             (alarmed)
                        Wait? Are you and Cal getting 
                        married?

                                 ISABEL
                        No.
                             (a beat)
                        Why, you’d be mad?

                                 RUBY
                             (lying)
                        No, I just want you to think about 
                        it before you rush into anything. 
                        I’d hate for you to make a mistake.

                                 ISABEL
                             (avoiding)
                        Okay, sure. 

           They walk in silence, then Isabel picks up a huge cucumber 
           from a stand. It looks exactly like a penis.
                                 ISABEL
                        I’m not going to make a joke about 
                        this.

                                 RUBY
                        I appreciate your self-control.

           INT. JOSHUA AND RUBY’S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- THE NEXT WEEKEND

           Joshua, Brad and Evan stand in the kitchen pouring drinks.

           They all secretly peer in on Ruby and HALE STRUNK, 30s, in a 
           “Red” shirt and corduroy blazer. In a word: pretentious.

                                 BRAD
                             (re: Hale)
                        So who is this guy?

                                 JOSHUA
                        Some guy Ruby wanted to set Iz up 
                        with. 

                                 BRAD
                        Wait, isn’t Izzy seriously dating 
                        that Cal guy?

                                 JOSHUA
                        Yup.

                                 EVAN
                        And aren’t they coming over 
                        tonight?

                                 JOSHUA
                        Yup.

                                 BRAD
                        But Ruby still invited this guy to 
                        seduce Izzy away from Cal?

                                 JOSHUA
                        Bingo.

                                 EVAN
                        Wonderful. Dinner and a show!

           INT. LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Joshua, Brad, Evan and Hale awkwardly sip drinks.
                                 JOSHUA
                        So, I hear you play the saxophone?

                                 HALE
                             (chuckling)
                        Soprano sax. They say it’s the most 
                        difficult sax to learn, but I 
                        mastered it in a few weeks. It’s 
                        all about breathing and meditation. 
                        Here, try breathing with me.

           Hale places his hand on Joshua’s diaphragm. Brad gives Joshua 
           a thumbs up.

                                 HALE
                        Don’t be shy, Joshua.
                             (Hale puts his hand on 
                              Joshua’s cheeks)
                        Fill those cheeks up. Imagine 
                        yourself as a big beautiful 
                        balloon.

           EXT. RUBY AND JOSHUA’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Ruby opens the door to Isabel and Cal.

                                 CAL
                        For the lady.

           Cal presents a bottle of ALIZE with a flourish.

                                 RUBY
                        Wow, thanks. Alize. Awesome. 
                        Isabel, thanks for dressing up.

           Isabel is in a sweatshirt and cut-offs.

                                 ISABEL
                        Yeah, sorry, my barrel with straps 
                        was at the cleaners. 
                             (beat)
                        Why is the table set all fancy?

           The guys enter the dining room with Hale. 

                                 RUBY
                        Isabel, This is Hale. Hale works 
                        for NPR. 

           Isabel shoots Ruby a look.
                                 RUBY
                        Oh and everyone, this is Cal.

           Cal gives the group a wave.

                                 CAL
                        Cal Perdew, Esquire. Just kidding, 
                        I’m not really a lawyer. But I play 
                        one on TV! Just kidding.

                                 ISABEL
                        Ruby, can I talk to you in the 
                        kitchen for a second?

           They exit as Cal extends a hand to Brad.

                                 CAL
                        Hey, I’m Cal.

                                 BRAD
                        I’m Brad. This is my boyfriend 
                        Evan.

                             (after a beat)
                        Oh, I get it. And this is my 
                        boyfriend Joshua. We love frenching 
                        each other. Don’t you, guys?

           He pretends to kiss Joshua.

                                 CAL
                        Vhat’s up, I’m Bruno!

           Joshua goes BRIGHT RED.

                                 EVAN
                        Hey, Cal, I realize you are 
                        kidding, but we really are gay.

                                 CAL
                        Me too. I wish I could quit you.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Cal...

           A moment. Cal registers the truth.

                                 CAL
                        Oh shit. Hey, guys, no offense. I 
                        love gay guys.

                                 CAL (cont'd)
                        I cried like a baby in Brokeback 
                        Mountain when he was hugging that 
                        other guy’s jean jacket. I didn’t 
                        know you were really gay.

                                 EVAN
                        Yep.

                                 CAL
                        You don’t look gay. 

                                 BRAD
                        What do gay guys look like?

                                 CAL
                        You know, like George Clooney, but 
                        maybe in white pants? And maybe 
                        like they have a mustache? 

                                 EVAN
                             (laughing)
                        That is one version.

                                 BRAD
                        Hey, why don’t we all go have some 
                        more of that dip?

                                 CAL
                        No way. I hate dip! Not! Get it? 
                        Because who hates dip?

           Izzy glares at Ruby in the kitchen.

                                 ISABEL
                        What the fuck, Ruby? Why’s that guy 
                        you wanted to set me up with here?

                                 RUBY
                             (caught)
                        What? No! That was a different guy 
                        from NPR. That was...Dale.

                                 ISABEL
                        Ruby.

                                 RUBY
                        Okay, you’re right. But I can’t do 
                        anything about it now, so let’s 
                        just make the best of it, okay?
                                 ISABEL
                        Promise you won’t do that thing 
                        where you try to pimp me out by 
                        telling the guy things you think 
                        will make him like me?

                                 RUBY
                        Promise.

           Everyone is sitting at the table.

                                 RUBY
                        Hale, did you know that Isabel just 
                        got back from teaching English to 
                        kids in Nepal? And she loves NPR, 
                        fusion bands, and corduroy jackets? 
                        She can also suppress the gag 
                        reflex. You know what I mean?

                                 JOSHUA
                        Ruby. Kitchen. Now.

                                 CAL
                        Wow, y’all love going to the 
                        kitchen with each other.

           INT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

           Joshua loud-whispers to Ruby.

                                 JOSHUA
                        You have got to chill out.

                                 RUBY
                        I know. I know!

                                 JOSHUA
                        Look, there is really no reason to 
                        push Isabel together with Hale. He 
                        makes Cal look like James Bond.

                                 RUBY
                             (deep breath)
                        Yeah. It really would be a lateral 
                        move, huh?
                                 JOSHUA
                        Okay, tiger, let’s get in there and 
                        act normal. Try to stay on neutral 
                        subjects.

                                 RUBY
                        Okay. Okay. Got it.

           INT. DINING ROOM

           Ruby sits back down and smiles. A long awkward silence.

                                 RUBY
                        So, did you guys hear about that 
                        baby that fell down a well? 

                                 ISABEL
                        Baby Jessica? 

                                 BRAD
                        I think that happened like thirty 
                        years ago.

                                 RUBY
                        Huh. Time flies.

                                 HALE
                        So, Cal, how do you know all of 
                        these lovely individuals?

                                 CAL
                        Well, Iz and I met out in Nepal. On 
                        an elephant ride through the 
                        jungles of Chitwan. Izzy fell off 
                        the elephant. 

                                 ISABEL
                        I was trying to take a picture of 
                        my own foot.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Sure, why not?

                                 CAL
                        And there was this huge-ass rhino 
                        right near by. 

                                 ISABEL
                        And the guide like freaked out and 
                        started to take the elephant the 
                        other way. Like, oops, lost another 
                        one. Let’s head back to camp.
                                 CAL
                        And there I am, like, what the 
                        heck? And so I slide right down off 
                        the elephant, pick her up and carry 
                        her out of the jungle like some 
                        kind of crazy caveman.

                                 ISABEL
                        And he saves me, and I’m so 
                        grateful, I just kiss him.

                                 EVAN
                        That is so romantic.

           Cal and Isabel lean into a KISS.

           Ruby SLAPS the table startling everyone.

                                 RUBY
                        Well that explains it!

                                 ISABEL
                        What?

                                 RUBY
                        They say that in dangerous 
                        situations, our brains can confuse 
                        adrenaline for romantic attraction.

                                 ISABEL
                             (raising her voice)
                        Ruby, I’m not confused.

                                 RUBY
                        Maybe we should talk about 
                        it...in...the...kitchen.

                                 ISABEL
                        No. No more kitchen. Cal and I 
                        aren’t confused, we’re engaged.

                                 RUBY
                        Come again?

                                 BRAD
                        Holy shit, this is a good show.

                                 EVAN
                        I am recommending this show to 
                        friends.
                                 ISABEL
                        We were going to wait until you got 
                        to know Cal a little better to tell 
                        you, but we are engaged. 

                                 CAL
                        Isn’t it great? We are gonna be 
                        family. Like the Mansons.

           Cal GRINS around the table as Ruby and Joshua look shocked 
           and Brad and Evan suppress laughter.

           Hale, lost in his own world, picks up a bite of chicken.

                                 HALE
                        You know, Ruby, they make some 
                        great processed wheat meat 
                        substitutes these days.

                                 RUBY
                        Shut up, Hale.

           INT. LOS ANGELES ZOO -- MORNING

           Ruby, in her Zoo Guide work uniform, and SITARAAM, 22, AN 
           AFFABLE YOUNG INDIAN GUY WITH A SLIGHT ACCENT AND A HUGE 
           “TRAINEE” NAME TAG, sit on a bench near a GIANT TORTOISE in 
           an indoor pen with a school group looking on.

           Ruby, super-distracted, stares hollow-eyed into space.

                                 SITARAAM
                        Now, who knows, do tortoises lay 
                        eggs like chickens or have babies 
                        like people?

           A teacher raises his hand.

                                 SITARAAM
                        Um, let’s maybe hear from one of 
                        the kids. Okay, you! What do you 
                        think, eggs or babies?

           Angle on a little BLONDE KID.

                                 BLONDE KID
                        Purple.

                                 SITARAAM
                        Great. That is a color. Um, but, a 
                        tortoise digs a burrow to lay her 
                        eggs. And after they hatch,
                                 (MORE)
                                 SITARAAM (cont'd)
                        Then they live with their mother 
                        for only two months before striking 
                        out on their own. Can you imagine 
                        if you had to live on your own at 
                        only two months old? How old are 
                        humans when they usually move out 
                        of the house?

           Angle on the Blonde Kid again.

                                 BLONDE KID
                        Grapes.

                                 RUBY
                             (clearly not listening)
                        That’s right. Now, let’s form a 
                        single line to touch the turtle.

           The kids line up and Ruby and Sitaraam let them touch the 
           turtle. Ruby goes back to being lost in thought.

                                 SITARAAM
                        Ruby, what’s going on? You’re 
                        totally distracted.

                                 RUBY
                        Oh, it’s nothing. Just...my 
                        sister’s getting married to this 
                        weirdo.

                                 SITARAAM
                        Oh no, does he have a crazy 
                        mustache? If there’s one thing I’ve 
                        learned from Bollywood films, it’s 
                        never let your sister marry the 
                        dude with the bushy mustache. He is 
                        a villain.

                                 RUBY
                        I don’t think Cal’s a villain. I 
                        just don’t think he’s right for Iz.

                                 SITARAAM
                        When a girl finds a love marriage, 
                        it’s hard for the family, but you 
                        should try to accept him. 

                                 RUBY
                        Yeah, everyone keeps saying that. 
                        But it’s different for them. I 
                        mean, my sister’s my best friend. I 
                        am going to have to live with this 
                        guy the rest of my life. It’s like 
                        I’m marrying him.

                        he is never going to change his

           INT. JAIL CELL

           Ruby turns to look at Sandra, who is crying.

                                 RUBY
                        Are you ok?

                        I just love weddings so much. I’ve 
                        been married eighteen times.

                                 TAMMI
                        So. I’m confused, why is this guy a 
                        bad dude?

                                 RUBY
                        Well, it’s hard to explain.

                                 TAMMI
                        Is he a criminal?

                        He one of those guys who acts all 
                        regular and then only wants to do 
                        it in the butt?

                        Good, cause God only gives you one 
                        butthole, and if you waste it, it’s 
                        on you.

                        I’ll take your word for it. Anyway, 
                        the point is he was just wrong for 
                        Izzy. And there was nothing I could 
                        do about it. And then, he did 
                        something really terrible: he moved 
                        in with her.

           EXT. CAL AND ISABEL’S APARTMENT

           Cal throws open the door to Josh and Ruby. He’s wearing an

                        It’s my man cave.

           The room is a horrible cross between a hunting room and a 
           fraternity house. 

           There is a neon beer sign on the wall. The couch is plaid. 
           There’s a “Spuds MacKenzie” poster above the fireplace.

                        never seen one of these babies.

           boogies along as it bursts into “Take Me To The River.”

           Joshua reaches out to grab one and Cal SLAPS his hand.

                        soundstage...

                                 ISABEL
                        Honey, hold on. Let me add 
                        something.

           A pause and then Isabel BELCHES. Cal high fives her. 

           INT. JOSHUA AND RUBY’S HOUSE -- LATER

           Ruby and Joshua relax in bed. Joshua reads a book quietly 
           while Ruby flips through a home-decor magazine. Joshua looks 
           up from his book and stares at her. Something is wrong. She’s 
           way too carefree and relaxed.

           She feels his stare and smirks.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Okay, spill it.

                                 RUBY
                        Spill what?

                                 JOSHUA
                        We jut spent the entire evening 
                        with Cal and Iz and you haven’t 
                        complained once since we left. 

                                 RUBY
                        Maybe I just decided to accept the 
                        things which I cannot change.
                                 JOSHUA
                        Not buying it. Talk.

                                 RUBY
                        You’re wasting your time detective.

           He starts to tickle her. She bursts into laughter.

                                 RUBY
                        Stop! You’re killing me! I’ll talk.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Okay, I let you live.

                                 RUBY
                        I just decided that I am going to 
                        stop worrying about this 
                        relationship because I finally 
                        figured out what it is.

                                 JOSHUA
                        How do you mean?

                                 RUBY
                        It just occurred to me tonight that 
                        Cal is Isabel’s way of rebelling.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Rebelling?

                                 RUBY
                        Yeah, all these years I’ve tried to 
                        set her up with these guys I liked. 
                        So she picks a guy I won’t like, 
                        knowing I’ll disapprove, and the 
                        more I object, the more it’s going 
                        to make her want to follow through.

                                 JOSHUA
                        So now you’re going to drive them 
                        apart...

                                 RUBY
                        By not driving them apart. I’m 
                        going to be Cal’s number one 
                        cheerleader. It’s perfect.

                                 JOSHUA
                        I don’t see how this could possibly 
                        backfire.

                                 RUBY
                        Me neither.
           We see a quick MONTAGE of Ruby being nice to Cal.

           1. Ruby clicks on a WWE pay-per-view event on their TiVo. 
           Cal, in a wrestling get-up, hollers at the screen. Ruby 
           hollers too. 

           Joshua rolls his eyes as Brad and Evan exchange a look.

           2. Ruby holds the ferret. It gnaws her hand.

                                 RUBY
                             (in serious pain)
                        That tickles.

           3. At the Olive Garden along with Cal, Iz, Brad and Evan. 
           Ruby shoves a huge breadstick in her mouth.

                                 RUBY
                        It’s hard to say who loves this 
                        place more, me or Cal.

           Brad gives her a look.

           Finally...

           INT. MINI-COOPER CONVERTIBLE

           Cal is in the backseat next to Isabel. He’s blindfolded.

                                 CAL
                        Guys, where are you taking me?

                                 RUBY
                        We’re almost there.

                                 CAL
                             (loud whisper)
                        Isabel, just whisper it to me.

                                 ISABEL
                        Okay, one, you are terrible at 
                        whispering, and two, I don’t even 
                        know. This was all Ruby’s idea.

           They pull up to the GREEK THEATER, swarming with parrot-heads 
           for...

                                 CAL
                        Wait. I’d know that smell anywhere. 
                        You are kidding me! 
           He rips off his blindfold. To see the huge marquee announcing 
           the JIMMY BUFFET CONCERT.

                                 CAL
                        Jimmy fucking Buffet. Ruby, you 
                        complete me! You had me at hello!

                                 RUBY
                        Happy birthday!

           He picks her up and swings her around.

                                 CAL
                        Isabel, wedding’s off. I’m marrying 
                        Ruby.

           Isabel shoots Ruby a weird look, which Ruby answers with a 
           PLACID SMILE.

           INT. RUBY’S HOUSE

           Isabel and Ruby sit with a bunch of wedding magazines.

                                 ISABEL
                        It’s really great of you to 
                        volunteer to coordinate our 
                        wedding, Ruby.

                                 RUBY
                             (laying it on thick)
                        Are you kidding? I am so excited 
                        about this. And listen, I hope this 
                        won’t offend you, but Joshua and I 
                        want to pay for the wedding.

                                 ISABEL
                        What? No. That’s crazy.

                                 RUBY
                        If dad was alive he’d want to do 
                        it, and Joshua is doing well at 
                        work now, so...let us. Okay? 

           Hesitant, Isabel gives Ruby a weird look.

                                 ISABEL
                        You really don’t have to do this.

                                 RUBY
                        Don’t be silly. 
                                 ISABEL
                        Ooooookay.

                                 RUBY
                        What?

                                 ISABEL
                        Well, one minute you seem like you 
                        hate Cal, then the next you want to 
                        pay for us to have some fairy-
                        princess wedding on Unicorn Island. 
                        I’m having trouble keeping up.

                                 RUBY
                        I think I was just freaked out that 
                        my sister was getting married. 

           She reaches out and grabs Isabel’s hands. A beat.

                                 RUBY
                        But I’m over it. So let’s get 
                        started, huh? I thought maybe you’d 
                        want to get married in June, like 
                        mom and dad. That’s only three 
                        months away...

           Cal enters with a gallon of chocolate milk.

                                 CAL
                        Hey gals. Sorry I’m late. Who wants 
                        chocolate milk? It was on sale, so 
                        we have to drink it all by tonight.

                                 RUBY
                        I didn’t know you were coming, Cal.

                                 CAL
                        Oh yeah, Iz and I want to decide on 
                        things together. We’re all 
                        liberated and stuff. Sometimes I 
                        let her be on top. Hey now!

           He gives Isabel a glass of chocolate milk with a crazy straw.

                                 ISABEL
                        Aw, you got me crazy straws.

                                 CAL
                             (terrible British accent)
                        If my lady would like her drink to 
                        take an outrageous journey on its 
                        way to her lips, who am I to deny 
                        her this favor?
                                 ISABEL
                             (bad British accent)
                        Thank ye, me lord.

                                 CAL
                        We’re going to the Ren Faire 
                        tomorrow. How do we sound?

                                 RUBY
                        Very authentic.

           He sits down and puts his feet up on the kitchen table.

                                 CAL
                        Let’s do this thing.

                                 RUBY
                        Okay. Well, a lot of couples like 
                        to start by choosing their colors.

                                 ISABEL
                        I don’t know. I mean, I don’t 
                        really have a good eye...

                                 CAL
                        Well, I was thinking red, gold, 
                        black and green. Rasta colors.

                                 RUBY
                        Wow. That would be bold. But it 
                        might be better to start with your 
                        own roots.

                                 CAL
                        Those are my roots. My dad’s 
                        Jamaican. I’m half-black.

                                 RUBY
                             (in disbelief)
                        Uh huh.

                                 CAL
                        Yeah, Isabel knows which half, 
                        right, Iz?

           Isabel giggles.

                                 CAL
                        I’m talking about my big dick, 
                        Ruby. That’s what I’m talking 
                        about.
                                 RUBY
                        Yes. Good. Okay, so maybe if we 
                        just went with a pale gold and a 
                        very light green. We can do red and 
                        black for the engagement party.

           Ruby writes this down in her planner.

                                 CAL
                        We’ve been having so many great 
                        ideas for the wedding. I started 
                        writing them all down in a journal.

           Cal pulls out a Lisa Frank notebook with “DREAMS” written in 
           sparkly puffy paint on the cover.

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        Okay. So here are just a few of the 
                        gems we’ve come up with so far for 
                        the wedding. One, a karaoke 
                        machine. Two, ball pit. I know 
                        people say they are full of germs 
                        but they’re freaking fun as hell. 

                                 ISABEL
                        Yeah, and maybe we could get those 
                        full size arcade games. I bet you 
                        can rent those. Ruby, remember how 
                        much we loved playing Ms. Pac Man?

                                 CAL
                        Clutch idea, babe. Three, Italian 
                        ices. Four, lemurs. I know a guy. 
                        And I thought that’s a good 
                        metaphor -- you know how lemurs are 
                        always jumping off cliffs together? 
                        -- that’s like marriage.

                                 RUBY
                        I think you mean lemmings.

                                 CAL
                        Hmm. No, I think it is lemurs.

                                 RUBY
                        Fair enough.

                                 CAL
                        Five, beer pong tables. Six, a 
                        pumpkin carriage. 
                                 ISABEL
                        Oh yeah, we could dress the horses 
                        up like mice, like Cinderella. Or 
                        do I have that backwards?

                                 CAL
                        Seven, wait what the heck does 
                        seven say? It looks like dyke 
                        pistols, but that can’t be right. 
                        Can it? I guess it got smudged by 
                        my Vick’s Vapo-Rub. I like to use 
                        it nightly. Helps with my sinus 
                        allergies. But I digress. Eight, 
                        Taco Truck. Nine, Jimmy Buffet 
                        sings live and in person--

                                 RUBY
                             (interrupting)
                        Okay, Cal, why don’t you just give 
                        me that notebook so I can...process 
                        all these wonderful ideas.

           He hands Ruby the dream journal. She sets it aside.

                                 ISABEL
                             (hesitant)
                        I had some other ideas too. I 
                        thought that like each table could 
                        have a different country theme 
                        from, like, places that I went to 
                        do nonprofit work, and that Cal was 
                        a missionary. And since Cal’s 
                        Christian, and I’m not really 
                        religious, maybe for the ceremony, 
                        we could have a priest and also a 
                        psychic spiritual healer.

                                 CAL
                        Oh, and I’d really like to get 
                        Kanye West to sing Gold Digger.

           As they keep talking, Ruby’s eyes glaze over, and we see 
           INSIDE HER MIND --

           A DREAM SEQUENCE of the wedding they’ve planned.

           In the middle of an OLIVE GARDEN, Kanye West and the Mormon 
           Tabernacle Choir break into a solemn version of GOLD DIGGER 
           as, at the back of the church, Isabel appears, dressed in a 
           Rasta-colors wedding gown, holding Cal’s ferret on a leash.

           Brad, Joshua and Evan stand near the groom’s party dressed in  
           T-shirts that have a tuxedo jacket and tie printed on them.
           Near a makeshift altar is Cal in a SLEEVELESS TUXEDO.

           At the front, a preacher and a psychic healer in just a 
           leotard smile at the bride and groom as they join hands.

           The bridesmaids are all dressed in various national costumes:

           A sari, a burkha, a cheongsam, a snowsuit, and Ruby as a 
           white-face mime wearing a beret.

           The groomsmen are all in jeans and T-shirts, mesh shirts, 
           tank tops, and one has a shirt saying “I’m With Stupid” with 
           an arrow pointing to his crotch.

           As they say their vows, Cal slips a BEER KOOZIE onto Isabel’s 
           wrist instead of a ring.

                                 PSYCHIC HEALER
                        You may kiss the bride!

           Cal starts dry-humping Isabel as the floor of the church 
           opens and Ruby falls through the floor into a huge ball-pit 
           filled with balls, lemurs, pagers, tacos and Kanye West.

           She struggles to stay atop the balls, but keeps sinking and 
           finally SCREAMS herself awake--

           INT. BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Ruby sits up with a SCREAM. She was dreaming.

                                 JOSHUA
                             (not really awake)
                        What is it?

                                 RUBY
                        It was awful. There were lemurs and 
                        a taco truck and I was a mime.

           Joshua goes back to snoring. Ruby stays awake, TERRIFIED.

           INT. BRAD’S OFFICE -- THE NEXT DAY

           Ruby’s friend Brad’s office is in a fancy downtown high-rise.

                                 BRAD
                        So, you just thought you’d stop by.

                                 RUBY
                             (cagey)
                        Uh-huh. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUBY (cont'd)
                        I have to go to the courthouse and 
                        pay a parking ticket, so...

                                 BRAD
                        Cool.

           They sit in silence for a second, then:

                                 RUBY
                        Can you get Cal’s Social Security 
                        number for me?

                                 BRAD
                        And this is for?

                                 RUBY
                        A background check on him.

                                 BRAD
                        Oh boy.

                                 RUBY
                        What? You can’t find it?

                                 BRAD
                        Rube, I’m an entertainment lawyer.

                                 RUBY
                        So you don’t know how to find 
                        someone’s Social Security number?

                                 BRAD
                        No, I do, but Ruby...Does Isabel 
                        know you’re doing this?

                                 RUBY
                        No. And you can’t tell her, okay? 
                        She’s just too trusting, Brad. If 
                        she’s going to marry this guy, at 
                        least one of us should know 
                        everything about him. 

           A beat, Brad takes her in.

                                 RUBY
                        I mean, you think Cal is awful, 
                        right?

                                 BRAD
                        He isn’t my soulmate, but if Iz 
                        likes him, that’s what matters.

                                 RUBY
                        But what about Michael Hershman?
                                 BRAD
                        What?

                                 RUBY
                        Cal is like Michael Hershman. Your 
                        sister’s husband. He’s going to 
                        drive my family apart.

                                 BRAD
                        Trust me, Cal is not like Michael 
                        Hershman. Michael wasn’t just 
                        weird. He was rude, and kind of 
                        mean. He used to weigh my sister 
                        every morning to make sure she 
                        wasn’t gaining relationship weight.

                                 RUBY
                        Ew.

                                 BRAD
                        That’s not Cal.

                                 RUBY
                        No, believe me, I have it on good 
                        authority that he likes “more 
                        cushion for the pushin’ and more 
                        pillow for the dillow.”

                                 BRAD
                        Word. Look, Rube, Cal, whatever 
                        else he is, seems like a nice guy. 
                        And that’s what matters.

                                 RUBY
                        But what if he isn’t. He might be a 
                        secret Michael Hershman. Or a 
                        murderer. I just don’t know. And I 
                        need to. Because I don’t want to be 
                        a mime in a wedding.

                                 BRAD
                        What?

                                 RUBY
                        Not important. Weird dream I had. 
                        Can you please get this for me? 
                        Please?

           A beat. Brad SIGHS.

                                 BRAD
                        Fine. But that’s as far as I go.
           He stands and gets his jacket.

                                 RUBY
                        Where are you going?

                                 BRAD
                        You’re taking me to lunch. If 
                        you’re going to make me your weird 
                        dirty confidante, the least you can 
                        do is buy me a burger. And no 
                        talking about Cal at lunch.

                                 RUBY
                        What? I don’t talk about him that 
                        much.

           INT. BRAD’S CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

           Brad stares morosely forward as Ruby babbles.

                                 RUBY
                        And he wants to have a nacho bar, 
                        because he only likes things 
                        thirteen year-olds like. Ugh, and 
                        now the wedding’s so close...

           We FADE TO a MONTAGE of wedding preparations:

           INT. HOLLYWOOD BAKERY

           Cal triumphantly slams a cake book down between them, with 
           the page open on a large “Lobster” cake. 

                                 CAL
                        Found it. Lobster for dinner and 
                        dessert. Doesn’t get much classier 
                        than that.

           INT. SILVERLAKE WINE AND CHEESE

           Cal, Izzy, Joshua and Ruby sit at the counter testing wines. 

                                 WINE EXPERT
                        And this is a California Merlot.

           Cal cocks an eyebrow.

                                 CAL
                        Hey, have you seen Sideways?
           The expert looks wary, Ruby puts her head in her hands -- she 
           knows what’s coming.

           Then the Wine Expert suddenly bursts into a smile and...

                            CAL
           I’m not drinking any fucking 
           merlot! 
                                                       WINE EXPERT
                                              I’m not drinking any fucking 
                                              merlot! 

                                 WINE EXPERT
                        I was an extra in the movie.

                                 CAL
                        Get out of town!

           Cal pulls the Wine Expert into a head lock and gives him a 
           noogie.

                                 CAL
                        This guy gets it!

           INT. IZZY AND CAL’S HOUSE - DEN

           Izzy, Josh and Ruby chat as Brad and Evan look at Cal’s DVDs. 
           Cal walks in with a platter of wedding cake tasting slices.

                                 CAL
                        All right. Wedding cake tasting 
                        night is on like a prom dress!

                                 BRAD
                        Cal, you have all our favorite 
                        movies.

                                 CAL
                        You guys like action?

                                 EVAN
                        Action movies combine my two great 
                        loves: hot dudes with their shirts 
                        off and shit blowing up.

                                 CAL
                        Well, you guys can come over 
                        anytime. I’ll queer out with you.

                                 BRAD
                        Sweet.
           INT. FRIAR TUX SHOP 

           Izzy nudges Ruby.

                                 ISABEL
                        I picked these out. They are 
                        awesome.

           Cal and Joshua emerge wearing powder blue and bright orange 
           tuxedoes a la “Dumb and Dumber”.  

           Izzy cracks up and gives Cal two big thumbs up. 

           Ruby gives Joshua her big fake smile.

           Cal bends over and pretends his butt is talking, a la Ace 
           Ventura, Pet Detective.

                                 CAL’S BUTT
                        I love these. Get it, Rube? Ace 
                        Ventura?

                                 RUBY
                        I got it.

                                 CAL’S BUTT
                        Then why aren’t you laughing? Is it 
                        because I make you horny baby? That 
                        was Austin Powers. NIIIICE!

                                 RUBY
                        No.

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. RUBY AND JOSHUA’S HOUSE

           Ruby and Joshua stand in the doorway as Cal and Izzy leave.

                                 ISABEL
                        Thanks again for dinner. 

                                 RUBY
                        Of course. I’ll mail the 
                        invitations tomorrow. Hard to 
                        believe it’s just six weeks away.

                                 CAL
                        Then we can finally consummate our 
                        love -- for the one-thousandth 
                        time. 
           He chases Iz out, pretending to grab her ass the whole way.

                                 CAL
                        Niiiiiiiiice!

           Ruby lets out a long sigh as Joshua closes the door.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Good day?

                                 RUBY
                        Ugh.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Hey, listen, tomorrow is your 
                        birthday, and somebody made a 
                        reservation at Jar. Just us, Brad 
                        and Evan.

                                 RUBY
                        You’re the best.

           INT. JAR RESTAURANT

           Ruby raises her glass.

                                 RUBY
                        To a lovely, civilized evening.

           They all clink glasses.

                                 RUBY
                        It is weird that no one has sent 
                        their food back because it has too 
                        many ingredients. 

                                 JOSHUA
                        All right, take it easy.

                                 BRAD
                        Yeah, Cal’s a little crazy, but 
                        he’s also kinda fun to have around.

                                 RUBY
                        Oh god, he’s turned all of you.

                                 EVAN
                        Speaking of Cal, we got our 
                        invitations to the big engagement 
                        party next week. 
                                 RUBY
                        It’s a combination Bob Marley/Toy 
                        Story theme. Were gonna have pot 
                        brownies and one of those little 
                        claw machines where you get a toy.

                                 BRAD
                        Okay, now can we talk about 
                        something, anything other than 
                        Isabel and Cal? 

                                 RUBY
                        Okay, but one thing? He’s got a 
                        webbed toe on his right foot. No 
                        joke. I saw it.

           Everyone rolls their eyes.

           EXT. JOSHUA AND RUBY’S HOUSE -- LATER

           Ruby wraps her arms around Joshua’s neck.

                                 RUBY
                        Thanks again for my night off.

           She kisses him.

           INT. JOSHUA AND RUBY’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           They open the door to a DARKENED HOUSE and...

                                 CROWD
                        SURPRISE!

           A crowd bursts out of their hiding places, including, front 
           and center, CAL, in a party hat.

                                 CAL
                        Hey, sis! Happy birthday.

                                 ISABEL
                        We got you good!

                                 CAL
                        Hey! There’s cake and there’s 
                        wieners. Get a mouthful! NOT!

           MOMENTS LATER

           Cal brings in a GIANT BIRTHDAY CAKE with a picture of Ruby’s 
           head photo-shopped onto Pamela Anderson’s Baywatch body.
           It’s aglow with candles.

                                 CAL
                        We put your head on Pamela 
                        Anderson’s body. Isn’t that 
                        hilarious?

                                 ISABEL
                        Make a wish.

           Ruby looks from Izzy to Cal, takes a deep breath, and BLOWS.

           INT. RUBY’S HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Joshua intercepts her as she comes out of the bathroom, the 
           party still raging outside.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Hey, I’m sorry. This was Izzy and 
                        Cal’s idea. They just wanted to say 
                        thanks for planning their wedding.

                                 RUBY
                        It’s fine...

           Cal pushes the door open.

                                 CAL
                        Put some clothes on and get out 
                        here! We’ve got another surprise.

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           All the party guests sit or stand near a GIANT PLASMA TV.

           Cal stands in front of the crowd.

                                 CAL
                        First of all, we really want to 
                        thank everyone for coming. We’re 
                        here to smell-a-brate a pretty 
                        special lady. A lady who has taken 
                        me into her heart like a real 
                        sister, and who’s been kind enough 
                        to help us two deadbeats plan our 
                        special day. She’s sweet and kind 
                        and she’s got a pretty good body 
                        even though I can’t talk about that 
                        because we’re about to be related. 
                        Anyway. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CAL (cont'd)
                        We were trying to figure out what 
                        to get her for her birthday, and Iz 
                        and I decided that instead of 
                        buying her something, we ought to 
                        make her something. So without 
                        further Mountain a-Dew, let’s go 
                        ahead and show Ruby the movie we 
                        made for her.

           Ruby’s face balls up in embarrassment as Cal kills the lights 
           and Isabel presses play.

           The video comes up, and we see some slow-motion shots of the 
           things Cal says as Cal’s VOICEOVER STARTS.

                                 CAL (V.O.)
                        There are many awesome things in 
                        this world. Monster trucks. The 
                        Pussycat Dolls. Carrot Top. Tato 
                        Skins. Spiders. The hot sister on 
                        Charles in Charge. My mom. Your mom-

           A picture of a GORILLA comes up.

                                 CAL (V.O.)
                        Just kidding. But of all the 
                        awesome things in the world, 
                        including oceans, sunsets, and 
                        different sexy ways of making love, 
                        the most awesome thing of all, is 
                        Ruby.

           The tape switches tone as a HEAVY METAL BALLAD starts 
           playing. And we see BABY PICTURES of Ruby. 

                                 CAL (V.O.)
                        Ruby Duncan was born in 1976. It 
                        was a big year for humanity. The 
                        Concorde took its first flight. 
                        Jimmy Carter was elected. Apple 
                        Computers was founded, and a bunch 
                        of Alien UFOs landed in the Sea of 
                        Japan, although that story was 
                        silenced by the United Nations. But 
                        most importantly, Ruby came into 
                        the lives of her mom and dad, 
                        Robert and Rachel Duncan. 

           A picture of a young, hippie-looking couple. Tears 
           immediately spring into Ruby’s eyes.

           The movie flips through Ruby’s elementary school years.
                                 CAL (V.O.)
                        Ruby was good at almost everything. 
                        She won the spelling bee. And took 
                        second place in the science fair, 
                        losing out to John Hartmere and his 
                        stupid constellation diorama that 
                        his dad obviously did for him. And 
                        when Ruby was six, her little 
                        sister Isabel was born, and Ruby 
                        immediately took her under her 
                        wing.

                                 CAL
                        When Isabel was eight, she finally 
                        convinced Ruby that she was too big 
                        to be carried like a baby.

                        Ruby was not a rebellious teenager.

           Pictures of Ruby in Model U.N., thespians, Young Scholars, 
           cheerleading, 4-H, M.A.D.D., Etc.

                                 CAL
                        And when Ruby’s mom and dad died 
                        while she was in college, Ruby came 
                        right home to take care of Isabel.

           Now Ruby’s totally crying. Joshua gives her a look as the 
           video goes into wedding photos of Joshua and Ruby with Isabel 
           as bridesmaid, and continues to the present.

                                 CAL (V.O.)
                        So thanks, Ruby. Happy Birthday and 
                        keep rocking. Your new brother Cal, 
                        out. Hey Isabel, shut off the tape 
                        recorder and let’s do a 69.

           The crowd APPLAUDS as the lights come back on.

           Ruby looks across at Cal. He smiles at her. She smiles back.

           LATER -- AT THE DOOR

           Ruby gives Cal and Isabel a hug as they go. 

                                 RUBY
                        Thanks, guys. That was the nicest 
                        present anybody ever gave me. 
                                 ISABEL
                        It was all Cal’s idea.

           Ruby gives Cal another hug.

                                 CAL
                        Happy birthday, Rube. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Brad and Evan straighten up the living room.

                                 RUBY
                        You guys do not have to do that.

                                 EVAN
                        Yes we do. We’re gays.

           Evan takes some plates to the kitchen.

           Once they are alone, Brad takes a small white card out of his 
           pocket and hands it to Ruby.

                                 BRAD
                        So, do you still want this?

                                 RUBY
                        What is...oh my god. I forgot.

           A BEAT. It’s Cal’s Social Security number.

                                 BRAD
                        That was awfully nice of Cal to 
                        make that tape.

                                 RUBY
                        Okay, I get it, I was wrong, you 
                        were right.

                                 JOSHUA
                             (entering)
                        About what?

           Ruby sticks the card hastily into a drawer and CLOSES IT.

                                 RUBY
                        Oh, I thought...um...that dogs and 
                        cats could have babies together.

           Joshua gives her a weird look.

           Ruby smiles as we hear her V.O.
                                 RUBY (V.O.)
                        I’m not the type of person who 
                        can’t admit it when she’s wrong...

           INT. JAIL CELL

           Ruby smiles ruefully as the other prisoners look on. By now a 
           few more prostitutes are in the cell too.

                                 RUBY
                        ...and I was wrong about Cal. I 
                        finally saw that. And over the next 
                        few weeks, I actually started to 
                        like him. I started to find the 
                        things that used to annoy me kind 
                        of endearing.

                                 CARLA
                        I know what you mean. I had this 
                        John that I used to hate, because 
                        he had a weird penis. But then 
                        after a while, that’s what I liked 
                        about him. Life is a beautiful and 
                        complex mystery.

                                 RUBY
                        I think we’re on the same page 
                        there Carla. I began to like Cal so 
                        much I even took him on a behind-
                        the-scenes tour of the zoo. Just 
                        the two of us.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. ZOO PICNIC AREA

           Cal fastens half of a “BEST FRIENDS” NECKLACE around her 
           neck.

                                 CAL
                        You sure that’s the half you want?

                                 RUBY
                        Yeah, man. This is great.

                                 CAL
                        Now let’s get our tour on. I wanna 
                        see the basement at the Alamo.
                                 RUBY
                             (playing along)
                        There is no basement at the Alamo.

                                 CAL
                        Whoa, you like that movie?

                                 RUBY
                             (talking like Pee-Wee)
                        Of course. “My bike! My bike!”

           INT. SPIDER HOUSE

           They are back behind the spider cages.

                                 CAL
                        You sure this is safe?

                                 RUBY
                        Just try not to move.

           She places a big hairy tarantula on his arm.

                                 CAL
                        You ever notice how tarantulas look 
                        like pubes?

           Ruby tilts her head and looks. He’s kinda right.

                                 RUBY
                        Huh I guess.

                                 CAL
                        Which Spiderman movie is your 
                        favorite?

                                 RUBY
                        First one.

                                 CAL
                        What? Not three? You’re nuts.

           INT. AVIARY

           Cal stands still, a bird perched on his head.

                                 CAL
                        No, seriously, I feel like there’s 
                        something on me.
           INT. AQUARIUM

           Cal points to a weird little guy in a tank.

                                 CAL
                        Who’s this little weirdo fish?

                                 RUBY
                        That is actually not a fish. It’s 
                        an Axolotl.

                                 CAL
                        Axolotl.

                                 RUBY
                        Axolotls are salamanders, which 
                        means he’s a perennibranchiate.

                                 CAL
                        A pebbibarnnniayaaaah.

                                 RUBY
                        That’s right. That means they are 
                        amphibians, but unlike other 
                        creatures of that type, they never 
                        develop lungs or eyelids.

                                 CAL
                        No lungs or eyelids? Buddy, what 
                        are you thinking?

                                 RUBY
                        Yep, and so they have to stay 
                        underwater their whole lives.

                                 CAL
                        Cool. Why don’t you put a little 
                        friend in there or something. 
                        Nobody likes to be alone.

                                 RUBY
                        We’re trying to find a mate for him 
                        so he can reproduce, but it’s tough 
                        because these little guys are 
                        endangered.

                                 CAL
                        NO!
                                 RUBY
                        Yeah, their natural habitat is only 
                        seven miles wide, and it’s getting 
                        smaller all the time. They’ve only 
                        found a hundred Axolotls in the 
                        last three years.

                                 CAL
                             (whispering to the fish)
                        Hey pal, don’t you worry. We’re 
                        gonna find you somebody. We’re 
                        gonna get you a family. 

           Ruby, watching Cal, smiles.

           INT. SNAKE CAGE

           Cal stands with a python draped over his shoulders.

                                 CAL
                        I look like Britney!

           Ruby laughs.

           Cal switches suddenly to being terrified.

                                 CAL
                        Okay, now get this monster off of 
                        me. I think I’m gonna puke.

           INT. CAL’S CAR

           Cal and Ruby drive along singing to “Margaritaville.”

                                 RUBY
                        I know you guys can’t afford to buy 
                        in our neighborhood now, but the 
                        market’s still dropping so it could 
                        become a reality. Then we’d be 
                        neighbors. How fun would that be?

                                 CAL
                        Super-fun.

                                 RUBY
                        Okay, where are you taking me?

                                 CAL
                        It’s a surprise.
                                 RUBY
                        Okay, but you don’t have to take me 
                        anywhere.

                                 CAL
                        Are you kidding? That zoo tour was 
                        my fifth favorite thing I’ve ever 
                        done, right above the time Steven 
                        Seagal accidentally punched me in 
                        the face at a Claire’s Boutique. 
                        Now, I gotta take you to do my 
                        favorite thing.

           EXT. THE STRAND -- NIGHT

           On a part of The Strand (the walkway near the beach) that is 
           totally deserted, Ruby and Cal sit on a bench eating Subway.

           It’s dark and there’s no one around.

                                 RUBY
                        Okay, what are we doing out here?

                                 CAL
                        Just eat your Five Dollar Footlong 
                        and wait, woman.

                                 RUBY
                        You’re not gonna kill me are you?

                                 CAL
                        I’m not ruling it out, but I don’t 
                        think so.

                                 RUBY
                        What are we...

                                 CAL
                        Okay, here it comes.

           There’s a SUPER-LOUD WHOOSHING sound, and then a GIANT 747 
           comes swooping right over them on takeoff from LAX.

           It’s so close, they can see the writing on the bottom.

           Cal whoops and hollers.

                                 RUBY
                        Oh my god. That was terrifying!
                        That’s awesome.
           EXT. RUBY AND JOSHUA’S HOUSE -- FRONT PORCH

           Cal walks Ruby to the door.

                                 RUBY
                        Thanks, Cal. I had a great time.

                                 CAL
                        Me too.

                                 RUBY
                        You know, I never had a brother 
                        before. This’ll be fun.

                                 CAL
                             (blushing)
                        Gee, thanks, Rube.

           He goes in for a really awkward hug. 

           It’s a totally sweet moment.

                                 CAL
                        I apologize in advance.

                                 RUBY
                        For wha--

           Cal FARTS.

                                 RUBY
                        And...there it is.

           INT. NORDSTROM’S BRIDAL AT THE GROVE MALL

           Ruby waits for Isabel to come out in a gown.

                                 ISABEL
                        So I hear you and Cal had fun 
                        yesterday.

                                 RUBY
                        Yep. I gotta admit you were right 
                        about him. He is pretty fun.

                                 ISABEL
                        Told ya.

           Isabel emerges in a wedding dress that’s all wrong for her.
                                 ISABEL
                        How does it look?

                                 RUBY
                        Like a sixteen-year-old girl’s 
                        wishes and dreams threw up on you.

                                 ISABEL
                        Awesome. I’ll try another one.

           Isabel heads back in. Ruby calls through the door.

                                 RUBY
                        So the caterers said they can’t do 
                        jalapeno poppers. No deep fryer.

                                 ISABEL
                        Oh, Cal will be so sad.

                                 RUBY
                        But I was thinking we could bring 
                        our own frozen ones -- the kind you 
                        can reheat in the microwave.

                                 ISABEL
                        You’re letting me use a microwave 
                        for wedding food? Who are you and 
                        what have you done with my sister?

                                 RUBY
                        I know, I’m like Brad Pitt after he 
                        started dating Angelina Jolie. I 
                        like flying and orphans now.

                                 ISABEL
                        Okay, here I come.

           Isabel steps out in the perfect WEDDING GOWN.

           It’s a long, simple sheath that doesn’t hide her tattoos. 

           She’s BEAUTIFUL. Ruby stares, a little overwhelmed.

                                 ISABEL
                        Oh shoot, you don’t like it.

                                 RUBY
                        No, it’s -- it’s perfect.

                                 ISABEL
                        Can you get the zipper in the back? 
                        I need to make sure this bitch zips 
                        all the way up.
           Ruby zips her all the way in.

                                 RUBY
                        Okay. No getting out of it now.

                                 ISABEL
                        I think the wedding is going to be 
                        so fun. And then off to Vietnam and 
                        Cambodia for three whole weeks! And 
                        then we’ll have to come back and 
                        pack.

           Ruby startles.

                                 RUBY
                        Pack? For what? 

                                 ISABEL
                        Oh my gosh! I’m so caught up in 
                        this whole wedding thing, I forgot 
                        to tell you. Cal got a promotion. 
                        They’re making him a full manager 
                        at the Friday’s in Honolulu. 

                                 RUBY
                        What?

                                 ISABEL
                        Cal found out about a week ago.

                                 RUBY
                        So you’ve known for a whole week?

                                 ISABEL
                        Yeah.
                             (then, taking Ruby’s face 
                              in her hands)
                        Hey, don’t freak out. Hawaii’s just 
                        a few hours away. And we’ll visit 
                        all the time, okay? Smile?

           Ruby forces a smile. Isabel drops her hands and turns away.

           Angle on RUBY, clearly thrown as her V.O. starts.

                                 RUBY (V.O.)
                        Hawaii? Like across-the-ocean 
                        Hawaii. That’s weird right? Because 
                        Isabel...
           EXT. ZOO PICNIC AREA

           Ruby talks to Sitaraam, getting more and more worked up. 
           Sitaraam looks scared.

                                 RUBY
                        ...never talked about wanting to 
                        move to Hawaii. I mean, sure she’s 
                        putting on a brave face, but...

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. RUBY AND JOSHUA’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        ... I bet she doesn’t really even 
                        want to go.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Yeah, who’d want to go to a shit-
                        hole like Hawaii?

                                 RUBY
                        Right? 

                                 JOSHUA
                        I know you don’t like change, but 
                        this is about what’s best for Izzy. 

                                 RUBY
                        I just can’t picture her not being 
                        around. I mean, before when Izzy 
                        left on one of her crazy trips, I 
                        always knew she was coming back. 
                        This time, she’s not going to. Who 
                        am I going to watch Grey’s Anatomy 
                        ironically with? Who is going to 
                        come with me to the mall and eat at 
                        The Great Steak Escape even though 
                        it’s disgusting because that’s 
                        where we ate ever since we were 
                        kids? Who’s going to go with me to 
                        do all the stuff we’ve always done? 

                                 JOSHUA
                        I can do that stuff with you.

           Ruby shrugs like: Meh.
                                 JOSHUA
                        Or maybe we can get Michelle Obama 
                        or the new Captain Kirk.

                                 RUBY
                             (breaking into a sob.)
                        They’re too busy.

                                 JOSHUA
                             (comforting)
                        Okay, come on. Come to bed my 
                        little lunatic. This will all seem 
                        better in the morning.

           INT. RUBY AND JOSHUA’S BEDROOM -- LATER

           Ruby lays with her eyes wide open.

           INT. LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Ruby creeps over to the drawer where she put the CARD WITH 
           CAL’S SOCIAL SECURITY CARD NUMBER.

           INT. RUBY’S HOME OFFICE -- LATER

           She has the INTELLIUS WEBSITE up on her computer. She enters 
           her credit card info, paying for a DELUXE BACKGROUND CHECK.

           LATER

           Ruby flips through pages and pages of printed information. 

                                 RUBY
                        Former addresses all in 
                        Indianapolis, Indiana. Boring.

           LATER

           Ruby talks on the phone with her feet up on the desk. She has 
           Cal’s credit report in front of her.

           She’s IMITATING CAL’S VOICE AND MANNERISMS.

                                 RUBY 
                        Right, so I see the charges here. 
                        Water bill. Ferret feed. A water-
                        bed. Cable. Seven ShamWows. Martha 
                        Stewart Living Magazine 
                        subscription. Check. Another water-
                        bed? Of course. 
           Then, suddenly, she sits up straight.

                                 RUBY
                        Now wait a minute, what’s this? Who 
                        received this money I wire-
                        transferred to Las Vegas? 

           EVEN LATER

           As dawn breaks, Ruby drinks a large cup of coffee.

                                 RUBY
                             (on phone)
                        Yes this is Sergeant, uh, Axel 
                        Foley over at the Reno station. My 
                        partner was recently, um, shot and 
                        we need some information on a 
                        former inmate of yours. Yes, her 
                        first name is Mindy. Let me spell 
                        the last name for you, it’s Rote. R-
                        O-T-E. 

           INT. VERA WANG BRIDAL -- MORNING

           Ruby tries on a pale pink bridesmaid dress as Isabel watches.

                                 ISABEL
                        It’s a little girlie for my taste, 
                        to be honest.

           Ruby’s phone rings.

                                 RUBY
                             (on phone)
                        Hello. 
                             (deepens her voice)
                        Yes, this is Sergeant Foley.

           Ruby covers the phone and mouths to Isabel that she needs to 
           take the call and heads back into the dressing room.

                                 RUBY
                             (on phone)
                        Uh huh. I’m very interested in 
                        hearing that. You got something?

           She listens, her eyes go WIDE.
           EXT. VERA WANG BRIDAL -- MOMENTS LATER

           Ruby tears out of the front of the Vera Wang store, a clerk 
           and Isabel giving chase.

           She runs to a car but, damn it...

                                 RUBY
                        Isabel drove.

           EXT. BEVERLY HILLS STREET

           In front of Mr. Chow Restaurant, an rich-looking guy pulls up 
           in a LOTUS near an unattended valet stand.

           Ruby opens his door, handing him a ticket she swiped from the 
           valet stand.

                                 RUBY
                        Here you go, sir.

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                             (re: her dress)
                        What’s this, some new valet 
                        gimmick?

                                 RUBY
                        Correct. Enjoy your lunch sir.

           She hops in and pulls away from the curb, gunning it. 

           EXT. 15 HIGHWAY REST STOP

           Ruby, still in her bridesmaid’s dress emerges from a 
           bathroom. Her phone rings.

                                 JOSHUA
                             (on phone)
                        Ruby, where are you? Isabel said 
                        you ran out of the store?

                                 RUBY
                        Oh yeah, I...got my period. You 
                        know how that is.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Whoa, yeah, okay. Sure.
                                 RUBY
                        Us girls and our periods. They make 
                        us crazy!

                                 JOSHUA
                        So where are you?

                                 RUBY
                        Oh just picking up something for 
                        the party real quick.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Are you going to be back in time?

           Ruby gets in the Lotus and rolls back onto the highway.

                                 RUBY
                        Totally.

           We widen and see she is in Primm, Nevada, headed to LAS 
           VEGAS.

           EXT. MOTEL 6, DOWNTOWN LAS VEGAS -- LATER

           Ruby, still in her gown, knocks on the a door at the sleazy 
           motel. An overweight lady in a bikini holding a weird-looking 
           dog in a Snugli opens the door. She has like three teeth.

                                 LADY
                        What’s up. You here to buy PCP or a 
                        bus pass?

                                 RUBY
                        No. Thank you. Neither. 

                                 LADY
                        Well, we’re out of fudge.

                                 RUBY
                        Wait, you also sell fudge?

                                 LADY
                        I just said we’re out.

                                 RUBY
                        Right. That was more of an “I’m 
                        startled that you sell fudge” kind 
                        of question. More rhetorical than 
                        anything. Are you Mindy Rote?
                                 LADY
                             (suddenly sexy)
                        I’m whoever you want me to be.

                                 RUBY
                        Okay, no, that’s not what I’m here 
                        for either.

                                 LADY
                        Suit yourself. 

                                 RUBY
                        This is so fun, just talking to 
                        you, really fun. But if you aren’t 
                        Mindy, do you have any idea where I 
                        can find her?

           INT. MIRAGE CASINO -- SIEGFRIED AND ROY’S SECRET GARDEN AND 
           DOLPHIN HABITAT

           In the elaborate indoor wildlife preserve, Ruby lurks near a 
           panther cage, where a young worker, KEVIN, feeds the panther.

           She winds her way around to where he exits the exhibit and 
           then shadows him back to the--

           DRESSING ROOM

           She spots a JANITOR’S CART nearby and wheels in behind him.

           Kevin hangs up his TRANQUILIZER DART GUN on a shelf. Ruby 
           tries to reach for it when he turns, but he sees her.

                                 KEVIN
                             (startled)
                        Hey, what are you doing in here? 
                        Why do you have Glinda’s janitor 
                        cart?

                                 RUBY
                        It’s okay! I work for the zoo in 
                        Los Angeles.

                                 KEVIN
                        What?

                                 RUBY
                        I just need to borrow your gun, so 
                        be cool, okay?
                                 KEVIN
                        Stay right here. I’m calling 
                        security.

           As soon as his back is turned, she grabs the TRANQ GUN and a 
           roll of DUCT TAPE from the shelf. She points the gun at 
           Kevin.

                                 RUBY
                        Freeze. Lay on the floor. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 RUBY
                        Because my sister’s marrying a 
                        weird guy.

                                 KEVIN
                        What? Weird how?

                                 RUBY
                        He’s just really awkward, and 
                        inappropriate, and kind of a dou--

           She shakes her head.

                                 RUBY
                        Wait. No. I can’t get into this 
                        now. Lay down. And count to 50 
                        before you stand up.

                                 KEVIN
                        Aren’t I supposed to count 
                        backwards from 50?

                                 RUBY
                        Just count!

                                 KEVIN
                        50, 49,...

           EXT. MIRAGE

           MINDY ROTE, 35, a crazy, meth-addict-looking disaster in bra, 
           cut-offs, and platform heels, steps off a city bus and 
           wobbles towards the Mirage. As she approaches the door, Ruby 
           jumps out of her Lotus.

                                 RUBY
                        Are you Mindy?
                                 MINDY
                        Yeah. Who the fuck are you?

           Instead of answering, Ruby shoots her with a TRANQUILIZER 
           DART.

           Mindy recoils and falls, then reaches up and pulls the dart 
           out.

                                 MINDY
                             (re: dart)
                        Again?

           She slumps over, out cold. 

           Ruby tries to pick her up, but it’s really difficult to move 
           a passed-out person.

           A DRUNKEN BACHELOR PARTY exits the Mirage, all with giant 
           souvenir drinks. Ruby stands up and straightens her hair.

                                 RUBY
                             (fake Southern accent)
                        Hey y’all, can you guys help me 
                        with somethin’ real quick?

           MOMENTS LATER, Ruby cruises away with Mindy duct-taped 
           upright in the passenger seat.

           INT. ENGAGEMENT PARTY

           Cal stands with his mother, HELEN PERDEW, 64. and father JOE, 
           who is 70 and, yes, he’s BLACK.

           He introduces them to Joshua.

                                 CAL
                        This is my awesome bro-in-law 
                        Joshua. Joshua, these are my folks, 
                        and these are my brothers: Montana, 
                        Beau, LeRoy, and Biscuit.

           THE BROTHERS, VARIOUS AGES, all looking like Cal, all wearing 
           Tennessee Tuxedoes: denim shirt, denim pants.

                                 LEROY
                        We’ve called him Biscuit ever since 
                        he was a little baby. 
                                 BEAU
                        On account of he had an imaginary 
                        friend who happened to be a 
                        biscuit.

                                 BISCUIT
                        That talking biscuit was not 
                        imaginary!

                                 BEAU
                        Agree to disagree.

                                 CAL
                        Joshua, where’s Ruby?

                                 JOSHUA
                        She called and said she was running 
                        late. I’m sure she’ll be here any 
                        second.

           He smiles, but seriously, where is Ruby?

                                 CAL
                        All right, I’m gonna go pick up 
                        some ladies. Psych! But, y’all make 
                        Joshua feel at home. I’m gonna find 
                        Iz.

           An awkward moment as Cal’s brothers take in Joshua.

                                 MONTANA
                        You like shooting guns?

                                 JOSHUA
                        Not really.

                                 BEAU
                        You don’t own a gun?

                                 JOSHUA
                        Nope.

                                 BISCUIT
                        What if someone breaks into your 
                        house?

                                 JOSHUA
                        I guess I’d call 911.
                                 MONTANA
                        Good luck with that, friend. You 
                        know that the government monitors 
                        those calls and only dispatches the 
                        cops when the house is a place 
                        where voters from their party live, 
                        right?

                                 JOSHUA
                        I don’t think that’s true.

                                 MONTANA
                        It’s called the internet man. You 
                        gotta read it.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Okay.

                                 BEAU
                        Hey, Josh.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Yeah.

                                 BEAU
                        Don’t you think my dad looks like 
                        Barack Obama?

           Joshua laughs.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Sure.

                                 LEROY
                        Uh-oh. Looks like a homeless lady 
                        got in here.

           ANGLE on Ruby, just entering, and looking totally nuts -- 
           sunburned and frazzled from her drive, and still in her 
           bridesmaid dress.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Oh boy.

           Ruby pushes her way through the party guests. 

           She grabs a champagne flute from a passing waiter and downs 
           it in one gulp, then throws the glass down with a loud 
           shatter. 

                                 CAL
                        Party foul!
                                 JOSHUA
                             (re: Ruby)
                        Well, this is not going to end 
                        well.

           He makes his way towards her, but Izzy gets there first.

                                 IZZY
                        Ruby. Oh my god. Where have you 
                        been? I was so worried about you. I 
                        thought you were kidnapped or 
                        murdered or hit by a car and sent 
                        back in time to solve mysteries. 

                                 RUBY
                        There was an emergency.

                                 IZZY
                        Are you still in your bridesmaid’s 
                        dress? Because they want that back. 
                        And I think there’s a warrant out 
                        for your arrest.

                                 CAL
                        Ruby, glad you made it.

           Cal goes in for a hug and Ruby resists. 

                                 RUBY
                        Save it.

                                 IZZY
                        Ruby!

                                 CAL
                             (laughing)
                        Iz, Rubes was just messing with me. 
                        It’s our bit. She pretends she 
                        hates me. Get it?

                                 IZZY
                        Not really.

                                 CAL
                        Come here, you little minx.

           Cal once again goes for a hug and Ruby pushes him away.

                                 RUBY
                        Stop it. 

           Cal stares at Ruby for a moment then breaks into laughter.
                                 CAL
                        That’s just part of the bit. She 
                        never breaks. How do you do it?

                                 IZZY
                        Ruby, what’s going on?

                                 RUBY
                        I’ll tell you what’s going on. I 
                        have a very special surprise for 
                        Cal. A very bad surprise.

                                 IZZY
                        Is this part of the bit?

                                 RUBY
                        There is no bit. Isabel, there’s 
                        something you need to know about 
                        your so-called fiancé. 

                                 ISABEL
                        What? Ruby, you’re scaring me.

           Behind Ruby, Mindy appears, still in her bra, but now with 
           weird bits of duct-tape hanging off of her.

                                 RUBY
                        Isabel, meet Mindy.

           A moment. Clearly Cal knows this woman.

                                 CAL
                             (shocked)
                        Mindy? Is that you?

           Ruby smiles smugly.

                                 RUBY
                        Oh, it’s her all right.

                                 MINDY
                        Hey Cal. 
                             (to Ruby)
                        Hey Rudy. Look, I know you said to 
                        wait in the car for you, but I ate 
                        that whole bag of hot Cheetos you 
                        gave me and I am wicked thirsty.

                                 ISABEL
                        Cal, who is that woman?

           The party guests quiet down at the commotion.
                                 RUBY
                        Yes who is this woman, Cal? Maybe 
                        you could explain why you’ve been 
                        sending money to her every month? 
                        Or why you purchased her a hotel 
                        room in Reno on March sixteenth? 
                        And why you’ve visited her five 
                        times in the last six months? 
                        Because to me it’s weird that you 
                        are spending so much time and money 
                        on this...prostitute.

           Isabel gasps.

                                 ISABEL
                        Is that true?

                                 MINDY
                        Yep, I am a prostitute. But I also 
                        have a blog.

                                 CAL
                             (defeated)
                        Iz, it’s not true. I mean yes, part 
                        of it is, but it’s not what you 
                        think. Mindy’s--

                                 RUBY
                        Don’t listen to him. He’s a liar. 
                        He’s a liar and a cheat and I 
                        caught him. I got him.

                                 CAL
                        Ruby, you don’t know what you’ve 
                        done. Mindy is--

                                 RUBY
                        Oh don’t I? I’m saving my little 
                        sister from making the biggest 
                        mistake of her life. I’m saving her 
                        from getting married to a guy who 
                        wants a mudslide bar and a ball pit 
                        at his wedding, and who hates 
                        organic food and singer-songwriters 
                        and wears mesh shirts. I’m stopping 
                        my baby sister from marrying THE 
                        MOST ANNOYING PERSON ON EARTH.

           The whole room is SILENT.

           Then, from across the room, Cal’s dad, Joe, spots Mindy. 
                                 JOE
                        Mindy? 

                                 MINDY
                        Hey daddy! 

                                 RUBY
                        Daddy?

                                 JOE
                        What in holy hell are you doing 
                        here?

                                 MINDY
                        This lady brought me here. First 
                        she tranquilizer-darted me. Then 
                        she bought me hot Cheetos and a 
                        bunch of Meth. I had a great day!

                                 JOE
                        Goddammit, Mindy. You know you are 
                        not supposed to cross state lines. 
                             (then, to Ruby)
                        Wait, you bought her drugs?

                                 RUBY
                        Whoa. I did not buy her drugs.

                                 MINDY
                        Well, I stole a bunch of money out 
                        of your bag and bought some in the 
                        parking lot. So technically you 
                        did. And she kept asking me about 
                        my relationship to Cal but I didn’t 
                        say anything cause she said she was 
                        the police. Plus her questions were 
                        all perverted. I may have done a 
                        lot of weird shit in my life, but I 
                        do not get sexy with family 
                        members. 

                                 RUBY
                        But...your last name is Rote. 

                                 MINDY
                        I changed it on account of I don’t 
                        ascribe to the passing of names 
                        through the patriarchal system.

                             (taking Izzy’s hand)
                        Isabel, I am sorry I didn’t tell 
                        you this before.

                        Mindy here is my half sister. She’s 
                        a drug addict and a convicted 
                        felon.

                                 MINDY
                        Totes. I should be in some kinda 
                        facility right now. I am a 
                        dangerous person.

                                 CAL
                        I didn’t tell you about her before 
                        because, well, I was ashamed I 
                        guess. I thought you wouldn’t think 
                        I was respectable. But she’s my 
                        family and I can’t just turn my 
                        back on her. So I’ve been sending 
                        her money and trying to help her 
                        out when I can. I’m so sorry that I 
                        didn’t tell you sooner.

           Izzy and Cal embrace. 

                                 ISABEL
                        You are such a good guy.

           Over Cal’s shoulder, Izzy glares at Ruby.

           Ruby’s face falls as she realizes what she’s done.

           SUDDENLY, there is a SIREN and policemen flood the party.

                                 MINDY
                             (pointing at Ruby)
                        She brought me here! It was Rudy! 
                        It was Rudy! 

                                 RUBY
                        Fuck.

           A female cop approaches Rudy with handcuffs.

                                 RUBY
                             (backing away)
                        Hello officer. I’m Detective Axel 
                        Foley, Detroit P.D.

           Ruby starts to run, but the female cop TASERS HER. As she 
           falls, one of her shoes flies off through the air smacks 
           another cop in the face. That cop joins in on the tasering 
           too.

                                 RUBY (V.O.)
                        So that was that...
           INT. LOS ANGELES CORRECTIONAL FACILITY, CELL

           The prostitutes shake their heads as Ruby wraps up her tale.

                                 RUBY
                        ...and then they locked me up in 
                        here with you all.

                                 TAMMI
                        Man, I wish I had me a brother like 
                        Cal.

                                 CATHY
                        Sounds like such a good guy.

                                 CARLA
                        I knew Mindy Rote when I lived in 
                        Vegas. I’m pretty sure she ate my 
                        cat.

                                 RUBY
                        Sounds about right.

                                 CARLA
                        So, what are you going to do now?

           A BEAT.

                                 RUBY
                        I really don’t know.

           We hear a DOOR OPEN in the distance, and a guard’s footsteps.

                                 GUARD
                        I’m looking for a Rudy Duncan-

                                 RUBY
                             (calling out)
                        That’s me. I’m Rudy.

           INT. RUBY AND JOSHUA’S BEDROOM

           Ruby steps out of her bridesmaid dress as the shower runs in 
           the background. Joshua sits on the edge of the tub.

                                 RUBY
                        So, how mad was Isabel?
                                 JOSHUA
                        You know like in the end of Alien 
                        when Ripley is trying to throw the 
                        Alien out of the airlock?

                                 RUBY
                        That made the Alien really mad.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Yeah.

                                 RUBY 
                        And how mad are you?

                                 JOSHUA
                        I was pretty mad. 

                                 RUBY
                        But now you’re not?

                                 JOSHUA
                             (calmly)
                        You know, I’ve kept pretty quiet 
                        about all this stuff that’s been 
                        going on with you, but now I’m 
                        going to say my piece and you’re 
                        going to listen.

                                 RUBY
                        Okay, I...

                                 JOSHUA
                        Shhhh. I know you love your sister. 
                        But you can love someone without 
                        them being just like you. Isabel is 
                        her own person. And she’s not like 
                        you. She’s just not. You know who 
                        she’s a lot like? Cal.

                                 RUBY
                        What? No...

                                 JOSHUA
                        Ruby, do you remember what Izzy got 
                        us for our wedding?

           SILENCE

                                 JOSHUA
                        You can talk.

                                 RUBY
                        A vase?
                                 JOSHUA
                        A Chia Pet Bride and Groom.

                                 RUBY
                        She did?

                                 JOSHUA
                        Yes. She eats Bagel Bites for 
                        dinner, Rube. She likes Mork & 
                        Mindy. She buys all her clothes at 
                        Goodwill. She has a sleeve tattoo. 
                        She’s never going to marry some 
                        boring guy. She has her own path. 
                        You have to accept that.

           Ruby lets out a half-laugh, half-cry.

                                 RUBY
                        But I hate accepting things.

                                 JOSHUA
                             (hugging her)
                        I know honey. I know. 

           INT. RUBY’S HOME OFFICE -- LATER

           Ruby tries to type out an apology email to Isabel and Cal.

           DEAR ISABEL AND CAL,

           I AM SO SORRY--

           She erases that.

           I AM A TERRIBLE PERSON--

           Erase.

           I AM SORRY I TRIED TO SHOVE CAL OUT OF THE AIRLOCK.

           EXT. CAL AND ISABEL’S HOUSE

           Ruby rings the doorbell. 

           Isabel peers through the curtains, doesn’t open the door.

           Ruby rings again.

           Finally, Isabel opens it.
                                 ISABEL
                        Yes?

                                 RUBY
                        Hey. I just came to say I’m really 
                        sorry.

                                 ISABEL
                        Well, it’s a little late for that. 
                        Mindy’s in jail here now, and her 
                        parents are refusing to bail her 
                        out.

                                 RUBY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ISABEL
                        And now that I know how you really 
                        feel about us getting married, 
                        don’t worry, you don’t have to be 
                        my maid of honor.

                                 RUBY
                        What?

                                 ISABEL
                        Yeah, Kimmie said she’d do it.

                                 RUBY
                        Kimmie? But she only wears shorts.

                                 ISABEL
                        Yeah, well, I’ll work around it.

                                 RUBY
                        Ugh, no, listen I know I screwed up 
                        but you can’t let Kimmie--

                                 ISABEL
                        Unbelievable. You come over here to 
                        apologize and now you’re lecturing 
                        me again.

           Ruby stops short. Isabel is totally right.

                                 RUBY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ISABEL
                        We’re just going to get married at 
                        City Hall. In three weeks. You can 
                        come if you want. But just don’t 
                        object, okay?
                                 RUBY
                        But I want to pay for--

                                 ISABEL
                        I know you wanted to. But this is 
                        what we can afford, and this way we 
                        can just get it over with before 
                        you do something else to ruin it.

                                 RUBY
                        But--

                                 ISABEL
                        And by the way, Ruby, nobody gives 
                        a fuck about organic food. It’s 
                        probably just regular food that 
                        they put stickers on. And nobody 
                        wants to listen to singer-
                        songwriters. They’re douchey. And 
                        ball-pits are fun. They just are. 
                        And mudslides are delicious and 
                        awesome and you...you suck. 

           She slams the door.

                                 RUBY
                        Well, that went well.

           She turns, and sees Cal Segway-ing towards her.

           She walks down to meet him at the curb.

                                 CAL
                             (polite nod)
                        Ruby.

                                 RUBY
                        Cal.

           She goes in for a hug, but he stiff-arms her.

                                 RUBY
                        Okay, can’t say I blame you.

                                 CAL
                        Look, Ruby, I don’t want to be mad 
                        at you but I made a promise to 
                        myself and to Oprah in my journal 
                        that I would learn to take care of 
                        me and not let people walk on me 
                        anymore just ‘cause I’m a nice guy.
                                 RUBY
                        You are a nice guy. You’re just -- 
                        sometimes you’re weird around me.

                                 CAL
                        Well, that might be true. Maybe I 
                        tried too hard to make you like me. 
                        I don’t know if you know this, but 
                        you can be kind of intimidating.

                                 RUBY
                        Well. I’m sorry. 

                                 CAL
                        I know. 

           Cal looks away.

                                 RUBY
                        Do you think you can forgive me?

                                 CAL
                        I don’t know, Ruby. You did a 
                        really bad thing. I’m just hurt. My 
                        sister, Jesus love her, was always 
                        difficult. I always had to take 
                        care of her. It was a one-way 
                        street. I know I’m naive but I 
                        actually thought that this was 
                        like...destiny...like you were the 
                        sister I was meant to have, like 
                        Luke Skywalker and Leah but without 
                        the part where they kiss.

                                 RUBY
                        Right.

                                 CAL
                        But now I see that you were just 
                        humoring me for Isabel’s sake. And 
                        I can live with that, but I don’t 
                        think you and I can be close 
                        anymore. Call me old fashioned, but 
                        I’m just one of those guys who 
                        still takes “Best Friends” 
                        necklaces seriously. 

           Cal reaches up and unclasps his “Best Friends” half-necklace.  
           He hands it to Ruby.

                                 CAL
                        Goodbye Ruby. 
           Cal puts his helmet under his arm, and rides the Segway up 
           the STEEP DRIVEWAY.

           It’s really, really slow and awkward.

           INT. RUBY AND JOSHUA’S HOUSE

                                 RUBY’S VOICE 
                             (on Isabel’s voicemail)
                        Hey guys, we were gonna play some 
                        Rock Band tonight, if you wanna 
                        come over...

           All ALONE, Ruby sings Alanis Morissette’s “YOU OUGHTTA KNOW.” 
           With no one there to freak her, it just isn’t the same.

           INT. KITCHEN

           Ruby follows the recipe for Cal’s mom’s casserole.

                                 RUBY
                             (on the phone)
                        Hey guys, I know it’s last minute, 
                        but I’m making Cal’s casserole. 
                        Thought you might wanna come 
                        over...

           Strewn over the counters are tuna cans, a package of coconut, 
           hot sauce, shrimp, peanut butter, chocolate chips...

           LATER

           She and Jamie eat the casserole ALONE, taking tiny bites and 
           grimacing.

           INT. OLIVE GARDEN

           Ruby half-heartedly shoves a breadstick into her mouth. She’s 
           at a three-top but she’s all alone.

                                 RUBY
                             (flagging a waiter)
                        Is the rest of my party here yet?

                                 WAITER
                        No, miss.

           She’s surrounded by empty breadstick baskets.
                                 WAITER
                        More breadsticks?

                                 RUBY
                        Yeah, keep ‘em coming.

           INT. JOSHUA AND RUBY’S HOUSE

           The clock reads 3 a.m. 

           Ruby huddles on the couch raptly turning the pages of Cal’s 
           novel, The Terrorist Heart.

                                 RUBY
                             (to herself)
                        No, Ahmed. Don’t get on that plane. 
                        She loves you.

           INT. BAR

           Ruby and Joshua sip wine.

                                 JOSHUA
                             (to Ruby)
                        You are wrong. That guy does not 
                        look like Obama.

                                 RUBY
                        No, he kinda does.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Not at all.

                                 RUBY
                        A little bit.

           INT. AQUARIUM

           Ruby taps the glass on the Axolotl’s tank. He’s all alone in 
           there still.

                                 RUBY
                        Hey buddy, c’mon. Cheer up. Swim 
                        around. 

           On Ruby’s face, as she looks sadder and sadder...
                                 RUBY (V.O.)
                        Boy, do I know how this guy feels, 
                        one minute you’re on top of the 
                        world, swimming around in your 
                        seven miles of endangered habitat, 
                        hanging out with your friends, 
                        being all happy, and the next thing 
                        you know, you’re all alone in a 
                        jar. I mean...

           EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO -- DAY

           Ruby perches morosely on the edge of the duck pond talking to 
           a bunch of kindergartners.

                                 RUBY
                        ...these ducks. Take these ducks 
                        for example. Flying around and yada 
                        yada, so carefree. But guess what, 
                        ducks? It’s not gonna last. 

                             (then, re: the kids)
                        Any of you read The Catcher in the 
                        Rye yet? No, of course not. You’re 
                        like five. Well, in the book, 
                        Holden Caulfield wants to know 
                        where the ducks go when the pond in 
                        Central Park freezes over. And you 
                        know what that is? That’s a 
                        metaphor, guys. Because he really 
                        wants to know what happens to the 
                        good part of people when they 
                        encounter tragedy. Right? Because 
                        Holden’s brother died, and so he’s 
                        worried about his sister, because 
                        what would happen if she died. 
                        Right? So this isn’t a duck pond, 
                        guys, this is a metaphor for the 
                        good part of your life, and it’s 
                        slowly freezing over every single 
                        day...

           A little girl bursts into LOUD SOBS

                                 RUBY
                        I know, man. It is sad. Let it out.

           Sitaraam grabs the mic away from Ruby.

                                 SITARAAM
                        And you know what else guys? 
                        Duckies like to swim! Yay duckies!
           EXT. ZOO PICNIC AREA

           Sitaraam sits next to Ruby.

                                 SITARAAM
                        I see now, so you thought you were 
                        protecting your sister from this 
                        man, but as it turns out, you were 
                        aiding and abetting a fugitive? 

                                 RUBY
                        Yeah. 

                                 SITARAAM
                        I guess I understand. I myself have 
                        seven sisters.

                                 RUBY
                        Seven?

                                 SITARAAM
                        Salita, Jumna, Prabha, Bishu, 
                        Sadhana, Santi, and Carol.

                                 RUBY
                        Does everyone in India have such a 
                        big family? 

                                 SITARAAM
                        I am from Nepal.

                                 RUBY
                        What? I thought you were from 
                        India.

                                 SITARAAM
                        I get that a lot.

                                 RUBY
                        Oh, is that racist? Am I racist?

                                 SITARAAM
                        A little bit, yes.

                                 RUBY
                        So you have seven brothers in law?

                                 SITARAAM
                        Well technically I have six...
                             (beat)
                        ...and one sister in law, but you 
                        didn’t hear that from me. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SITARAAM (cont'd)
                        Carol lives in Belgium where her 
                        love can be free. 

                                 RUBY
                        Ah. And the six brothers in law, 
                        you like them all?

                                 SITARAAM
                        Oh no. They are all very strange. 
                        Soorja wants to be a R&B artist, 
                        Prakash is constantly challenging 
                        everyone to an arm wrestling match, 
                        Suman is short, Boubon is a close 
                        talker, Mohan is narcoleptic, and 
                        Lal, well, Lal I just plain don’t 
                        like.

                                 RUBY
                        So you must hate family functions.

                                 SITARAAM
                        No, I don’t let it get to me. My 
                        sisters love these guys, and I’m 
                        sure they all could say things they 
                        don’t like about me.

                                 RUBY
                        I guess I never thought about what 
                        Cal might not like about me. What’s 
                        something annoying about me?

                                 SITARAAM
                        Oh no. This is a trap.

                                 RUBY
                        I promise not to get mad.

           Sitaraam hesitates.

                                 SITARAAM
                        Okay...he probably finds it 
                        annoying that you have a terrible 
                        singing voice and yet you 
                        frequently sing loudly as if you 
                        are on stage.

                                 RUBY
                        What? No.

                                 SITARAAM
                        Oh yes. And you are always fixing 
                        people’s collars, you think “Rescue 
                        Me” is a good show, you bite your 
                        nails...
                                 RUBY
                        You can stop now.

                                 SITARAAM
                        ...you’re extremely nosy, you think 
                        it’s okay to tell your life story 
                        to total strangers all the time, 
                        and you constantly misuse the word 
                        literally. Do you know how 
                        confusing that is to a non-native 
                        English speaker? 

                                 RUBY
                        I see.

           There is a long BEAT as Ruby takes this all in.

                                 RUBY
                        Oh my god. I’m horrible too. 

                                 SITARAAM
                        We’re all horrible and we’re all 
                        not horrible. We’re just people. 

                                 RUBY
                        You are very wise.

                                 SITARAAM
                        Yes, but more importantly I am very 
                        hungry. Let’s go get some lunch. I 
                        am literally starving.

           Ruby laughs.

                                 RUBY
                             (as they walk away)
                        I still don’t know how to make it 
                        up to Iz and Cal.

                                 SITARAAM
                        I think that, as we say in Nepal, 
                        you are looking for fire while 
                        carrying a lamp.

                                 RUBY
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 SITARAAM
                        It means that you probably already 
                        know the answer to the question you 
                        are asking.
                                 RUBY
                        I do?

           She stops short.

                                 RUBY

                        I do. God, I have got to stop being 
                        such a douchebag.

                                 RUBY
                        How many adults would you say can 
                        fit in the pit at one time?

                                 CLOWN
                        Adults?

                                 RUBY
                        Yes. 

                                 CLOWN
                        Naked adults?

                                 RUBY
                        Um, no. But would that make a 
                        difference?

                                 CLOWN
                        It would for me.

                                 RUBY
                        Right. Are all the ball pits used?
                                 CLOWN
                        I don’t like that term “used”.  
                        It’s so unsexy. Let’s just say they 
                        are all pre-loved.

           The clown gives her a creepy wink.

           Izzy wears a cute but casual white dress. 

           Cal is in a Hawaiian shirt and jeans.

           KIMMIE, 30s, awkward, is in formal dress shorts.

                                 JUDGE
                        All right, let’s get started.

           Isabel and Cal move to the center of the room.  Isabel looks 
           around nervously. Where’s Ruby?

                                 JUDGE
                        Ladies and gentlemen, we are 
                        gathered here today to join these 
                        two citizens in marriage.

           The door CREAKS open and Ruby and Joshua sneak into the back.
                                 JUDGE
                        Isabel Duncan, do you take this man 
                        to be your lawfully wedded husband?

                                 ISABEL
                        I do.

           ANGLE ON RUBY. She tears up. She can’t help it.

                                 JUDGE
                        And do you Cal, take this woman to 
                        be your lawfully wedded wife?

                                 CAL
                        You bet your buttcheeks I do.

                        Before I pronounce these two man 
                        and wife, if there is anyone here 
                        assembled who can present a reason 
                        why these two should not be wed...

                                 RUBY
                        I can.

           A general murmur, and Isabel rounds on Ruby.

                                 ISABEL
                        Ruby! No! You promised.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Wait, Isabel. Hear her out.

                                 ISABEL
                        I don’t want to hear her out. I 
                        love Cal, and I’m going to marry 
                        him. And we’re going to Hawaii.

                                 RUBY
                        And I don’t object.

                                 ISABEL
                        But you just said...

                                 RUBY
                        I just object to you doing it here. 
                        Like this. This wasn’t your dream. 
                        This was your dream.

           She holds up Cal’s puffy-paint journal.
                                 RUBY
                        Look, I know I made terrible awful 
                        mistakes, and I said things that I 
                        can’t take back about Cal. But, 
                        Cal, I want you to know that I 
                        think you’re awesome. I know I said 
                        that you annoyed me, but I think 
                        anyone Isabel said she was marrying 
                        would annoy me, because I’ve always 
                        been her best friend, but now you 
                        get to be her best friend. I was 
                        just afraid that you were taking my 
                        sister away from me. Our family is 
                        so small, so I was terrified. But 
                        now I see that our family isn’t 
                        small at all anymore. It’s really 
                        effing big. And I have a brother 
                        named Biscuit. Which, frankly, 
                        kicks ass.

           She looks around at all of Cal’s brothers, his parents, and 
           Isabel.

                                 RUBY
                        So, if you’ll let me make it up to 
                        you, just follow me outside.

           She exits with Joshua. Isabel hesitates, then takes Cal’s 
           hand and pulls him...

                                 ISABEL
                        Where’s it taking us?

                                 RUBY
                        To your wedding.

           Cal hesitates.
                                 CAL
                        This is the worst surprise ever, 
                        Ruby. 

           A beat. Ruby looks worried.

                                 CAL
                        NOT! It’s the best.

           EXT. RUBY AND JOSHUA’S HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- LATER

           Under a gazebo hung with Rasta-colored streamers, a priest 
           and a psychic healer in a leotard wait.

           All of the friends and family are gathered on the lawn. It’s 
           a proper wedding.

           A TABERNACLE CHOIR hums, then breaks into KANYE WEST’S song 
           TOUCH THE SKY.

           The lead singer isn’t Kanye West -- not even close. Joshua 
           nudges Cal.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Sorry, we couldn’t get Kanye.

                                 CAL
                        Are you kidding? That guy looks 
                        just like him.

           Isabel appears at the end of the aisle in the beautiful 
           wedding dress from Vera Wang.

           Ruby walks behind her with the ferret on a ribbon leash. They 
           reach the front.

                                 PSYCHIC HEALER
                        Who presents this extraordinary 
                        being to be enmeshed into the folds 
                        of matrimony?

                                 RUBY
                             (tearful)
                        I do.

           EXT. BACKYARD -- LATER

           Party guests jump around in the ball pit as waiters in tuxes 
           pass trays of jalapeno poppers and mini-mudslides. A group 
           gathers around a karaoke machine. People wear Rasta hats with 
           attached dreads.
           The prostitutes from Ruby’s cell flirt with some of Cal’s 
           brothers.

           Joshua shows off a pair of pistols to Montana.

                                 JOSHUA
                        I shit you not, Melissa Etheridge 
                        used to own these.

           As Ruby walks by Evan, he grabs her arm.

                                 EVAN
                        Come on, you have to meet Brad’s 
                        mom and sister.

                                 RUBY
                        They’re talking again?

                                 EVAN
                        He says you inspired him.

           Brad stands with his MOM, CLARA and SISTER, HEATHER.

                                 BRAD
                        Ruby, this is my mom, Clara, and my 
                        sister Heather.

                                 RUBY
                        So nice to finally meet you.

           A guy walks up wearing a mustard yellow suit shoving food in 
           his mouth.

                                 BRAD
                             (with a sigh)
                        And this is Michael Hershman.

           He looks Ruby right in the eye and--

                                 MICHAEL HERSHMAN
                        You have nice boobs. 

           EXT. RUBY’S HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- LATER

           Now inside the WEDDING TENT where all the tables are 
           different nationalities, just like Isabel wanted. Isabel and 
           Cal respond to clinking on the glasses with a long KISS.

           Cal stands, raising a beer in a “JUST MARRIED” BEER KOOZIE. 
           There is a ton of clapping as Cal tries to quiet the room.
                                 CAL
                        Well, gosh. We are just so touched 
                        that you all made it out here for 
                        this big night. Big ups to my 
                        sister Mindy, who has been sober 
                        ten whole days.

           ANGLE ON MINDY, sitting with a nurse. She reaches for a glass 
           of wine. The nurse SLAPS her hand away.

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        Shout out to my mom and dad, who is 
                        black. My brothers. Let’s see. My 
                        ferret for keeping it real. And 
                        that’s about it. 

           He starts to sit...

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        NOT! I was kidding. I gotta say a 
                        big hearty thanks to our hosts, 
                        Joshua and Ruby. I came all the way 
                        across the ocean on a donkey to 
                        have sex with your sister, and you 
                        treated me NIIIIIIIICEE! Now enjoy 
                        the rest of night, you bastards.

           More clapping as Cal sits and Ruby grabs the mic.

                                 RUBY
                        Wait, wait. I think we have one 
                        more speech. Yes, you sir. In the 
                        back.

           In the back, near the MAKESHIFT STAGE and dance floor, a man 
           in shorts and a Tommy Bahama shirt stands. For some reason, 
           he has his own CORDLESS MIC.

                                 ISABEL
                             (to Cal)
                        Who’s that?

                                 CAL
                        I don’t know him.

                                 STRANGE GUY
                        You know, folks, there’s nothing 
                        quite like a wedding to remind you 
                        of your own love life, and of the 
                        mistakes you’ve made along the way. 
                        Now, I know that most of you here 
                        don’t know me very well...
           As he talks, musicians begin to take the stage...

                                 STRANGE GUY
                        ...but I’m sort of known for 
                        telling the same sad story about my 
                        love life over and over again.

           He starts to climb up to the stage.

                                 STRANGE GUY
                        And it goes a little something like 
                        this...

           HOLY SHIT! The strange guy is...

                                 JIMMY BUFFET
                             (sings Margaritaville)
                        Nibblin’ on sponge cake
                        Watchin’ the sun bake

           Cal’s head explodes with happiness. Ruby winks at Brad, who 
           gives her a big thumbs up. 

           Cal picks Ruby up and gives her a big kiss on the cheek. Ruby 
           reaches into her purse and pulls out Cal’s half-heart “Best 
           Friend” necklace.

                                 RUBY
                        Cal, will you do me the honor?

                                 CAL
                        Ruby, nothing would make me 
                        happier. Except seeing Jimmy Buffet 
                        live at my own wedding. Which, holy 
                        crap, is happening!

           Everyone hits the dance floor. Ruby sings along. Horribly.

                                 JIMMY BUFFET
                        Wastin’ away again in 
                        Margaritaville...

           Cal takes the floor and starts to do a weird, awkward dance. 
           One of the caterers, standing near Ruby, nudges her.

                                 CATERER
                             (re: Cal)
                        That guy’s kind of a douche, huh?

           Ruby NARROWS HER EYES and turns on the guy.

                                 RUBY
                        What did you say?
                                 CATERER
                        Oh, sorry, no offense, I...

                                 RUBY
                        No, I didn’t hear you. It’s loud in 
                        here.

                                 CATERER
                        Oh, I said that guy’s kind of a 
                        douche, huh?

                                 RUBY
                        Yeah, but what are you gonna do?

           She smiles as she watches Cal freak her sister on the dance 
           floor. It’s far from perfect, but it’s okay as we...

                                                              FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
