           The stuttering THUD of helicopter blades accompanied by the 
           high pitched DRONE of an engine.

           We see a cluster of PIXELS fill the screen. 

           Flickering in black and white is a helicopter’s AERIAL VIEW -

           Bursts of GUNFIRE streak from the rooftop of an 8-story

           A row of armed PALESTINIAN POLICE OFFICERS in dark green 
           uniforms run up against a side wall.

           A YOUNG OFFICER peers around the corner at the courtyard: his 
           PARTNER writhes on the ground, wounded - and fully exposed. 
           The young officer hesitates. Scared.

           A make-shift surveillance vehicle. Painted-over windows. 
           Improvised technology. Three people in headsets hunch in 
           front of monitors. In the center - hemmed in by his 
           Palestinian colleagues - is a lone American, GRANT MATHESON - 
           40s, his former varsity physique soft around the edges from 
           20-plus years of drinking. He barks into his headset.

           A wiry Palestinian woman, 25, in a yellow printed tunic, 
           holding her baby peers into the hallway.

           A dozen ARMED OFFICERS storm their way up the stairwell. She 
           SCREAMS.

           The blurry black figure stops firing. He turns and disappears

           PRE-LAP: The sound of BANGING.

           INT. 5TH FLOOR HALLWAY - RIMAL APT. COMPLEX

           We’re up close with THE SHOOTER: young eyes behind a ski 
           mask, in a red Manchester United soccer shirt and jeans. He 
           clutches a Kalashnikov as he BANGS on locked doors, one after 
           another.

           No one answers.

           He hears the POUNDING of boots approaching in the stairwell. 

           Desperate, he selects a random door. Apartment 501. He SHOOTS 
           open the lock - SPARKS SPLINTER - and RAMS it open. 

           INT. APT 501 - 5TH FLOOR - SIMULTANEOUS

           A half-finished cup of tea sits next to cereal bowls with 
           milk on the table.

           A FAMILY OF FIVE huddles in the corner of their kitchen as 
           the door BURSTS open. They’re terrified. Heaving. Shaking.

           The YOUNGEST BOY breaks off from the family, runs into the 
           coat closet and HIDES.

           INT. 5TH FLOOR HALLWAY - RIMAL APT. COMPLEX

           The officers move swiftly down the hallway, their boots 
           CLATTERING on the concrete. The LEAD OFFICER spots the 
           gunshot-splintered lock on Apartment 501. 

           The clatter stops. They congregate outside the door.

           INT. APT 501 - SIMULTANEOUS

           The man stands there, with the family huddled around him like 
           a shield. The youngest girl begins to WAIL.

                                 SHOOTER

                        Quiet!

           He grabs her tight in front of him, smothering her mouth with 
           his forearm.
           EXT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The Lead Officer lifts up three fingers silently. We can just 
           about hear the TINNY sound of the American barking orders 
           through his headset. 

                                 GRANT
                        Hold! Hold! Check for -

           The man flicks his earpiece out. He counts down. 3 - 2 - 1 -

           CRAAACK! They BURST into the apartment and -

           A STORM OF GUNFIRE. FLASHES. BULLET CASINGS FALL TO THE 
           FLOOR. 

           TINKLE. TINKLE. SILENCE.

           It’s all over in seconds.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COURTYARD - RIMAL APT COMPLEX - LATER

           We pull out, high above, and survey the aftermath. The two 
           wounded officers are carried on stretchers across the 
           courtyard into an ambulance.

           A SECOND AMBULANCE, C105, also branded with a red crescent 
           moon and star, SCREECHES to halt, kicking up dirt.

           From the cloud of dust emerge: RAND DAVID-MAYER - 25, 
           American, clean-cut, in medical uniform, with fresh sutures 
           on his brow - and SIMON RUSSELL (nicknamed STRIKER - we’ll 
           find out why later) - late 30s, British, rumpled, unshaven.

           INT. 5TH FLOOR HALLWAY - RIMAL APT COMPLEX - MOMENTS LATER

           Rand and Striker pass body bags being carried out: two larger 
           ones and a very small one - as Grant curses out the Lead 
           Officer down the hallway.

           Bloody boot-prints lead away from the front door to a red-
           faced Palestinian officer trying to hide his tears. He 
           mumbles something to Striker as he walks by.
           INT. APT 501 - RIMAL APT COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

           A man in a red Manchester United T-shirt is slumped in a 
           crumpled heap against the wall. A young girl is held frozen, 
           trapped in an arm lock in front of him. The Shooter makes 
           WHEEZING, CHOKING noises. He has been shot multiple times in 
           the chest. 

           The girl is silent. Cold. Her hair is matted red.

           Rand tries not to wretch.

           The CORONER’S MEN extract the body of the girl from the man’s 
           grip.

           Striker gestures for Rand to come closer.

                                 STRIKER
                        Look, you can see the cerebellum.

           Rand hesitates. Striker looks at him like he’s a pussy.

           Rand peers around the head of the girl, pulling her hair 
           aside. There’s a 4 inch exit wound in the skull. And surely 
           enough, there it is: the pink, cauliflower-like mass of 
           brain, that Rand had only seen in the pages of books.

           Striker shifts to the face and shines a penlight into the 
           girl’s lifeless eyes.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        See that? 

           Rand notices tiny red pinpoint contusions in the girl’s 
           conjunctiva.

                                 RAND
                        Petechiae. Consistent with 
                        asphyxiation.

           Striker nods with approval. He looks to the red-faced 
           officer.

                                 STRIKER
                        It wasn’t the bullet that did it.

           The girl is taken away and ZIPPED into a small body bag.

           Striker squats near The Shooter examining the bandana that 
           wraps Arabic lettering around his face.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Gaza Martyrs Brigade.
           Rand and Striker exchange a look. Striker pulls up the cloth 
           to look at his face. He’s a young kid. Probably 16.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        You know who lives next door in 
                        502? 

           Rand shrugs.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        An 85 year-old spinster. But he 
                        happened to pick a family of four. 
                        That’s chance for you.

           Rand and Striker stare at the killer for the briefest of 
           moments, taking in the senselessness of it all, before they 
           both snap back into auto-pilot paramedic mode. 

           Rand does some quick tests. He lifts the man’s hand to take a 
           pulse. The man’s right hand is open and bleeding at the 
           knuckles where the police have smashed the gun out of it - 
           the left hand remains clenched shut, in a fist. There’s a 
           weak pulse.

                                 RAND
                        Some sort of motor deficiency. 
                        Muscle spasm? Paralysis?

                                 STRIKER
                        Check his pupils.

           A flashlight illuminates the irises of the killer. Rand tries 
           not to look for very long, as if something might still be 
           lurking there. The dark blot contracts.

                                 RAND
                        There’s brain activity.

                                 LEAD OFFICER
                        Make sure he survives. We’ll need 
                        him for interrogation.

           Rand intubates the man and covers his mouth with a manual 
           ventilator bag. He’s quick, efficient.

           Rand assists Striker as they carefully lift the blood-soaked 
           man onto an unfolded stretcher.

           As they carry The Shooter out. Rand spots a row of sandals 
           arranged along the wall near the front door peppered with 
           bullet casings. 

           Something is not right.
                                 RAND
                        Did you say a family of four?

           He pauses.

           Striker looks at him and sees what Rand sees: a worn black 
           pair of men’s loafers, a larger pair of women’s sandals and 
           THREE pairs of little sandals.

           That’s FIVE.

           Striker freezes for a moment. They lower the stretcher.

                                 STRIKER
                        Everybody quiet.

           He stands in the middle of the room, listening. 

           He slowly walks across the apartment, his eyes trailing a 
           spray of bullet-holes across the wall and across the closet 
           door.

           Striker opens the closet open to reveal: 

           A 5 YEAR-OLD BOY, hiding between coats. Unconscious.

           He has been hit by an errant bullet in his side.

           But he’s still breathing.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Who fucking prepped this place?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RED CRESCENT AMBULANCE C105 - COURTYARD - RIMAL APT 
           COMPLEX - LATER

           WADI, 47, a lanky Palestinian Authority Police Officer, helps 
           Rand mount The Shooter’s stretcher into the ambulance. 
           Striker lays the boy down on the other side of his family’s 
           killer.

           As STRIKER starts to drive, Rand rapidly runs an IV line into 
           the boy’s arm, pushing saline and morphine into his veins. 
           Wadi grabs onto the handrail, getting his balance. 

           Rand turns a dial on the wall connected to a transparent tube 
           and places an oxygen mask over the boy. 

                                 RAND
                        The kid’s stable.

           He does the same for the Shooter.
           The ambulance jounces as Rand begins to cut away the 
           Shooter’s T-shirt and the leg of his jeans to treat the 
           multiple gunshot wounds. 

           Underneath the blood-darkened denim, he finds something 
           curious - another layer: a thick, blood-soaked green cloth, 
           wrapped tightly around the man’s thigh. The blood looks like 
           black ink against the green fabric.

           The Shooter spasms for a moment. His blood pressure is 
           falling.

           Rand stops. The man’s arm is flexing, involuntarily, perhaps. 
           His left fist - still clenched shut - shudders violently.

           Rand pushes it back down, suppressing the convulsion and 
           tries to strap the man’s fist underneath the stretcher belt - 
           but he feels something catch in his grip. 

           He slowly turns the man’s hand in his.

           There’s a WIRE running from his closed fist down into his 
           sleeve...

           ...and down into the wrapping around his thigh.

           Rand freezes. His composure evaporates.

           It’s an IED.

           Rand keeps his hand firmly gripped around the man’s fist. He 
           looks up to Striker in the driver’s seat.

                                 RAND (CONT’D)
                        Striker. Stop the bus.

           Rand begins to hyperventilate. He can’t help it.

                                 STRIKER
                        What? You need to throw up already?

           Unknowing, he chuckles.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        That’s a record. You’ve been here, 
                        what, 48 hours?

                                 RAND
                        Stop the bus. I’m serious.

           Rand begins to shake.

                                 RAND (CONT’D)
                        He has a wire.
           Striker turns around. In a second, the situation lands on his 
           face.

                                 STRIKER
                        Rand, listen to me. Just...keep him 
                        stable. Could be a pressure 
                        trigger. Hold his fist closed.

           Officer Wadi puts the pieces together, terrified.

                                 OFFICER WADI
                        Stop the vehicle! Now!

           Striker keeps driving. 

                                 STRIKER
                        We’re in a densely populated area.

           He passes a market. Beads of sweat bloom across Rand’s 
           forehead. 

                                 OFFICER WADI
                        I need to call for back-up. Let me 
                        off!

           No one responds. Rand’s hands are becoming slick with 
           perspiration. He’s watching the systolic of the man fall. 

           The Shooter’s body shudders.

                                 OFFICER WADI (CONT’D)
                        I have a family. I need to get out!

           Officer Wadi aims his gun at the Shooter’s head. 

                                 OFFICER WADI (CONT’D)
                        Move! 

                                 RAND
                        Listen, his hand has reflexed shut - 
                        him staying alive is the only thing 
                        keeping us from being spread all 
                        over the road.

           Wadi shifts his handgun to Striker.

                                 OFFICER WADI
                        I’m ordering you stop the vehicle.

           Striker doesn’t flinch.

                                 OFFICER WADI (CONT’D)
                        Now!
           He cocks the handgun -

           But the traffic stops the vehicle for him. It’s a red light. 

           Cars idle in front of them and behind them. No one has pulled 
           over for the ambulance. That’s Gaza for you.

           Striker BLARES the SIREN, honks the HORN and FLASHES his 
           lights but there’s no room to squeeze by. A sea of people in 
           vehicles all around them, stopped in traffic.

           Striker grabs the radio.

                                 STRIKER
                        Dispatch, this is C105, we have a 
                        Ten-99. I need a bomb Squad. Gaza 
                        Old Quarter. On Juffair. Ten-99. 
                        Now!

           A white-frocked little girl in the backseat of the car in 
           front stares at Striker through the rear window. She hides 
           her head behind the seat and pops back up again as if to 
           engage Striker in a game.

           Rand glances out through the rear doors as women in abayas 
           cross past the back of ambulance holding plastic bags of 
           groceries; chatting; holding their children; haggling over 
           prices.

           The world is oblivious to how close they are to being 
           obliterated. Possibly seconds away.

           The traffic light seems to spend an eternity on red. Wadi 
           reaches for the rear door of the ambulance...

                                 OFFICER WADI 
                        I’m sorry. I have a family.

           ...and LEAPS OUT into the street.

                                 RAND
                        Take the kid!

           But he’s gone, leaving the wounded boy and the ambulance’s 
           doors open to the road.

           The bustling COMMOTION of the market spills into the tense 
           silence of the ambulance. 

           The light turns green.

           Striker accelerates out of the busy district, the open rear 
           doors FLAPPING about. 
           Medication bottles and plastic syringes fall off shelves and 
           roll past Rand’s feet off the back of the ambulance as the 
           vehicle TEARS through the streets.

           But the Shooter’s fingers begin to twitch. He’s fading. Fast.

                                 RAND (CONT’D)
                        Striker, stop the bus, take the boy 
                        and get out of here.

                                 STRIKER
                        No.

                                 RAND
                        I’m going to let go and try to run 
                        for it. But I need you as far away 
                        as possible, in case -

                                 STRIKER
                        We’re going to get you out of this.

                                 RAND
                        If anything happens, call my 
                        parents.

                                 STRIKER
                        You think I’m going to let you 
                        wreck my ambulance again?

                                 RAND
                        Call them. Their number is on my 
                        form at the clinic. Tell them I’m 
                        sorry I was such a fuck up.

           Striker drives into an empty lot. He stops the ambulance 
           carefully.

                                 STRIKER
                        I’m not leaving you with this 
                        motherfucker.

           Striker jumps through the back doors.

           Rand smiles, sweat - or are they tears? - streaming down his 
           face.

           Striker slowly puts his hands around Rand’s.

           He whispers, gripping tight.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Let me take it. You take the boy.
                                 RAND
                        No.

                                 STRIKER
                        Don’t worry. I have it, just slip 
                        your hands out. We’re going to be 
                        okay.

           Rand looks at Striker. For the first time, Striker’s eyes are 
           clear as he looks straight back at him. Not red, not 
           bloodshot, but calm.

                                 RAND
                        Okay, boss.

           They stand there over the body, hands clasped together, 
           almost like they’re in prayer.

           Just then: the approaching DRONE of heavy engines, SIRENS and 
           tires CRUNCHING over gravel.

           EXT. EMPTY LOT - OLD QUARTER - GAZA CITY - HIGH ANGLE

           Military vehicles pull in around the parked ambulance in a 
           100 foot ring. A man in a heavy kevlar suit lumbers towards 
           the ambulance’s open doors. 

           The BOMB SQUAD has arrived.

           INT. AMBULANCE - SIMULTANEOUS

                                 STRIKER
                        Now light me a cigarette while I 
                        wait for these fuckers to get me 
                        out of this.

           Rand smiles.

                                                                CUT TO:

           TITLE:           THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY

           EXT. OVERHEAD - DELTA CHECKPOINT - NAHAL ‘OZ CROSSING, ISRAEL 
           - MORNING

           We pan down from jet trails in the sky.

           Loud Jordanian pop music. Men and women’s voices argue on 
           Arabic talk radio. The news crackles in Hebrew. 
           A dozen clashing radio stations BLARE out of -

           Cars, jeeps and scooters - a row of them - idling in front of 
           stubborn gray slabs of concrete three stories high, thorned 
           with razor wire. Solid. Impenetrable. Like a dam.

           ISRAELI SOLDIERS - barely out of their teens and armed with 
           assault rifles - pace around a TAXI waiting at the base of 
           the wall.

           EXT. BASE OF THE WALL - DELTA CHECKPOINT - NAHAL ‘OZ 
           CROSSING, ISRAEL - CONTINUOUS

           Inside the taxi, RAND - here, dressed like a tourist and 
           without the scruff that belies his boyish good-looks. He sits 
           next to a duffle bag, shirt-unbuttoned, sweating, looking out 
           at:

           A row of PEDESTRIANS fenced off in a cage leading to an 8-
           foot metal turnstile. Rand’s taxi driver, ADMON, balding, 50, 
           yells out the car window in Hebrew.

                                 ADMON
                        What’s the hold up?

           The pedestrian at the front of the line - a WOMAN in a hijab 
           and dark jeans - won’t let go of her CAMERA. She is SLAMMED 
           in the shoulder with a rifle. Her scarf comes undone 
           revealing her BLONDE HAIR. This is IRIS BERINGER, 33, German, 
           the kind of woman who likes to put up a fight, especially 
           when she can’t use her sex appeal.

           Hesitant at first, Rand jumps out of his idling taxi to help. 
           He runs over to the soldier. BAD idea.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - SPACEMAKER - DELTA CHECKPOINT - 
           MOMENTS LATER

           Rand sits at a table illuminated by harsh fluorescent tubes, 
           one of which blinks incessantly. 

           An oscillating fan in the corner intermittently is aimed at 
           CAPTAIN LIOR - a portly, middle-aged man in an olive green 
           Israeli Defence Force (IDF) uniform.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INSIDE THE MACHINERY OF A HIGH-TECH ID CARD MACHINE (VISUAL 
           ONLY)

           Rollers suck in a rectangle of blue plastic --
                                 CAPTAIN LIOR (V.O.)
                        You were two seconds away from 
                        causing an international incident.

           A silver-brown data strip is rolled onto the card ---

                                 RAND (V.O.)
                        I was trying to prevent the young 
                        lady from getting hurt.

           A laser etches a hologram into the plastic -

                                 CAPTAIN LIOR (V.O.)
                        There are rules, Mr. David-Mayer. 
                        Hamas is targeting photographers, 
                        so you need clearance from the 
                        Ministry of Information. No 
                        clearance. No pictures. It’s for 
                        her own protection.

                                 RAND (V.O.)
                        Of course.

           A tiny nozzle, sweeps back-and-forth across the surface of 
           the card, creating an image - a FACE ---

                                 CAPTAIN LIOR (V.O.)
                        You’re here getting an EMT 
                        certification from the Red Cross?

                                 RAND (V.O.)
                        I guess that’s what it says on the 
                        form. What’s this?

           The nozzle prints a birth date: “7-11-80”, a country of 
           origin “USA” and a stream of digits --

                                 CAPTAIN LIOR (V.O.)
                        It’s a waiver. To ensure that you 
                        are aware of the all the risks and 
                        that you, your family or your State 
                        Department will not hold Israel 
                        accountable if you are shot or 
                        bombed or otherwise injured.

           A wafer-thin sheet of acrylic FUSES to the surface of the 
           card.

                                 CAPTAIN LIOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        This is a big liability for us 
                        especially with someone like you.
           The ID card - with Rand’s photo - pops out of the machine.

                                                                CUT TO:

                        Once you cross, we will treat you 
                        like any other Palestinian. Your 
                        connections are useless beyond this 
                        point. Don’t try any stunts.

           EXT. DELTA CHECKPOINT - NAHAL ‘OZ CROSSING, ISRAEL - LATER

           A mirror sweeps under a vehicle.

           The mud-encrusted axle of a car reflects into it.

           Sand-caked fingernails examine Rand’s shiny blue ID in the 
           sunlight. The hologram morphs over his boyish face.

           The trunk slams shut.

                                 CHECKPOINT SOLDIER
                        Clear!

           The soldier BANGS on the side of the taxi as his PARTNER 
           hands the transit ID through the rear window to Rand.

           Sitting beside him is Iris - even with the sunburn, the 
           unkempt hair, the unsmiling poker face, she’s still 
           astonishingly beautiful - her hardened eyes hide something 
           soulful. 

                                 RAND
                        I got your film back.

           She takes the spool from Rand without saying thanks.

                                 RAND (CONT’D)
                        What’s it for?

                                 IRIS
                        A photo essay. On Palestinian 
                        Christians for National Geographic.

           The soldiers step aside as the sliding steel door in the wall 
           GRINDS open, SHUDDERING on its tracks, REVEALING --
           GAZA, PALESTINE - CONTINUOUS

           The light is the same, but the world is completely different.

           INT./EXT. TAXI - HIGHWAY 25

           Angry graffiti and half-torn photos of men and women plaster 
           the other side of the giant wall - a massive collage of 
           graduation pictures and family portraits - posters of the 
           missing and the dead. Iris CLICKS.

           Rand catches the last sliver of Israel disappear as the metal 
           gate BOOM shut behind them, when -

           THUD - he is thrown to the right side of the taxi, his body 
           SLAMS against the door. Iris tumbles into him. The taxi SKIDS 
           and swerves as a battered pick-up loaded with young 
           PALESTINIAN MEN speeds by, horn BLARING, flatbed CLANGING.

           The taxi driver curses out the window as Rand and Iris 
           awkwardly EXTRICATE themselves from one another.

                                 RAND
                        You ok?

           A long, awkward silence. Two suppressed smiles. The tension 
           palpable as Iris lets her guard down for just a moment -

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. ROOM 32 - DIPLOMAT HOTEL

           Two tangled bodies slam against the yellowing wallpaper, 
           still prying one another out of their sweaty clothes. Hands 
           through hair. Snapping buttons. Bumping teeth.

           And before they realize it, they’re naked. They pause. Iris 
           and Rand look at one another - and for a moment, contemplate 
           the bizarreness of the situation - before continuing to 
           devour each other, laughing.

           INT. ROOM 32 - DIPLOMAT HOTEL - MORNING

           Light filters through the yellow curtains. A woman’s shoulder 
           rests in frame. A hand reaches over.

                                 RAND
                        I’m late.

                                 IRIS
                        So go.
                                 RAND
                        When do I see you again?

                                 IRIS
                        I was horny. We fucked. That was 
                        it.

                                 RAND
                        Is that how you greet all the new 
                        guys?

                                 IRIS
                        Just the pretty ones.

                                 RAND
                        Thanks.

           She starts to collect her clothes, throwing the hotel soap on 
           the bedside into her bag. Coming across the roll of film Rand 
           retrieved for her -

                                 IRIS
                        I didn’t need you to save me.

            She UNFURLS it - EXPOSING it to the light.

                                 IRIS (CONT’D)
                        It’s a dummy roll. A decoy.

           She hunts down her left sneaker. Flipping out her swiss army 
           knife, she plies the SOLE from it, revealing - in a space 
           CARVED into the rubber - three hidden rolls of film.

                                 IRIS (CONT’D)
                        Learned that trick from a bodyguard 
                        in Kosovo.

           Rand is speechless.

                                 IRIS (CONT’D)
                        Later, rookie. 

           And with that, she’s gone, leaving Rand blindsided.

           INT. DIPLOMAT HOTEL - MINUTES LATER

           A squat, 1960’s-style building clad in time-blackened 
           limestone slabs and fat pillars wrapped in what look like 
           little blue swimming pool tiles. At some point, this was a 
           decent hotel.

           The lobby consists of a television playing CNN, encircled by 
           a few fraying red and yellow arm chairs from the ‘70s.
           The RECEPTIONIST, a creaky Filipino man, fills out some 
           paperwork as Rand impatiently taps against the chipped 
           formica counter.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Your taxi will be here in a minute.

           GRANT MATHESON - the American we met earlier in the make-
           shift surveillance vehicle - comes up alongside Rand. He 
           tries to strike up a conversation.

                                 GRANT
                        What are you in for?

                                 RAND
                        Red Crescent. I’m a trainee medic.

                                 GRANT
                        Wait.

           He pauses for a moment, picking up the accent.

                                 GRANT (CONT’D)
                        New York?

                                 RAND
                        Yes.

                                 GRANT
                        No fucking way! I’m from Brooklyn. 
                        Former NYPD. Now I’m a consultant 
                        for the State Department. We’re 
                        trying to train the Palestinian 
                        Police farce.

                                 RAND
                        Farce?

                                 GRANT
                        Their motto: shoot first, look 
                        later. Wouldn’t survive a day in 
                        NYC without a lawsuit. 

           They shake hands.

                                 GRANT (CONT’D)
                        Grant Matheson.

                                 RAND
                        Rand David-Mayer.

                                 GRANT
                        David-Mayer like the Lester David-
                        Mayer?
                                 RAND
                        Yes.

                                 GRANT
                        No kidding.

           An awkward moment.

                                 GRANT (CONT’D)
                        Trauma junkie, eh?

                                 RAND
                        I guess I’ll find out.

                                 GRANT
                        Trying for med school?

                                 RAND
                        Trying.

                                 GRANT
                        I’m sure your Dad could pull some 
                        strings, eh?

           The comment drops like a lead balloon. Rand doesn’t respond.

                                 GRANT (CONT’D)
                        Well, no kind of experience like 
                        Palestine. It’s a shit show, 
                        alright.

           The taxi horn BLARES outside.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RED CRESCENT CLINIC/ HABARA ELEMENTARY - DAYR AL BALAH - 
           GAZA - LATER

           A man in a green jumpsuit scrapes the carcass of a dead 
           animal into a bag. It looks like the corpse of a dog.

           Rand steps out of the taxi. In front of him: 

           A utilitarian, single-story building with a slightly 
           whimsical 1970’s Corbusier look. The walls are white-washed 
           concrete with rusty pink and baby blue metal shapes on the 
           window railings. A faded and pock-marked Mickey and Minnie 
           Mouse fresco out front.

           The building is actually an old, bombed out elementary 
           school, reclaimed as a medical clinic.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. NONDESCRIPT OFFICE - RED CRESCENT CLINIC

           A camera FLASH goes off.

           Rand stands in front of a white wall. He blinks.

           Rand’s thumb in an inkpad.

           A hand presses his fingers onto a red and white form.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - RED CRESCENT CLINIC - MOMENTS LATER

           An old classroom with wooden benches and lockers. Everything 
           is small and low, designed for 10 year-olds. There’s a 
           blackboard on the wall with a weekly duty schedule and a list 
           of names - one of them is Rand’s. 

           NADIA CHABBANI, 33, an attractive Lebanese woman with a 
           tightly-wound pony tail and French-tinged accent hands him a 
           thick photocopied guide book.

                                 NADIA
                        This is your lifeline. It’s got a 
                        list of precautions and phone 
                        numbers for foreigners, social 
                        protocol, regulations, that sort of 
                        thing. And you’ll need this -

           She pulls out a green bullet-proof flak vest from a metal 
           cabinet. 

           There’s a large red cross taped to the back of the vest in 
           red masking tape. It looks less like a logo and more like a 
           target.

                                 NADIA (CONT’D)
                        You’re with bus number 108 in the 
                        bay. We hooked you up with Striker 
                        since he speaks English too. He’ll 
                        be signing the ledger for your 
                        certification.

           She starts to leave and then stops and turns.

                                 NADIA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t let him get to you.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - RED CRESCENT CLINIC - MOMENTS LATER

           A baby’s CRY percolates through the dirty white-tiled walls.
           Rand takes off his watch and winds it ten hours forward.

           He hunches to see himself in the kids-height mirror, 
           straightening his new uniform - black slacks, white shirt, a 
           Red Crescent band on the sleeve. He clips his Red Crescent 
           ID, complete with photo and thumbprint, to his pocket.

           EXT. AMBULANCE BAY - RED CRESCENT CLINIC - CONTINUOUS

           Two medics, KHALEED, 23, shaved head and RAFIQ, 35, short, 
           with a goatee, slouch in yellowed plastic chairs watching a 
           nubile young woman gyrate in an Egyptian pop video. 

           A cat stops in its tracks as Rand scans the semi-enclosed 
           loading dock.

           Three relatively modern ambulances - all donated by different 
           European nations. Their Red Cross signs have been painted 
           over with the Red Crescent logo but the inverted Dutch, 
           French and German lettering are still visible underneath. 

           One of the vehicles has its rear doors open -

           INT. AMBULANCE C108 - AMBULANCE BAY - RED CRESCENT CLINIC

           A needle pierces the rubber cap of a small jar containing a 
           clear liquid marked “Insulin”.

           We pull back. A man’s puffy eyes are focused intently on his 
           task. Crow’s feet show years of wear. He kneels on the floor 
           of the ambulance, a lit cigarette in his mouth. 

           He glances up at the clean-cut American in the doorway.

           This man - we encountered him earlier at the building 
           shooting - is the chain-smoker known as STRIKER from the box 
           of Lucky Strikes permanently affixed inside his shirt pocket.

           He returns his attention to the drooping Palestinian woman of 
           55 in front of him, slipping out the needle and swabbing her 
           arm with an alcohol wipe.

           As the woman hobbles away, Rand extends his hand out to the 
           gruff, unshaven man in front of him. 

                                 RAND
                        Striker, yes? I’m your new partner, 
                        Rand.

           He notices that Striker’s eyes are red. Like he’s high, but 
           not on life.
                                 STRIKER
                        My new partner was supposed to be 
                        here 15 minutes ago.

           Striker takes off his rubber gloves and puts them, together 
           with the empty glass jar, in Rand’s hand.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Incinerator bin’s over there.

           Suddenly, a jerry-rigged loudspeaker in the corner of the 
           ambulance bay SQUAWKS to life: 

                                 FEMALE VOICE
                        Attention. C-108. Urgent dispatch. 
                        We have a Ten-56A. Khan Yunis. 55 
                        Budaiya Road. 

           Striker quickly shuts the interior cabinets.

           The speaker SQUAWKS again.

           Striker SLAMS the rear ambulance doors, the large painted 
           crescent and the ambulance number stopping inches from Rand’s 
           face.

                                 STRIKER (O.S.)
                        Why are you just standing there? 
                        You want me to run you over? 
                        Because I will.

           INT. AMBULANCE C108 - AMBULANCE BAY - MOMENTS LATER

           A large crack spiderwebs across the windshield from the 
           passenger side. It’s from a rock or maybe a bullet.

           Striker huffs as Rand scrambles into the passenger seat, 
           fumbling to put on his flak jacket and seat belt.

                                 STRIKER
                        They taught you what the ‘E’ stands 
                        for in E.M.T., right?

           A/C roaring, Striker turns on the siren, hits the accelerator 
           and SQUEALS through the rusty gate into the street. 

           INT./EXT. AMBULANCE C108 - ROAD - DAYR AL BALAH - CONTINUOUS

           They drive in silence as Striker chain smokes with one arm 
           dangling out the window.
                                 STRIKER
                        Pass me that tape.

           Striker gestures to the area between the seats. Rand shuffles 
           through several cassette tapes stacked between empty water 
           bottles, papers and a bedpan used as an ash-tray.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        The red one.

           Rand pulls out a red tape scrawled “POWERSLAVE.”

           Striker pops the tape in, hits PLAY. The tape HISSES. The 
           music starts with vaguely Egyptian rock chords...

                                 RAND
                        So how long have you been here?

           ...but then the electric guitars hit...its IRON MAIDEN.

                                 RAND (CONT’D)
                        I had one of these albums when I 
                        was a kid - the one with the zombie-

           Abruptly - Striker clicks off the cassette.

                                 STRIKER
                        If you’re going to keep 
                        interrupting my music, why don’t 
                        you sing me a song.

           Rand looks at Striker to make sure he’s being serious. He is.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, go ahead. What music do you 
                        like?

           Rand struggles desperately to think of some music he might 
           have in common with Striker.

                                 RAND
                        Um, I like hard rock, like AC/DC...

                                 STRIKER
                        What about show tunes?

                                 RAND
                        Sure.

                                 STRIKER
                        Like what?
                                 RAND
                        Um, my mother used to sing me 
                        “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” when I 
                        was a kid.

           Striker slips into what seems like reverie.

                                 STRIKER
                        Sing it for me now. Go on, just 
                        like your mother used to.

           Rand hesitates, embarrassed.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got your ledger right here. 
                        “Communication skills.” Don’t make 
                        me give you a zero.

           Striker’s not kidding. This is a test. Rand clears his throat-

                                 RAND
                        “Somewhere over the rainbow, way up 
                        high...”

                                 STRIKER
                        C’mon, louder! Like you really mean 
                        it!

           Striker flips on the loudspeaker with the back of his hand.

                                 RAND
                        “There’s a land that I heard of 
                        once in a lullaby...”

           Unbeknownst to Rand, his little musical revue is being 
           broadcast, not only back to the clinic but to the entire 
           world outside.

                                 RAND (CONT’D)
                        “Some-where over the rain-bow, 
                        skies are blue...”

           His shaking voice blasts out of the loudspeakers, drifting 
           over arid, dusty streets that have barely ever seen rain, let 
           alone a rainbow.

                                 RAND (CONT’D)
                        “And the dreams that you dare to 
                        dream, really do come true...”

           Outside, a group of Palestinian police officers laugh from 
           behind a roadblock, a kid stops to stare, a woman shakes her 
           head. It dawns on Rand, but noting Striker’s amusement, he 
           ploughs ahead with his song - 
           As abruptly as he started - Striker flips off the mic.

                                 STRIKER
                        Karaoke’s over, kid.

           He ejects the red tape, flips it over and pops it back in. 

           Iron Maiden once again BANGS through the speakers. No one 
           speaks. 

           Striker nods towards the passing wreckage of a bombed-out 
           building collapsed in on itself, it’s lobby now a garden of 
           weeds.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got to be able to come home 
                        from a place like that, after an 
                        attack, and be able to wipe off 
                        whatever the fuck’s on your boots 
                        without a second thought. You ready 
                        for that?

           Rand ponders the notion.

                                 RAND
                        I don’t know.

                                 STRIKER
                        You ‘don’t know’?

           A beat.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Then get the fuck out of my 
                        ambulance.

           He literally stops the ambulance - right there - in the 
           middle of the road.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Get out.

           A stand-off. Rand doesn’t budge.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Good. Then say “Yes, Boss.” And 
                        start by taking that thing off - 
                        you look like a tourist.

           Rand looks at his flak jacket.

                                 RAND
                        This? It’s a precaution.
                                 STRIKER
                        It shows people you’re afraid of 
                        them. 

           Striker looks directly at Rand.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        They’re military issue. People kill 
                        for them. What do you think is more 
                        valuable to a jihadi? Your life or 
                        your flak jacket? 

                                 RAND
                        What did you do with yours?

                                 STRIKER
                        I sold it. And bought something 
                        much more handy. Look under your 
                        seat.

           Rand runs his hand along the underside of the seat. Velcro-
           ed, underneath is cold metal. He pulls it out - a HANDLE.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        It’s a modified 9 millimeter Soviet 
                        pistol.

           Striker un-velcroes something from under his seat. It’s the 
           CHAMBER.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Breaks away into two halves with 
                        just a pin.

           He snaps the pistol together in an instant, grinning.

                                 RAND
                        We’re an aid vehicle. We can’t 
                        carry weapons.

                                 STRIKER
                        Yeah? Let the guy sitting in Geneva 
                        who typed that up come tell that to 
                        me in person.

           He snatches Rand’s protocol handbook and FRISBEES it out the 
           window.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Lesson number one: You aren’t a 
                        real medic until you learn to fuck 
                        the rules. You got to make some 
                        hard choices. Take some risks. Live 
                        on the edge.
           Striker gestures to a duct-taped patch in the side door.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        You see that? That’s how the last 
                        one went.

           Rand runs his hand across it. There’s torn metal underneath.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Now, he was a good medic.

                                 RAND
                        The last one?

                                 STRIKER
                        Yeah. Bullet. Popliteal artery.

                                 RAND
                        Who shot him?

                                 STRIKER
                        Israeli, Palestinian, it doesn’t 
                        matter once the bullet is in you.

           Striker snickers.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Although, if you actually look at 
                        the bullet, it’s usually Russian or 
                        American.

                                 RAND
                        Arterial trauma? Did he survive?

                                 STRIKER
                        Nope. Took me four fucking hours to 
                        clean up the mess.

           Striker impulsively hits the accelerator.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Take off your seat belt.

                                 RAND
                        Why?

                                 STRIKER
                        What? You scared?

                                 RAND
                        No.

           Rand UNCLICKS.
                                 STRIKER
                        You ready to roll?

                                 RAND
                        Yes, boss.

           Striker turns the ambulance to the left slightly and then a 
           SHARP right, like the ambulance is out of control. 

           And then he JERKS the wheel into a HARD LEFT. 

           The tires SCREECH. Two of them LIFT OFF THE ASPHALT. Bottles 
           and equipment CLINK and CLANG in the back. Rubber BURNS. 

           Rand almost smashes his head on the glass. He grabs onto the 
           armrest.

           The ambulance TIPS further. It leans over almost 45 degrees. 
           This is insane.

           Striker LAUGHS. He kisses his hand and stretches it out the 
           window, reaching for the asphalt as the vehicle totters... 

           And for a second, Striker drives on two wheels before the 
           ambulance THUDS back flat again. 

           It’s an impressive, reckless stunt. Rand is stunned.

                                 Striker
                        Scared now?

           Rand, gripping the safety handle above him, fumbles to get 
           his seat belt back on.

           Smoke curls out of Striker’s nostrils.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Want out yet?

                                 RAND
                        You’re not getting rid of me that 
                        easily.

           Striker snorts. He stubs his cigarette out into a steel 
           bedpan between the seats.

                                 STRIKER
                        Look, this is the one moment of the 
                        day before everything goes to shit. 
                        Let me enjoy the rest if it.

           He turns up the music ear-piercingly LOUD.
           The ambulance drives on, BLARING the song “Powerslave.”  Rand 
           looks out as the barren Palestinian landscape slides past his 
           window.

           INT./EXT. AMBULANCE C108 - BUDAIYA ROAD - KHAN YUNIS - LATER 

           The ambulance jerks up to the gate of a white 3-story 
           concrete apartment building with a semi-enclosed courtyard. 
           Clothes hang from wrought iron balcony railings. A/C units 
           drip condensate down the walls in green and brown streaks.

                                 STRIKER
                        This is a Ten-56 “A”. You know what 
                        that is?

           Rand shakes his head.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Suicide attempt. In progress. Could 
                        get messy.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. APT 3 - APT BLOCK - 55 BUDAIYA RD - KHAN YUNIS - MINUTES 
           LATER

           GABRIEL, 13, brandishes a butcher’s knife. Swinging it wildly 
           in the center of the living room.

                                 GABRIEL
                        Get away from me!

           He SWIPES at Rand, barely missing.

                                 RAND
                        Shouldn’t we call a psychologist?

                                 STRIKER
                        You think we have shrinks on call? 
                        You’re it. Go.

           Rand steps forward cautiously, just out of swinging distance.

                                 RAND
                        Hi, I’m Rand. What’s your name.

                                 GABRIEL
                        Gabriel.

                                 RAND
                        That’s a nice name. Like the Angel.
                                 JAFFER
                        Fuck you.

                                 RAND
                        Okay, Gabriel, I need you to put 
                        down the knife so we can talk.

           Gabriel SPITS on his face. 

           Rand is repulsed, the phlegm dripping off his eyebrow.

                                 STRIKER
                        I’ll radio the coroner - you want 
                        to get some towels?

           Rand turns back to the kid, wiping his face with his sleeve.

                                 RAND
                        Listen -

                                 GABRIEL
                        Please go!

                                 STRIKER
                        Gabriel, just do it. We’ve got 
                        people waiting for us who actually 
                        want to live. Just. Do it.

                                 GABRIEL
                        Fine.

           He pushes the knife against his wrist. His MOTHER SCREAMS.

                                 RAND
                             (Whispering to Striker)
                        What are you doing? 
                            (To Gabriel)
                        Hey! Don’t listen to him!

                                 STRIKER
                        Don’t do it like that, kid. 
                        Everyone always cuts perpendicular 
                        to the wrist. But nine times out of 
                        ten that’ll just cause some 
                        scarring and make a big mess. And I 
                        just cleaned the ambulance so help 
                        me out a bit.

           Gabriel looks at him confused. The PARENTS, shocked.
                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Look, if you do it properly, the 
                        two of us can go home because 
                        picking up the dead is the 
                        coroner’s job. But if you fuck it 
                        up, you’re stuck with us. So I just 
                        want you to do it right. 

           He draws a line up his arm with his finger.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        The artery is here. Gimme that - 
                        let me show you.

           Gabriel holds steady with the knife, not about to let it go.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        You know what? Use this. Much 
                        cleaner.

           He pulls out his PISTOL from his belt and demonstrates that 
           it has a couple of bullets in the chamber.

           Striker places the nozzle against his temple.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)

                        Because if you’re anything like me, 
                        you’ve got a pretty thick skull and 
                        the bullet will probably get lodged 
                        in your brain and then you’ll be a 
                        vegetable. The most effective way 
                        is like this.

           He sticks the gun in his mouth aimed upwards.

                        Here, take it. This will be much

           The kid moves over to Striker to get the gun.

           But Striker uses the opportunity to - LUNGE at Gabriel and 
           GRAB HIM in a HEAD LOCK.

                                 GABRIEL
                        Ooww!

           The gun falls to the floor. Rand grabs it!

           The mother SHRIEKS.

           Striker plies the knife out of Gabriel’s hand.

                                 STRIKER
                        You’re about the age my son would 
                        have been. Be thankful you’re 
                        alive.

           Striker holds the struggling, thrashing kid. As the boy’s 
           shirt loosens, he notices a set of bruises and belt lashes on 
           his back and neck.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)

           The kid slackens. He doesn’t answer. His father looks away.

                        Yeah, and nice talk you were giving

           SAMI, a middle-aged man who is sweating profusely, leads them 
           up a flight of stairs.

           They stop at Number 31, a door with an embroidered Qu’ranic 
           verse outside:

           “God has ordained everything to a divine plan and only God 
           can accomplish it. 65: 2-3”

           Striker shakes his head and starts to open the apartment door 
           when -

           Suddenly heavy-set woman, HAFIDA, SCREAMING in Arabic SLAMS 
           hard on the other side.

                        No! No! No! They cannot see her! 

           She bolts the chain to the other side of the door.

                             (in Arabic)

                        Move away from the door, madam.

           Both Striker and Sami PUSH their weight against the door. 

           The door doesn’t budge.

           Rand puts down the folding stretcher and joins them.

           A modestly appointed family drawing room lit with fluorescent 
           tube lights. A large picture of the Qab’aa hangs above 
           souvenir monuments in a glass case. 

           A small dog runs around, BARKING in a frenzy.

                        her, she’s orthodox.

           Hafida, wearing a blood-stained floral tunic RUSHES Striker.

           Sami slips off his shoes and pads rapidly through the room in 
           his socks. Striker stomps through.

           Rand follows more cautiously, adjusting to the space, trying 
           not to grind dirt from his boots into the rug.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           A pile of dark red stained towels on the square-tiled floor. 
           The grout is stained maroon, a grid of blood zig-zags out 
           from -

           A 17 year-old girl, DAREEN.

           She lies on her back, moaning. Her eyes clenched in pain. The 
           girl’s tunic is sodden with blood. 

           An orange pan lies in a corner with bloodied dish towels, 
           utensils and thick twisted hanger wire.

           Striker pauses when he sees her. A flicker of recognition - 
           something.

           Striker kneels near Dareen and starts to check her vitals. 
           She SCREAMS and writhes, not wanting to be touched by him.

           He rolls out his medic bag. White rubber gloves. SNAP. SNAP. 
           Pulse. Pupils. Breathing.
           He’s smooth, like clockwork.

           He pulls scissors from his kit and begins to cut away her 
           tunic. Striker pulls away the cloth. Dareen SCREAMS. 

           The sight of her bloodied groin is horrific. 

           Striker doesn’t blink. Rand steps back, nauseous.

                        Prep a bandage. Vulvar trauma. 
                        She’s hemorrhaging.

           He looks at Hafida, lifting up the wire.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        You used this?

           He snaps his fingers at Rand. But Rand is frozen.

                        Bandage!

           Rand stares. Queasy. Nervous. Blank.

                        It’s in the bag!

           Snapping back, Rand fumbles through his medic bag, pulling 
           out a stream of gauze. It’s a tangled mess, like him. 

           He hands it to Striker who glares at him. 

           Striker presses the bandages into place.

                                 SAMI
                        You must fix her here.

           Striker stands, his hands bloody, looking at Sami coolly.

                                 STRIKER
                        She needs a surgeon within the next 
                        two hours or she’s gone. You

           Rand tries to close the doors, but Sami has his hands on the 
           door. He won’t let go.

           Not about to wait another second, Striker hits the gas. 

           Rand plies Sami’s fingers from the door frame and pushes him 
           away before slamming the doors shut, leaving his lone figure

           With the tube ready, he tries to open her mouth with his 
           hands but it’s clenched shut. 

           He tries to pry her jaw open with a wooden spatula, it 
           doesn’t budge.

                                 RAND
                        Her jaw is locked!

                                 STRIKER
                        Figure it out. Break her teeth if 
                        you have to.

           Rummaging around, Rand grabs a small metal hammer from the 
           tool drawer. He looks at Dareen’s face.

           He can’t.

           Rand steps back. This is too much.

           He tries to pry her mouth open one more time using the 
           spatula. 

           Luckily, it GIVES. The opening is just enough to get the 
           catheter in, but Rand can’t quite see the chords in the back 
           of her throat.

           He FORCES the tube in. A foot of clear tubing goes down.

           He pumps the respirator bag. Dareen’s stomach PUFFS UP. The 
           systolic numbers on the monitor FALL FURTHER.

                                 RAND
                        What’s happening? Her stomach is 
                        inflating.

                                 STRIKER
                        You sent it down the wrong pipe! 
                        Take it out. Look closer for the 
                        trachea.

           Fuck. Rand pulls out the tube.
           He inserts the tube again and tries to get it down the 
           windpipe but it won’t go any further than a few inches. The 
           numbers are still falling.

                                 RAND
                        I can’t do this! We’re moving too 
                        much.

                                 STRIKER
                        I’m driving. You have to.

                                 RAND
                        Her chords have seized up.

                                 STRIKER
                        Get the tube in!

                                 RAND
                        They’re seized shut! How do I get 
                        them open?

                                 STRIKER
                        You have to figure it out!

                                 RAND
                        I can’t get a look at the back of 
                        her throat.

           Rand looks up at the monitor. Dareen’s stats are falling 
           steeply.

                                 RAND (CONT’D)
                        Striker, she’s 50 over 35. She’s 
                        going to asystole in a couple of 
                        minutes.

                                 STRIKER
                        You’re a fucking amateur.

           Striker slows down the ambulance and pulls over. He moves 
           into the back.

           Rand tries to hand over the apparatus to Striker.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        You get to decide whether she lives 
                        or dies. Now put the tube in.

           Striker shoves the tubes back into Rand’s hands.

                                 RAND
                        I’m sorry. You do it!
                                 STRIKER
                        No. Get ready.

                                 RAND
                        We’re going to lose her.

                                 STRIKER
                        Just calm the fuck down and listen 
                        to me!

           Rand takes a deep breath and positions the apparatus, ready 
           to push.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Now wait.

                                 RAND
                        But she’s going asystole. Striker 
                        you have to do this. I can’t!

                                 STRIKER
                        Listen to me. Wait.

           Rand looks at him like he’s crazy.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Wait for the verge.

           Dareen is 40 over 20. Inches away from death. Color drains 
           from her face.

                                 RAND
                        What if I miss?

                                 STRIKER
                        Hold on. Her body will start to 
                        shut down and then -

           The body heaves -

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        NOW!

           Dareen’s throat GASPS OPEN and Rand shoves the tube in, all 
           the way down. He PUMPS the bag, pushing - 

           a RUSH of air into her lungs.

           Suddenly, the numbers on the monitor pause. They go into 
           REVERSE.

           Rand exhales, flushed. Relieved. Exhausted. Exhilarated.

           Still pumping the bag, he looks up at Striker, eyes wide. 
           Striker looks back without even the faintest glimmer of 
           approval. He takes over the respirator.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Now drive, you amateur.

           INT./EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE GAZA CITY - MINUTES LATER

           The ambulance roars through a trash-strewn street, past 
           rickety furniture stores and fruit stands. There’s too much 
           outbound traffic.

                                 STRIKER
                        What are you doing?

                                 RAND
                        I’m trying to get through.

                                 STRIKER
                        We’re a fucking ambulance. Get on 
                        the other side of the road!

                                 RAND
                        There are cars coming...

                                 STRIKER
                        Get over - NOW.

           Rand SWERVES across the median. The oncoming traffic is 
           light, but no one stops or pulls over despite the WAILING  
           SIREN and flashing lights. Vehicles simply dodge the 
           ambulance and whizz by. 

           A truck screams past them, HONKING loudly, less than a foot 
           away.

                                 RAND
                        Jesus!

           Rand drives by his bare knuckles. It’s a roller coaster.

           Three TEENAGE BOYS run carelessly across the street in front 
           of him - Rand HONKS and SWERVES - narrowly missing them - the 
           ambulance LURCHES to the side.

                                 STRIKER
                        Are you trying to kill her?

                                 RAND
                        I’m sorry!
                                 STRIKER
                        Listen, if you’re going more than 
                        70 kilometers per hour, you have to 
                        keep your turn radius less than 45 
                        degrees. Or we’ll flip.

                                 RAND
                        I’m trying!

                                 STRIKER
                        You see that red rubber band on the 
                        steering wheel? If it’s ever on 
                        top, it’s too far.

                                 RAND
                        Got it.

           Rand looks at the red rubber band. He takes a deep breath.

           INT. AMBULANCE C108 - GATE A - EREZ CROSSING, GAZA - MINUTES 
           LATER

           Through the windshield, an imposing graffiti-covered wall - 
           made of meter-wide concrete slabs - looms into view.

                                 STRIKER
                        Left!

           Rand turns wide, carefully. He looks back over his shoulder 
           at Striker.

                                 RAND
                        How’s she doing?

                                 STRIKER
                        We got an hour, maybe less.

           On the right side of the windshield, the walls slide past, 
           covered with anti-Israeli and Palestinian Liberation Front 
           inscriptions.

           Bouncing over a small rise, the menacing barbed wire and 
           concrete barricades of the Erez Crossing Gate come into view.

           Between him and the gate is a long line of idling cars.  

           He SLAMS on the brakes.

           Striker looks up from Dareen.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Jump the line!  Do it!
           Rand hastily pulls onto the edge of the road, rolling past 
           the line of vehicles.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Drive!

           Rand speeds up, WEAVING through a maze of stopped cars and 
           concrete barriers.

           Less than thirty meters from the gate, an Israeli Defense 
           Force (IDF) soldier, SAMUEL - not more than 20, dressed in an 
           olive green uniform, clutching an assault rifle - steps out 
           to block his path.

                                 RAND
                        What if they don’t let us through?

                                 STRIKER
                        Don’t worry. I give this guy Moshe 
                        his painkillers. He has a thing for 
                        oxycodone.

           Rand pulls up to the soldier and rolls down his window.

                                 RAND
                        Sir -

                                 SAMUEL
                        ID, please.

                                 STRIKER
                             (to Rand)
                        In the visor.

           He flips down the visor and sees Striker’s ID wedged into the 
           elastic holding strap next to a picture of:

           A smiling YOUNG BOY, 6, with a GERMAN SHEPHERD PUPPY. 

           The resemblance between the boy’s face and Striker’s ID photo 
           is unmistakable.

           He presents his and Striker’s IDs to the soldier. 

           Samuel swishes a blue UV flashlight over the cards to 
           illuminate the embedded hologram.

           He examines them for a moment, taking his time.

                                 SAMUEL
                        And your patient?

           Rand produces Dareen’s orange ID.
           Without even touching it, the soldier shakes his head.

                                 SAMUEL (CONT’D)
                        No blue, no pass.

                                 RAND
                        Officer, she’s critical.

                                 STRIKER
                        Go get Moshe.

           Striker sticks his head into the front of the ambulance. He’s 
           cool and calm.

                                 SAMUEL
                        There’s no Moshe today.

                                 STRIKER
                        Moshe knows me and he can tell you -

                                 SAMUEL
                        Moshe was reassigned. Please do a U-
                        turn.

           Striker looks winded.

                                 STRIKER
                        What?

           Samuel BANGS his hand on the hood.

                                 SAMUEL
                        Turn around now.

                                 STRIKER
                             (to Rand)
                        Get us out of here.

                                 RAND
                             (to Samuel)
                        Look, we have a young girl with 
                        internal bleeding. We have less 
                        than an hour of blood left.

           Samuel looks at Rand sternly.

                                 SAMUEL
                        Listen, no orange IDs. Don’t make 
                        my supervisor come over. Turn 
                        around. Or step outside.

           Striker RAPS on the roof of the back of the ambulance.
                                 STRIKER
                             (to Rand)
                        Forget it. Let’s go!

           Noticing the situation, another older, armed IDF SOLDIER, 
           swaggers out of the guard post. 

                                 SOLDIER
                        Get out of the vehicle!

                                 RAND
                        Sir, listen, I’m an American. 
                        Please, she’s critical.

           Samuel LOWERS his gun to firing position -

                                 STRIKER
                        Officer, my apologies, we’re 
                        leaving! 
                                 (to Rand)
                        Drive! Who the fuck do you think 
                        you are: Rambo Junior? 

           Rand snatches back the IDs and rolls up the window. He turns 
           the ambulance around.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        You think they’ll hesitate to put a 
                        bullet through your head?

           EXT. EREZ CROSSING - GAZA SIDE - CONTINUOUS

           Rand drives the ambulance back down the row of cars.

                                 RAND
                        What do we do now?

           Striker looks at the blood bag - it’s three-quarters empty.

                                 STRIKER
                        Now we take her to the clinic and 
                        watch her die. And I eat my lunch.

                                 RAND
                        Isn’t there somewhere else we can 
                        take her?

           Rand stares ahead, already exhausted.

                                 STRIKER
                        The nearest place this side of the 
                        wall is an M.S.F. tent an hour 
                        away. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STRIKER (CONT'D)
                        They don’t have the doctors or 
                        equipment to save her. She’ll be 
                        there for a couple hours, drain a 
                        couple blood packs and then she’ll 
                        asystole. That’s how it’s going to 
                        happen.

           Striker is still pumping away at the respirator bag.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        The first one’s hard but you’ll get 
                        over it. They tell you all this 
                        crap about how you can feel the 
                        soul leaving the body when someone 
                        passes, but you don’t. It’s a lie. 
                        There’s nothing. People close their 
                        eyes and they get cold. That’s it. 
                                   (a beat) 
                        Lesson Number Four: A good medic 
                        doesn’t get too attached to his 
                        patients. 

           Rand, angry and frustrated, shakes his head.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t forget we’re just flesh and 
                        bone and genes. We’re born, we 
                        grow, we fuck, we die. Don’t ever 
                        pretend there’s anything more. Gets 
                        in the way of proper judgment.

           Striker looks at the Dareen’s body on the stretcher.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Barzilai in Ashkelon is the only 
                        place with a surgery equipped for 
                        something like this.

                                 RAND
                        There’s got to be a way of getting 
                        around them.

                                 STRIKER
                        Not with an orange ID.

           Striker gives him a look as if he’s about to say something 
           but stops himself.

                                 RAND
                        What?

                                 STRIKER
                        Forget it. Let’s head back to the 
                        clinic.
                                 RAND
                        No, tell me.

                                 STRIKER
                        There is a man I used to know in 
                        Rafah, near the Egyptian border. 
                        But I don’t think it’s safe for 
                        you.

                                 RAND
                        What does he do?

                                 STRIKER
                        He has some unofficial connections 
                        at the IDF - under the table.

                                 RAND
                        Whatever it takes.

           Rand looks at Striker, there’s a spark in his eyes.

                                 RAND (CONT’D)
                        Let’s do it.

           Striker stubs out his cigarette against the wall.

                                 STRIKER
                        You’re the boss.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT./EXT. AMBULANCE C108 - OUTSKIRTS OF RAFAH/ NEAR EGYPTIAN 
           BORDER - GAZA

           The landscape changes as the ambulance peals down the road.  
           Paved roads give way to asphalt shredded by tank treads. 

           The ambulance passes shuttered stores; decapitated minarets; 
           abandoned construction projects; burned out carcasses of 
           vehicles left in the street.

                                 STRIKER
                        Don’t come here alone unless you 
                        want to be next week’s propaganda.

           INT./EXT. AMBULANCE C108 - RAFAH/ NEAR EGYPTIAN BORDER - GAZA

           A dozen stray dogs start to BARK at the ambulance as it 
           enters a run-down housing compound. 

           A rusty Toyota pick-up transporting refrigerators rattles 
           past them.
           The walls are covered with graffiti: “Fatah is Fraud” and 
           “End Zionist Oppression.”

           Images of masked martyrs silk-screened onto green and red 
           fabrics hang over balconies and boundary walls. 

           A YOUNG BOY wearing a skullcap is tying down one of these 
           banners with sand-filled plastic bottles. 

           EXT. HYDER’S COMPOUND - RAFAH - CONTINUOUS

           Rand hesitantly gets out of the vehicle, following Striker. 
           He cautiously surveys the area.

           A group of TEENS kicking around their football in the dirt 
           stop to stare at the American. Rand tries not to make eye 
           contact.

           In front of them: A large bungalow sits amidst a cluster of 
           dusty tented structures. Outside are TWO GUARDS, with 
           keffiyehs wrapped around their heads - a pair of Kalashnikovs 
           in their shadows.

           Striker nods to the guards. They seem to recognize him. 

           The guards look Rand up and down.

                                 STRIKER
                             (in Arabic)
                        He is a friend.

           They FRISK both of them. GUARD #1 swipes an old airport wand 
           in front of and behind them. It BEEPS at Rand’s belt buckle.

           The guard looks at it more closely. It’s a designer belt. 
           Calvin Klein. Shiny. New.

           He makes a gesture for Rand to remove it.

           Rand looks at Striker. Striker shrugs. He unbuckles and hands 
           the belt over. The guard confiscates it.

                                 GUARD
                        Yalla! Go!

           The gates open.

           INT. HYDER’S BUNGALOW - MOMENTS LATER

           Rand and Striker follow a few paces behind a bespectacled 
           man, ISMAIL - 40, with the quiet demeanor of an academic. 
           They pass a small line of people in the vestibule, waiting 
           for goods and supplies. It’s clear that Hyder is the local 
           Godfather.

                                 STRIKER
                             (whispering to Rand)
                        Ismail is the Number Two here.

           Rand spies a boy, JAMIL, 7, peering out of an archway. He has 
           his fingers in his mouth, the other on the trigger of an 
           orange plastic pistol. He looks directly at Rand. The boy 
           grins and pulls the trigger - CLICK! He giggles.

           A severe-looking MAN, 50, in an immaculately pressed cream 
           dishdasha appears from around the corner and scoops up the 
           BOY. This is HYDER MALIKI.

                                 HYDER
                             (to Striker)
                        Salaam! Welcome, welcome.

           Hyder and Striker kiss each other on both cheeks.

                                 HYDER (CONT’D)
                        You should have told me you were 
                        bringing guests.

           He gives Rand a look down.

                                 HYDER (CONT’D)
                        This is the new one?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - HYDER’S BUNGALOW - MOMENTS LATER

           A well appointed drawing room, garishly furnished.

                                 HYDER
                        Chai? Pepsi?

                                 STRIKER
                        No, Hyder, we’re in a rush.

                                 HYDER
                        You don’t visit me for so long and 
                        straight to business!

           Tea arrives on a plastic, patterned tray. Hyder lets Jamil 
           off his knee and pats him away.

                                 HYDER (CONT’D)
                        One sugar?

           Striker nods. Hyder looks over to Rand. 
                                 RAND
                        No thank you.

           Eyebrows raised, Striker gives Rand a silent look. Rand gets 
           it: he gestures for a single sugar.

           Hyder puts the sugar into the tea cups, but for his own he 
           takes out a plastic container of CANDEREL, a diabetic 
           sweetener.

                                 STRIKER
                        My friend needs an ID for his 
                        patient.

                                 HYDER
                        Of course, for you, anything. You 
                        have the original ID? 

           Rand pulls it out.

                                 HYDER (CONT’D)
                        You know what they say in Arabic? 
                        Eed wihdeh ma bit zakkif. One hand 
                        cannot clap.

           He looks intensely at Rand.

                                 HYDER (CONT’D)
                        You understand?

           Rand is silent.

                                 HYDER (CONT’D)
                        Yalla, it’s time for my shot, let 
                        me give you a moment to think.

           Hyder gets up and disappears into an adjacent room.

                                 RAND
                        What does he mean?

                                 STRIKER
                        He’s going to offer you a barter, 
                        don’t refuse.

                                 RAND
                        What do I have to do?

                                 STRIKER
                        He’ll ask you to take something 
                        across.

                                 RAND
                        What?
                                 STRIKER
                        Not anything dangerous. 
                        Merchandise. It’s harmless. You’re 
                        just the delivery man.

                                 RAND
                        I don’t know, Striker.

                                 STRIKER
                        I risked a lot bringing you here 
                        because I thought you had it in 
                        you.

           Rand hesitates.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Remember, you decide if Dareen 
                        lives or dies. Think about the 
                        patient, not yourself.

           Close on Rand. The choice burns away at him. 

           Taking a deep breath -- he takes the plunge.

                                 RAND
                        Ok. Let’s do this.

           INT. HALLWAY - HYDER’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS

           Hyder leads Rand and Striker down a hallway. Rand glances at 
           a woman making tea in the kitchen behind beaded curtains.

           They come to a large wooden trapdoor in the floor. Hyder 
           signals for Ismail to open it, revealing a set of stairs 
           going down to a basement.

           INT. BASEMENT - HYDER’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS

           At the bottom of the stairs, a sandy, cavernous room with raw 
           concrete walls, construction-site sodium lights and a pulley 
           hanging from the middle of the ceiling.

           Two MEN, 20s - dressed much like the guards from earlier - 
           stack various goods from a ladder in an 8-foot hole in the 
           floor onto wooden palettes: plastic petrol containers; baby 
           formula; A/C units; fridges; stereos. 

           MADE IN EGYPT is stenciled on the crates.

                                 STRIKER
                             (whispering to Rand)
                        This our lifeline.
           A narrow HALLWAY leads off to -

           ANOTHER ROOM

           It’s a makeshift command center:

           Computer monitors, scanners, printers; high-tech equipment 
           all covered in a layer of fine tunnel dust. HEBREW voices 
           crackle from a hacked radio frequency.

           Hyder gestures for the pass from Rand and gives it to TOUFIQ.

                                 HYDER
                             (smiling at Rand)
                        Same machines as the IDF.

           Toufiq places the card on a scanner.

           CLOSE on Dareen’s FACE printing onto the plastic on the same 
           ID-maker from the beginning of the film.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - HYDER’S BUNGALOW - MINUTES LATER

           Rand turns the blue ID over in his hand watching the Israeli 
           hologram morph over her face. It’s perfect - a masterful 
           replica complete with Dareen’s photo and information.

           Baba approaches, carrying two large cling-wrapped packets 
           which he puts in Rand’s hands - through the plastic, we can 
           see HUNDREDS OF SMALL WHITE PILLS.

                                 STRIKER
                        Who is working the Erez gate today?

           Hyder pulls out a thick brown envelope and hands it to 
           Striker.

                                 HYDER
                        Jacob.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AMBULANCE C108 - RAFAH - MOMENTS LATER

           Striker and Rand cut open the packets with a scalpel and 
           empty the contents onto a metal tray.

           Hundreds of small yellow and white pills embossed with 
           symbols tumble out. 
           They both stare at them for a moment. It’s MDMA. Smuggled 
           from Egypt for Israel, the hub of the world’s ecstacy market.

                                 HYDER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Put them in medicine containers and 
                        nobody will ask any questions.
                        You will drop them off at Zanzi-Bar 
                        in Ashkelon.

           Striker begins to roll up a piece of paper into a cone.

                                 HYDER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        This man will give you a packet for 
                        Jacob for your return trip and 
                        payment for me. Then we’ll get some 
                        supplies and things for the 
                        children.

           Rand, conflicted, looks at Dareen on the stretcher breathing 
           through the tubes. A tinge of blue curls around her lips.

           He takes the cone and begins funneling the pills into a 
           bottle.

           INT. AMBULANCE C108 - SALAHUDEEN HIGHWAY - LATER

           Rand drives with Striker in the back, their fragile load 
           jostling on the stretcher.

           The ecstacy pills are neatly shelved in plain sight in orange 
           prescription bottles.

           EXT. EREZ CROSSING CHECKPOINT - MINUTES LATER

           Rand approaches the drop bar.

                                 RAND
                        What if they realize it’s a fake? 
                        They’re going to deport me and 
                        arrest you.

                                 STRIKER
                        Welcome to adventure.

           They pull up.

                                 CHECKPOINT SOLDIER
                        IDs.

                                 RAND
                        Sir, is Jacob here?
           The soldier yells to a MAN in the booth.

           JACOB - 32, aviator sunglasses, eating a sandwich - 
           approaches and looks into the vehicle.

           Rand hands over all three of their IDs, sandwiching Dareen’s 
           in the middle. 

                                 JACOB
                             (to the soldier)
                        Gabi, go check the back.

           The assistant walks around the ambulance and opens up the 
           rear doors.

           The soldier scans their faces. Striker stands poker-faced 
           over Dareen on the stretcher. 

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        Papers?

           Rand hands over some medical documents, the BROWN CASH 
           ENVELOPE folded inside.

           Jacob tears a corner off the envelope and fans through the 
           bills. He puts it inside his military jacket.

                                 GABI (O.S.)
                        Clear on visual. You want me to do 
                        a manual check?

                                 JACOB
                        It’s okay. They’re clean.

           Rand smiles nervously at Jacob, resisting the urge to slam on 
           the accelerator as the ambulance rolls across the threshold.

           INT./EXT. AMBULANCE C108 - RURAL ISRAEL - LATER

           Rand stares ahead. They pass olive groves and sand-blown 
           hills as the sun sets on this biblical land.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. AMBULANCE BAY - BARZILAI HOSPITAL - ASHKELON, ISRAEL

           Dareen is rapidly wheeled out of the ambulance and through 
           the automatic glass doors of the hospital to safety.

           For a brief moment, Striker puts his hand on Rand shoulder.
                                 STRIKER
                        We did it. Your first save.

           Rand shrugs it off and retreats into the ambulance.

           INT. AMBULANCE C108 - CONTINUOUS

           Rand sits on the bench twisting the safety cap of the 
           medicine container. CLICK...CLICK...CLICK...

           For a moment he just listens to the noise, staring blankly. 

           Striker opens up the rear door.

                                 STRIKER
                        Look, no one loses. The suppliers 
                        are happy, the IDF gets their 
                        share, the people who get it are 
                        getting what they want, and we’re 
                        saving lives. It’s a win-win game. 
                        Let’s go.

           Close on Rand and the look in his eyes. CLICK.

           EXT. ZANZI-BAR CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           A seedy combination bar-restaurant-nightclub heralded by a 
           dirty neon sign.

           Rand and Striker approach a BOUNCER outside.

                                 STRIKER
                        We have a delivery for Yosef from 
                        Hyder.

           Through the crack, Rand can see restaurant tables and an 
           older man sitting at a table eating with a family.

           The man, YOSEF, comes to the door, wiping his hands on his 
           napkin, shutting the door behind him.

                                 YOSEF
                        Come.

           INT. BASEMENT - ZANZI-BAR CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           The brash, tacky, dirtiness of a nightclub before the lights 
           are dimmed. An empty, scuffed dance floor. Chipped mirrors on 
           the walls. A stage lined with red and pink neon strips.

           Techno-music plays quietly. 
           It’s early and the place is empty except for two off-duty 
           olive-uniformed IDF OFFICERS at the bar, sitting between a 
           rail-thin RUSSIAN GIRL and an AFRICAN GIRL, in tube tops. 
           Neither is much older than 18. They look high.

           Yosef, Rand and Striker go into a SIDE ROOM -

           Rand pulls out the pill bottles.

           Yosef summons an INDIAN MAN. A helper. They empty out the 
           pills onto a steel tray. It’s a weighing scale.

           Yosef wets his finger on his tongue, touches a random pill 
           and licks it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The WHIR of a mechanical CASH counter. Dollars fan through 
           and land in a neat vertical stack in the tray.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Cash is stapled into wads of equal denomination.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Josef stacks the money in the bottom of a green and red Magen 
           David Adom (the Israeli ambulance service) ORGAN TRANSPORTER 
           CASE. They place packets of ice on top.

                                 YOSEF
                        Get to the checkpoint before the 
                        shift change at 7 pm. Find Ari.

           INT. AMBULANCE C108 - LATER

           Rand stands at the small metal sink in the back of the 
           ambulance, the organ transporter case at his feet. 

           He washes his hands of the fine white powder from the pills. 
           He scrubs hard, his face distorted in the stainless steel 
           mirror.

           EXT. EREZ CROSSING CHECKPOINT - ISRAELI SIDE - EVENING

           Moths FLUTTER around sodium lights as Israeli flags FLAP over 
           cammo-netting and massive concrete reinforcements holding up 
           coils of prison-like concertina wire.

           An olive-uniformed IDF SOLDIER stands at the ambulance 
           window.
                                 RAND
                        Captain Ari?

                                                                CUT TO:

           Ari opens up the back doors. 

           A thick brown envelope sits on the stretcher. 

           Looking back up at the gaurd tower, Ari does his due 
           diligence, LOUDLY opening and closing the cabinet doors. He 
           looks at the Magen David Adom organ transporter case wedged 
           under the stretcher.

           Rand looks over his shoulder from the driver’s seat. Ari 
           nods.

           He stuffs the envelope into his jacket and SLAMS the back 
           doors.

                                 ARI
                        Clear!

           EXT. SALAHUDEEN HIGHWAY - OUTSIDE GAZA CITY - LATER

           Palm trees silhouetted against the purpling sky.

           Somewhere, far away, a minaret SINGS the Qu’ran, interrupted 
           by the staccato CHOPPING of a hovering gunship. 

                                 STRIKER
                        It’s curfew. We have to go inside. 
                        My place is close.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STRIKER’S APARTMENT - AL QUBBAH - OUTSIDE GAZA CITY

           Striker unlocks the door, a SCRATCHING NOISE coming from the 
           other side. A shaggy GERMAN SHEPHERD bounds out, excitedly 
           licking Striker and pacing back and forth. 

           It’s the dog from the photo in the visor, though much older. 
           Curiously, the dog WHEEZES and WHOOPS hoarsely, but doesn’t 
           bark.

           The dog sniffs Rand.

                                 RAND
                        Is he ok? He sounds sick.
                                 STRIKER
                        He’s fine. His chords are cut. 

           Off Rand’s quizzical look -

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        He barked too much.

           Rand tries to suppress his shock.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        If they hear a dog barking on the 
                        road when they’re on patrol at 
                        night, they shoot it.

           The dog jumps on Rand.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, he’s friendly. 

           Striker begins to unbutton the cuffs on his blood-stained 
           shirt.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        The municipality claim the dogs are 
                        spreading rabies and eat the dead 
                        after bombings.

           Rand lets the dog lick his hand.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        But it’s really just to shut them 
                        up because their barking is an 
                        early warning for the IDF raids. 
                        Hamas has hundreds of dogs.

                                 RAND
                        What’s his name?

                                 STRIKER
                        Simba. It’s from the Lion King.

                                 RAND
                        The Disney movie?

                                 STRIKER
                        My son named him.

           Striker disappears into the bathroom to change.

           Rand scans the room. He is surprised by the size of the 
           apartment. It’s a cramped studio - spare, almost unfurnished. 
           Plain off-white walls. No pictures, except for:
           A framed photograph on a desk in the corner: Striker, a 
           Palestinian woman, an 8 year-old girl and the BOY from the 
           visor photo smiling against a painted backdrop of clouds.

           But there’s ANOTHER picture on the table - a SECOND family, 
           Striker - probably ten years younger here - with his arm 
           around an attractive red-haired woman. Behind them, a semi-
           detached house in the East End of LONDON.

           Rand hears the sink RUNNING in the bathroom.

           He lifts a book from the desk. There’s a diagram with various 
           components circled. The books all appear to be about 
           mechanical and electrical engineering. 

           The top drawer is open a crack. Rand pulls it open slightly:

           Pills. Syringes. Lots of them. Rand reads the labels: 
           “Valium.” “Oxycodone.” Painkillers. 

           Tucked underneath the half-empty pill bottles is an un-mailed 
           letter - old and worn around the edges, but sealed. Rand 
           carefully pulls it out and flips it over. It is addressed to: 
           “Emma Russell” in London. 

           As Rand slides the envelope back, something cold and metal 
           catches his hand at the back of the drawer -

           It’s another GUN - a 9mm Browning embossed with a crown and 
           lion insignia and the inscription: “PROPERTY OF THE BRITISH 
           ARMY.”

           Rand picks it up. Suddenly -

           Striker is standing behind him, drying his face in a towel 
           and holding a leather belt.

           Startled, Rand puts the gun down. He can’t read Striker’s 
           poker face.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        I see you’ve discovered my small 
                        project.

           Striker closes the opened books.

                                 RAND
                        I was just -

                                 STRIKER
                        And you don’t know much about guns 
                        do you?

           Striker slams the drawer SHUT.
                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        When you picked it up, your finger 
                        went right to the trigger.

           He picks up the weapon.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        When you hold a firearm, you always 
                        make sure the finger is outside the 
                        trigger guard. 

           He holds the pistol in his palm.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        It’s not like in the movies. You 
                        never put your finger on the 
                        trigger.

           He points the gun at Rand’s foot and COCKS the gun. 

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Until -

           Rand takes a step back. What is he playing at?

           He pulls the trigger. Rand flinches. CLICK!

           Striker laughs.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        That’s the only time you pull the 
                        trigger: when you’re ready.

                                 RAND
                        Get that thing away from me.

           He hands Rand the belt he is holding.

                                 STRIKER
                        Here. Sorry it’s not Calvin Klein.

           Rand starts to put it on.

                                 RAND
                        You were in the armed forces?

                                 STRIKER
                        Medical unit. Operation Granby, 

           (Granby = the British designation for Operation Desert Storm)

           Striker takes out something from a cupboard, wrapped in 
           cloth.
                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Here, you can put this on the belt.

           He tosses a brown leather medical pouch onto the chair.

                                 RAND
                        Really?

           Rand opens it up; it has two sets of medical scissors, a 
           thermometer, dissecting forceps, a pen flashlight and an 
           empty syringe.

                                 STRIKER
                        It’s old. I don’t need it.

                                 RAND
                        This is a really nice set.

           Rand admires the pouch in his hands. It’s military issue. He 
           clicks the flashlight on.

                                 RAND (CONT’D)
                        No, I can’t take it.

                                 STRIKER
                        You don’t have one. Just take it. 
                        Why are you always refusing?

           Rand starts to unclip the pouch from his belt. Striker stops 
           him, putting his hand over Rand’s.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        I want you to keep it. I don’t have 
                        anyone else to give it to.

           A beat.

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER

           Rand’s eyes flicker open on the sofa: the HALLWAY, sideways.

           Striker sits on a stool down the hallway. He’s holding a thin 
           hardback book in his hand. His hands cupped around the phone 
           dangling from the wall, he whispers into the yellow handset, 
           in an almost sing-song voice.

           He’s reading a children’s book to someone, ever so softly.

           Striker gently replaces the handset. He takes a moment before 
           returning to the living room.
           Striker lays down on the mattress in a sarcophagus pose. 
           Quietly, he straps a tourniquet around his arm and INJECTS 
           himself with a clear liquid. Instantly, he relaxes, lets go.

                                 RAND
                        What’s that?

                                 STRIKER
                        Keeps the ghosts away.

           He CLICKS the lamp off.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HYDER’S BUNGALOW - RAFAH - MORNING

           HYDER counts the cash in the Magen David Adom organ case: ten 
           thousand in American bills. 

           He’s satisfied. 

           He peels off a few bills and gives them to Striker. 

           Rand refuses, but Hyder pushes the money into his hand.

                                 HYDER
                        We just got in some supplies for 
                        the district.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HYDER’S COMPOUND - MINUTES LATER

           They load up several LARGE CARDBOARD BOXES of assorted goods 
           into the back of the ambulance.

           Striker sets aside a CD-Radio on the seat next to him.

           EXT. RAFAH NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER

           The Mediterranean sea sparkles through the haze on the 
           horizon. Paved streets give way to dirt roads. 

           They drive silently through the dusty wreckage of Rafah: 
           decapitated palm trees; piles of uncollected garbage; pools 
           of standing water in the alleys.

                                 STRIKER
                        The aid trucks are too afraid to 
                        come here. 

           The ambulance pulls up to an empty intersection and parks. 
           Striker turns the siren dial to an alternate tone.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        You want to do it?

           Rand presses the siren button. After a few BLEATS, Striker 
           switches it off. 

           Silence.

           All of a sudden, out of doorways and alleys emerge: CHILDREN, 
           WOMEN in abayas, and MEN in dirty athletic wear and wife-
           beaters. They rush towards the ambulance.

           It’s like an ice cream truck.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Rand TEARS open boxes, pulling out blankets, baby formula, 
           batteries, flashlights, toys. Eyes look up to him, some old 
           and wrinkled, some wide-eyed and young, some hidden behind 
           veils. People reach out, holding out babies, grabbing. Needy. 
           Desperate. Hopeful.

           Rand’s AMPED. It’s a rush. 

           INT. AMBUALANCE C108 - DAYR AL-BALAH - LATER

           Iron Maiden BLARES from the speakers as the ambulance cruises 
           down the road.

           Rand looks at the CD-Radio on the floor.

                                 RAND
                        Who’s that for?

                                 STRIKER
                        My ‘wife’.

           A beat.

                                 RAND
                        Where is she?

                                 STRIKER
                        She lives outside Gaza City.

           Striker turns up the Iron Maiden as if to indicate the 
           conversation is over.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. DIPLOMAT HOTEL -  GAZA CITY - LATER

           The ambulance pulls up to Rand’s hotel.

                                 STRIKER
                        Get some rest. We have a dialysis 
                        run at 1600. 

           He makes a shushing gesture with his finger and lips.

           INT. DIPLOMAT HOTEL - AFTERNOON - MOMENTS LATER

           Rand walks into the lobby to find a small gathering in the 
           lounge. Young men and women, mainly European, drink colored 
           juices and talk animatedly. French POP MUSIC plays from a 
           stereo.

           It’s a weekend NGO mixer.

           Grant waves to Rand and summons the bartender.

                                 GRANT
                        You have a choice of tomato juice 
                        from a can; Coke, which tastes 
                        great by the way - they use real 
                        sugar - or orange juice that tastes 
                        like camel’s ass.

           He winks at him, pulling out a stainless steel flask from his 
           hip pocket.

                                 GRANT (CONT’D)
                        But I carry a bit of that-which-
                        shall-not-be-named.

           He chuckles. He takes a swig of his drink and smacks it on 
           the bar. 

                                 GRANT (CONT’D)
                        You look like you could do with 
                        some sleep.

                                 RAND
                        Yeah. It’s been a long 36 hours - 
                        but I feel amazingly awake.

                                 GRANT
                        Well, if you ever need some (wink, 
                        wink), I got plenty in my room. 
                        (whispering) Got some movies too. 
                        Travel three thousand miles, and 
                        what do you find? Bootleg DVDs of 
                        pussy from the valley.
           He laughs and smacks Rand on the shoulder, but Rand is 
           distracted:

           He spies Iris in the corner, holding a large portfolio case, 
           chatting up a bearded MAN with a PRESS lanyard. She winks -

           Rand approaches her as the man leaves to get a drink. 

                                 RAND
                        Is that the new conquest?

                                 IRIS
                        Did you get your gold star for 
                        ‘making a difference’?

                                 RAND
                        I didn’t expect to see you back 
                        here.

                                 IRIS
                        Well, with the circus in town for 
                        the Secretary of State’s visit next 
                        week, looks like I’m out of a room. 

           A beat. Iris has this planned. She turns on the charm.

                                 IRIS (CONT’D)
                        Would the Good Samaritan take in a 
                        roommate?

                                 RAND
                        As long as you’re okay sleeping on 
                        the floor.

                                 IRIS
                        And who said chivalry was dead?

           Off Iris’s grin - 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ROOM 32 - DIPLOMAT HOTEL - LATER

           Iris’s portfolio photographs are spread all over the bed: a 
           woman holds up a glinting cross to an approaching tank; ashes 
           fall like snow around a young girl; a single bedouin 
           traverses a vast rocky overpass -- if there’s a theme, it’s 
           people defiant, courageous, on their own.

           Iris holds up a 4 by 5 inch negative against the window.
                                 IRIS (CONT’D)
                        Church of the Nativity. That’s 
                        where Jesus was born. It’s just 
                        hidden away - 

           Rand leans in and squints at the image: a lone man 
           momentarily caught by a shaft of sunlight as he kneels in a 
           cavity under a floor - a guard with a machine gun just in 
           frame behind him.

                                 IRIS (CONT’D)
                        See that silver star? That’s the 
                        spot.

           Rand moves in closer, his lips brushing the curve of her ear.

           Iris almost flinches - she’s usually in control of this game. 
           It has been a long time since she has actually been 
           interested - but there’s something about our rookie’s un-
           jaded innocence and his newfound audacity... 

           A beat. What the hell, they’ll always have Gaza. She kisses 
           him back.

                                 IRIS (CONT’D)
                        You’re sleeping on the floor.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. ROADSIDE - KEFAR DAROM - GAZA - 1630

           The glaring sunlight of the afternoon. Rand and Striker have 
           just started their dialysis run.

                                 STRIKER
                        They’re already overdue a couple of 
                        days. Careful, they’re weak - and 
                        crabby.

           A skinny man, KAMAL, 60, sits on the side of the road in a 
           plastic lawn chair clutching a tattered instrument case.

           The ambulance pulls up beside him. Rand leaps out and 
           attempts to support him as he creaks to his feet, but Kamal 
           slaps his hand away.

                                 KAMAL
                             (in Arabic)
                        I can do it myself.

           Kamal places his case inside the ambulance and clambers in.
           INT. AMBULANCE C108 - AL BURAYI - GAZA - LATER

           Striker drives.  Rand rides passenger. There are now FIVE 
           pale-looking patients crammed into the back.

                                 STRIKER
                        One more stop. 

           EXT. APT COMPLEX - AL BURAYI - LATER

           Striker emerges carrying RANA, a tiny elderly woman, in his 
           arms. He carefully winds down the staircase that wraps around 
           the outside of the building. 

           Rand pops open the rear door of the ambulance.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. EREZ CROSSING CHECKPOINT - GAZA SIDE - LATER

           Jacob is on duty. Rand gives him a mock salute and a grin but 
           he doesn’t smile back.

                                 RAND
                        We have six dialysis patients. 

           Jacob nods.

                                 JACOB
                        Okay. IDs?

                                 RAND
                        We came through yesterday.

                                 JACOB
                        Yesterday was yesterday. 

                                 RAND
                        They can’t go any longer without 
                        their dialysis.

                                 JACOB
                        You want me to let you through 
                        without the right papers?

           Incredulous, Rand reaches into his pocket for his wallet, 
           pulling out the bills from yesterday’s encounter with Hyder.

           Glancing behind him, Jacob leans in close.

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        Put that back. The Lieutenant is 
                        here.
           He takes a step back and gestures with his rifle. Rand 
           realizes he has just driven into Jacob’s theater piece for 
           the day.

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        Everybody out!

                                                                CUT TO:

           The rear door of the ambulance. Rand beckons the six patients 
           to exit.

           As they clamber down, a scowling second officer, LT. HERZL 
           stares suspiciously at Kamal’s instrument case.

                                 LT. HERZL
                        What’s that for?

           Kamal stares blankly at Herzl. He opens the case to reveal a 
           time-worn violin.

                                 STRIKER
                        It’s to pass the time during his 
                        dialysis. He has a stamped form 
                        allowing him to take it.

           Kamal holds up a laminated piece of paper. Herzl sneers.

                                 LT. HERZL
                        Tell him to play it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A bizarre sight in the middle of the road. Cars stopped in 
           line at the checkpoint as a frail man sits on a metal folding 
           chair playing chords on a violin. Sweat runs down his brow.

                                 RAND
                        Enough.

           Rand takes the violin from Kamal and returns it to its case.

                                 RAND (CONT’D)
                        We’re leaving.

           Jacob steps up to him.

                                 JACOB
                        I’m afraid they can’t leave here 
                        until we have the right 
                        documentation.

           Jacob summons another guard to round up the patients.
                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        Make sure you get back before my 
                        shift is over...or we might have to 
                        send them for interrogation.

           He smiles with mock concern.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AMBULANCE C108 - EREZ CHECKPOINT - MOMENTS LATER

           Rand BANGS his fist on the side door as he turns the vehicle 
           around, fuming. 

                                 STRIKER
                        Humiliation is just part of their 
                        policy. Sends a message.

           Striker stubs out his cigarette in the bed pan.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure they’ll let them out 
                        tomorrow...

           Rand looks to Striker.

                                 RAND
                        Can we go back to Hyder?

           Off Rand’s look -

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT./EXT. AMBULANCE C108 - HYDER’S COMPOUND - LATER

           Rand tosses the plastic-wrapped ecstacy packets into the 
           green Magen David Adom organ transporter case. He spreads ice 
           over them.

           He SLAMS the doors shut. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           The plastic organ case rattles in the back as the ambulance 
           speeds down the highway.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. EREZ CROSSING CHECKPOINT - LATER

           The rear ambulance doors SLAM shut on the faces of the six 
           dialysis patients, now covered in a film of sweat and dust 
           from waiting outside.
           Jacob stuffs an envelope into his back pocket and bangs on 
           the side of the vehicle.

                                 JACOB
                        Clear!

           The ambulance REVS and kicks up a cloud of sand onto him as 
           it speeds through the gate into the promised land.

           EXT. AMBULANCE BAY - BARZILAI HOSPITAL - ASHKELON - LATER

           Striker and Rand help the patients out of the ambulance and 
           into wheelchairs.

           INT. DIALYSIS WING - BARZILAI HOSPITAL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           We’re clearly not in Gaza anymore; there are nurses and crash 
           carts and x-ray rooms and the sharp smell of disinfectant 
           hangs in the air. 

           The white linoleum floor might be missing a few tiles and 
           there are no computers - only stacks and stacks of patient 
           files spilling out of boxes and cabinets - but it’s a real 
           hospital.

           Rand and Striker park the patients at a bank of DIALYSIS 
           MACHINES: rectangular metal cabinets housing black and green 
           monitors with transparent rubber tubes running out of them. 

           The hospital’s in-house TECHNICIANS take over and begin to 
           hook up the patients.

           INT. SICK BAY 4 - BARZILAI HOSPITAL - LATER

           Light streams through the grilles on the windows. 

           A Filipino NURSE leads Rand and Striker to a large room with 
           several beds. There are no curtains separating them. 

           In the bed in the corner lies DAREEN, now looking much more 
           like the young face on her ID.

                                 RAND
                        How are you?

           Dareen smiles weakly at Rand, not understanding the English. 
           She gestures for him to move closer. Striker stays back.
           Rand leans in towards her to hear what she has to say. 
           Instead, she takes off a thin silver chain from her neck - on 
           it is the ‘Hand of Fatima’ encircled by her name in Arabic 
           lettering. She loops it over Rand’s head.

           Rand doesn’t know how to take the gesture. He smiles an 
           awkward thank you.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FANAA FAST FOOD - ASHKELON - LATER

           An Arabic fast food joint, modelled after a 1980’s McDonalds: 
           formica table tops, faux-wood panelling, glowing yellow 
           plastic letters in Arabic and Hebrew.

           Striker and Rand eat shawarma wrapped in newspaper.

                                 STRIKER
                        You should have gotten the Falafel 
                        Burger - my so -

           He catches himself mid-sentence. Chews on his wrap, continues-

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Twice or thrice a week, I’d get 
                        food from here and sit with him 
                        while he got his dialysis...He 
                        liked the Falafel Burger.

                                 RAND
                        Can I ask what happened?

                                 STRIKER
                        Hamas started an offensive during 
                        Passover that lasted twenty-two 
                        days. And the crossings were 
                        closed.

           He puts down his half-eaten shawarma and pushes it away.

                                 RAND
                        I’m sorry.

                                 STRIKER
                        There’s nothing to cry about or be 
                        sorry about. Fariha thinks that I’m 
                        cold, but being a medic all these 
                        years has only shown me the truth: 
                        there’s no grand plan. Karma, 
                        coincidence, it’s all shit. I’m a 
                        medic and there was nothing I could 
                        do to save my own son.
           Striker gets very dark.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        You learn that, in war. You strip 
                        away all the bullshit. You discover 
                        who you are and what the world is.

           He scrunches up his napkin and throws it on his tray.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        That’s why I’m here. The state of 
                        always being alert, life and death 
                        every day - after Granby - this is 
                        my normal. Once you’re a sand dog, 
                        you can’t live any other way. 

           He pushes his tray away. Almost under his breath -

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        And you can’t go home because 
                        you’re not the same fucking person.

           Contemplating, Striker flicks his cigarette against the 
           window.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Lesson Number Five: when you see 
                        the truth of the world, you can’t 
                        talk about these things with anyone 
                        else - except those who know. 
                        Because they will not understand.

           He kicks his chair back -

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get out of here.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ZANZI-BAR CLUB - ASHKELON - LATER

           A high angle view, above the neon sign.

           Rand’s figure emerges from the ambulance carrying a green 
           organ transporter case and walks up to the doorway.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. AMBULANCE BAY - BARZILAI HOSPITAL - LATER

           Holding two small boxes of medical supplies under his arm, 
           Striker shakes hands with a Jewish doctor as Rand helps the 
           dialysis patients out of their wheelchairs. They’re looking 
           flushed. 

           Curiously, two of the younger patients now have CASTS on 
           their legs.

                                 RAND
                        What’s with the casts?

                                 STRIKER
                        It’s part of my little project. 

           He winks as Rand starts the engine.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        I’ll show you at the clinic.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. EREZ CROSSING CHECKPOINT - SUNSET

           No cars, no sniffer dogs, no fenced-in commuters. The place 
           is deserted, the concrete barricade down. 

           The Erez Crossing is CLOSED.

                                 RAND
                        Fuck.

                                 STRIKER
                        We have to take the embargoed route 
                        through the hills.

           EXT. NISANIT TUNNEL - NETIV HA ‘ASARA - ISRAEL - DUSK

           The ambulance passes Caterpillar earth-movers and concrete 
           mixing trucks parked between steel beams and piles of earth 
           in front of a row of semi-built Jewish settlement houses.

           As they approach the tunnel Rand notices a RING OF LIGHT 
           growing in the darkness of tunnel - headlights!

           Rand TURNS off the road into the construction site, hiding 
           between a rubble pile and a concrete-mixer. He kills the 
           engine. Everyone is silent, holding their breath.

           The vehicle RUMBLES by. It’s an IDF truck, followed by a 
           second one.
           They wait a few minutes before pulling back onto the road and 
           into:

           THE TUNNEL 

           Marked “IDF ACCESS ONLY.”

           It is illuminated only by a single spine of sodium vapor 
           lamps: the coast looks clear.

           The patients nod asleep in the back as the ambulance drives 
           through.

           Rand repeatedly checks the rear view mirror, when -- 

           Two tiny spots appear in the distance. They’re growing 
           rapidly and there’s nowhere to pull over. 

           In another few seconds, the lights take shape - Rand can make 
           out that the vehicle is not a green IDF vehicle...but a beat-
           up red Toyota pick-up. 

           A relief. 

           The vehicle flashes its lights.

                                 STRIKER
                        I think we should let them pass.

           Rand slows down and hugs the wall of the tunnel. The pick-up 
           drives by slowly. As it does, Rand’s eyes connect with one of 
           the men in the car. He stares at Rand. 

           A RUSH of air as the car overtakes them. The ambulance 
           shudders slightly. 

           Rand gets back into the center of the lane.

           Suddenly the Toyota BRAKES HARD on the road in front of them, 
           SCREECHING to a halt at a 45 degree angle. 

           Rand SLAMS the brakes. The ambulance skids to a stop in front 
           of the car.

           Two MEN jump out of the Toyota. They’re swinging AK-47s.

                                 RAND
                        Brace!

           He throws the ambulance into REVERSE. 

           The back of the tunnel - now only a small spot of light at 
           the end - is too far behind them.
           The guns are pointed directly at the windshield. 

           A warning BURST goes off. The REPORT reverberates through the 
           tunnel.

                                 RAND (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!

                                 STRIKER
                        Stop! We won’t make it.

           The ambulance SQUEALS to a halt. A stand-off.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t speak.

           The two men - JAFFER and WAJID - dressed in black, their 
           faces covered with black and white scarves with Arabic 
           lettering - slowly walk up to the ambulance. The steady, 
           menacing clicking of their boots echoing in the tunnel.

           Striker rolls down his window.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                             (in Arabic)
                        Good afternoon, brother. How can we 
                        help you?

           The pleasantries aren’t working.

           Jaffer YANKS on the door handle. The vehicle is locked.

           He RAPS on the glass with the butt of his rifle.

                                 JAFFER
                        Open!

           Rand looks at Striker. He CLICKS the unlock button.

           The man FLINGS open the driver side door, grabbing Rand by 
           the arm.

                                 JAFFER (CONT’D)
                        Get out!

           His command ricochets down the tunnel. There’s no one for 
           miles around.

           Nervously, Rand unfastens his seat belt and steps out.

                                 STRIKER
                             (in Arabic)
                        Talk to me. He doesn’t understand 
                        Arabic. Talk to me, brother.
           Jaffer ignores Striker. He looks directly at Rand, seeing the 
           “USA” on the Red Crescent ID clipped to his shirt.

           He smiles and holds his hand out to shake. Rand just stands 
           there.

                                 JAFFER
                        What kind of politeness is this? 
                        You come to our country, but you 
                        won’t take my hand? 

           Rand looks at him blankly and then Striker.

                                 JAFFER (CONT’D)
                        My hand is not clean for you?

           Jaffer looks at his blackened hand. He spits into it, leaving 
           a phlegmatic residue.

           He pats Rand on the cheek with his moist palm. Rand winces.

           Hesitating, Rand gingerly puts out his hand to shake when -

           THUD! He’s HIT in the gut with the butt of Jaffer’s rifle. 
           Rand bends over double, winded.

           Wajid, his partner, sneers. He joins in and KICKS Rand in the 
           gut while he’s down. 

           Striker RUSHES out of the ambulance.

           Wajid points his rifle at Striker.

                                 STRIKER
                        Brother, stop!

                                 JAFFER
                        What is he, your son?

                                 STRIKER
                        He is my partner.

           Jaffer SHOVES his gun in Striker’s face. 

                                 YOUSEF
                             (in Arabic)
                        Don’t think I won’t shoot you.

           Striker PUSHES the rifle butt away. He continues moving 
           towards Rand.

           Jaffer is caught off guard by his audacity. 

           Striker slowly gets Rand back on his feet.
           He turns to the two men.

                                 STRIKER
                        What do you want? 

                                 JAFFER
                        We want morphine.

                                 WAJID
                        And painkiller. Diazepam.

                                 JAFFER
                        And gauze.

                                 STRIKER
                        Take what you want and go!

           Striker goes around the back of the ambulance and unlocks the 
           back door to reveal the six huddled dialysis patients 
           cowering and praying in the back. Kamal looks at Jaffer with 
           disdain.

                                 JAFFER
                        What are you looking at, old man?

           Striker unlocks the glass cabinets.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Jaffer and Wajid grab as much as they can carry, leaving 
           medicine jars and blister-packs strewn across the ambulance 
           floor.

           Wajid notices Rand looking over at the green Magen David Adom 
           organ transporter case tucked under the stretcher.

           He nudges his partner.

           Jaffer puts down a handful of supplies and makes for the 
           case.

           Striker watches tensely as Jaffer slides it out. 

           Jaffer gestures at Rand with his rifle.

                                 YOUSEF
                             (in Arabic)
                        What is this, Amrekee?

                                 STRIKER
                        You’ve taken what you need. Now go.

           Jaffer shakes his head, looking straight at Rand.
                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                             (to Rand)
                        He wants you to tell him what’s 
                        inside.

           Jaffer aims the rifle at Rand’s head.

           Rand calls his bluff.

                                 RAND
                        It’s a transplant organ. You must 
                        not open it. 

           Jaffer looks at Striker; he mis-translates to protect Rand.

           Wajid opens the box, scraping the ice aside to reveal ROWS OF 
           STACKED BILLS. 

           His eyes light up. JACKPOT.

                                 STRIKER
                        Now get the fuck out of here!

           Jaffer scurries out of the ambulance holding the transporter 
           box. Wajid follows backwards behind him with his rifle aimed 
           at the ambulance.

           They hop into the pick-up with their bounty and the Toyota 
           SQUEALS into the darkness.

           Striker and Rand watch the ring of light recede into the 
           blackness in front of them.

           Rand turns to Striker in the driver’s seat.

                                 RAND
                        What do we tell Hyder?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - HYDER’S BUNGALOW - RAFAH - LATER

           The tea sits untouched on the coffee table. 

           Hyder is fuming, but maintains his cool facade. He paces as 
           Striker and Rand sit perched at the end of the sofa.

                                 HYDER
                        My suppliers are waiting on the 
                        other side of the tunnel for my 
                        payment. What do I tell them? And 
                        the IDF officers? Who’s going to 
                        pay them their protection money?
           He glares directly at Striker.

                                 HYDER (CONT’D)
                        Brother, I thought you were going 
                        to be responsible for him. He has 
                        been quite costly for us.

                                 RAND
                        It was my fault. I’ll do whatever 
                        you need to make up the payment.

                                 HYDER
                        What can you do?

                                 RAND
                        I’ll do more runs for you. Look at 
                        me. As an American they’re much 
                        more likely to let me pass.

           The room is silent. Close on Hyder: we see an idea forming.

                                 HYDER
                        I’ll find a special project.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AMBULANCE C108 - SALAHUDDIN HIGHWAY - LATER

           Rand and Striker drive in silence. They’re both nervous, 
           trying not to think about what lies ahead.

           Striker turns on the radio to break the tension.

           He turns a knob on the console. Nothing happens.

           He SMACKS the dash and the TINNY radio CRACKLES to life.

           Striker tunes to a different station. Nothing. Static.

                                 STRIKER
                        Still jammed. They won’t even let 
                        us have our own radio. Fuckers.

           He flicks it off, leaving just the sound of the cat’s eye 
           worry beads dangling from the rear-view mirror CLATTERING 
           against the windshield.

           They drive in silence.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t your fault.
           EXT. DIPLOMAT HOTEL - LATER

           The ambulance pulls away from the front entrance.

           INT. HALLWAY - DIPLOMAT HOTEL - LATER

           Drained, Rand unbuttons his shirt as he takes out his room 
           key -

           But the door to his room is already AJAR.

           INT. ROOM 32 - DIPLOMAT HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           He pushes it open, turns on the light -

           The SHOWER is running.

                                 RAND
                        Iris?

           He turns around and freezes - 

           There’s an olive-uninformed MAN sitting on a chair at the 
           window, silently waiting.

           It’s JACOB.

                                 RAND (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 JACOB
                        I thought I’d pay you a visit.

                                 RAND
                        Get out.

           Fingering past photographs and negatives on the table, Jacob 
           picks up a piece of Iris’s clothing. Sniffs it.

                                 JACOB
                        I’d love to get her in an 
                        interrogation room and see what she 
                        could do for me.

           Jacob gets up to leave.

           Rand cringes, grabbing back the blouse.

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        I have a message from Hyder. 
                        You’ll get an emergency call at 
                        10:00. Come alone. 
                                 RAND
                        I’ll be there.

                                 JACOB
                        Gate B. Don’t forget my papers.

           Jacob turns around in the doorway.

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        Don’t fuck it up this time.

           The door clicks shut.

           Rand locks it and slides the dead-bolt just as Iris opens the 
           bathroom door in a towel.

                                 IRIS
                        Who were you talking to?

                                 RAND
                        They had the wrong room.

           INT. ROOM 32 - DIPLOMAT HOTEL - NIGHT

           Rand and Iris on opposite sides of the bed. She’s asleep, 
           separated by a dam of pillows. Rand looks at the ceiling and 
           watches the breeze rustle the musty curtains. 

           A dog BARKS in the distance. And then another. And another.

           And then another sound. The GRINDING sound of military 
           vehicles. GUNSHOTS. Single, targeted BURSTS. It’s the night 
           exterminators.

           Beams of light sweep across the ceiling from the vehicles.

           One by one, the barking of the dogs is silenced.

           Rand lays there sweating, tense. He turns over.

                                 IRIS
                        You okay?

           He slips his arm around Iris. Unguarded, she takes it. He 
           just holds her.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RED CRESCENT CLINIC - DAYR AL-BALAH

           Rand follows Striker down the hallway. He looks at the clock: 
           it’s 9:45.
           They approach two dialysis patients from yesterday - SAMEER 
           and QASIM - waiting in wheelchairs.

           They’re wearing casts.

                                 STRIKER
                        You want to help me remove these?

           INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A large pair of plaster shears cut carefully along the length 
           of Sameer’s cast. Curiously, there are points where the 
           shears won’t cut through.

           Rand reaches the end of the cast and puts down the shears. 
           Grabbing the ends of the cast, he pulls - it comes apart in a 
           stream of plaster and gauze.

           But there’s something else - there are pieces of metal 
           EMBEDDED into the plaster - hinges, a circuit board, a valve.

           Rand is alarmed.

                                 RAND
                        What is this?

                                 STRIKER
                        From Barzilai.

           Rand holds up a circuit board and turns it over in his hand.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        This is what I’ve been working on.

           Striker pulls a sheet off a cabinet. It’s not a cabinet at 
           all, but a partially assembled DIALYSIS MACHINE.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        So we can treat them right here 
                        regardless of the checkpoint 
                        closures.

           Rand tries to smile, but he’s tense. He looks at the clock: 
           10:05.

           On cue: The loudspeaker SQUAWKS to life.

                                 VOICE
                        Attention C108. We have a Ten-17. 
                        Three female patients. Rafah, Taba 
                        Compound, Block 11. Dispatch.

           Striker immediately recognizes Hyder’s address.
                                 RAND
                        I have to go alone.

           Rand looks Striker straight in the eye.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HYDER’S COMPOUND - RAFAH - LATER 

           The guards swipe the airport wand over Rand. It BEEPS around 
           his neck. Rand pulls out Dareen’s chain.

           It BEEPS again at Rand’s medical pouch. He opens it to reveal 
           the scissors, flashlight and syringe. He’s clear.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HYDER’s BUNGALOW - MOMENTS LATER

           Hyder leads Rand down the stairs to the basement bunker, past 
           the tunnel and the racks of supplies and into a locked room 
           on the side.

           INT. BASEMENT ROOM - HYDER’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS

           The door opens to reveal: 

           Three unconscious WOMEN lying on a tattered, stained mattress 
           with no sheets. Two are African - they look like sisters - 
           and the other appears to be Eastern European or Russian - she 
           can’t be more than 16 years old.

           They’ve been sedated and they have bruises on their arms and 
           legs.

                                 HYDER
                        These are your patients. They need 
                        to be taken to Yosef at Zanzi-Bar 
                        in Ashkelon. 

           Hyder hands Rand three flawless blue ID cards.

                                 HYDER (CONT’D)
                        Tomorrow there will be three more, 
                        until you’ve paid off your debt.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HYDER’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A banal red-tiled bathroom. An ornate brass tissue box 
           holder. A kids toothbrush. A picture of sunset. 
           Rand could be in any American suburban bathroom - far away 
           from this madness, but he’s not. He’s here in Hyder’s lair.

           Rand wretches, but nothing comes out. He’s sweating, gasping 
           for breath.

           He looks at his bloodshot eyes in the mirror. They look like 
           Striker’s.

           INT. AMBULANCE C108 - HYDER’S COMPOUND

           Ismail helps Rand strap the women into the stretchers - the 
           two sisters together on one and the Eastern European girl on 
           the other. 

           The women moan softly, heavily drugged. Ismail looks at them, 
           almost regretful.

                                 ISMAIL
                        I’m sorry. We all have to make 
                        difficult choices to survive here.

           Ismail looks at Rand with a flicker of compassion before 
           turning away.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. EREZ CROSSING CHECKPOINT - GATE A - LATER

           Rand sweats profusely as he waits in a crooked line of cars 
           and vans up against the concrete wall.

           The posters of missing sons and daughters stare at him. 
           They’re peeling and tearing in the dusty wind, revealing 
           layers of other faces below them, and layers of faces even 
           further.

           Rand gets to the front.

           It’s Jacob. 

           He takes the three blue IDs.

                                 JACOB
                        Permit?

           Rand hands over a thick brown envelope wrapped in documents.

                                 RAND
                        You want me to open the back?

                                 JACOB
                        I’ll see them later.
           Jacob smiles, but it looks more like a snarl.

           The gate GRINDS open.

           He waves him through.

           EXT. ISRAELI SUBURB - OUTSIDE ASHKELON - LATER

           The setting sun glints through the olive groves. 

           Rand looks ahead - the yellow light hits the facades of 
           Ashkelon apartment blocks at an angle. The seedy neon sign at 
           Zanzi-bar must be flickering on right around now.

           Close on Rand and the look in his eyes. 

           No, he can’t do this. 

           No.

           Rand pulls over.

           He moves to the back compartment and pulls out a jar of 
           adrenaline. He fills three small syringes with the clear 
           fluid and, one by one, carefully INJECTS the three women.

           He unstraps them as the adrenaline kicks in.

           The sisters are the first to rouse, disoriented and groggy, 
           they look at him with fear, startled. The Eastern-European 
           girl wakes and stares at him blankly, like the life has 
           already been sucked out of her.

           Rand takes out the bills given to him by Hyder and PUSHES 
           them into the hands of the girls.

           They look back at him, wide-eyed, afraid of what lies ahead.

           Rand opens the back doors. His heart beating wildly.

                                 RAND
                        RUN. Don’t come back!

           INT. AMBULANCE C108 - SALAHUDDIN HIGHWAY - GAZA

           The ambulance speeds down Salahuddin Highway as the evening 
           prayer ECHOES from minarets around Gaza City. 

           Rand rolls down the windows as he drives back, the air 
           THUNDERING through.

           The radio CRACKLES. Striker is paging through.
                                 RAND
                        C108 here. Copy?

                        urgent.

                                 RAND
                        Striker. I couldn’t do it.

           CRACKLING silence.

                                 STRIKER
                                 (Filtered)
                        I know. 

           EXT. RED CRESCENT CLINIC - LATER

           Striker rushes out and jumps into the ambulance. His face is 
           white.

                                 STRIKER
                        It’s my wife.

           The siren BLARES as they roar through the outskirts of Gaza 
           City.

           INT. STRIKER’S FORMER HOUSE - AL QUBBAH - HALF AN HOUR LATER

           STREAKS OF BLOOD across the floor, leading into the kitchen. 

           There’s a bloodied, furry mass in the middle of the floor. 

           It’s Striker’s dog, Simba.

           He’s wheezing, half alive. 

           FARIHA - the woman from Striker’s family portrait - ashen-
           faced, is huddled in the corner of the sofa holding a SOBBING 
           SAHRA, 9, Striker’s daughter.

                                 FARIHA
                        She found him at the doorstep.

           Simba has several gunshot wounds. He’s choking on the blood 
           filling his lungs.

           A note has been tucked into his collar. Striker unfolds the 
           bloody piece of paper - 
           Inscribed in Arabic: “It takes two hands to clap”

                                 STRIKER
                             (to Fariha)
                        Take her to the other room and turn 
                        up the television.

           TV is on LOUD. Striker pulls his handgun from his satchel. He 
           wraps the barrel in a dishrag and holds it against Simba’s 
           head.

           Hands shaking, face contorted, he pulls the trigger.

           BANG. The report is deafening.

           The dog stops wheezing.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                             (to Fariha)
                        Stay inside. Lock the doors.

           EXT. STRIKER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Striker stumbles into the ambulance and turns on the IRON 
           MAIDEN really LOUD. 

           He sits at the wheel. From his eye, a tear. He wipes it away. 

           But he can’t stop the next one. And the one after that.

           And for the first time since his before his son’s death, 
           Striker CRIES. 

           In that moment, everything he has held away like a dam, 
           catches up to him.

           Rand puts his hand on his shoulder.

                                 RAND
                        I’m sorry...

           Striker gets out of the ambulance and goes back inside.

                                 STRIKER
                        I’m going to stay here.

           As Fariha comes to the door, he hugs her tight, like he never 
           wants to let go. 

           Rand, in the vehicle, ponders what to do next. He looks at 
           the seat next to him, under which Striker’s pistol is 
           strapped.
           INT. LOCKER ROOM - RED CRESCENT CLINIC

           Back at the clinic. Rand shuts the door behind him. He 
           collapses into a kid-sized plastic chair. He’s drowning 
           inside.

           Someone opens the door - it’s Khaleed, one of the other 
           medics. He has a locker a few doors down.

           Rand composes himself and begins to change out of his 
           uniform.

           Khaleed looks over.

                                 KHALEED
                        You have a nice watch.

                                 RAND
                        Thanks.

                                 KHALEED
                        Nice shoes.

                                 RAND
                        Thank you. You too.

                                 KHALEED
                        No. I know I don’t. 

           A long, awkward silence.

                                 KHALEED (CONT’D)
                        Most of us here are just trying to 
                        make a living. Not all of us can 
                        afford to save the world.

                                 RAND
                        I’m just trying to do my best.

                                 KHALEED
                        So is Hyder. (a beat) He helps take 
                        care of our families.

           Rand is chilled by the reference. Another long pause.

                                 KHALEED (CONT’D)
                        You know why we have a cat here at 
                        the clinic?

           Rand shakes his head.

                                 KHALEED (CONT’D)
                        To kill the rats.
           Rand, silenced. 

           Khaleed shuts his locker and leaves.

                                 KHALEED (CONT’D)
                        You have a good night.

           Rand opens his locker to hang up his uniform and finds - 
           affixed to the back of the locker with medical tape - a half-
           chewed DEAD MOUSE hanging from its tail. He stops cold.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT./ EXT. AMBULANCE C108 - GAZA CITY

           Rand drives C108 through the streets of Gaza City. Amongst 
           the collapsed buildings and the rubbish and the rubble, cars 
           honk, men smoke hookah on steps outside shops, music plays 
           through windows. For this one hour before curfew - the city 
           is teeming with life and hope.

           Rand pulls up to the hotel.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Rand shoves Iris’s things into a bag.

                                 RAND
                        You have to leave.

                                 IRIS
                        What the fuck is going on?

                                 RAND
                        I want you to go into Israel.

                                 IRIS
                        Why? I’m staying right here. I have 
                        an assignment!

                                 RAND
                        They’re going to come for you. 
                        Because of me.

           Rand sits her down on the bed and begins to tell her the 
           truth -

                                                                CUT TO:
           MINUTES LATER

           Shock, confusion, anger, fear burn across Iris’s face. Just 
           when she had let her guard down...she wants to say something 
           but nothing comes out.

                                 RAND
                        I’m sorry.

           Iris grabs her bag to leave. She looks back at him, not 
           knowing whether to kiss him or punch him -

           She disappears. Probably forever. Rand’s world is crumbling.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HALLWAY - DIPLOMAT HOTEL

           Rand stalks down the hallway. He knocks on a door.

           The door opens, revealing Grant, holding a glass of whiskey.

                                 GRANT
                        Welcome! You came for some (he 
                        makes a drinking gesture) Eh?

           He notices Rand’s bloodshot eyes and senses the desperation 
           in his breath.

                                 RAND
                        No, I need to tell you something.

                                                                CUT TO:

                        Look, you’re in way over your head. 
                        I’m just a visiting consultant. I’m 
                        out of here in a couple of days.

                                 RAND
                        You can tip-off the Palestinian

                        women coming through the tunnels 
                        tomorrow.

                                 GRANT
                        You think they have the power to 
                        take them down? They barely have 
                        enough funding for uniforms.
                                 RAND
                        Just call the police commissioner 
                        for me, please.

           Grant looks at him, shaking his head. He then picks up the 
           phone and starts to dial.

           A group of UNIFORMED OFFICERS storm into the building, their 
           assault rifles illuminated with flashlights. One of them is 
           JACOB.

           They SMASH open cabinets and lockers. They’ve clearly been 
           tipped off to look for something. They CRACK open patient’s 
           casts and TOPPLE Striker’s DIALYSIS MACHINE - years of work

           pull out three cylindrical cannisters from his jacket. He 
           cuts open the gray foam padding on the bench and carefully 
           slides them in.

                                 GRANT (CONT’D)
                        Talk to him.

           Grant flips open his cell phone. It’s an international 
           number.

           Rand puts the handset to his ear.

                                 RAND
                        Hello?

                                 LESTER (O.S.)
                        Rand?

           Silence.

                                 LESTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know what you’ve gotten 
                        yourself into, but you need to get 
                        out now. We’ve arranged a 
                        diplomatic pouch through Jack’s 
                        connections.

                                 RAND
                        Dad, I can’t leave.
                                 LESTER (O.S.)
                        Come home before this becomes more 
                        embarrassing for everyone.

                                 RAND
                        I have to finish this.

                                 LESTER (O.S.)
                        You don’t need to prove anything 
                        out there. It won’t make a 
                        difference. Just get on the plane.

                                 RAND
                        Sorry...I have to go.

           Rand hangs up and pushes the phone back across the table.

                                 GRANT
                        Rand, I have tickets from the 
                        consulate for you to leave the 
                        country.

           He slides the travel documents towards him.

                                 GRANT (CONT’D)
                        You can leave now. Or you’re on 
                        your own. Flight leaves in 3 hours.

                                 RAND
                        If I leave, Striker is a dead man.

           Rand looks at the ticket. 

           In a second he can make this all go away. Fuck this hellhole. 
           Fuck Striker. Fuck Iris. Lesson number four, was it? Don’t 
           get too attached, gets in the way of proper judgment.

           He picks up the ticket. He’s done. 

                                 GRANT
                        Who is he to you anyway?

           A long pause...

                                 RAND
                        He’s my partner.

           A beat. Rand slides the tickets back.

           Grant looks at Rand, shaking his head - stunned and impressed 
           by his stubbornness.

                                 RAND (CONT’D)
                        I’m not leaving them to Hyder.
                                 GRANT
                        Listen, I spoke to the commissioner 
                        about this Hyder guy. They’re 
                        looking into it, but they can’t go 
                        in there. 

           Rand rubs his temples.

                                 GRANT (CONT’D)
                        Rand, they’re not going to touch 
                        him. He’s a mole.

                                 RAND
                        He smuggles drugs and traffics 
                        women!

                                 GRANT
                        Prostitution is legal on the 
                        Israeli side. And drug enforcement 
                        isn’t the domain of the State 
                        Department. Besides, we can’t prove 
                        any of that.

                                 RAND
                        What about the checkpoint officers 
                        on his payroll? I know who they are 
                        - what if you had an opportunity to 
                        take down the ring? It’ll be a coup 
                        for the security forces.

                                 GRANT
                        Look, even if somehow you can prove 
                        it, the IDF isn’t going to take a 
                        chance by raiding him in his own 
                        district. The area is protected by 
                        Hamas. They don’t want a bloodbath.

           Rand shakes his head.

                                 GRANT (CONT’D)
                        We have no power unless he’s out of 
                        there. 

                                 RAND
                        And if he’s out of there?

                                 GRANT
                        I can’t guarantee anything, but if 
                        you can get him out of that 
                        jurisdiction, I can tip off my 
                        contact the IDF. They have an 
                        aerial surveillance unit. Maybe 
                        they’ll make a move.
           Rand gets up to leave.

                                 GRANT (CONT’D)
                        Good luck.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AMBULANCE C108 - ROADSIDE - SALAHUDDIN HIGHWAY - LATER

           Hold on Rand in the ambulance, gripping the steering wheel.

           There’s only one plan left. And he could die. If he’s worth 
           anything, now’s the time to prove it.

           His heart pounding, Rand takes out the two halves of 
           Striker’s modified Soviet pistol. The handle and the chamber 
           are each no bigger than a medium-sized cellphone. With a 
           medical scalpel, he peels off the soles of his boots, gauging 
           out a compartment in the rubber.

           Rand slams on the accelerator and barrels boldly through the 
           night, Striker’s Iron Maiden SCREAMING through the speakers.

           The sodium street lights sweep across his face as 
           determination burns in his eyes.

           EXT. AMBULANCE C108 - RAFAH/ NEAR EGYPTIAN BORDER - GAZA

           The headlights flash wildly as the ambulance hurtles through 
           the dirt roads towards Hyder’s compound.

           INT. AMBULANCE - HYDER’S COMPUND - LATER

           Stray dogs BARK and HOWL as the ambulance lurches to a halt.

           Rand removes the metal components of the medical pouch on his 
           belt. He pulls out a small syringe from the back of the 
           ambulance and slips it into one of the empty slots. 

           EXT. HYDER’S BUNGALOW - MOMENTS LATER

           Rand walks up to the front gate, confronted by the guards. 

                                 RAND
                        I have some business.

           They are surprised by his audacity. They pat him down. He 
           shifts from foot to foot, steadying himself on his uneven 
           soles as they move down to his ankles. Clear.
           Now the wand. Again, the chain BEEPS around his neck, so does 
           the medical pouch. They check. Flashlight, syringe, pen - no 
           weapons.

           They buzz the intercom and let him in. 

           Sweat trickles down Rand’s temples.

           INT. HYDER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The front door closes behind him. He scans the hallway.

           The tinny SOUND EFFECTS of a cartoon waft from a television 
           down the hall.

           Rand stops in a dark corner of the vestibule. He peels off 
           the soles of his boots, and pulls out the pistol components, 
           locking the two pieces together. He tucks it into his medical 
           pouch, using it as an ad hoc holster.

           Suddenly, he’s SPIED - it’s Hyder’s son, Jamil, peering out 
           from an archway, dressed in a Spider Man costume. Recognizing 
           him, he instinctively smiles at Rand.

           Rand lifts up his hands in mock-surrender. The boy grins. 

           Rand silently counts down from ten with his fingers. 

           The boy gets it: hide-and-seek. He scurries off to hide.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Rand creeps down the hallway, past the living room.

           Through the beaded curtain, he catches Hyder’s silhouette in 
           the kitchen. 

           Unclipping his pouch, he pulls out the gun, keeping his 
           fingers off the trigger, hands trembling.

           As he pulls back the curtains, the beads CLATTER - Hyder 
           spins around, holding a cup of steeping tea.

           He’s not afraid, rather amused.

                                 HYDER
                        I didn’t think you were this 
                        foolish.

                                 RAND
                        Where’s Striker? Let him go.
           He puts the tea down on the counter.

                                 HYDER
                        I feed the people, pay for their 
                        families and this is how you thank 
                        me? You think you can threaten me 
                        in my own home?

           He pops a few Canderel tablets into the cup.

                                 HYDER (CONT’D)
                        Do you know how much each of those 
                        girls was worth? Over the years? If 
                        you didn’t come here with the 
                        money, I have no use for you.

           He opens a drawer and gets out a teaspoon. We notice there’s 
           a large knife amongst the silverware.

           Rand aims the gun at Hyder’s head.

                                 HYDER (CONT’D)
                        What? You’re going to shoot me? Is 
                        that the plan? You think you can 
                        get out of here alive?

           Hyder ignores him and stirs his tea, deliberately leaving the 
           drawer open.

                                 HYDER (CONT’D)
                        What were you thinking when you 
                        went to inform the IDF?

           Rand notices the blade glinting in the drawer.

                                 RAND
                        Move away from the cabinet!

           Hyder backs off.

                                 HYDER
                        Why do you think this place is left 
                        standing when all the others have 
                        been bombed?

           Hyder takes a sip from the cup.

                                 HYDER (CONT’D)
                        Why do I have their machines? I 
                        work for them. I’m their informant. 
                        I know which tunnels smuggle 
                        weapons and arms. They need me. 
                        They let me operate. I let them 
                        infiltrate. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HYDER (CONT’D)
                        One hand shakes the other. 
                        Something you don’t understand.

                                 RAND
                        Then call your buddies at the IDF 
                        and tell him to release Iris and 
                        the people from the clinic.

           Rand puts his finger on the trigger.

                                 HYDER
                        You don’t have the courage, son...

           Suddenly, Hyder FLINGS his tea at Rand’s face, SCALDING him. 
           The gun goes OFF. The cabinet SPLINTERS. Hyder lunges at 
           Rand. They struggle on the floor. The gun slips across the 
           linoleum.

           Hyder grabs it. 

           He lifts up the gun and CLICKS - there were NO more bullets 
           in it. Rand grabs for the syringe in his pouch but, just then-

           Alerted by the sound of the gunshot, Hyder’s guards BURST 
           through the beaded curtain, grabbing Rand and forcing him 
           into a headlock. They PUMMEL his head repeatedly. 

           Rand thrashes about as they drag him down the stairs to the 
           underground hallway, until he falls almost unconscious from 
           the blows -

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. UNDERGROUND STORAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A dark, sandy space guarded by empty crates and rusty metal 
           racks.

           Rand is thrown in and slumps onto the ground. The door SLAMS 
           shut.

           And there beside him is - STRIKER, lying crumpled on the 
           floor - his face caked in dirt and blood - his hands zip-tied 
           behind him.

           Rand has found him.

           They just look at each other across the floor, barely able to 
           speak.

                                 STRIKER
                        Amateur. 

           Striker smiles weakly.
                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        You should have looked out for 
                        yourself.

           The moment is broken by the OPENING of the door.

           Rand sees the silhouette of a stocky MAN in the doorway, 
           holding a GUN. Ismail, Hyder’s #2 stands behind him, 
           watching.

           THWUMP. THWUMP. THWUMP. The man KICKS Rand repeatedly with 
           his steel-capped boots. He curses in Arabic.

           Rand closes his eyes, wincing, taking the punches and the 
           blows, as the man ploughs into him.

           His whole body convulses from the pain. 

           This is it.

           Striker was right. There is no justice, there is no plan. 
           He’s going to die in this basement. Executed, like a sand 
           dog.

           Suddenly - the man STOPS. Something glimmers in the dark. A 
           look of recognition flickers across his face.

           He leans in close to Rand, near his face. Rand can smell his 
           breath. 

           Rand waits for the cocking of the gun, but it doesn’t come. 
           The man is looking at the shiny silver Hand of Fatima around 
           Rand’s neck with the Arabic name on it.

                                 MAN
                             (in Arabic, to Ismail)
                        Look at this.

           The man yanks the chain off. Rand looks at him, confused. 

                                 RAND
                        It’s from a patient - she’s in 
                        Barzilai.

           Ismail wipes the dirt off the inscription.

                                 ISMAIL
                        Dareen...Zayani?

                                 RAND
                        How does he...?

           Striker lets out a deep breath.
                                 STRIKER
                        Dareen was one of Hyder’s girls.

                                 RAND
                        You...knew?

                                 STRIKER
                        I took her over once...I didn’t 
                        know what for.

           Striker’s eyes mist over with regret.

           For Rand, it all falls into place: the reason Dareen was so 
           scared of Striker; the reason for her home abortion; 
           Striker’s adamant desire to save her; the whole chain of 
           events that have led us to this moment.

           Ismail turns the amulet over in his hand and whispers 
           something under his breath.

                                 ISMAIL
                        Go.

           Ismail looks at him as if this is the moment - the 
           opportunity - HE has been waiting for too. 

           Rand is confused, disoriented.

           He looks to Striker on the floor. 

                                 STRIKER
                        Just run. He’s not going to give 
                        you another chance.

           Summoning all his strength, Rand stumbles to his feet, his 
           body aching, throbbing.

           Rand rushes through the open door and UP the stairs, pulling 
           out the syringe from his pouch.

           INT. HYDER’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Hyder is on the sofa with the guards. They turn to see a 
           FIGURE coming up behind Hyder.

           RAND CHARGES HYDER and STABS him in the NECK with the 
           syringe.

           Hyder WINCES and the guards immediately grab RAND in a choke-
           hold, ready to squeeze the remaining life out of him.

           The empty syringe falls out of Rand’s hand to the floor: it’s 
           INSULIN.
           Within seconds, Hyder’s knees buckle. He falls to the floor. 
           He begins to convulse, going into a seizure as the insulin 
           overdose spreads through his system and his body SHUTS DOWN.

           He’s having a DIABETIC SEIZURE.

           The guards loosen their grip on Rand, unsure of what to do. 
           They want to kill him, but they can’t - they NEED him.

                                 GUARD #1
                        Fix him!

           THWACK! He hits Rand over the head with the butt of a rifle. 
           Rand reels. Mouth bloodied.

                                 RAND
                        I can’t do it myself! I need 
                        Striker’s help.

           An uncuffed Striker is dropped on the floor in front of a 
           semi-conscious Hyder.

                        We have to get him to the 
                        hospital...

           Striker suppresses a smile at Rand’s bluff.

           Striker and Rand tend to Hyder as the guards carry Hyder out 
           to the ambulance. 

           They run a glucose drip to counteract the insulin shot and 
           attach a sedative into the line.

           The guards jump into the vehicle with their assault rifles.

                                 RAND (CONT’D)
                        You can’t take your guns - we have 
                        to go through the checkpoint to 
                        Barzilai.

                                 GUARD # 1
                        We’ll take them as far as we can.
           Rand puts Striker in the jumper seat, taking extra effort to 
           strap him in firmly.

           Rand gets into the front seat and puts on his seat belt. 
           Tight.

           As he does so, he brushes his knuckle by the radio’s ON 
           switch - the same thing Striker did earlier to broadcast 
           Rand’s singing over the airwaves. That’s the SIGNAL.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Rand’s hands grip a steering wheel. They’re shaking.

           He drives fast. Too fast, through the narrow, dusty streets.

           We pull back from our view through the windshield. There’s 
           sweat down his temples and the glint of a metal barrel 
           pressed against his matted brown hair.

                                 GUARD #1
                        If he dies, you die.

           An AERIAL VIEW on a helicopter’s video display - we’re 
           looking down, directly above the rooftops. The ambulance 
           tears through the streets, the numerals “108” visible across 
           its roof.

           Hyder’s voice CRACKLES through the radio - the helicopter is 
           TUNED IN to the ambulance frequency. They can hear everything 
           - Jacob is fucked.

           The sound of an Apache helicopter THUNDERS above, cutting

           Through the windshield, we can see a military checkpoint - 
           with several IDF vehicles and military personnel - 
           approaching 500 feet ahead.

           It’s getting closer, but the speedometer maintains its

                        Yes, boss.

           Rand looks at the red rubber band tied to the steering wheel. 

           He checks Hyder through the rear view window. As their eyes 
           connect, something dawns on Hyder. He grabs his guard’s gun 
           to fire, a split-second of realization flashing over his face 
           before -

           SMASH! Hyder’s head slams against the side of the ambulance 
           as -

           Gripping the wheel tighter, RAND suddenly YANKS it SHARPLY to 
           the left, way beyond the RED MARKER.
           THUD. The driver side wheels SLAM into the curb. SCRAPE. The 
           ambulance SHUDDERS, lifting OFF the asphalt. It TIPS. The

           bomb. Striker’s hands are clasped around his.

                                 STRIKER
                        Don’t worry. I have it, just slip 
                        your hands out. We’re going to be 
                        okay.

           Rand looks at Striker. Striker’s eyes are clear as he looks 
           straight back at him. Not red, not bloodshot, but calm.

                                 RAND
                        Okay, boss.

           Just then: the approaching DRONE of heavy engines, SIRENS and 
           tires CRUNCHING over gravel as the bomb squad pulls into the 
           lot outside.

           Moving millimeters at a time, Rand slowly slips his hand out 
           from under Striker’s.

                                 STRIKER
                        Stop.

                                 RAND
                        What?

                                 STRIKER
                        Shhh...
           Seconds pass.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Did you feel that?

           They’re still for a moment.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        He just passed.

           Rand felt something. Or was it just his own heart thumping in 
           his chest? No, it was definitely...something.

           He slowly pulls his hands away, still staring at Striker.

                                 RAND
                        I thought you said that was a myth.

           Striker winks, but his eyes are glistening. 

                                 STRIKER
                        What are you waiting for? Go 
                        debrief them. Get me the hell out 
                        of here.

           Rand unstraps the boy from the stretcher.

                                 STRIKER (CONT’D)
                        Now light me a cigarette while I 
                        wait for these fuckers to get me 
                        out of this.

           Rand reaches into Striker’s shirt pocket and pulls out a 
           cigarette from his perennial packet of Lucky Strikes. He 
           sticks it into the corner of Striker’s cheeky grin.

           Rand unstraps the INJURED BOY from the bench and lifts him 
           into his arms. 

           He jumps off the back of the ambulance and runs to get help.

           EXT. AMBULANCE - EMPTY LOT - JUFFAIR - CONTINUOUS

           Carrying the boy in his arms, Rand gulps the air outside. He 
           trudges through the weeds and over to the commanding officer 
           approaching him.

                                 RAND
                        There’s a patient with an IED 
                        strapped to -

           As he speaks -
           A FLASH OF WHITE AND RED, a loud, concussive BANG. 

           Rand is thrown to the ground. 

           A colossal explosion RIPS through the ambulance behind him. 

           The world goes silent. All that’s left is a TINNY RINGING in 
           his ears. 

           Rand in a ball, covering the boy. His face rests in the 
           earth. 

           The world is SIDEWAYS. SLOW-MOTION.

           The ambulance’s rear door, ripped from its hinges, lands 
           upside down in front of him, the numbers inverted. Something 
           strikes him about the image, but the thought is lost.

           Men trudge toward the ambulance. He hears someone YELLING. 
           Boots CRUNCH around him.

           Black smoke. Splinters of debris. Burning embers float softly 
           to the ground. Twisting, twirling in the aftermath.

           Rand closes his eyes and lets out a long breath.

           The world goes black as Rand passes out - the kid, safe in 
           his arms.

           Somewhere, a photo of a boy and a German shepherd curls into 
           a crisp.

                                                                CUT TO:

           TITLE BURN:         THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW

           An IRON MAIDEN song plays.

           Close up on a warped and singed red audio cassette tape 
           marked “Powerslave” in Rand’s hand, he slips it into his 
           pocket - right alongside a long-overdue envelope, worn at the 
           edges, addressed to a woman in London.

           Rand looks through the window of the pediatric sick bay at 
           the wounded BOY from the apartment building. We notice Rand 
           has a medic’s badge on his sleeve.

           The camera pulls back to reveal a woman - her hair covered by 
           a black scarf - next to him. It’s Fariha.

           She leans in to Rand.

                                 FARIHA
                        When can I take him home?
                                 RAND
                        Soon.

           The camera pulls back further from the two figures at the 
           window - and out the front door of the Red Crescent clinic.

           A dialysis machine is being wheeled off an IDF truck.

           Iris waits in a taxi outside.

           A dog barks in the distance.

           CUT TO BLACK.
