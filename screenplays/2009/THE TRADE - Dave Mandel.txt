           Click.  The screen “turns on” like an old picture tube 
           TV.  After a few moments of flickering, we realize we are 
           watching a...

           BASEBALL GAME.  The color is so bleached out, it has to 
           be from the seventies.  1970 to be exact.

           The pitcher, number 19,  goes into his wind-up and 
           throws... THWACK!

           The batter rips the ball to left field for a single.

                        Base hit for Andrews.  Yanks left 
                        fielder, Roy White, bobbles the ball.  
                        Andrews is going to test White’s arm...

           The runner rounds first and heads towards second.  Here 
           comes the throw...

                        Safe!  Not even close.  That’s going to 
                        put a runner in scoring position for the 
                        Red Sox.  Not that it matters here on the 
                        last day of the season.  Neither team is 
                        going near the playoffs this year.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        But it still matters to Fritz Peterson, 
                        the Yankee lefty, who’s trying to win his 
                        twentieth game.  He does not look happy.

           The pitcher stares daggers out to left.  Meet Fritz 
           Peterson.  Big, tall and athletic, but with a kind face.  

                                 ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
                        Here comes the Yankee manager, Ralph 
                        Houk, to take his pitcher’s temperature.

           From out of the dugout comes a legend, Houk.  He moves 
           with the slowness of a man who won two consecutive World 
           Series.  But that was long ago.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Yanks lead 4-1 bottom of the 8th.  We’ll 
                        be right back after these words from our 
                        sponsor.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           GULDEN’S MUSTARD COMMERCIAL

           Young kids come into the kitchen, where their mom, Mrs. 
           Elston Howard, spreads mustard on a bunch of delicious-
           looking hot dogs.

                                 MRS. ELSTON HOWARD
                        Wonder why the hot dogs at Yankee Stadium 
                        are so good?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           BACK ON THE MOUND

           We are no longer “watching this on TV.”

                                 HOUK
                        How you doin’ Pete?

                                 FRITZ
                        I’m fine.

                                 HOUK
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 FRITZ
                        What would you do if this was the eighth 
                        inning of Game 7 of the Series?

                                 HOUK
                        I’d bring in McDaniel to shut them down 
                        and win the game.  Then we’d have a 
                        parade down Broadway.

           Fritz hands the manager his ball and walks off with a pat 
           on his butt as Houk motions for relief.

           Fritz reaches the visitors’ dugout and a sea of “good 
           jobs.”  He heads to the far end of the bench where the 
           pitchers hang out. Mel Stottlemeyer, the Yankee ace, 
           hands him a towel.

                                 FRITZ
                        If either of us is ever traded...

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        ... we bean Roy White. 

           Fritz sits a second but then heads down the stairs to the 
           locker room.
                                 STOTTLEMEYER (CONT’D)
                        Where you going?  

                                 FRITZ
                        I can’t watch this.

           VISITOR LOCKER ROOM

           Empty.  Fritz grabs a beer and starts to get undressed.

           There’s a big TV hanging from the ceiling.

           ON THE TV

           The end of the Gulden’s mustard commercial.  The kids and 
           Mrs. Howard have now been joined by former Yankee Catcher 
           and the first African American Yankee, Mr. Elston Howard.

                                 ELSTON HOWARD
                        All the Howards love Gulden’s mustard!

           The game comes back on.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Welcome back to Fenway Park where it’s up 
                        to Lindy McDaniel to keep the Red Sox 
                        from scoring.  

           Fritz can’t bear to watch.  He heads away from the TV.

           TRAINER’S ROOM

           Fritz enters.  Another TV is there with the game on.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        McDaniel into his wind-up... a monster 
                        shot, going back, back, back... Home run!  
                        Luis Alvarado!  And the Sox just made it 
                        interesting. 4-3 Yankees.

           Fritz runs out and slams the door.

           VISITING MANAGER’S OFFICE

           Fritz comes in.  Looks around.  There is no TV.  But he 
           can still hear the TV from the locker room.

           He shuts the door.  He can still hear it.
           Fritz gets down on his hands and knees and crawls under 
           the manager’s desk.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        And that’s a curve ball just nicking the 
                        corner--

           He covers his ears.  SILENCE.  We close in on his face.  
           He shuts his eyes.

           We are there forever.  Or just a few seconds.

           Suddenly... the door to the office opens.  From under the 
           desk, we see feet approaching.  They come around the desk 
           to find Fritz.

           FRITZ’S POV:  He looks up to see the Yankee clubhouse 
           man, Pete Sheehy.  Sheehy looks sad.

                                 SHEEHY
                                (shaking his head)
                        Sorry, Pete.

           Fuck.

                                 SHEEHY (CONT’D)
                        You just won your twentieth game!

           Yeah!

                                 SHEEHY (CONT’D)
                        Still not going to the playoffs.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           THE LOCKER ROOM

           Fritz is on the phone.  His shoulder is packed with ice.  
           Behind him, celebration.  The season is over.  School’s 
           out for the summer. 

                                 FRITZ
                        It’s me!  Guess what!?!
                                (beat, disappointed)
                        Oh, you heard.  Good.  No.  No.  I’ll be 
                        home tomorrow.   First flight out.  OK, 
                        well, I lo--

           Click.  He looks at the phone and hangs up.
           EXT. FENWAY PARK-- THAT NIGHT

           The Yankee team bus sits waiting.  Players slowly making 
           their way out into the cold Boston fall.  A few fans 
           still linger for autographs.  A few reporters as well.  
           The players make time for both.

           Fritz and Mel Stottlemeyer emerge from the locker room in 
           street clothes.

                                 VOICE
                        Pete, you want to grab a drink?

           Fritz turns to see Gene Michael, short-stop and future 
           Yankee GM.

                                 FRITZ
                        Sorry, Stick.

                                 STICK
                        You sure?

           Michael gestures to two GIRLS, all “dolled up.”  They 
           don’t call him “Stick” for nothing.

                                 STICK (CONT’D)
                        Spotted them in right field, during the 
                        game.  Had the bat boy pass them a note.  
                        See if they wanted to meet a real live 
                        Yankee.

                                 FRITZ
                        Have fun.

           Michael and a couple of other players head off with the 
           girls.  Stottlemeyer heads for the bus.

           A car pulls up.  The driver gets out and heads inside.

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        You coming? 

                                 FRITZ
                        Yeah, one sec.

           Stottlemeyer gets on board, as Fritz heads over to legend-
           to-be Thurman Munson who is finishing an interview.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Tugs.  The bat boy just told me the 
                        heater on the bus is broken, but they 
                        sent a car for us.
           Fritz gestures to the sitting car.

                                 MUNSON
                        Guys, we got a car.

           Munson and a couple of other players rush into the car 
           and wait for the driver.

           Fritz gets aboard the bus, and watches out his window.

           FRITZ’S POV:  the confused driver comes out of the 
           stadium and heads to his car, only to discover it filled 
           with players.  After some discussion, the very angry 
           players get out and look towards the bus as... it drives 
           away.

           ON THE BUS

           Fritz laughs to himself.  The perfect crime.

           Fritz is approached by a reporter MAURY ALLEN.

                                 MAURY ALLEN
                        Pete, you got a sec?

                                 FRITZ
                        Sure, Maury, what do you need?

                                 MAURY ALLEN
                        Bullshit piece.  20 game winner, all-star 
                        year, blah blah blah, what do you have 
                        planned for the off-season?

                                 FRITZ
                        Sorry, Chip.  I was helping that new 
                        tenant move a few boxes in.  Nice people.

           He heads for the dining room and finds his wife MARILYN 
           “CHIP” PETERSON.  She is somewhat petite, and very 
           attractive, with long hair, but definitely bossy.  

                                 MARILYN
                        You don’t know if they’re nice people or 
                        not.  Why would you say that?

                                 FRITZ
                        Well, they seemed--

                                 MARILYN
                        And it’s not your job to help them move 
                        boxes.  You are the landlord, not some 
                        moving company.  If they are one day late 
                        with the rent...

           He’s heard all this before. 
                                 FRITZ
                        Right.

                                 MARILYN
                        Dinner’s ready.

           INT. PETERSON LIVING ROOM-- CONTINUOUS

           Fritz and Marilyn eat dinner in front of the TV.  

           Fritz turns it on and flips the channels.  Kent State.  
           Vietnam.  Something about Janice Joplin.  Ah, Lawrence 
           Welk!  Enough said.

           They do not speak for a long while.

                                 FRITZ
                        It’s delicious.  

                                 MARILYN
                        Thanks.

           More silence.

           INT. PETERSON BEDROOM-- LATER

           Close-up:  Marilyn’s head.

           Only, it’s not Marilyn’s head, it’s a Styrofoam head.  
           And on it sits a wig of Marilyn’s hair.

           Marilyn comes out of the bathroom-- her hair is naturally 
           shorter and thinner.  She walks by the wig, taking us to 
           the bed where Fritz awaits.

           She climbs into bed.

                                 MARILYN
                                (flat)
                        OK.

           That’s the starting gun.  Fritz kisses her a bit.  And 
           after enough of that, he climbs on top of her, as if by 
           rote.

           It’s over quickly.  That’s it.  

           They turn and face away from each other and go to bed.
           EXT. PETERSON HOUSE-- THE NEXT DAY

           Fritz outside his front door again.  Takes a deep breath 
           and goes inside.

                                 FRITZ
                                (before she can accuse him of 
                                 anything)
                        Sorry.

                                 MARILYN
                        Your sister called.

                                 FRITZ
                        They want to borrow the car.

                                 MARILYN
                        No.

                                 FRITZ
                        Are you using it?

                                 MARILYN
                        No, but I don’t want them borrowing it.  
                        That car costs too much money to be 
                        lending it out to just anyone.

                                 FRITZ
                        But she’s my sis--

                                 MARILYN
                        Dinner’s ready.

           Discussion over.

           INT. PETERSON LIVING ROOM-- CONTINUOUS

           Once again they eat in front of the TV.

                                 FRITZ
                        Delicious.  
                                (beat)
                        As always.

                                 MARILYN
                        Thanks.

           Marilyn gets up to clear the dishes.

                                 MARILYN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I got you this.
           As she walks away, she hands Fritz a BOOK.  The Art of 
           Marriage.

           INT. PETERSON BEDROOM-- LATER

           A wig-less Marilyn is fast asleep.  But the bed next to 
           her is empty.

           Fritz is still in the living room staring at The Art of 
           Marriage, still CLOSED.

           He picks it up and looks through it a bit.

           Fritz’s POV:  we see keywords like “pleasure”, “new 
           positions” etc.

           INT. BOWLING ALLEY-- THE NEXT DAY

           Fritz addresses his students.

                                 FRITZ
                        Some of you fellas are... married, right?

           A few nod.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        Have... uh... any of you ever... uh...  
                        heard of...

           Yes?

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        Never mind. 

           A hand goes up.  Fritz points to him.

                                 STUDENT #3
                        Coach, will this be on the final exam?

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. PETERSON BEDROOM-- LATER

           Fritz and Marilyn having sex again.  The same as before.  
           He finishes and rolls off her.  

           They lay separately.  Neither of them will speak of it.
                                 FRITZ
                        I got the schedule today.  Pitchers and 
                        catchers report at the end of February.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. YANKEE SPRING TRAINING, FT. LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA

           The first day of Spring Training, and it is a bit like 
           the first day of high school:  players and coaches 
           arriving, happy to see each other;  finding your locker; 
           getting your uniform and equipment.

           Fritz is holding court.  He is a different animal away 
           from Marilyn.

                                 FRITZ
                        ... ha, some negotiation.  I said, I made 
                        the all-star team last year and won 
                        twenty games.  They said the offer’s 
                        still the same.  So I said, “Oh yeah,” 
                        and they said, “Yeah,” so I said... “OK” 
                        and signed the deal.  I showed them.

           Everyone laughs.  That’s the business of baseball.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                                (re:  Thurman Munson)
                        Hey, Beer Can, what do you have there?

           Thurman Munson is reading a gun catalog.

                                 MUNSON
                        Check this out boys.
                                (points)
                        I am going to order me this beauty.

           It’s a pistol and a black leather holster.

                                 FRITZ
                        Make sure you get an extra extra large, 
                        Tug Boat.

           More laughter, even from Thurman, who always has trouble 
           with his weight.

                                 MUNSON
                        Very funny.
                                (smiling)
                        You better be careful once I get this 
                        thing.
                                 (MORE)
                                 MUNSON (CONT'D)
                                (yells)
                        Hey, Pete, some help here. 

           Pete Sheehy magically appears to help whatever player 
           calls.  Munson scribbles on the order form and writes a 
           check from his locker.  

                                 MUNSON (CONT’D)
                        Put this in the mail for me.

           Fritz is finishing getting dressed but he watches the 
           exchange with great interest.

           INT. PETE SHEEHY’S OFFICE-- A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Fritz pops his head in.

                                 FRITZ
                        Hey, Pete, can I see that thing Munson 
                        gave you?

           Sheehy smiles and hands it over.

                                 SHEEHY
                        You better hope nobody finds out it’s 
                        you.

                                 FRITZ
                        No problem, Thurman just asked me to make 
                        a few changes.  Let’s see...

           Fritz is crossing stuff out and marking a few things.

           EXT. TRAINING FIELDS-- LATER

           Fritz and the boys having a lazy throw-around.

                                 MEL
                        Jean and the kids are coming down next 
                        weekend.  Wait until you see Todd’s arm.  
                        Just like the old man.

                                 FRITZ
                        I know Marilyn would love to see her.

           VROOM!  VROOM!

           The players look over to see a motorcycle heading 
           practically right for the field.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        What--
           The bike stops.  The rider kicks the t-stand and gets off 
           the bike.  He wears a jean jacket and an old-fashioned 
           leather helmet.  Crazy.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        Who’s the Red Baron?

           The rider reaches into a case and pulls out... his 
           baseball mitt.  

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        That’s Mike Kekich.  We got him from the 
                        Dodgers.  Supposed to be the next Sandy 
                        Koufax.

           Mike heads towards them.

                                 MIKE
                        How you ladies doing today?

           Meet MIKE KEKICH.  A free spirit if there ever was.  His 
           hair is a little shaggy, his grin a little devilish, and 
           I don’t feel comfortable saying this about another man, 
           but he is really good-looking.

                                 MUNSON
                        Aw great, another lefty.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                                (yelling)
                        Kekich!

           It’s Ralph Houk.

                                 HOUK
                        I don’t know how you do things in 
                        Dodgertown, but on the Yankees, we report 
                        first thing in the morning.

                                 MIKE
                                (flashes a grin)
                        I know, but it was such a beautiful 
                        morning.

           They can’t believe he just said that to Ralph Houk!

                                 HOUK
                        Be on time tomorrow and ready to throw.  
                        Let’s see why the Dodgers would trade 
                        away...
                                (dismissive)
                        “the next Sandy Koufax.”
           Kekich heads off.  The players disperse except for Fritz 
           and Houk who watch Kekich go.

                                 HOUK (CONT’D)
                                (to Fritz)
                        Pete, word to the wise.  Steer clear of 
                        that guy.  You don’t need that kind of 
                        trouble.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM-- THE NEXT MORNING

           Fritz, Stottlemeyer and the guys are changing, when Pete 
           Sheehy brings over Mike.

                                 SHEEHY
                        You’ll be over here in the “nursery.”

                                 MIKE
                        The nursery?

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        Where they keep us babies!

                                 FRITZ
                        It’s a little something we call 
                        ourselves.  Right, guys?

           Stottlemeyer and the others are less than enthusiastic.  
           But Mike doesn’t let that bother him.

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        C’mon, Pete. Let’s hit the field.

           Fritz heads off, but throws a look back at Mike.

           EXT. FIELD-- LATER

           Joining a new team is a little bit like transferring to a 
           new school: everyone else already knows each other, and 
           they don’t want any new friends.

           Mike walks out on to the field, and all the other 
           pitchers are already long-throwing with each other.

           He stands there a second.  He knows the drill.

           Fritz sees Mike.  He’s been warned but...

           Fritz grabs a ball and throws it over to Mike.  FOOMP!  
           Right in his glove.
                                 FRITZ
                        So where are you from, Mike Kekich?

                                 MIKE
                        California, born and bred.  I’ll tell 
                        you, my wife wasn’t too happy about 
                        moving to New York.  You?

                                 FRITZ
                        Illinois.  My dad always wanted me to 
                        play for the White Sox.  Scout told me, 
                        sign with the Yanks.  They win 
                        championships. 

                                 MIKE
                        How many have you won?

                                 FRITZ
                        Hold on, let’s see...
                                (does the math)
                        ... zero.

           Mike laughs.

                                 MIKE
                        Well, it’s better than that poor bastard 
                        Herb Score.

                                 FRITZ
                        Yeah, it’s better than Herb Score.
                                (beat)
                        You know, Marilyn and I would love to 
                        have you and your wife over for dinner 
                        sometime. 

                                 MIKE
                        Ha.  No.

                                 FRITZ
                        What’s so funny? 

                                 MIKE
                        Susanne doesn’t come to spring training.  

                                 FRITZ
                        You got kids in school?

                                 MIKE
                        We’ve got kids, but that has nothing to 
                        do with it.  It’s just spring training... 
                        that’s my time.  You know?
                                 FRITZ
                                (oblivious)
                        What?

                                 MIKE
                        My time.

                                 FRITZ
                                (getting it)
                        Oh.  Riiight.

                                 MIKE
                        But how about we go “oiling” tonight?  
                        Grab a few drinks?

                                 FRITZ
                        Well, I’m not sure if my wife would--

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. PARROT LOUNGE-- NIGHT

           An old Florida watering hole. Mike and Fritz sit at the 
           bar “oiling.”  Mike makes a toast.

                                 MIKE
                        To Herb Score!

                                 FRITZ
                        Herb Score!

           They drink.

                                 MIKE
                        Poor bastard got hit by a liner and never 
                        pitched again.

           They both shake their head at this.  A pitcher can’t 
           imagine anything worse.

                                 FRITZ
                        At least it got him out of Cleveland.

                                 MIKE
                        So, what’s Houk like?  His bite worse 
                        than his bark?

                                 FRITZ
                        No, you’ll love him.  He’s got the rings.
                                (looks at his watch)
                        Well, it’s getting late.  I really should 
                        be going.
                                 MIKE
                                (to bartender)
                        Another round!

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

           LATER

           Mike sings some 50’s tune, while Fritz harmonizes.  It 
           sounds pretty good.

           The bar gives them a round of applause.

           The bartender puts down yet another round.

                                 BARTENDER
                        You guys sound pretty great.

                                 MIKE
                        Speaking of “great,” check out the talent 
                        at the end of the bar.

           He motions towards two great-looking girls at the far end 
           of the bar!

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s say hi.  C’mon.

           Before Fritz can object, Mike is heading over.  Fritz has 
           no choice but to follow. 

           This is NOT something he would ever do.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Ladies, I am... Doctor Gehrig.  And this 
                        is my associate.

           They all turn to face Fritz...

                                 FRITZ
                        ... Doctor Ruth.

           This is going to be fun.

                                 GIRL #1
                        We’re waiting for someone.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s fine.  We just wanted to ask you 
                        some questions.  

           Fritz whispers something into Mike’s ear.
                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Right, we’re doing a study for Psychology 
                        Today.  Very prestigious.  Can we ask you 
                        a few questions?

           The girls are a little confused.

                                 GIRL #1
                        I guess so.

                                 MIKE
                        OK, these are pretty routine... question 
                        one, do you hate your mother?

                                 GIRL #2
                        What?

                                 MIKE
                        That’s a very interesting reaction.  
                        Isn’t it, Dr. Ruth?  

                                 GIRL #2
                        It is?

                                 FRITZ
                        Very interesting.  You avoided the 
                        question.  Classic avoidance syndrome.

                                 MIKE
                        Yes, avoidance syndrome.  Classic.

           The two girls are now mouths agape.  What could this all 
           mean?

                                 GIRL #1
                        Please sit down.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           LATER

           Empty glasses lined up on the bar.

                                 GIRL #1
                                (a little drunk, confused)
                        We should make out with each other?

                                 GIRL #2
                        Really?

                                 MIKE
                        I think so, and I am a doctor.
           That’s it for Fritz.

                                 FRITZ
                        Dr. Gehrig, I should go.  I have surgery 
                        in the morning.  

                                 MIKE
                        I thought that was canceled.  

                                 FRITZ
                        No, it wasn’t canceled.

                                 MIKE
                        You’re sure.

                                 FRITZ
                        I’m sure.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ll take it from here then.  Doctor.

                                 FRITZ
                        Doctor.

           Fritz heads out the door.  Looks back at Mike and the 
           girls.  What a night!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. PETERSON SPRING TRAINING BEDROOM-- MORNING

           The Florida sun blazes across the sleeping face of Fritz 
           and finally wakes him.  His head hurts a bit.  He 
           struggles to get up and finally heads downstairs.

           INT. PETERSON SPRING TRAINING DOWNSTAIRS-- CONTINUOUS

           Fritz starts down the stairs, but stops when he hears 
           something... something very strange... something he 
           hasn’t heard in a long time.  It’s...

           Marilyn LAUGHING.

           Fritz looks down and sees Mike and Marilyn having 
           breakfast, and Marilyn is giggling like a school girl.  
           Fritz listens a moment.

                                 MARILYN
                        ... when will I get to meet her and your 
                        daughters? 
                                 MIKE
                        Well, she didn’t want to come to Florida.  
                        She hates oranges.  Bit of a racist.

           Marilyn laughs.

           Fritz heads down the rest of the stairs.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                                (arch)
                        Oh my God, Pete, what are you doing here!  
                        You weren’t supposed to be home for 
                        hours!

                                 FRITZ
                                (playing along)
                        Well, well, well.  My new best pal and my 
                        wife.

                                 MIKE
                        Fritz, there’s something we’ve been 
                        meaning to tell you.  But just didn’t 
                        know how.

                                 FRITZ
                        You can start by getting out of my chair.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s OK, I just swung by to make sure 
                        you were OK.  Marilyn, absolutely 
                        delicious.  The food wasn’t bad either.

                                 MARILYN
                                (laughs)
                        Any time.

           Fritz shows Mike to the door.

                                 FRITZ
                        Last night was hilarious.  How come you 
                        told them we were doctors?

                                 MIKE
                        I always thought I’d be a good doctor.

           They pass the copy of The Art of Marriage.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

                                 FRITZ
                        Nothing.  
                                 MIKE
                        See you soon, Petersons.

           Mike leaves, and we see his bike right outside.  He 
           starts it with a loud rev and heads out.

                                 FRITZ
                        Sorry about staying out so late last 
                        night.

                                 MARILYN
                        It’s OK.  

                                 FRITZ
                                (surprised)
                        It is?  Great.  Mike’s a nice guy.

           Uh-oh.  What is she going to say.

                                 MARILYN
                        He seems so.  Now sit down, I made you 
                        some breakfast.

           Fritz sits.  A little bit shocked.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. LOCKER ROOM-- A WEEK LATER

                                 MUNSON
                        Son of a bitch!

           We pull back to see Thurman Munson in his underwear 
           holding up a tiny little derringer gun for ladies.  It 
           matches well with his tiny holster that he can’t fit 
           around his belly.

                                 MUNSON (CONT’D)
                        They sent me the wrong gun, the wrong 
                        holster, and worst of all, it’s for a 
                        lefty.  I’m right-handed.  Peeeeeeeete!

           Fritz is biting his hand.  Other guys in the locker room 
           are laughing hysterically.

           Pete Sheehy appears.  Thurman hands him the box, the gun 
           and the holster.

                                 MUNSON (CONT’D)
                        Send this piece of shit back and tell 
                        them to send me the gun I ordered.
           Thurman finishes getting dressed and heads out to 
           practice.  Other players follow.  Fritz lingers behind.

           INT. PETE SHEEHY’S OFFICE-- A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Pete is just putting the gun down on his desk, when Fritz 
           sneaks in.

                                 FRITZ
                        Hey, Pete.

                                 SHEEHY
                        I thought I might see you.

                                 FRITZ
                        Take a letter...

           Pete pulls out a piece of paper.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        “To the Stenbridge Gun Company.  From 
                        Thurman Munson, New York Yankees catcher.  
                        Dear sirs, I received my gun, and I love 
                        it! 

           Sheehy smiles.

           EXT. SPRING TRAINING GAME, YANKEES VS. PHILLIES-- LATER 
           THAT DAY

           Kekich goes into his wind-up, blazes a ball right down 
           the middle of the plate and.... THWACK!  The batter 
           drives it out of the ball park.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Spring training may not count but Mike 
                        Kekich is getting killed by the boys from 
                        Philadelphia.

           Fritz watches from the dugout as Houk walks out and takes 
           the ball from Kekich.

           Mike heads for the bench near Fritz and Stottlemeyer.  
           You wouldn’t know he just got taken out of a game.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, Amigo.  Why the long face?

                                 FRITZ
                        The Phils stuck it to you.
                                 MIKE
                        Eh, it’s spring training.  Too many late 
                        nights, you know.

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        Great.

           Stottlemeyer doesn’t care for Mike’s attitude.  He heads 
           into the clubhouse.  

                                 MIKE
                        I think I may have picked up a little 
                        virus.  Doc says there’s something going 
                        around, and I agree with his diagnosis.

                                 FRITZ
                        Well, they’re sitting on your fastball, 
                        Virus.

                                 MIKE
                                (defensive)
                        It’s faster than yours.

                                 FRITZ
                        That may be.  But it’s nothing without 
                        control.  You ever throw a palm ball?

                                 MIKE
                        Palm ball?  That doesn’t sound fast.

                                 FRITZ
                        Jim Bouton taught me when I first came 
                        up.
                                (holds up a baseball with a 
                                 palm grip)
                        You never learned to pitch, did you 
                        Virus?  You just get out there and throw 
                        as hard as you can?

                                 MIKE
                        That’s how I do everything.  Let it all 
                        hang out!

           More true than he realizes.

                                 FRITZ
                        You have to learn to think about every 
                        move you are going to make, and then, 
                        only then, throw the ball... in control.  
                                (beat)
                        I’ll take control every day of the week. 

           Mike takes the ball and tries it.
                                 MIKE
                        Palm ball, huh?  Needs a cooler name.

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. YANKEE STADIUM-- A FEW WEEKS LATER

           The stadium is packed to the gills, and the crowd is 
           going nuts.

           Mike Kekich goes into his wind-up and throws... for a 
           ball.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Low and outside.  A ball and two strikes.  
                        Mike Kekich looking for his first win as 
                        a New York Yankee.

                                 ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
                        That looked like some sort of off-speed 
                        pitch.

           Munson throws the ball back, and crouches down to give 
           the sign.

           Mike goes into his wind-up again... 

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Kekich has been keeping the Tigers off 
                        balance all night with that one.  Here’s 
                        the pitch... fastball... strike three!  
                        The Yankees beat the Detroit Tigers 5-2 
                        thanks to an outstanding performance from 
                        Mike Kekich.

                                 ANNOUNCER #2  (V.O.)
                        You know they call him the next Sandy 
                        Koufax.

           INT. YANKEE STADIUM LOCKER ROOM-- LATER

           Post-game frivolity.  Everyone gabbing and having a good 
           time, except for Fritz who picks up the clubhouse phone.

                                 FRITZ
                                (into phone)
                        Hi, Sally.  It’s Fritz Peterson, can you 
                        connect me to my home number.  Thanks.

           After a few seconds, Marilyn picks up.
                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                                (on the phone)
                        Hey... but Chip, the game just ended.  
                        OK, I’ll be home within the hour... Half 
                        hour.  OK.  Hey, Mike won his first game.  
                        Yeah.

           He hangs up and starts to get dressed.

           EXT. YANKEE STADIUM-- LATER THAT NIGHT

           It is drizzling out, but the autograph hounds are out in 
           force.

           Fritz exits the stadium and sees Mike surrounded by fans.

                                 MIKE
                        Who wants an autograph from the Yankees 
                        newest star?!?

           The fans laugh.  He is a natural with them.

           Fritz starts to head for his car when...

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, you all recognize All-Star pitcher 
                        Fritz Peterson.  I taught him everything 
                        he knows.  
                                (shoots a look to Fritz)
                        His autograph isn’t worth as much, but 
                        you should still get it.  

                                 FRITZ
                                (to fans, awkward)
                        Hi... fans...

           Some fans move over to Fritz to get his autograph.

                                 MIKE
                        Pete, you wanna get a drink?

                                 FRITZ
                        Can’t.  Marilyn.

           Fritz signs another one and then heads into the parking 
           lot, disappointing those that didn’t get signatures

           The rain is starting to come down now.

           A car pulls up near the gate and HONKS its horn.

           Fritz turns to look.
                                 MIKE
                                (to fans)
                        Hold on, hold on.  I’ll be right back.

           Fritz watches as Mike runs out into the rain, and heads 
           over to the driver side of the car.

           Mike begins talking to the driver.  The talk gets more 
           and more animated.  Mike is yelling.

           Fritz approaches.  As he gets closer he can hear the 
           argument.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                                (yelling)
                        I spent that money.  It was my money.

                                 VOICE
                                (upset)
                        You left us in LA with my parents.  I had 
                        to borrow from them.

                                 MIKE
                                (yelling)
                        I don’t want to talk about this.

           Mike looks up to see Fritz.  The argument stops.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Pete, hey.  

                                 FRITZ
                        Hey.

           Fritz can now see that there is a woman driving the car.  
           Even seated, he can tell she is slim, cute and athletic.

                                 MIKE
                        This is my wife.  Susanne, this is Fritz 
                        Peterson.  And that’s Kirsten in the 
                        front, and that little bug in the back is 
                        Reagan.

           Kirsten, age 5, sits in the front seat.  Reagan, almost 
           2, sits in the back with a stuffed animal.  That’s right, 
           no car seats.  

                                 KIRSTEN/REAGAN
                        Hi,
                                 FRITZ
                        Hi.
                                (to Susanne)
                        Nice to meet you.

                                 SUSANNE
                        It better be.  It’s raining.

                                 FRITZ
                        It’s worth it.  

           She laughs.

                                 MIKE
                        We should get going.

                                 FRITZ
                        Yeah, me too.

           Starts to go.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        Hey, after this next road trip, we should 
                        all get together some time.  The four of 
                        us.  You, Mike, me, and Marilyn.

           Trailer moment.  Sorry, couldn’t resist.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           FUCKING

           There’s no other word for it.  But it’s not who you 
           think... yet.  We are...

           INT. CRAPPY BALTIMORE HOTEL-- NIGHT

           Mike has a blonde bent over the bed and is having his way 
           with her.  Loud.  

           Suddenly, a lamp goes on.  We see...

           Fritz trying to sleep in the other bed.

                                 FRITZ
                                (groggy)
                        Hey--

           Mike turns to talk without missing a beat.
                                 MIKE
                        Sorry, roomie, did we wake you?

                                 FRITZ
                                (sarcastic)
                        Oh, no.  This is when I like to wake up 
                        on the days I pitch.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, where are my manners.  Pete, this 
                        is....

           She speaks with a thick “Bal-mar” accent.

                                 BLONDE
                        Barbara. 

                                 MIKE
                        Pete, this is Barbara.

                                 FRITZ
                        Hi.  

                                 BLONDE
                        Charmed.

                                 FRITZ
                        Do you think you guys could, you know...

                                 MIKE
                        Say no more.  We will move the party to 
                        the guest room.  

           Mike and Barbara open the door to the bathroom and head 
           in.  The door closes behind them.

           Fritz turns off his light as the fucking starts again.

           Fritz lays there listening and listening in disbelief.

           EXT. BALTIMORE STADIUM

           The Orioles line up to shake hands.  The scoreboard reads 
           Orioles 3, Yankees 2.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        A heartbreaker for Fritz Peterson and the 
                        New York Yankees.  Those Yankee bats have 
                        got to wake up.
           INT. BALTIMORE VISITORS’ LOCKER ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Fritz and Mel Stottlemeyer getting dressed together.  
           Fritz is thinking about last night.

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        Tough loss.  White should have made that 
                        throw, for a change.

                                 FRITZ
                        Hmmm.

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        You OK?  You seem... I don’t know... 
                        distant.

                                 FRITZ
                        Mel, let me ask you something.  

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        Sure.

                                 FRITZ
                        You and Jean...

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        Uh-huh?

                                 FRITZ
                        Well...  do you...  No... Have you 
                        ever... 

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        Pete, what is it?  You know you can ask 
                        me anything.

                                 FRITZ
                        It’s about sex.

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        Oh.  I should go.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           THWACK

           A racket hits a tennis ball.  TWACK.  It’s quite a rally.

           Reveal:  Fritz playing tennis with Susanne.  Kirsten and 
           Reagan play with dolls as Mike and Marilyn drink ice teas 
           and look on.
                                 MIKE
                        What do you say winner buys dinner?

                                 FRITZ
                                (hitting a great forehand)
                        I have to buy dinner.  You blew all your 
                        money on a house with a tennis court.  

           Everyone laughs.  Except maybe Susanne.

                                 MIKE
                        I love this house.  The kids love this 
                        house.  Right?

                                 KIRSTEN/REAGAN
                        Yeah!  Yes!

                                 FRITZ
                        You don’t even play tennis.

           Everyone laughs again as Fritz and Susanne hit the ball 
           back and forth.  They are well-matched.

           Fritz looks over at Mike and Marilyn who are thick as 
           thieves.  

           FRITZ’S POV:  Mike and Marilyn laughing a little loud.  
           Playful touching.  “Oh, Mike, stop it!”

                                                                 CUT TO:

                        Game.  You should have had that.

                                 FRITZ
                        Huh?  Oh, yeah.

                                 MIKE
                        Alright, Susanne!  C’mon, let’s throw 
                        some steaks on the grill.
           Mike and Marilyn head towards the house.

                                 SUSANNE
                        Mike, the kids...

           Either Mike didn’t hear or he chose not to.

           Fritz starts to follow when...

                                 SUSANNE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, a little help!  My husband can 
                        ignore me, but you’re not allowed to.

                                 FRITZ
                        I’m sorry.  Sorry.

                                 SUSANNE
                        You don’t have to apologize for anything.  
                        I was kidding. 
                                (re: kids)
                        Now, give me a hand with these munchkins.

           Susanne picks up Reagan, and Fritz grabs Kirsten.

                                 FRITZ
                        You hungry?

                        Uh-huh, Unca Fritz.

           That’s sweet.

                                                                 CUT TO:

                        A reborn Mike Kekich goes all the way for 
                        the Yankees.  They beat the Kansas City 
                        Royals 6 to 5.

           INT. BAR, KANSAS CITY-- NIGHT

           Mike and Fritz out for a drink.  Actually they have had a 
           few, and they have a few shots sitting in front of them.
                                 MIKE
                        What the fuck are we doing in Kansas 
                        City?

                                 FRITZ
                        We’re playing the Royals.

                                 MIKE
                        It could be worse.  We could be in...

                                 FRITZ/MIKE
                                (same time)
                        Cleveland.

           The door to the bar opens.

                                 MIKE
                        Look... stews.

           Fritz turns to see a flight crew of stewardesses sitting 
           down at the other end of the bar.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        The trick is you separate the weak ones 
                        from the herd.  Then fuck ‘em.

           Fritz laughs.  Starts to get up.

                                 FRITZ
                                (yawns)
                        I should head back.

                                 MIKE
                                (mocking)
                        I should head back.  I’m going to buy 
                        more real estate and get yelled at by my 
                        wife.
                                (downs a shot)
                        Don’t be such a pussy.  

                                 FRITZ
                        Fuck you.

                                 MIKE
                        Alright, fuck me.  But seriously, where 
                        are you going, Pete?

                                 FRITZ
                        Stop it.
                                 MIKE
                        She can’t yell at you here.  Where are 
                        you going?  We’re in fucking... where are 
                        we?

                                 FRITZ
                        Kansas City.

                                 MIKE
                        We’re in fucking Kansas City.  Who’s 
                        going to know?

           Fritz doesn’t answer.

           Fritz and Mike and the Stewardesses at a table, laughing 
           it up.

                                (to the bartender)
                        I love that song!  Turn it up!

           The bartender does.  

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Who wants to dance?  Pete?

                                 FRITZ
                        Sure.

           Fritz takes Mike’s hand “romantically.”  They move closer 
           to each other and get ready to dance.  The stewardesses 
           giggle.

           Mike grabs a girl.  Fritz grabs one too.  They start 
           dancing.  Real close.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                                (to stewardess)
                        I’m married.

                                 STEWARDESS
                        Ha, OK.

                                 FRITZ
                        I just want to be clear.  Nothing can 
                        happen.

                                                                 CUT TO:

                                 FRITZ
                        This can never happen again.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Fritz and Marilyn in bed together.  Her head comes up 
           from under the blankets.

                                 MARILYN
                        I don’t like it.  It’s wrong.

                                 FRITZ
                                (kissing)

                                 MARILYN
                        No.

                                 FRITZ
                        C’mon!

                                 MARILYN
                        Where is this coming from?

           Uh-oh.

                                 FRITZ
                        You know... you got me that book and I 
                        thought...

                                 MARILYN
                        No.

           Fritz gives up.  They have their usual sex, and Marilyn 
           heads to the bathroom.

           Fritz lays there.  That was soooo quick.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           SPLASH!  Mike jumps into the swimming pool getting 
           everyone-- Fritz, Susanne, Marilyn and the kids-- wet.  A 
           splash fight ensues.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Both couples out on a big sailboat.  Lots of laughs.

           The Petersons and the Kekiches standing around the piano.  
           Fritz plays a bit, and the four of them sing.  Just a 
           typical Saturday night for the foursome.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. FRONT DOOR-- NIGHT

           Fritz, holding flowers, approaches nervously and rings 
           the bell, like he is picking up his prom date.

           The door opens.  It’s... the stewardess, Karen.

                                 KAREN
                                (re: flowers)
                        For me?  You shouldn’t have. 

           INT. CLUB-- KANSAS CITY

           Fritz and Karen slow dance, along with a few other 
           couples.  

           The song ends.  She heads to the ladies room.  He heads 
           to the bar where he finds...

           Mike, Stick, a couple of other players and some girls.  
           Stick is finishing some wild story.
                                 STICK
                        ... she’s two-timing him.  And he only 
                        figures it out, because she keeps going 
                        to the beauty parlor and getting her hair 
                        done.

           Everyone laughs.

                                 FRITZ
                                (re: girls)
                        Hey, boys.  Who do we have here?

                                 STICK
                        This is Lois and Lana.  Lucky for us, 
                        they always wanted to meet some real live 
                        Yankees.

                                 MIKE
                        We’re thinking of heading over to Charlie 
                        O’s.  

                                 FRITZ
                        Eh, I think Karen and I are going to call 
                        it a night.

                                 MIKE
                        Jesus, Pete, only you could get married 
                        twice.  

           Off Fritz’s confused look.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        She’s a road girl.  You’re not supposed 
                        to be so... serious.  That’s the point.

                                 FRITZ
                        It’s not that serious.

                                 MIKE
                        Whatever you say.

           Fritz walks away back to his table.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                                (calling after.)
                        You’re welcome by the way.

           Fritz looks back him.  What?

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        You never would have even done this if 
                        not for me.
           Very true.

           INT. KAREN’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Fritz and Karen lay in bed together, her head nuzzling 
           his shoulder.  They look so comfortable.

                                 FRITZ
                        Tomorrow’s our last game in KC.  But 
                        maybe you could meet me in Chicago in 
                        three weeks. 

                                 KAREN
                        Yeah, I’ll swap flights with someone on 
                        the Chicago run.  

           Karen has something important she wants to ask.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        You know, I was thinking... about when 
                        the season ends, and maybe you and I 
                        could--

                                 FRITZ
                        Karen, no.  I’m sorry. 

           She is hurt by this.

                                 KAREN
                                (backpedaling, tears)
                        No, no.  My fault.  I shouldn’t have said 
                        anything. Stupid.  I just thought...

                                 FRITZ
                        I’ve always been honest with you.  I 
                        won’t divorce Marilyn.  I could never 
                        leave her in the lurch.  I can’t do that 
                        to her.

                                 KAREN
                        I know.

           Karen runs out to the bathroom leaving Fritz to 
           contemplate the decision he made there.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           SWACK!

           The Tigers batter pops one practically straight up.  We 
           are...
           INT. YANKEE STADIUM-- A FEW WEEKS LATER

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        That’s going a mile high, back behind the 
                        plate.  Shouldn’t be a problem for 
                        Munson.

           The ball lands right in Munson’s glove.

                                 ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
                        And that’s the ball game.  Yankees over 
                        the Tigers 3-0.  The Yanks starting to 
                        build some momentum and put something 
                        together.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM-- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Fritz comes out of the shower and starts changing next to 
           Mel.  Mel eyes him-- no more weird talk!

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        Are you going to Maury’s party?

                                 FRITZ
                        I have to convince you-know-who.

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        Tell her it will be fun.  

                                 FRITZ
                        You think Maury would be OK if we brought 
                        the Kekiches?

           Stottlemeyer makes a face.

           Suddenly...

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                                (screaming)
                        Son of a bitch!

           Everyone turns to see a very angry Thurman Munson holding 
           an even smaller gun and holster set.

                                 MUNSON
                        Those fuckers did it again!
           INT. PETERSON HOUSE - A FEW DAYS LATER

           Fritz is waiting in the living room for Marilyn to get 
           ready.  He plays with their dog.

                                 FRITZ
                        C’mon, Chip, we’re going to be late.
                                (beat)
                        By the way, Mike and Susanne are going to 
                        be there.  

                                 MARILYN (O.S.)
                        Why didn’t you tell me?  I need a few 
                        more minutes.

           Fritz sighs and goes back to playing with the dog.

           INT. MAURY ALLEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A nice suburban house.  The party is already going.  A 
           nice mix of some players and some reporters that Maury is 
           friendly with.

           Mel and Jean Stottlemeyer are there, trying to talk with 
           Mike and Susanne.  The Munsons too.

           The door bell rings.  Maury heads off to answer it.  

                                 MAURY ALLEN
                        Hey everyone, Fritz and Marilyn are here.

           Fritz and Marilyn enter only there is something different 
           tonight.

           Marilyn is NOT wearing her wig.  Instead it is her 
           NATURAL HAIR.  It is surprising and stunning. 

                                 MAURY ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        Can I get you guys something to drink?

                                 FRITZ
                        I’ll have a beer.  And Marilyn will have 
                        a ginger ale.

                                 MARILYN
                        I’ll have a glass of wine.

           Fritz almost does a double-take.

                                 MAURY ALLEN
                        Great.
           Maury heads off as the Petersons mingle.

                                 SUSANNE
                        Marilyn, you look fantastic tonight.

                                 MIKE
                        Definitely.

           INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

           The table has been extended so that 12 chairs can go 
           around it.

           Mike is across from Susanne.  Marilyn is next to him, and 
           Mike is next to Susanne.  Chit-chat all around.

                                 MAURY ALLEN
                        No, it’s true, CBS is looking for a 
                        buyer.  

                                 FRITZ
                        Maybe I should buy the team.  Then I can 
                        underpay myself.

           Everyone laughs.  

                                 MAURY ALLEN
                        George Steinbrenner is trying to put an 
                        offer together.

                                 MIKE
                        Who?

                                 FRITZ
                                (To Susanne)
                        Sorry.

                                 SUSANNE
                        What?

                                 FRITZ
                        I think I kicked you.  Sorry.

                                 SUSANNE
                        No problem.

           Unseen by anyone, Susanne kicks Fritz under the table.  
           He looks at her.  Did you just do that?

           Susanne smiles devilishly.
                                 MAURY ALLEN
                        Guy tried to buy the Indians last year.  
                        From Cleveland.  He’s in shipbuilding.

           Fritz kicks her back. 

                                 FRITZ
                        What’s he know about baseball?

           It’s an all-out game of footsie, and nobody suspects 
           anything, least of all their spouses.  

                                 MAURY ALLEN
                        Nothing.

           Fritz holds her foot down with his foot.

                                 FRITZ
                        That’s all we need running the Yankees...

           To make him let go, Susanne gives him a slightly harder 
           kick.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        ... a guy from Cleveland.  Owwwww!

           Everyone looks.  What’s going on?

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        Can someone pass the potatoes?

                                 MARILYN
                        You’ve had enough potatoes.

           Susanne giggles to herself.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           LATER AT THE PARTY

           Everyone’s having a great time, especially the Kekiches 
           and Petersons who DRINK and SING around a piano.

           We notice that Mike seems to be standing more with 
           Marilyn and Fritz seems to be closer to Susanne.

           FRITZ’s POV:  Susanne laughing and looking so pretty.

           Fritz turns to see:  Mike and Marilyn LAUGHING together.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           EXT. MAURY ALLEN’S HOUSE - LATER    

           The party is breaking up.  The Kekiches and the Petersons 
           exit laughing.

                                 ALL
                        Good night, Maury.  Thanks!  Delicious!

           The foursome head for the cars which are parked one 
           behind the other.

                                 FRITZ
                        So much fun.

                                 ALL
                        Yeah.  Definitely.  Fun.

                                 MIKE
                        Too bad it has to end.

                                 ALL
                        Yeah.  Too bad.  Fun.

           They all pause for a second by the cars.  Where is this 
           going?

                                 FRITZ
                        You know.. this evening doesn’t have to 
                        end.  Maybe we could all head to the Fort 
                        Lee Diner?  They are open late.

           Fritz looks at Susanne.  She is gorgeous, even in the low 
           light.

           Before anyone says anything he adds...

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        Susanne can ride with me... if she wants.  
                        Mike, why don’t you take Marilyn?

           Fritz can’t believe he said it.  What is Marilyn going to 
           say?  What is Marilyn going to say?

                                 MARILYN
                        Great.  We’ll see you there.

           Marilyn and Mike get into his convertible.  Susanne and 
           Fritz get in his very sensible car.

                                 SUSANNE
                        I’m glad you thought of this.
                                 FRITZ
                        Me too.

           They drive off.

           INT. FORT LEE DINER - AN HOUR LATER

           Fritz and Susanne sit across from each other in a booth 
           eating ice cream-- like a Norman Rockwell painting. 

                                  FRITZ
                        So, what’s it like being married to Mike?

                                 SUSANNE
                        Ha.  I was going to ask you the same 
                        question.

           He is completely smitten with her.

                                 FRITZ
                        Seriously.

                                 SUSANNE
                        Well, you know Mike.  He’s full of... 
                        zest.

                                 FRITZ
                                (laughing)
                        Yeah, zest.  You know, he told me you‘ve 
                        been running some kind of races?

                                 SUSANNE
                        I can’t believe he even was paying 
                        attention.  They’re not “races.”  It’s 
                        just cross country.  To keep in shape.

                                 FRITZ
                        You know, I ran track back in high 
                        school.  Heck, I teach track among other 
                        things, during the off season.

           Small world.

                                (re: Mike and Marilyn)
                        Boy, I hope they didn’t get lost or 
                        something.

                                 SUSANNE
                        Probably not.

                                 FRITZ
                        Probably not.
           They laugh.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                                (a little giddy)
                        God, it feels so great just to talk.

                                 SUSANNE
                        I know.  I’m with the kids all day, and 
                        Mike’s...

                                 FRITZ
                        ... zesty.

           She smiles at him.  Finally... Mike and Marilyn show up.  
           Marilyn looks disheveled, if you know what I mean.

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry.

                                 FRITZ
                        No problem, we were just talking.

                                 MARILYN
                                (not)
                        Us too.

           INT. PETERSON BEDROOM-- THAT NIGHT

           Fritz climbs into bed.  Marilyn is already in bed  
           watching a little TV.

                                 MARILYN
                        Good night, honey.

                                 FRITZ
                        Good night.

           They kiss good night.  Not a word about the evening is 
           said.

           Fritz turns off his light and goes to sleep.

           On the TV, once again see... The Gulden’s Mustard 
           Commercial.

                        All the Howards love Gulden’s mustard!

           Marilyn turns the TV off and goes to bed.
           INT. LOCKER ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Fritz enters the empty locker room.  He makes a bee-line 
           for Munson’s locker and adds an envelope to Munson’s fan 
           mail.

           Fritz heads to his locker as other players drift in 
           including Mike.

                                 COACH
                                (screaming from across the 
                                 room)
                        Kekich, you’re dropping your arm on your 
                        curve.  Keep an eye on that.

                                 MIKE
                        Fuck you.

           Mike pulls a medical text book from his locker.  

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                                (to Fritz)
                        Hey, check this out.  Did you know your 
                        left lung is smaller than your right 
                        lung?  It’s to make room for your heart.  
                        This shit is fascinating.

           We see Thurman Munson start to sort through his mail.

                                 FRITZ
                        So... uh... that was... fun.  Last night.

                                 MIKE
                                (like it was nothing)
                        Yeah, we should do it again.

                                 FRITZ
                        Really?  Yeah.  Definitely!

           Munson comes running up.

                                 MUNSON
                        Hey, Guys!  They want me and my family 
                        for a new Gulden’s mustard commercial. 

                                 FRITZ
                        What?  You’re kidding.

                                 MUNSON
                        No.
                                (re: letter)
                        Look!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MUNSON (CONT'D)
                                (all serious)
                        All the Munsons love Gulden’s mustard.  
                        Fuck.  I hate mustard.  Gives me 
                        heartburn.  Hell, I’m going to be rich!

           Munson runs off to call his wife.

           Beat.

           Mike and Fritz laugh like bastards.

           EXT. PETERSON HOUSE-- THE NEXT NIGHT

           Fritz and Marilyn say goodbye to the dog, lock up and 
           walk out to their car, all dressed up.

                                 MARILYN
                                (giddy)
                        We’re going to be late.

                                 FRITZ
                        No, no, we’re fine.

           Next door, a NEIGHBOR is getting out of his car.

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        Hey Marilyn, finally got Fritz to take 
                        you out to dinner, huh?

           Marilyn smiles and nods as they get into the car and 
           drive off.

           INT. STEAK AND ALE - NIGHT - LATER

           They make a heck of a steak.  A perfect spot for a date 
           night out with your wife.

           Mike and Susanne are sitting at the bar having a drink 
           when Fritz and Marilyn arrive.

                                 MARILYN
                        I told you we would be late.

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t sweat it.  We got here a little 
                        early, had a drink.

           This seems to calm down Marilyn.

                                 FRITZ
                        Hi.
                                 SUSANNE
                        Hi.

           Fritz and Susanne smile at each other.

           The hostess approaches.

                                 HOSTESS
                        Folks, your table is ready.

           AT THE TABLE - LATER

           The two couples sit having a drink, looking at menus.

                                 MIKE
                        A toast!  To the Yankees.  This is the 
                        year we win it all!

                                 ALL
                        To the Yankees!

                                 MIKE
                        And to our beautiful ladies!

           He’s a smooth one.

           They all toast.

                                 FRITZ
                                (re: menu)
                        So... who’s in the mood for a steak?

           Marilyn and Mike exchange a look.

                                 MIKE
                        You know what, Pete?  Marilyn and I were 
                        going to go take a drive.

                                 FRITZ
                        What about dinner?

                                 MARILYN
                        We’ll... get something later.

                                 MIKE
                        Besides, you guys should be alone 
                        together.

           Mike and Marilyn move to leave.
                                 FRITZ
                        Look, I don’t exactly know what we’re 
                        doing here... or what last night was... 
                        but it’s great, really great...

           Everyone nods.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        ... And I thought maybe, we should... I 
                        don’t know... lay down a few ground 
                        rules.  So nobody gets hurt.

           How could anybody get hurt?

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t be such a fuddy-duddy.  We’re just 
                        having some fun, grandma.

           Everyone laughs.

                                 FRITZ
                        I know, I know.  But, I’ve been 
                        thinking...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           FLASHBACK

           Fritz watching Mike having sex in the hotel room.

                                                            CUT BACK TO:

           STEAK AND ALE

                                 FRITZ
                        Let’s just agree... so we can all stay 
                        friends... that there won’t be any... you 
                        know... sex.

           Mike and Marilyn exchange a look.

                                 MIKE
                        Fine.  Good idea.

                                 MARILYN/SUSANNE
                        Yes.  Of course.

                                 FRITZ
                        Alright.  Great.  We’ve got this totally 
                        under control.  This is really working 
                        out great.
           Now, Marilyn and Mike make their move to leave.

                                 MARILYN
                        Bye, Susanne.

                                 MIKE
                        Bye, Babe.

           Marilyn practically grabs Mike’s hand and pulls him out 
           of there.

           Fritz and Susanne don’t seem to notice... or care.

                                 FRITZ
                        We should order.  Waiter...

           INT. STEAK AND ALE - LATER

           Fritz and Susanne eating and having a great time.

                                 FRITZ
                        I’ve got it all planned out.

                                 SUSANNE
                                (teasing)
                        You?

           That makes him laugh.

                                 FRITZ
                        I’ll pitch a few more years.  Win a World 
                        Series.  By then I’ll have my degree, and 
                        I’ll be ready to coach back at Northern 
                        Illinois.  Unless I go the announcer 
                        route.

                                 SUSANNE
                        Wow.  Mike can’t even tell me if he’s 
                        coming home for dinner tomorrow.

           UNDER THE TABLE

           Susanne engages Fritz in a little more footsie.

           EXT. NITE LITE MOTEL

           Convenient to the Lincoln Tunnel.  Mike’s convertible is 
           sitting parked outside room 4.

           The camera peeks into the room to see...
           Mike and Marilyn “breaking the ground rules.”

           EXT. YANKEE STADIUM - THE NEXT DAY

           Fritz entering the players’ entrance when... HONK!  HONK!

           Fritz looks up to see Thurman Munson driving a brand new 
           Ford Thunderbird.  Guys gather around to take a look.

                                 MUNSON
                        Check it out!  Got it this morning!

                                 FRITZ
                        Wow!

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        This must have set you back good.

                                 MUNSON
                        Uh-uh.  I used the Gulden’s Mustard 
                        commercial money.

           There is a giggle or two.

                                 MUNSON (CONT’D)
                        What?

           Then it explodes into a circle of laughter.

                                 MUNSON (CONT’D)
                        What’s so funny?

           The crowd disperses as Mike drives up.  Fritz heads over.

                                 FRITZ
                        You guys got in late last night, did you--

                                 MIKE
                        I love her, man.

                                 FRITZ
                        What?

                                 MIKE
                        I love her.  You’re so lucky to be 
                        married to someone like Marilyn.

                                 FRITZ
                        Marilyn Peterson?

                                 MIKE
                        Oh stop.  She’s... incredible.
           Oh boy.

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. STEAK AND ALE - NIGHT

           Fritz and Susanne on a date.  Fritz doesn’t know how to 
           tell her.

                                 FRITZ
                        He loves her.

                                 SUSANNE
                        I know, he told me.

                                 FRITZ
                        He wrote her a poem.

                                 SUSANNE
                        Mike’s good.  Heck, I fell for it.  It’s 
                        why we got married so young.  
                                (remembering)
                        I was eighteen years old, and he can make 
                        you feel like the most special person on 
                        earth.
                                (beat)
                        And he can also make regret that feeling 
                        for the rest of your life.

           Fritz looks at Susanne with new appreciation.

                                 SUSANNE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t sweat it.  Mike falls in love a 
                        lot.

                                 FRITZ
                        You want to catch a movie?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. YANKEE STADIUM - A FEW

           Fritz and Mike are changing into their uniforms as Munson 
           comes stomping by angrily.

                                 MIKE
                        What happened to the car?

                                 MUNSON
                        They’re going to take it back.  
                                (yelling to all)

                        I hope whoever did it finds that funny 
                        too!

           Munson open his locker.  Hanging there is “Little Lefty.”

                                 MUNSON (CONT’D)
                        Arrrgggh!

           Munson storms out, and Fritz chuckles to himself.

                                 MIKE
                                (sing-song)
                        Hey, Pete.  Don’t forget you promised to 
                        call my wife before the game.

                                 FRITZ
                                (loving it)
                        Alright but don’t you forget to call my 
                        wife.

           Mike and Fritz laugh at their private joke, and Fritz 
           picks up the clubhouse phone.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                                (into phone)
                        Hey Sally.  It’s Fritz Peterson.  No, not 
                        my home number.  Can you connect me with 
                        Mike Kekich’s house?  Thanks.

           It rings.  Susanne answers.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                                (into phone)
                        Susanne, it’s Fritz.  The game should be 
                        over around 5 PM.  We on for tonight?  
                        Great.

           Fritz hangs up the phone.  He bows to Mike and hands the 
           receiver over.

                                 MIKE
                                (into phone)
                        Sally, it’s Mike Kekich.  No, not my 
                        house.  I need Fritz Peterson’s place.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. YANKEE STADIUM SWITCHBOARD - CONTINUOUS

           Sally, the long-time Yankee switchboard operator looks 
           very, very confused.  
           Eh, none of her business so she connects the call and 
           goes back to smoking her tenth pack of cigarettes that 
           day.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           DATING MONTAGE

           A.  Fritz takes Susanne dancing.  They gaze forever into 
           each other’s eyes.

                                 FRITZ
                        There’s somewhere special I want to take 
                        you.

           B.  Mike and Marilyn having sex in his convertible.

           C.  Fritz covers Susanne’s eyes

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        What do you think?

           Reveal, Fritz has taken her to... an ice hockey game.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        If it wasn’t for baseball, I would have 
                        been a hockey player.

           Fritz looks at her.  What is she going to say?

                                 SUSANNE
                        We should get a couple of beers.

           Can you imagine Marilyn ever ordering a beer?  Susanne is 
           like a dream come true.

                                 FRITZ
                        Yeah!  We should.  
                                (yelling to the Beer Guy)
                        Two beers over here!

           What a girl!

           D.  The ice hockey game plays on a TV, which sits in a 
           bedroom where... Mike and Marilyn are having sex.

           E. Fritz and Susanne pull into the Steak and Ale parking 
           lot.

           A moment later, Mike and Marilyn pull in.  The wives get 
           out and switch cars.
           F.  Mike and Susanne pull up to their house.  They open 
           the front door and are met by the baby-sitter.  They pay 
           her and watch from the front door as she heads home.

           As soon as she is gone... 

           Mike runs out to his car and drives off as Fritz pulls up 
           in his car and heads inside.

           G.  Fritz and Susanne on her couch... necking like two 
           teenagers.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        Is this OK?

                                 SUSANNE
                        Yeah.  It’s nice to go slow. 

           H.  Fritz picks up the clubhouse phone.

           INTERCUT:  Sally the operator connects the call.

           SPLIT SCREEN: Fritz talking to Susanne.

           Sally the operator connects another call.

           The split screen shifts over and now Susanne is talking 
           to Mike.

           Sally does another connect, and now Mike is talking to 
           Marilyn.

           Sally shakes her head, connects a call, and now Marilyn 
           is talking to Fritz.  

           I.  5:30 am.  Fritz is sneaking out of the Kekich house 
           when... he bumps into Kirsten, in her PJs.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Hi, Unca Fritz.  Can you make me 
                        something to eat?

                                 FRITZ
                        Uh... sure.

           J.  Mike comes sneaking back in only to find... Fritz, 
           Susanne and the kids already having breakfast.

                                 SUSANNE
                        Mike, look who came over to make us 
                        breakfast... Uncle Fritz!

                                                                 CUT TO:
           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           A gorgeous day for a drive.  Fritz and Susanne in the 
           front, Mike and Marilyn in the back of a car.                            

           On the radio, the one and only Paul Harvey show is 
           wrapping up with one of his amusing stories.

                                 PAUL HARVEY
                                (on radio)
                        ... the old farmer’s name incidentally.  
                        McDonald.  
                                (beat, get ready for the 
                                 catchphrase)
                        For what it’s worth.
                                (beat)
                        Paul Harvey... good day.

                                 MIKE
                        Can you imagine if we ever ended up on 
                        the Paul Harvey show?  Perfect place to 
                        announce our double wedding!

                                 FRITZ
                                (laughing)
                        Don’t forget our double divorce first. 

                                 MARILYN
                        It’s not funny.  Nobody can ever find 
                        out.

                                 FRITZ
                        Nobody is ever going to find out.  We’re 
                        just having some fun.

           But even as he says this, Fritz puts his hand on 
           Susanne’s leg.  It’s more than that.  

           Susanne gives Fritz a meaningful look back.

                                 MIKE
                                (doing Paul Harvey)
                        Doctors believe it had something to do 
                        with both men being lefties.

           Everyone laughs.  Even Marilyn.

                                 FRITZ
                                (doing Harvey)
                        Righties would never have done this.  And 
                        they throw worth shit.

                        For what it’s worth.  

           More laughter.

                                 SUSANNE
                        I have a question.  Have we figured out 
                        what we are going to do about the hotel 
                        rooms?

           The car speeds past a road sign: Baltimore 33 miles to 
           go.

           INT. YANKEE TEAM HOTEL - BALTIMORE- LATER THAT DAY

           The foursome approaches the check-in desk.

                                 FRITZ
                        Reservation for Peterson and Kekich.

                                 CLERK
                        Yes sir, we have them right here.

                                 MIKE
                        Can we get adjoining rooms, please.

                                 CLERK
                        Sure.  You guys going to gab all night?

                                 FRITZ/MIKE
                        Yeah.  Sure.

           The Clerk hands over the keys, and the foursome heads up 
           to their rooms and pass by Stottlemeyer and a couple of 
           the other guys.

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        Boy, they are really good friends.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM HALLWAY -  CONTINUOUS

           Mike and Susanne head into their room.

           Fritz and Marilyn head into their room.

           Just in case anyone is watching.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A mad dash for the connecting door which is immediately 
           opened. 
           At that point, Susanne rolls her suitcase into Fritz’s 
           room, and Marilyn rolls hers into Mike’s.

           Mike grabs at Marilyn as...

           The connecting door is SHUT.

           EXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Do Not Disturb signs are hung on both doorways.

           INT. FRITZ’S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Fritz and Susanne are making out, but it’s starting to 
           get a little more serious.  

           Fritz starts to undress her.

           Unlike anything we have seen before-- be it the music, 
           the lighting, or how it’s shot-- this is all beautiful 
           and romantic.

           Unlike any sex we have seen before, these two make love, 
           gentle and caring love.

           Fritz is on top, and as always he doesn’t last long.  
           Fritz is a bit nervous to say the least.  She’s been with 
           Mike.

                                 FRITZ
                                (whispers)
                        Sorry.  Was that... alright?

                                 SUSANNE
                        It was perfect.

           She kisses him and they lay there together.

           From the other room, they can clearly hear Mike and 
           Marilyn having LOUD sex.

                                 FRITZ
                        I’m glad we all waited.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. BALTIMORE RESTAURANT - THAT NIGHT

           Crab cakes all around for Mike, Fritz, Susanne and 
           Marilyn.  To anyone walking by, it looks like two couples 
           out for a nice evening.

                                 FRITZ
                        The season’s coming to an end in a month.  
                        So, I’ve been thinking....

                                 MIKE
                        Uh-oh, more thinking.

           They all laugh.

                                 FRITZ
                        I think... we should try to make this 
                        official.

                                 MARILYN
                                (not sure where this is 
                                 going)
                        What, tell people?

                                 FRITZ
                        No, no.  But once the season is over, 
                        these guys are supposed to go back to LA.

                                 SUSANNE
                        I don’t want to go.

                                 FRITZ
                        And I don’t want you to go.  I think we 
                        should try this.  Heck, we’ve practically 
                        been living like it for the last few 
                        months anyway.

           Marilyn has concerns. 

                                 MARILYN
                        I don’t know.  What if people find out?

                                 MIKE
                        C’mon, Babe, don’t worry about that.

           Mike has a way with her that Fritz never had.

                                 FRITZ
                        I know this is right.  We’re good 
                        together.  You and Mike.  Me and Susanne.
                                 MARILYN
                                (correcting)
                        Susanne and I.

                                 FRITZ
                        Susanne and I.  I think maybe this is how 
                        it was supposed to be.  

           They all nod.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        It’s perfect, because nobody gets hurt.  
                        Nobody gets left behind, and we all get 
                        what we want.

           Fritz looks to Susanne.  Mike to Marilyn.

                                 MIKE
                        Pete and I will work it all out.

                                 FRITZ
                        We’ll take care of everything.

                                 MARILYN
                                (always sees the bad side)
                        But what if--

                                 FRITZ
                        Let’s agree right now, that if at any 
                        time, any of us want out then we quit.  
                        No matter what the reason.  It all goes 
                        back to the way it was.

                                 ALL
                        OK.  Good.  Yeah.

           EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - EARLY MORNING - A FEW DAYS LATER

           A newspaper lays on the front stoop.

           Mike walks up, picks up the paper and rings the bell.

           While he waits, he looks at the back of the paper:  
           sports.  A headline reads: “Yanks 6 Back and Falling 
           Fast”.

           Fritz opens the door.  Sam the dog barks madly and tries 
           to run out.

                                 FRITZ
                                (to dog)
                        Down boy.  It’s just Mike.

                                (to Mike)
                        Marilyn will be out all day.  You ready 
                        to do this?

           INT. PETERSON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Mike and Fritz sit in the living room, kind of opposite 
           each other, in arm chairs.

                                 FRITZ
                        Our wives stay with their houses.  We 
                        trade.

                                 MIKE
                                (looking around)
                        So I live here?  

                                 FRITZ
                        Yeah.  I figure it will be easier.  Less 
                        change for them.  Agreed?

                                 MIKE
                        Whoa, whoa, wait.  What about the rent 
                        here?  It’s kinda higher than our place.

                                 FRITZ
                        I wanted to talk about this with Marilyn, 
                        but I want to help out financially 
                        because obviously, I make more money and--

                                 MIKE
                                (defensive)
                        I’ve had a lot of injuries.

                                 FRITZ
                                (you big baby)
                        Sure.  I know.  

                                 MIKE
                        I should have been an all-star two 
                        seasons ago, but the trainer screwed me.  
                        Total misdiagnosis.  I tried to tell him.  
                        That’s why the Dodgers traded me.

                                 FRITZ
                        Right.  
                                (gentle)
                        But until you sign your next contract, I 
                        thought I could lend a hand.

                                 MIKE
                                (proud)
                        I don’t need your help.
                                 FRITZ
                        OK, fine.  Sorry I brought it up.

                                 MIKE
                        I mean maybe for a bit.  But does Marilyn 
                        have to know?

                                 FRITZ
                        Not at all.

                                 MIKE
                        OK.  Boy, I feel like a general manager.  
                        I’ll give you Willie Stargel for Marilyn.

                                 FRITZ
                        Ha.  No deal.  I want Susanne and a 
                        player to be named later.

           They both laugh.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        Now most important--

                                 MIKE
                                (heard it before)
                        I know, I know...

                                 FRITZ
                        OK, then you tell me.

                                 MIKE
                                (it’s been said a thousand 
                                 times before)
                        Nobody can find out.

                                 FRITZ
                        That’s right.  So, smart guy, what do we 
                        tell our families?

                                 MIKE
                        Oof, I don’t know.  
                                (thinks)
                        This is hard.  I guess it’s why people 
                        don’t do it every day.  You got any 
                        beers?

                                 FRITZ
                        I think there’s some in the kitchen.  
                        Grab me one

           Mike hops up to grab them.
                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        My Dad could probably deal with it.  But 
                        Marilyn’s folks make her seem easygoing.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                                (from the other room)
                        Hey, lay off my lady.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           A BUNCH OF EMPTY BEER CANS AND SOME HALF-EATEN SANDWICHES

           Mike and Fritz still sitting there.

                                 FRITZ
                        Steak and Ale is ours.  You can have 
                        Pietro’s.

                                 MIKE
                        And The Old Town Tavern.

                                 FRITZ
                        Fine.
                                (next on the list)
                        The Stottlemeyers.  Mel is my friend.

                                 MIKE
                        You can have him. 
                                (next)
                        I’m keeping my car.  Nobody is swapping 
                        any cars.  Agreed?

                                 FRITZ
                        Not a problem.  Spring training.

                                 MIKE
                        What about it?

                                 FRITZ
                        You have to bring Marilyn.

                                 MIKE
                        No waaaaay.  I’ve told you.  Spring 
                        training is my time. 

                                 FRITZ
                        No.  You can’t do that anymore.  I 
                        brought Marilyn to Spring training every 
                        year.  Now, you’ll bring her.  And I’ll 
                        bring Susanne and the girls.
                                 MIKE
                                (truly shocked)
                        You’re getting the girls?

                                 FRITZ
                        I’m not “getting” the girls.  The girls 
                        should stay with their mother.

                                 MIKE
                        Why?

                                 FRITZ
                        Why?  She’s their mother.

                                 MIKE
                        So?

                                 FRITZ
                        So?  You really want to take care of two 
                        little girls?

                                 MIKE
                        Alright, well maybe not the baby.  She’s 
                        a lot of work.  How about I take Kirsten?  
                        She’s a more interesting anyway.

                                 FRITZ
                        You can’t split them up.  They’re not 
                        lamps.

                                 MIKE
                        They might like it.  They’re always 
                        fighting.

                                 FRITZ
                        They’re sisters!  They stay together with 
                        Susanne.

           Mike stews a moment or two, but finally gives in.

                                 MIKE
                        Fiiiiiiiiine.  
                                (beat)
                        But I want this chair.

           Mike pats the arms of the chair he is sitting in.

                                 FRITZ
                        What?  C’mon, take this seriously.  
                        Please.

                                 MIKE
                        OK.  I want Sam.
           Mike points to the dog.

                                 FRITZ
                        Cute.  You’re not getting Sam.  He is 
                        coming with me.

                                 MIKE
                        No.  Sam should stay with the house like 
                        the kids.

                                 FRITZ
                        You’re just saying that.

                                 MIKE
                        Am not.  Besides, Marilyn loves that dog, 
                        she told me.

                                 FRITZ
                        Marilyn hates that dog.  She hates the 
                        way he sheds.  She hates the way he 
                        drools.  She hates that I named him Sam.  
                        Says that it’s not a proper dog’s name.  

                                 MIKE
                        The dog stays here... or I’m staying with 
                        Susanne. 

                                 FRITZ
                        That’s how you want to be.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

                                 FRITZ
                        Fine.  Keep the dog.  He needs to be fed 
                        twice a day and walked at least, AT LEAST 
                        three times a day.

                                 MIKE
                        Great.

                                 FRITZ
                        You’re ridiculous.

                                 MIKE
                        You’re ridiculous.

                                 FRITZ
                        Are we done?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.
                                 FRITZ
                        Alright then.

                                 MIKE 
                        Alright then.

           Mike starts to get up.

                                 FRITZ
                        Do me one favor?  Will you talk to the 
                        girls and help Susanne explain things.

                                 MIKE
                        Absolutely.

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. KEKICH HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Where’s daddy?  

           Susanne is talking to the girls.  No Mike.  No surprise.

                                 KIRSTEN (CONT’D)
                        Daddy was supposed to take us to the zoo.

                                 SUSANNE
                                (to self)
                        I wish I knew.
                                (to girls)
                        Daddy was supposed to be here to tell you 
                        that he is going away for a bit.

           The girls look confused.

                                 SUSANNE (CONT’D)
                        But don’t worry, Uncle Fritz is going to 
                        live with us, and from now on he will be 
                        Daddy Fritz.

           There is no way they can understand this.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. PETERSON HOUSE-- LATER THAT DAY

           Fritz comes downstairs with a couple of bags packed.  
           Marilyn is sitting at the dining room table reading the 
           paper.
                                 FRITZ
                        I’m going to the ball park.

                                 MARILYN
                        OK.  Have a good game.

                                 FRITZ
                        Thanks.

           He starts to go.

                                 MARILYN
                        Aren’t you taking Sam?

           INT. YANKEE STADIUM - THAT NIGHT

           Fritz sitting in the dugout watching the game.

           It flies by at triple speed.  His mind is elsewhere.

           EXT. YANKEE STADIUM - LATER

           Fritz exits the stadium, gets in the car and starts 
           driving.

           Across the George Washington Bridge and into Jersey.

           He gets to his house... and keeps on driving.

           A few more twists and turns, he pulls up to the Kekich 
           house.

           Fritz gets out of the car, grabs his luggage and heads 
           for the door.  DING DONG!

           Susanne opens it.

                                 FRITZ
                        Hi.  I’m here about the room for rent.

           She hugs him.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        I forgot, I got you a little something.

           Fritz pulls out a couple of bars of Zest soap.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        In case we need it.
                                 SUSANNE
                                (laughing)
                        Girls, look who’s here?

                                 KIRSTEN/REAGAN
                        Uncle Fritz!/Unca Fritz!

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. KEKICH BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Fritz and Susanne are asleep when something wakes him up.  
           KNOCK!  KNOCK!  There’s someone at the door.

           Fritz stumbles awake and heads downstairs.  KNOCK!  
           KNOCK!

           Who the hell could it be at this hour?  Fritz opens the 
           door to see... Mike with Sam the dog.

           Mike hands Sam’s leash to Fritz.

                                 MIKE
                        Here.  I’m not allowed to have a dog.

           INT. YANKEE STADIUM -  A FEW DAYS LATER

           The Yanks warm up before another meaningless game.

           Stottlemeyer and Fritz throw the ball back and forth.

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        So, it’s a done deal?

           Oh my God, does Mel know?

                                 FRITZ
                        Huh?

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        This Steinbrenner fella is officially the 
                        new owner of the Yankees.

                                 FRITZ
                        Well, that should be good for my contract 
                        negotiation next season.

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        Hmmm?
                                 FRITZ
                        Guy like that, knows nothing about the 
                        game.  Should be a real pushover.

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        Yeah.  
                                (yells and throws ball to 
                                 Mike)
                        Kekich, look lively.  Your wife is 
                        waving.

           Mike looks up to the “WAG” section-- Wives and 
           Girlfriends.  We recognize a bunch of the players’ wives 
           including Susanne and, a few seats away, Marilyn.

                                 MIKE
                        Uh, yeah.

           Mike throws the ball and waves back.

           Susanne looks confused.  But Marilyn sees the wave and 
           waves back.

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        What’s wrong with you guys today?  You 
                        both blind?  Pete, Marilyn’s now waving.

           Fritz looks up, and starts waving.

           Marilyn and Susanne are now waving to Mike and Fritz.  
           And nobody is the wiser.

           EXT. YANKEE STADIUM-- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Players coming out and loading onto the bus.  Wives and 
           girlfriends there to say goodbye.

           Fritz and Mike stand with Susanne and Marilyn.

                                 FRITZ
                        Well, it’s off to Milwaukee.  Lucky us.  

                                 MIKE
                        We’ll see you ladies in a few days.  Be 
                        good.

                                 SUSANNE AND MARILYN
                                (pointed)
                        You too.

           They both know Mike too well.
                                 FRITZ
                        We should get going.

           There are too many people around.  So... Fritz kisses 
           Marilyn goodbye, and Mike kisses Susanne.  Both a little 
           awkward.  

           Then Fritz hugs Susanne.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                                (whispers)
                        I’ll call you when we get there.

           Mike hugs Marilyn.

           Mel Stottlemeyer walks bye.  He hugs Marilyn too.

                                 STOTTLEMEYER
                        Bye, Marilyn.

           Mel gets on the bus.  The guys laugh and follow.

           The bus pulls out as Marilyn and Susanne watch it go.

           INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

           Some of the players are asleep.  Some play cards.  
           Practically the entire plane smokes.  It is the 70’s.

                                 CAPTAIN  (V.O.)
                        This is your captain speaking.  We will 
                        be landing in Milwaukee in just about 
                        twenty minutes.  This would be a great 
                        time to make sure you are buckled up and 
                        have a last cigarette.  I’ll speak to you 
                        again when we are on the ground.

           Fritz hops up, heads back to give something to the 
           stewardess, and then sits back down.

           About a minute later, the stewardess comes down the aisle 
           and hands a clipboard to Thurman Munson.

           MUNSON POV:  The clipboard reads “Sign up Sheet for 
           Yankee Exhibition Trip to Tokyo.”

           Munson eyes it suspiciously.  He looks around to see if 
           anyone is watching him.  Nobody.

           Munson stares at the paper some more.  “Players may bring 
           their wives.  No Children.”
           Fuck it.  Munson signs up and passes it on to Roy White.  
           White takes a read and also sign up.

           Fritz is loving every second of it.

           INT. LUGGAGE CAROUSEL - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The Yankees wait for their luggage.  They all look 
           exhausted.

           Munson approaches Ralph Houk.

                                 MUNSON
                        Hey Skip, any idea who we will be playing 
                        in Tokyo?

                                 HOUK
                        What the hell is wrong with you, Munson?  
                        This is Milwaukee not Tokyo.

                                 MUNSON
                        No, the exhibition games this winter... 
                        we’re all... going... Tokyo...

           Everyone is staring at poor Thurman.

           Everyone LAUGHS and it finally hits him..

                                 MUNSON (CONT’D)
                        Fuuuuck!

           INT. MILWAUKIE STADIUM - DAY

           Yanks vs. Brewers.  Mike is pitching.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Kekich winds up, the pitch... fouled back 
                        behind the plate.  Catcher Thurman Munson 
                        has a bead on it, aaaaaaaand makes the 
                        catch to end the inning.

                                 ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
                        But not before the Brewers get three more 
                        runs off Mike Kekich and the Yankees.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        You know, they used to call Kekich the 
                        next Koufax.

           The Yanks head for the dugout, looking pretty defeated.
           Mike sits down next to Fritz and throws a towel over his 
           head.  

                                 FRITZ
                        Your curve is hanging there like a 
                        meatball.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah... I... I’m not feeling too well.

           Fritz rolls his eyes.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        What?  I’m not.  

                                 FRITZ
                        Probably all the travel.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.  I think it may be some kind of 
                        streptococcus.

                                 MUNSON
                                (from across the room)
                        You’re not a doctor.  You’re a ball 
                        player.

                                 MIKE
                        I could be a doctor if I wanted to!

           Stick Michael wanders down the bench.

                                 STICK
                        Hey boys.

                                 FRITZ
                        How’s it going Stick?

                                 STICK
                        I’m 0 for 3 today, but things are looking 
                        up.  Check out section 220, row 5.

           All the players’ heads turn and lock in on the section.

                                 STICK (CONT’D)
                        On the end...

           POV: At the end of the row are two blondes falling out of 
           tight, tight Yankees shirts.

                                 STICK (CONT’D)
                        Bull's-eye!  I hope to God they want to 
                        meet a real live Yankee.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 STICK (CONT’D)
                                (beat)
                        And fuck his brains out.  Who’s with me?

                                 FRITZ
                        Sorry, Stick.  But have fun.

                                 STICK
                        No surprise there.  But I know I can 
                        count on Kekich here-- especially after 
                        the turd ball he’s throwing out there.

                                 MIKE
                        Actually, Stick, I’d like to, but... I 
                        can’t.  I just... can’t.

                                 STICK
                        Holy shit, I never thought I’d see the 
                        day.  I guess we now have two lefty 
                        homosexuals on the team.
                                (spots a likely accomplice)
                        Hey, Jerry...

           Stick heads off.  Fritz is in shock too, but says 
           nothing, but smiles.  This is really working out.

                                 MIKE
                                (getting a sense of Fritz’s 
                                 happiness)
                        Shut up.

           INT. MILWAUKEE HOTEL LOBBY - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Fritz enters and passes Mike, who talks with a bellboy.

                                 MIKE
                        ... you’re back hurts?  Interesting.  Let 
                        me take a look. 
                                (sees Fritz)
                        Hey Pete, you want to grab a bite or 
                        something?

                                 FRITZ
                                (excited)
                        Maybe later, OK.  I’m going to give 
                        Susanne a ring.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, sure.  I’ve got stuff to do, too.

           Fritz practically runs towards the elevator and heads up.

           Mike watches his friend go.
           INT. FRITZ’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Fritz eats room service and talks on the phone.

                                 FRITZ
                                (into phone)
                        Everybody ready?  Daddy is going to eat 
                        his dinner at the same time as you guys.

           INT. MIKE’S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mike lays on the bed and tosses a baseball in the air.  
           He’s never been “alone” on the road like this.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. KEKICH HOUSE - EARLY MORNING - A FEW DAYS LATER

           An exhausted Fritz opens the front door, Susanne, the 
           kids, and Sam the dog come running up to greet him.

           EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The door is half-way open, luggage half-leaning on the 
           door, and clothes all over the floor.  

           The camera starts to go up the stairs when we realize 
           Mike and Marilyn are going for it right in the living 
           room.

           EXT. YANKEE STADIUM - A FEW DAYS LATER

           A sign on the facade now reads “Thanks to all our fans.  
           See you next season.”

           INT. YANKEE LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Season’s over.  Time to clean out the lockers and say 
           good-byes for the winter.

           Fritz is packing a box as he talks with one of the 
           infielders, Jerry Kenney.

                                 JERRY
                        I’m going to work at my brother-in-law’s 
                        dealership.  You know, meet a Yankee and 
                        buy a car.  You getting out of town?
                                 FRITZ
                        Later on, but I am going to be doing some 
                        color commentary for the New York 
                        Raiders.

                                 JERRY
                        The hockey team?

                                 FRITZ
                        Yeah, the hockey team.

                                 JERRY
                        Wild.  Well, see you next Spring... I 
                        hope.

                                 FRITZ
                        See you next Spring.

           Fritz grabs his box and starts to head out, passing 
           Mike’s locker.

           Kekich’s locker has already been emptied.  No trace of 
           him.

           Fritz is about to exit when...

           Thurman Munson yells.

                                 MUNSON
                        Hey, Pete!

                                 FRITZ
                        Hey, Tugs, just taking off.

                                 MUNSON
                        I just wanted to say goodbye.  Oh, and, I 
                        know it was you, and I am going to get 
                        you.

                                 FRITZ
                                (trying not to laugh)
                        OK.  I’ll be ready.

                                 MUNSON
                        Fuck you.  
                                (all nice)
                        Say hi to Marilyn.

           Fritz heads out to...
           EXT. YANKEE PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Susanne is waiting with the car.  Fritz loads up the 
           trunk and climbs in.

                                 SUSANNE
                        You ready?

                                 FRITZ
                        Let’s go!

           They head off to their life together.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. RAIDERS HOCKEY GAME - NIGHT

           Fritz doing color commentary for the Raiders Hockey 
           Games. 

           The camera pans from the announcer booth to find...

           Susanne is at the hockey game too.

           Fritz throws her a look and she smiles back.

                                                                 CUT TO:

                                (yelling)
                        I don’t know what happened!

           We are...

           INT. PETERSON KITCHEN - DAY

           In the middle of a big fight between Mike and Marilyn.

                                 MARILYN
                                (yelling back)
                        How can you not know?

                                 MIKE
                        I guess I spent it!

                                 MARILYN
                        You spent it?!?  The entire check!?!

           She stares at Mike like she wants to kill him.  Money has 
           always been important to Marilyn.
           Mike... laughs.

                                 MARILYN (CONT’D)
                                (pissed)
                        Don’t laugh at me!

                                 MIKE
                                (trying to hold it in)
                        I’m not.  

                                 MARILYN
                        Stop it!

           Mike moves towards her.

                                 MIKE
                        Come here.

                                 MARILYN
                        No.

                                 MIKE
                        Come here, baby!

           Mike grabs her and they start MAKING OUT.  Very 
           passionate.

           They head towards the ground.

                                 MARILYN
                                (between kisses)
                        What happened to the check?

                                 MIKE
                        Shut up.

           He starts to undo her shirt.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BOWLING ALLEY - A FEW DAYS LATER

           Fritz helps little Reagan “throw” a ball down the lane... 
           into the gutter.

                                 REAGAN
                        Yay!

           Kirsten runs around with a couple of other kids at the 
           bowling alley.
                                 SUSANNE
                        My turn.  Little help?

                                 FRITZ
                        Here, you have to follow through with 
                        your arm.  Like this.

           Susanne giggles as Fritz holds her close and helps her 
           with her arm motion.  It’s quite adorable.

                                 SUSANNE
                        Are you sure that’s right?

                                 FRITZ
                        It better be.  It was on the final exam.

                                 SUSANNE
                        I hope you didn’t hold all your students 
                        like this.

           With his help, she releases the ball.  And as they 
           kiss... she rolls a spare!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. NEW JERSEY NEIGHBORHOOD- DAY

           A “FOR SALE” sign hangs on a two-story apartment 
           building.  Mike and Marilyn stare at the building.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s a lot of money.

                                 MARILYN
                        It’s for the future.  You have to plan 
                        for the future.

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t know....

                                 MARILYN
                        What do you know?  It’s not like you went 
                        to college.

           Yikes.  Mike tries to calm her down.

                                 MIKE
                        I just thought we’d take a trip to 
                        Mexico.  You know... drink some fruity 
                        drinks... hot sweaty nights...

           Mike presses up against her.  She nuzzles him.  Then...
                                 MARILYN
                                (all business)
                        Focus, Mike.
                                (re: the building)
                        It needs a little work, but you can do 
                        that.

           What?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Fritz stands by while Reagan sits on her little “potty.”

                                 FRITZ
                        Did you go?

                                 REAGAN
                        Noooo.

                                 FRITZ
                        Do you have to go?

                                 REAGAN
                        Yeah.

                                 FRITZ
                        Big girls who go to the potty get a 
                        tootsie roll.

           He holds up a tootsie roll.

                        No.

           EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mike walks up to the front door.  Like Fritz before him, 
           he pauses at the front door and takes a deep breath.

           Here we go.

           As he walks in...
                                 MARILYN (O.S.)
                                (yelling from the kitchen)
                        You’re late!

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry.

                                 MARILYN (O.S.)
                        Did your check come today?

           Mike puts his head down and heads towards the kitchen 
           defeated.

           Marilyn has worn him down.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. O’HARE AIPORT - A FEW WEEKS LATER

           Fritz, Susanne, and the girls come down an escalator.  A 
           sign reads “Mayor Richard Daley welcomes you to Chicago.”

           At the bottom of the escalator is Fritz’s family:  his 
           DAD, his STEP-MOM, and his SISTER.

                                 FRITZ
                        This... is Susanne.  Susanne, this is my 
                        family.

           The family eyes her warily for a moment and then... 
           rushes to HUG her.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Filled to the brim with memorabilia and pictures of 
           Fritz, the house is packed with people in honor of Fritz 
           and Susanne.

           Fritz is talking with some old college buddies, while 
           Susanne is chatting with his sisters.

           One of the sisters breaks free and runs over to Fritz.

                                 SISTER
                        Oh my God, she is so much nicer than

           INT. KEKICH HOUSE - A FEW WEEKS LATER

           A quiet night back at home for Fritz and the girls.

           The  family eats TV dinners in front of the TV watching 
           the Lawrence Welk show.

           They laugh and sing along.

           Fritz has never seemed happier.

           INT. KEKICH BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Fritz and Susanne are fast asleep when suddenly... there 
           is a LOUD KNOCKING downstairs.

                                 FRITZ
                                (groggy)
                        Stay here...

           Fritz downstairs and opens the door.  It’s... Mike.  And 
           he is a little drunk.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                                (rubbing his eyes)
                        Mike?  What time is it?

                                 MIKE
                        Can I stay here?  

                                 FRITZ
                        Huh?  No.

                                 MIKE
                        Marilyn threw me out!

           Mike and Fritz sit in the living room drinking a couple 
           of beers.

                                (looking around the room)
                        This room looks different.
                                 FRITZ
                        Yeah, we painted it.  What happened?

                                 MIKE
                        It looks good.  I should have done that.

                                 FRITZ
                        Thanks.  Now tell me what happened.

                                 MIKE
                        Aw, hell.  You probably know better than 
                        me.  She’s crazy.  She makes me crazy. 
                        Arrrrgh!

                                 FRITZ
                        I know Marilyn can be a little difficult 
                        but--

                                 MIKE
                        Difficult?  Fucking looney tunes.  
                                (takes another drink)
                        I don’t know how you lasted so long.  You 
                        deserve like a medal or something.
                                (re: walls)
                        What color is it?

                                 FRITZ
                        Teal.  

                                 MIKE
                        Ah, teal.

                        Mike, uh, Marilyn?

           Mike downs another beer.

                                 MIKE
                                (getting worked up)
                        She doesn’t stop, and it’s always about 
                        the money.  Where’s the money?  What am I 
                        doing with the money?  How could I spend 
                        the money?  
                                (yells)
                        It’s my god damn money!  When I’m a 
                        doctor, money’s going to come rolling in!
                                (realizes)
                        Sorry, I don’t want to wake the girls.  
                        How are they?

                                 FRITZ
                        Good,  Reagan is toilet trained.  
                                 MIKE
                        Yeah?

                                 FRITZ
                        Yeah.  You know when you tell them you’re 
                        going to visit and then you don’t show 
                        up...

                                 MIKE
                        Aw, not you too.  Where’s Susanne?  She 
                        was the only one that never yelled at me.
                                (yelling)
                        Susanne?

           Fritz doesn’t want to go down this path.

                                 FRITZ
                        OK, big fella.  How about you call 
                        Marilyn and let her know where you are?

           Fritz picks up the phone, dials, and hands the phone to 
           Mike.

                                 MARILYN (V.O.)
                                (on phone and pissed)
                        Hello...

                                 MIKE
                                (sotto voce)
                        You talk to her.

           He hands the phone back to Fritz.

                                 FRITZ
                                (sotto voce)
                        I don’t want to talk to her.

                                 MARILYN (V.O.)
                                (on phone)
                        Mike, is that you?

           Fritz shoves the phone back to Mike.  He shoves it back 
           to Fritz.  It’s like a hot potato.

                                 MIKE
                                (sotto voce)
                        She scares me.  Take it!

                                 FRITZ
                                (sotto voce)
                        She scares me too.

           They struggle some more and finally...
                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        Fine.
                                (takes the phone)
                        Hey, Chip.  Yeah, he’s here.  He’s OK, 
                        more or less... I know, I’m sorry... I’m 
                        sorry... Let him just sleep it off, and 
                        I’ll talk to him in the morning and bring 
                        him back to our place.  Your place... I 
                        should go...

           He tries to hang up.  She clearly won’t let him.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        Ok... No, Mike understands.  It’s all 
                        fine.  Don’t freak out. Everything is 
                        good.  OK... OK... OK... Goodbye.

           He hangs up the phone. Jesus.

           Fritz looks over and Mike is passed out.

           Fritz heads to the stairs we he finds... Susanne has been 
           watching.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        He’s drunk.

                                 SUSANNE
                        I’m familiar with it.
                                (beat)
                        Fritz, please don’t let him ruin it.

                                 FRITZ
                        He’s not going to ruin it.  I love you 
                        sooo much!

                                 SUSANNE
                        I love you.

           They kiss and head up to bed.  On the couch...

           Mike is awake, and he heard that “I love you.”

                                 MIKE
                                (drunk and to himself)
                        How come you’re so fucking happy.

           It does not sit well with him as he passes out again.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. CAR - A FEW DAYS LATER

           Marilyn and Mike are driving and, for a change, fighting.

                                 MARILYN
                        I don’t want to do this.

                                 MIKE
                        Just shut up.  We’re doing it.

                                 MARILYN
                        Don’t tell me to shut up.  We’re not 
                        supposed to do this.  It’s idiotic.

                                 MIKE
                        We’re there.  People need to see, we’re a 
                        couple too.

           INT. STOTTLEMEYER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting, Mel and 
           his wife are playing a board game with their kids when... 
           the doorbell RINGS.

           Mel goes to answer it.  It’s... Marilyn.

                                 MEL
                        Marilyn!  What a surprise.

                                 MARILYN
                        We were in the neighborhood, and thought 
                        we would drop by.

           Behind her walks Mike Kekich.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, Mel.  

                                 MEL
                        Hey, Mike.

           Marilyn and Mike enter, but Mel just stands there with 
           the door open.

           Beat.

           Beat.

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                                (confused)
                        Uh, where’s Pete?
           They don’t exactly know how to answer.

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        Out in the car?

           Mel heads out to the car.

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                                (looking around)
                        Peeeete!

           INT. STOTTLEMEYER’S HOUSE - LATER

           Marilyn and Mike sit on the couch and drink coffee with 
           Mel and Jean.  Mel just looks stunned.

                                 JEAN
                        So how long have you two been together?

                                 MARILYN
                        Well, since the season ended.  It’s been 
                        hard to tell anyone.

                                 MEL
                        Can I ask one question?  This isn’t one 
                        of Pete’s practical jokes, is it?  He’s 
                        pulled some pretty good ones.

                                 MIKE
                        No, it’s real.  Pete’s with Susanne and 
                        I’m with Marilyn.

           Mike puts his arm around her.  She forces a smile.

           Just then... the Stottlemeyer kids come running down the 
           stairs playing with some army men.

                                 MEL
                                (yelling to kids)
                        Todd, I told you to keep your brother in 
                        your room.  Get upstairs.  Now.  Hurry!

           The kids run for their life back upstairs.

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                                (to Mike and Marilyn)
                        We’re really happy for you.

                                 JEAN STOTTLEMEYER
                                (stunned)
                        Uh, yeah.
           Mike has a big smile on his face.  Mission accomplished.

                                 MEL
                        So are all four of you coming to spring 
                        training?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. YANKEE SPRING TRAINING - A FEW WEEKS LATER

           Players arriving and seeing each other for the first time 
           after the long winter.

           We can’t help but notice that back then players didn’t 
           take quite as good care of themselves.

           Super:  Spring training 1973

           EXT. SPRING TRAINING FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           FOOMP!  Fritz and a couple of other pitchers hurl a few 
           in to a couple of bullpen catcher. 

                                 PITCHER
                        Looking good, Pete.

                                 FRITZ
                        Well, I bowled a bunch this offseason.  
                        Kept me loose.  You?

                                 PITCHER
                        I haven’t touched a baseball in months.

           The Pitcher throws the ball.

                                 PITCHER (CONT’D)
                                (exquisite torture)
                        Oh yeah!  That hurts!

           ACROSS THE FIELD

           Maury Allen and a couple of other beat reporters talk 
           with Ralph Houk.  Allen spots Fritz and heads over.

                                 MAURY ALLEN
                        Hey, Pete.  Got a sec?

                                 FRITZ
                        Let me guess, Maury... what I did on my 
                        winter vacation by Fritz Peterson?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRITZ (CONT'D)
                        Or maybe, Fritz Peterson says this is the 
                        Yanks’ year!

           Maury laughs.  That is the kind of article that gets 
           written in these first few days of Spring training.

                                 MAURY ALLEN
                        No, nothing like that.  Actually, this is 
                        kind of weird...

           Fritz’s interest in piqued.

                                 FRITZ
                        Did you hear something about a new 
                        contract for me?

                                 MAURY ALLEN
                        No.  It’s just there’s kind of weird 
                        rumor going around... about you and 
                        Kekich... and your wives.

           It’s like someone just punched Fritz in the stomach.  He 
           can’t breath for a second, but he knows he has to answer.

                                 FRITZ
                                (interrupting)
                        Maury.  Mike and I are pals.  The wives 
                        are friends too.  The four of us spend a 
                        lot of time together.  You’ve seen us.

                                 MAURY ALLEN
                        I know...

                                 FRITZ
                        A lot of people don’t like Mike.  Cause 
                        they don’t understand him.  
                                (a little outrage)
                        But come on.  I can’t believe you of all 
                        people would even dignify this.

           Is this going to work?

                                 MAURY ALLEN
                        I’m sorry, Pete.

           Yes!

                                 MAURY ALLEN (CONT’D)
                                (chastised)
                        You know how guys talk.  I shouldn’t 
                        have....

                                 FRITZ
                        Forget it.
                                 MAURY ALLEN
                        So tell me, is this the Yanks’ year?

                                 FRITZ
                        You can quote me on that!

           Maury laughs and heads off.  Fritz heads to...

           YANKEE DUGOUT

           Fritz grabs a seat to collect his thoughts.  What the 
           fuck is happening.

           Mel enters and sits down next to him.  Silently.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                                (looking up)
                        Hey, Mel!  Good to see you!

                                 MEL
                                (mumbles)
                        Hey.

                                 FRITZ
                        What’s doing?

                                 MEL
                        Nothing.  You?

                                 FRITZ
                        Nothing.  

                                 MEL
                        How’s... Susanne?

                                 FRITZ
                                (stunned)
                        What?

                                 MEL
                                (un-hip)
                        Don’t worry, I’m hip, my man...

           Mel saunters away, leaving Fritz in a state of shock.

           After a moment, Fritz regains his senses and looks 
           around.

           FRITZ’S POV: across the field, yucking it up with a bunch 
           of players and yes, a few reporters, it’s Mike.
           INT. SPRING TRAINING PARKING LOT - LATER THAT DAY

           Mike heads to his motorcycle only to find Fritz waiting 
           for him.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, Pete.  How are my girls?

                                 FRITZ
                        Everybody is good.  Anything you want to 
                        tell me?

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t think so.

                                 FRITZ
                        Maury Allen cornered me.  Said there are 
                        rumors about us going around.  And then 
                        to top that off, Mel seems to know.

                                 MIKE
                                (innocent)
                        That was Marilyn.  She wanted to visit 
                        Mel and his wife.  We had to tell them. 

                                 FRITZ
                                (freaked)
                        People aren’t going to understand this.  
                        We have to keep the noise down.

                                 MIKE
                        I know.  Don’t worry.  You want to grab a 
                        drink?  Me and Stick are going out.

                                 FRITZ
                        Stick?

                                 MIKE
                        It’s just drinks.  

                                 FRITZ
                        You promise.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not a child.

                                 FRITZ
                        You promise.  

                                 MIKE
                        Yes, I promise.
           Fritz heads off.

           Mike laughs to himself as he hops on his bike.  He’s 
           enjoying this.

           INT. FT. LAUDERDALE BAR - NIGHT

           Fritz enters the bar, looks around and sees Mike chatting 
           up two slutty-looking stewardesses.  

           Fritz approaches with a head of steam.

                                 MIKE
                                (to the girls, finishing a 
                                 joke)
                        ... the fireman says, “Let me show you my 
                        hose!”

           The girls giggle and Mike laughs loudly at his own joke.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                                (seeing Fritz)
                        Ah, Dr. Mantle.  Ladies, this is the my 
                        colleague from the Institute, Doctor 
                        Mickey M--

                                 FRITZ
                        What the hell do you think you are doing?

                                 MIKE
                        Is there a problem at the Institute?

                                 FRITZ
                        Cut that shit out.  

                                 MIKE
                        What!?!

           The girls are a little weirded-out and back a few steps 
           away.

                                 FRITZ
                                (re:  the sluts)
                        Who are they?

                                 MIKE
                        Keep your voice down.

                                 FRITZ
                                (loud whisper)
                        You promised me.  Now, who are they?
                                 MIKE
                                (laughing)
                        That’s for you to find out.  Dibs on the 
                        one with the big tits.  Whoops.  They 
                        both have big tits.

           Mike laughs again and turns towards the girls.  We’re all 
           having fun here!

           Suddenly, Fritz grabs Mike by the collar and shoves him 
           into the wall.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                                (shocked)
                        Heeeeey!

                                 FRITZ
                                (seething)
                        I asked you what the fuck you are doing 
                        with them?  You have a wife at home that 
                        loves you.

                                 MIKE
                        No, my wife loves you.

                                 FRITZ
                        You know what I meant.  You can’t do this 
                        to Marilyn.

                                 MIKE
                        Jeezus, why do you care so much?

                                 FRITZ
                        She’s my wife.

                                 MIKE
                        You can’t have it both ways.

                                 FRITZ
                        Don’t screw this up.  We have a good 
                        thing.

                                 MIKE
                        Maybe you do.

                                 FRITZ
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 MIKE
                        Nothing.  Look, these girls are just for 
                        fun.  You sure you’re not interested?

           Fritz looks at the sluts.  No way.
                                 FRITZ
                        I’m going back to my place.  And keep 
                        your voice down.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey!  More for me!
                                (to the girls and others)
                        Who wants another round?

           As Fritz heads out the door, he hisses over his shoulder.

                                 FRITZ
                        You should go home and call my wife!

           INT. FRITZ’S RENTAL-- LATER

           Fritz lies in bed talking on the phone with Susanne.

                                 FRITZ
                                (into phone)
                        I miss you.

                                 SUSANNE (O.S.)
                        I miss you.

                                 FRITZ
                        I can’t believe you won’t be here till 
                        next week.  Wait till you see the pool.  
                        The girls are going to love it.

                                 SUSANNE (O.S.)
                        Have you seen Mike?

                                 FRITZ
                                (better to lie)
                        Not yet.

           INT. MIKE’S PLACE-- CONTINUOUS

           Mike having his way with one of those stewardesses.  

           Oh wait, the other one just came out of the bathroom and 
           joins them.

           The phone RINGS.  Mike ignores it.  He knows who’s 
           calling.

           INT. FRITZ’S HOUSE - NEW JERSEY - CONTINUOUS

           Marilyn angrily stands in the kitchen on the phone. 
           After letting it ring a while, she SLAMS it down.

           INT. FRITZ’S RENTAL - CONTINUOUS

           The Phone RINGS.  Fritz answers it.  It’s Marilyn.

                                 FRITZ
                        Hello... Marilyn, I don’t know where he 
                        is.  I swear.  

                                 MARILYN
                        What am I supposed to do?

                                 FRITZ
                        It’s going to be OK, Chip.  I can fix 
                        this.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. SPRING TRAINING FIELD - THE NEXT DAY

           Fritz playing catch with a couple of the pitchers.

           As he looks around, we get the sense that other people 
           across the field are looking at him.  Even pointing.  

           Word is spreading.

           Maury Allen approaches.

                                 MAURY ALLEN
                        Pete, sorry man, but I gotta talk to you 
                        again.  I think you know about what.

           This isn’t good.

                                 FRITZ
                        Maury, I have nothing to say.

           INT. PETERSON HOUSE - NIGHT

           Fritz on the phone with a crying Susanne.

                                 SUSANNE
                        People know?

                                 FRITZ
                        Don’t cry, baby.  It’s going to be OK. I 
                        can fix this.
           INT. MIKE’S PLACE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           An agitated Fritz knocks on Mike’s door.

                                 MIKE
                        What do you want?

                                 FRITZ
                        All of a sudden, everybody seems to know 
                        about us.  Susanne’s crying.  Marilyn is 
                        calling me.  What the hell is going on?

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not happy with our deal.

                                 FRITZ
                        What is that supposed to mean?

                                 MIKE
                        What it says.

                                 FRITZ
                        I don’t understand.  What are you, two 
                        years old?

           Mike doesn’t like that.

                                 MIKE
                                (exploding)
                        Why the hell do you get to be so damn 
                        happy with my wife?  It’s not fair.

           Fritz can’t believe what he is hearing.

                                 FRITZ
                        Oh my God!  Fair?  It’s not fair?

                                 MIKE
                        Everything has changed.  Even you and me 
                        are different.

                                 FRITZ
                        And this is my fault?  We all agreed--

                                 MIKE
                        I want more.  

                                 FRITZ
                        What more do you want?  The dog back 
                        again?  I can’t give you anything else.  
                        There is no more.   This is crazy.  Why 
                        are you ruining this?
                                 MIKE
                        You ruined it.  You and Susanne.  It 
                        wasn’t supposed to be like this.  I was 
                        the next Sandy Koufax.  

           Fritz just shakes his head, turns and leaves.

                                 FRITZ
                        Look, please, just say nothing.  That’s 
                        what I did.  Alright?

                                 MIKE
                        Fiiiiine.

           Fritz leaves.

           INT. SPRING TRAINING LOCKER ROOM -  THE NEXT DAY

           Fritz enters and finds it empty.  Weird.

           Pete Sheehy wanders by.

                                 FRITZ
                        Pete, where the heck is everybody?

                                 SHEEHY
                        I guess you didn’t hear.  Mike Kekich is 
                        holding a press conference.

           INT. SPRING TRAINING PASSAGEWAYS - CONTINUOUS

           Fritz sprints through the underground maze that runs 
           under the stadium.  He passes the occasional support 
           personnel, none of whom can seem to look him in the eye.

           Finally, Fritz finds Mike heading towards the press room.

                                (out of breath)
                        Mike, this is quiet?

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry, I don’t have a lot of time, 
                        they’re waiting for me.  

                                 FRITZ
                        Waiting for you?  Who’s waiting for you?

                                 MIKE
                        The Post.  The Daily News.  A couple of 
                        the other guys.
                                 FRITZ
                        Are you really doing this?  This is 
                        completely out of control.  Out of 
                        control.

           And Fritz likes control.

                                 MIKE
                        Pete, let’s be adult about this.  Feel 
                        free to speak with them after me, and you 
                        can tell your side.

                                 FRITZ
                        My side?  I don’t have a side.  There are 
                        no sides.  We were all in this together.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s not how I see it.

                                 FRITZ
                        Well, how do you see it?

                                 MIKE
                        That’s not how I see it.  OK?  You’re not 
                        my boss.  Marilyn isn’t my boss.  
                        Promises were made, and they weren’t 
                        kept.  And I’m not going to sit back and 
                        just take it.

           Fritz is stunned.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not some pushover, you know.  I’m 
                        Mike Kekich.

           The door to the press room opens, and Mike is ushered in.

           As he heads in, Mike drops his head into a hang-dog 
           expression-- woe is me.  Flashbulbs snap as he enters.

           The door shuts.  Fritz is in complete shock.

           INT. PRESS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Six or seven reporters plus photographers throw questions 
           at Mike, who is loving every minute of it.

           As the flashbulbs pop, we see Mike alternatively smiling 
           and trying to look very sad.

           We don’t always hear the questions, but we hear a bunch 
           of Mike’s answers.
                                 MIKE
                        Don't say this was wife-swapping, because 
                        it wasn't. We didn't swap wives, we 
                        swapped lives.

           ANGLE ON:  Reporters.  They are stunned.  Mouths agape.

                        Susanne and I had a good marriage. But I 
                        wanted a great marriage. I was 
                        idealistic, I guess.  Now I have nothing.

                        There's still something very strong there 
                        for Marilyn and me, but we're both so 
                        mixed up. We each have qualities, 
                        idiosyncracies that rub the other person 
                        wrong.  I would like it to work out, but 
                        I'm really dubious now. Love is the 
                        strongest emotion I ever felt in my life. 
                        I'm one of the biggest soul searchers 
                        around. I don't give a damn what other 
                        people say, but Marilyn does. I'm sad 
                        that Marilyn and I can't work things out. 
                        I can't tell you how perfect it would 
                        have been if it worked like Fritz and 
                        Susanne.

           Awwwwwwww.

                        Fritz and I are still teammates. I 
                        suppose I'm fortunate in being able to 
                        disassociate myself from other things. 
                        When I play baseball, I play baseball, 
                        with nothing else on my mind. Fritz will 
                        be a teammate.  Thank you.
           Mike tries to leave, and the reporters are going nuts 
           with more questions.

                        nobody can turn this into something 
                        sordid.  Because it wasn’t.

                        have been perfect if things worked out, 
                        but I don't feel guilty.

           OUT IN THE BULLPEN:  Fritz finishes warming up.  A couple 
           of Mets fans spot him.

                                 METS FANS
                        Hey, Peterson.  I want to introduce you 
                        to my wife.  Take her off my hands, ya 
                        bum!

           Mel walks over to Fritz.  

                                 MEL
                        Don’t let that bother you.  It’s just a 
                        couple of idiots.

                                 FRITZ
                        Thanks.
                                 PA (V.O.)
                        Today's pitcher... number 19... Fred 
                        “Fritz” Peterson...

                                 MEL
                        Get on out there.

           Fritz jogs onto the field and heads for the mound, but is 
           instantly hit with... BOOOOOOOOS!

           Fritz is taken aback by it, but makes his way to the 
           mound.  

           He looks around the stadium.  It’s a STANDING BOO-VATION.  
           The whole stadium.  Mets and Yankee fans alike.  Booing 
           him.

           Not good.

           The first batter approaches the plate.  Still more 
           booing.

                                 FRITZ
                                (to self)
                        Block it out... block it out... you’re in 
                        control.

           Fritz goes into his wind-up.  The pitch.... ball one.

           The crowd BOOING even louder.

           It can’t be blocked.  It can’t be controlled.  

           It’s fucking out of control.  Which is never good for a 
           “control pitcher.”

           YANKEES UP AT BAT - THE THIRD INNING 

           Fritz sits on the bench basically alone.  Nobody will sit 
           near him.

           The Yanks get a couple of hits, and now Fritz has to grab 
           a bat.  He heads to the on-deck circle.

                                 PA (V.O.)
                        Now batting... number nineteen... Fred 
                        “Fritz” Peterson...

           Booooooooo!

           Fritz steps into the batter’s box. 
                                 FRITZ
                                (to himself)
                        Just strike out... just strike out...

           Thwack!  Fritz hits it to shallow right and is safe at 
           first.

           The stadium booos some more.  

           Fritz is just in total shock from it.

           LATER FIFTH INNING

           Fritz walks another batter to a chorus of BOOS.

           And now out comes Ralph Houk to talk to him.

                                 HOUK
                        You’re done son.  

           Fritz hands him the ball.  

           If anything the BOOING is getting louder.

                                 HOUK (CONT’D)
                        Let them get it out of their system.  It 
                        will get better.

           Fritz heads for the showers.

           And it doesn’t get any better...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. PARKING LOT - A FEW DAYS LATER

           Reporters hounding Fritz as he walks to his car.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. FRITZ’S CAR - THE NEXT DAY

           Frtiz drives listening to the radio.

                                 PAUL HARVEY
                                (on radio)
                        ... the pitchers names?  Mike Kekich and 
                        Fritz Peterson.  And they are both New 
                        York Yankees.

                                (beat)
                        Paul Harvey... good day.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. FRITZ’S RENTAL - A FEW DAYS LATER

           Fritz’s dining room table is covered with newspapers.  
           All of them are still covering the trade.

           It will not go away.

           EXT. SPRING TRAINING GAME -  A FEW DAYS LATER

           Fritz goes into his wind-up and...

           THWACK!  A Houston Astro smacks a shot off the outfield 
           wall. 

           Fritz pitching poorly again to a sea of boos.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Another poor outing for Fritz Peterson 
                        and the Yankees.  And a familiar sight... 
                        here comes Ralph Houk with the hook.

                                 ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
                        The Yanks will be opening the season next 
                        week versus the Indians and are obviously 
                        hoping that their spring record means 
                        nothing.  Otherwise, it’s going to be a 
                        long season.

           Once again, out comes Houk.

                                 HOUK
                        Sorry, Pete.  I think it’s getting a 
                        little better, huh?

                                 FRITZ
                        Yeah.  I barely notice it.

                                 HOUK
                        This probably won’t help.

           Houk taps his left arm.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Houk is signaling for a lefty.  Who’s it 
                        going to be?
                                 ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
                        And there’s something you don’t see every 
                        day.

           Out of the bullpen comes... Mike.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Mike Kekich is going to get a little 
                        work.  I’m sure he and Peterson have some 
                        catching up to do.

           Mike jogs out to the mound and holds his hand out for the 
           ball.

           Fritz stares at him.  Mike stares back.

                                 MIKE
                        You going to give me the ball so I can 
                        pitch?

           Fritz takes the ball and puts it hard into Mike’s glove.

                                 FRITZ
                        Pitch.  Unless of course, you’re not 
                        feeling well.

           They glare at each other till Houk gets Fritz to head 
           back into the dugout.

           Mike throws a few warm-up pitches.

           The crowd BOOS.

           Oddly, Mike seems to be enjoying it.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. FRITZ’S RENTAL - THAT NIGHT

           The phone rings and Fritz answers it.

                                 FRITZ
                        Hello.

                                 MARILYN (V.O.)
                        Hello.

                                 FRITZ
                        Chip?

                                 MARILYN (V.O.)
                        Yeah.
                                 FRITZ
                        How are you doing?

                                 MARILYN (V.O.)
                        Not great.

           Fritz never wanted to hear that.

           INT. KEKICH RENTAL - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The doorbell rings.  Mike answers it.  It’s Fritz.

                                 FRITZ
                        We need to talk.

                                 MIKE
                        You want to talk.  Let’s talk.

           They sit down.

                                 FRITZ
                                (deep breath)
                        How did we ever get here?

                                 MIKE
                        I know.

                                 FRITZ
                        Is what we did so wrong?  Do they have to 
                        boo like that?  I won 17 games last year.

           Mike nods.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        I talked to Marilyn tonight.

                                 MIKE
                        She’s not talking to me.

                                 FRITZ
                        You know when we got into this, I was 
                        just happy she found someone.  And doubly 
                        happy it was you.

                                 MIKE
                        Thanks.

                                 FRITZ
                        We always said if someone wanted out, we 
                        would call the whole thing off.  Well... 
                        Marilyn wanted out, and I was too selfish 
                        to do anything about it.

                        I can’t leave her alone.  It’s wrong.

                                 MIKE
                        So what are you saying?

                                 FRITZ
                        I guess I am saying when we head north 
                        for the season, we should go back to the 
                        way it was.  
                                (beat)
                        Try and make this all go away.

                        OK...  OK.  Yeah.  I thought I was going 
                        to have to fight you.  But this is good.  
                        I like this plan.  
                                (realizes something)
                        Um...?

                        What is it?

                                 MIKE
                        Have you told Susanne?

           INT. KEKICH HOUSE - NEW JERSEY - A FEW DAYS LATER

                                (crying)
                        No!!!

                                 FRITZ
                        I know.  And I’m sorry, but that is how 
                        it has to be.  It’s what we agreed to.

                                 SUSANNE
                        Who cares what we agreed to?  I don’t 
                        want to be with Mike. 

                                 FRITZ
                        You have to.  I have to.  I told Marilyn 
                        I’d never abandon her.

                                 SUSANNE
                        Marilyn?  What about me?  What about 
                        Kirsten and Reagan?

                                 FRITZ
                                (knows he’s lying)
                        Well, maybe they would be better off with 
                        their real father.
                                 SUSANNE
                        He was never a father to them.  I don’t 
                        understand.  What’s wrong with you? 

                                 FRITZ
                        I just didn’t think it would be like 
                        this.  You know?  And now everything is 
                        soooo complicated.  We have to get this 
                        under control.

           Susanne doesn’t know what to say.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 SUSANNE
                        You already said that.  The girls are 
                        upstairs.  You tell them.

                                 FRITZ
                        I will.

           Fritz turns to leave, but before he does, puts his keys 
           to the house on the kitchen table.  Then he heads 
           upstairs.

           INT. KIRSTEN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kirsten is bossing around her sister and all their 
           stuffed animals in an elaborate tea party, as Fritz 
           enters.

                                 FRITZ
                        Hey, ladies!

           They are thrilled to see him.

                        We have tea party.

                                 FRITZ
                        OK, sure.

           Fritz sits down on a tiny chair at a tiny table.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        So girls, Daddy Fritz has to go away.
                                 KIRSTEN
                        When will you be back? Tomorrow?

           The girls “serve” him tea.

                                 FRITZ
                                (playing along)
                        Hmmm, delicious tea!  Actually, Daddy 
                        Fritz will be gone a looong time.  But 
                        Daddy Daddy is coming home.

           The girls look confused.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        You know, Daddy Daddy.  He’s going to 
                        live with you and take you to the library 
                        and the ice cream store.

                                 REAGAN
                        Cookie?

           Reagan serves him an imaginary cookies.

                                 FRITZ
                        Yummy.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        When will you be back, Daddy?

           This is awful and Fritz has no answer.  He drinks his 
           fake tea.

           EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - A LITTLE BIT LATER

           Fritz walks up to the doorway with his luggage and 
           pauses. 

           We have been here before.  He can’t bring himself to go 
           in.

           Suddenly... the door opens.  It’s Marilyn.  And she’s 
           smiling.  Or at least trying to.

                                 MARILYN
                        Welcome home.

           He heads inside.

           INT. YANKEE STADIUM - THE NEXT DAY

           Cleveland Indians vs. the Yankees.
           A ball flies over the fence, and an Indian rounds the 
           bases.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Home run Buddy Bell!  And that’s it for 
                        Fritz Peterson as the Yankees’ woes 
                        continue since the start of the season.

                                 ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
                        And listen to that: the boo-birds are 
                        back and letting Fritz know how they 
                        feel.

           Fritz walks off the mound defeated.  More booing.  He 
           looks up into the WAGs section.  Marilyn sits clapping.  
           No sign of Susanne.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Fritz finishes changing and is heading out when he bumps 
           into Mike coming out of the shower.

           They try to get out of each other’s way but keep blocking 
           each other.  It’s like running into an old girlfriend.

                                 FRITZ
                        Hey.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey.  Tough out there today.

                                 FRITZ
                        I just didn’t have it.

                                 MIKE
                        It’ll come.

                                 FRITZ
                        Thanks.

                                 MIKE
                        A couple of the fellas and I are going 
                        out to grab a drink.  You interested?

                                 FRITZ
                        I can’t.  You know Marilyn.

           Ha.

                                 MIKE
                        I saw her up in the stands.  She looks 
                        good. 
                                 FRITZ
                        I’ll tell her.
                                (beat)
                        Maybe not.

           They laugh.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        How’s--

                                 MIKE
                        Kind of a mess.  A couple of those 
                        articles really hit her hard.

                                 FRITZ
                        Sorry.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.  We all are. 

                                 FRITZ
                        I’d like to see the girls sometime.

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t think that’s a good idea.

                                 FRITZ
                        Yeah.  Well, Marilyn is waiting.

           Fritz heads off.

           INT. PETERSON HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

           Fritz stumbles down the stairs from a restless sleep.  
           Something stops him in his tracks...

           Marilyn has laid out a giant breakfast spread.

                                 MARILYN
                                (a little Stepford-y)
                        Hey, sleepyhead.  I hope you’re hungry.

           Fritz approaches the food and her demeanor cautiously.  

                                 FRITZ
                        Is this for me?

                                 MARILYN
                        Of course, silly.  Who else?

           Fritz sits down and starts eating.
                                 MARILYN (CONT’D)
                        I made all your favorites.

                                 FRITZ
                        Yeah.
                                (eating)
                        ... goood.... Hmmm.  Thanks.

                                 MARILYN
                        No need to thank me.  You know I was 
                        thinking, when you play the White Sox in 
                        October, maybe I would tag along and we 
                        could visit your family.

                                 FRITZ
                        ... OK...

           This is weird.

           INT. PETERSON BEDROOM-- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Fritz and Marilyn have sex.  She is trying very hard.

                                 MARILYN
                                (passionate)
                        Oh God!  Fritz!  Fritz!  Fritz!

           He stops her.

                                 FRITZ
                        You don’t have to do that.

                                 MARILYN
                        I love you.
                                (beat)
                        Do you love me?

                                 FRITZ
                        Yeah.

           Fritz finishes quickly to her “moans” of delight.  

           Marilyn rolls over and sleeps.  

           Fritz can only lay there staring up at the ceiling.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
           A BLUR OF GAMES AND LIFELESS SEX

           Fritz stares into the distance, be it day game, night 
           game, rain delay or sex with Marilyn.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT.YANKEE STADIUM - NIGHT

           Like a zombie, Fritz comes out of the stadium after a 
           game.  

           FRITZ’S POV:  Mike getting picked up in the Kekich family 
           car.

           Fritz runs towards the car, but they pull away.

           Fritz can only see the back of Susanne’s head as they 
           drive away.

           INT. JFK AIRPORT - THE NEXT MORNING

           The Yankee team bus unloads into the terminal.  As the 
           players get off the bus, they are handed their airline 
           tickets.

           INT. AIRPLANE - LATER

           Fritz sits next to Mel who is showing him pictures of his 
           kids.  Fritz barely listens and stares out the window.

                                 MEL
                        This is Todd in his uniform.  He’s a 
                        pitcher and plays outfield....
                                (another)
                        Here’s me showing him how to throw a 
                        change-up.  

           Fritz can’t help but think about the girls.

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        How’s... never mind.

           INT. AIRPORT - LATER

           A sign reads “Welcome to Cleveland, Ohio.”  The Yankees 
           exit the plane and head towards baggage claim.
           INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM - LATER

           Fritz is the last guy still waiting for his luggage.

                                 FRITZ
                                (to self)
                        I hate Cleveland.

           Thurman Munson comes running up with a big smile.

                                 MUNSON
                        Where’s your luggage, Pete?

                                 FRITZ
                        I don’t know.  I guess it’s coming.

                                 MUNSON
                        Wrong!  It’s on its way to France.  Ha-
                        ha!  I got you!!!  I finally got you!!! 

                                 FRITZ
                        Yes, you did.  Good one.  I have been 
                        bested by the master.

           Munson runs off as the everyone heads towards the charter 
           bus.

                                 MUNSON
                                (to other players)
                        I got Pete!  I got him good!

           Fritz walks over to Pete Sheehy.  

                                 FRITZ
                        Hey, Pete.  Thurman sent my luggage to 
                        Paris, can you call the airlines. 

                                 SHEEHY
                        No problem.  They’ll find it.

                                 FRITZ
                        Thanks!

           INT. MUNICIPAL STADIUM, CLEVELAND -  THE NEXT DAY

           Fritz sits in the dugout, once again lost in thought, as 
           the Yanks are losing to the lowly Indians.

           Fritz turns to Mel.
                                 FRITZ
                        I’ll be right back, going to go inside 
                        and grab a bite.  The only good thing 
                        about Cleveland is the Clubhouse food.

           CLUBHOUSE

           Fritz pokes around and finds a fridge with a delicious-
           looking deviled eggs.

           Fritz pulls out the tray and starts eating a few.

           Suddenly...

                                 VOICE
                        Those are for after the game.

           Fritz looks up and sees the voice of the Indians, Herb 
           Score.

                                 HERB SCORE
                        You’re going to get in trouble with the 
                        clubhouse guy.

                                 FRITZ
                        You’re Herb Score, right?  You had a hell 
                        of a curve ball.

                                 HERB SCORE
                        As good as Koufax’s and my fast ball was 
                        slightly faster.  It’s nice to meet the 
                        infamous Fritz Peterson.  You taking a 
                        break?

                                 FRITZ
                        My head wasn’t in the game.  Hasn’t been 
                        all year.

           He eats another deviled egg.

                                 HERB SCORE
                        It’s just a game.  I learned that the 
                        hard way.  Ever since that line drive hit 
                        me in the head all those years ago, it’s 
                        hard to get too excited about any one 
                        game.

                                 FRITZ
                        Man, how many years ago was that now?
                                 HERB SCORE
                        Who knows?  The only anniversary I pay 
                        attention to is the one that involves my 
                        wife.

           Herb grabs an egg.

                                 HERB SCORE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t tell anyone I took this.  See you 
                        around Fritz Peterson.

                                 FRITZ
                        See ya.

           Fritz puts the almost-empty tray back in the fridge and 
           heads back to the...

           DUGOUT

           Fritz sidles up to Munson.

                                 FRITZ
                        Hey Tugs.  They have an incredible tray 
                        of deviled eggs in a fridge down in the 
                        clubhouse.

           That sounds great to Munson.

                                 MUNSON
                        Thanks.  Be right back.

           Fritz sits back down near Mel.

                                 FRITZ
                        I met Herb Score.

                                 MEL
                        Poor bastard.  He never pitched the same 
                        after he got hit by that line drive.

                                 FRITZ
                        Yeah.  I’m not sure he cared.

           CLUBHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Thurman has found the tray of eggs and is eating one 
           when...
                                 CLUBHOUSE ATTENDANT
                        Hey!  What the hell is the matter with 
                        you?  Who eats an entire tray of eggs, 
                        you animal?

                                 MUNSON
                                (mouth full of eggs)
                        It wasn’t me. I swear.

           INT. CLEVELAND HOTEL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Fritz sits down and dials the phone.

                                 FRITZ
                        Don’t hang up!

           Reveal:  Susanne on the other end of the call.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        If I can’t be with you, then none of this 
                        is worth it.  Susanne, I thought I was 
                        doing the right thing before.  The proper 
                        thing.  But I want to be with you.  No 
                        matter how crazy it gets.  

           INT. PETERSON HOUSE -  THAT NIGHT

           The phone rings and Marilyn picks up the phone.

                                 MARILYN
                        Hello.

                                 FRITZ
                        Hey, Chip.

                                 MARILYN
                        Is everything alright?  It’s late.

                                 FRITZ
                        Yeah, everything is fine.  Well, no, not 
                        really.

           She knows right there.

                                 MARILYN
                        Fritz, please.

                                 FRITZ
                        I have to.  I can’t keep pretending like 
                        this.
                                 MARILYN
                        I love you.

                                 FRITZ
                        I don’t think you do, and I know I don’t 
                        love you.

                                 MARILYN
                        You promised.  You said you wouldn’t ever 
                        leave me.  You said.

                                 FRITZ
                        I know.  But I think for once, I have to 
                        choose my happiness over yours.  

                                 MARILYN
                        Fuck you!

                                 FRITZ
                        Marilyn, please, I’m going to hang up.

                                 MARILYN
                        Fuck you!  I tried so hard. I--

                                 FRITZ
                        It just wasn’t working.

                                 MARILYN
                        Don’t you hang up--

           For the first time ever, Fritz hangs up the phone on her.

           He won’t let her just boss him around anymore.  He wants 
           to be with Susanne, no matter what the cost.

           INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - LATER

           Fritz walks down the hallway and knocks on a door.

           A second later, Mike opens the door.  

                                 FRITZ
                        Hey, Virus, we need to talk.

           He knows what this is too.

                                 MIKE
                        Aw, crap.  Come on in.

           The door shuts.  

           Beat.
           A stewardess exits the room buttoning up her shirt and 
           smoothing out her skirt.

           EXT. KEKICH HOUSE -  NEW JERSEY - THE NEXT DAY

           Fritz parks the car and goes running up the pathway.

           Susanne throws open the door and goes running to hug him.

                                 SUSANNE
                        It’s going to get bad.

                                 FRITZ
                        I don’t care.  Let them hit us with the 
                        worst they got.

           They kiss and go inside.  We hear...

                                 KIRSTEN/REAGAN (O.S.)
                        Daddy!

           INT. YANKEE STADIUM LOCKER ROOM- A FEW DAYS LATER

           Fritz arrives and is throwing his stuff in his locker 
           when he looks over to Mike’s locker...

           It’s empty.  The name Kekich has been taken down as well.

           Pete Sheehy approaches.

                                 SHEEHY
                        Hey, Pete.

                                 FRITZ
                        Pete, did Mike move his locker out of the 
                        nursery?

                                 SHEEHY
                        Kekich is dead.  They traded him this 
                        morning.  
                                (beat)
                        The GM would like to see you too.

           Fritz is in shock as he heads upstairs.

           INT. LEE MCPHAIL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Fritz enters but someone else is behind McPhail’s desk.
                                 FRITZ
                        I’m sorry, I was told to see Mr. McPhail.

                                 MAN
                        Sit down, Fritz.  OK to call you Fritz?

                                 FRITZ
                        Sure, mister....?

                                 GABE PAUL
                        I’m Gabe Paul.  Special advisor to George 
                        Steinbrenner.  Mr. Steinbrenner has 
                        decided to get more active in the running 
                        of his team.

                                 FRITZ
                        Am I being traded?

                                 GABE PAUL
                        We sent Mr. Kekich away, because we think 
                        you can help us more.  Mr. Steinbrenner 
                        wants to win a World Series. 

                                 FRITZ
                        Believe me, we all do.

                                 GABE PAUL
                        Alright then.  

                                 FRITZ
                        Mr. Paul.  IF you guys ever decide to 
                        trade me, please do me one favor:  
                        anywhere but Cleveland.

                                 GABE PAUL
                        You have my word on that.

                                 FRITZ
                        Thanks.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. YANKEE STADIUM - APRIL 1974

           Yankees vs. The Indians.

           Fritz takes the mound... as #16 on the Cleveland Indians.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Fritz Peterson back in familiar territory 
                        as he takes on his old team the New York 
                        Yankees.
                                 ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
                        Peterson had a little bit of arm trouble 
                        last year, and they traded him at the 
                        beginning of the season for first baseman 
                        Chris Chambliss, whom the Yankees are 
                        expecting big things from.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        But Peterson’s doing OK today against his 
                        former team.  He struck out Craig Nettles 
                        and that will bring up Roy White, the 
                        Yankees right fielder.

           Roy White steps into the batter’s box.

           Fritz looks over into the Yankee dugout.  He can see Mel 
           Stottlemeyer, looking back at him and smiling.

           Fritz looks up into the stands and finds the Cleveland 
           WAGs section.  And there’s Susanne.  She waves to him.

           Fritz takes a deep breath.

                                 FRITZ
                                (to self)
                        It’s all about control.

           He winds up and throws as hard as he can...

                                 ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
                        Whoa!  Peterson hit White right on the 
                        shoulder! That is going to sting for a 
                        bit!

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.

                        ERA at old Yankee Stadium.  His 2.52 ERA 
                        beat out Whitey Ford with a 2.55.  He was 
                        a control pitcher.

                        Fritz never coached at Northern Illinois 
                        or anywhere else.  He was never hired as

                        Mike Kekich got a medical degree in

                        bought him a boat.

           EXT. PUERTO RICO WINTER BALL -- MANY YEARS LATER

           Super: Many Years Later

           Fritz trying to warm up with a game of catch.

                                (to self)
                        Christ my arm is killing me.

                        You want me to take a look at that.

           Fritz looks up to see... Mike.

                                 FRITZ
                        You a doctor now?

                                 MIKE
                        Well, in Mexico.

           Fritz laughs.  With Mike, it’s probably true.

                                 FRITZ
                        How are you?

                                 FRITZ
                        Hanging on.  Not a lot of people looking 
                        for wife-swapping announcers.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.  Susanne’s good?

                                 FRITZ

                                 FRITZ
                        I will.
                                 MIKE
                        You ever talk to Marilyn?

                                 FRITZ
                        Only through lawyers.  And if a check is 
                        late.  You?

                                 MIKE
                        Every now and then, we get together.

                                 FRITZ
                        You’re unbelievable. 

                                 MIKE
                        I’m actually remarried now.  

                                 FRITZ
                        Really?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, that’s her over there.  On the end, 
                        behind the dugout.

           Mike points into the stands to an attractive Brunette who 
           might just look a little like Marilyn.

                                 FRITZ
                        Not bad.  Not bad.

                                 MIKE
                        Thanks.

                                 FRITZ
                                (joking)
                        Wanna trade?

           As they laugh we...

                                                               FADE OUT.

           THE END.
