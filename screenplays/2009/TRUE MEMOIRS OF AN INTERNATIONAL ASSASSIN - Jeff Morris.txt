           FADE IN:

           INT. MOVIE THEATRE -- NIGHT

           A French film plays to a full house. In a black Louis Vuitton 
           suit, COLT RODGERS, mid 30s, total fucking badass, sits in 
           back. Colt’s only focus is on MIKHAIL, 30s, Euro-trash, two 
           rows up. Mikhail and a SEXY WOMAN feed each other popcorn.

           The movie ends.

           Mikhail and Sexy Woman head for the exit. Colt stalks them, 
           blends into the crowd.

           EXT. PARIS -- NIGHT 

           Mikhail and Sexy Woman stroll the bustling Avenue des Champs-
           Élysées among a throng of Parisians.  

           BEEP, BEEP, BEEP. Mikhail checks his Blackberry. CLOSE ON the 
           cell, “DANGER!”

           Fear floods Mikhail's face. He grabs the woman's hand, pulls 
           her to move faster. 

           Colt stealthily gains on them. Mikhail lets go of the chick, 
           RUNS. Mikhail desperately SHOVES PEOPLE OUT OF HIS WAY.

           Mikhail darts into the busy intersection, HORNS BLARE. He 
           nearly gets run over by a Peugeot. 

           He ducks into an art gallery. 

           INT. ART GALLERY 

           A crowd sips wine, views paintings. Mikhail frantically 
           enters, knocks over an ART SNOB. Merlot soaks the fat 
           bastard. 

           Mikhail streaks out the back.

           EXT. ALLEY

           Desolate. Quiet. Safe. Mikhail tries to catch his breath.

           COLT POPS OUT OF A DUMPSTER, FIRES A SILENCED PISTOL... 
           PFFFT! THE BULLET STRIKES MIKHAIL BETWEEN THE EYES. 

           Mikhail falls to the ground, dead. 
           Colt climbs out, tosses the gun back in the trash. He 
           straightens his tie.

           REWIND THE PREVIOUS ACTION. 

           -- Mikhail’s limp body stands up.

           -- The bullet travels out of his head back into the gun. 

           -- The dumpster shuts, Colt hides inside. 

           -- Mikhail treads backwards into the art gallery. 

           FREEZE FRAME.

           Mikhail emerges from the gallery, scared.

           COLT JUMPS OFF THE ROOF, LANDS ON MIKHAIL. 

           Colt wraps a wire around Mikhail’s neck, STRANGLES him. 
           Mikhail’s eyes roll back, his face changes color. Mikhail’s 
           legs stop kicking. 

           Colt lets the limp body fall to the pavement. He straightens 
           his tie. 

           REWIND THE PREVIOUS ACTION. 

           -- Mikhail rises from the ground, blood returns to his face. 

           -- Colt removes the wire from around Mikhail’s neck. 

           -- Colt flies up in the sky. 

           -- Mikhail moonwalks into the gallery. 

           FREEZE FRAME.

           Mikhail shoots into the deserted alley, spots Colt at the end 
           of the block. 

           Mikhail charges him, but Colt sidesteps the attack. Colt 
           punches Mikhail in the nose, follows with a round house kick 
           to the head. 

           The next few minutes turns into a martial arts clinic with 
           punches thrown so fast Compubox wouldn’t be able to keep 
           track.

           Colt gains the upper hand when he ducks an overhand right, 
           connects with a judo chop to Mikhail’s throat. Stunned, 
           Mikhail gasps for air. 
           Colt spins Mikhail around, jumps on his back. CRRRRRACK! COLT 
           SNAPS MIKHAIL’S NECK. Mikhail’s dead body bounces off the 
           asphalt.

           Colt straightens his tie. He didn’t break a sweat or wrinkle 
           the suit. He walks down the alley. Calm. Cool. Collected. 

           WE HEAR THE TYPING SOUNDS FROM A KEYBOARD OFF SCREEN.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. JOE’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           TIGHT on JOE SCHMIDT as he taps a final button on his laptop. 
           Joe smiles, content. While Joe played Colt Rodgers, Joe and 
           Colt are polar opposites.

           CLOSE ON the monitor, “THE END.”

                                 JOE
                        And that’s how Colt Rodgers rolls, 
                        sucka. It’s Mr. Rodgers 
                        neighborhood! I wouldn’t mess with 
                        you, Colt. Unless of course you 
                        wanted some of... this!!!

           Pull back as Joe, with just a pair of undies on, LEAPS OUT OF 
           HIS CHAIR and throws a series of girly punches at no one. His 
           flabby belly jiggles. 

                                 JOE
                        Or a little of... this!!!

           JOE ATTEMPTS A SPINNING BACK-KICK, BUT ACCIDENTALLY NAILS HIS 
           LAPTOP. It flies off the desk.

                                 JOE
                        Crap!

           Joe picks it up. He tries to make the computer respond, 
           clearly worried.

           CLOSE ON the monitor, “CRITICAL FAILURE!” 

                                 JOE
                        No. No. No! Please, no!!!

           LATER -- 

           Joe beams proudly at the printed out manuscript, “THE MEMOIRS 
           OF AN INTERNATIONAL ASSASSIN, BY JOE SCHMIDT.” 
           INT. ACCOUNTING FIRM -- DAY

           Joe crunches numbers. COOPER, 47, an overly self-assured Ivy 
           Leaguer, drops a pile of papers on Joe’s desk.

                                 COOPER
                        I’ll need these done by the end of 
                        the week. 

           Dumbfounded, Joe examines one of the folders. 

                                 JOE
                        But, these are Ralph’s accounts. 

           Joe peeks across the way, an empty cube. 

                                 COOPER
                        Look, between you and me, I 
                        shouldn’t have hired Ralph in the 
                        first place. But what can I do? 
                        He’s my wife’s brother. Not to 
                        mention he went to my bachelor 
                        party and he knows what I did with 
                        those strippers. He could ruin me. 
                        There might even be a video. Hate 
                        for something like that to end up 
                        on YouTube.

                                 JOE
                        You kind of lost me. 

                                 COOPER
                        Joe, we’re a team. Be a team 
                        player, okay? 

           Cooper gives Joe the single gayest wink ever.

                                 JOE
                        It’s just that I’ve been working a 
                        lot of hours so I could get ahead 
                        and maybe take a trip somewhere. 

                                 COOPER
                        Joe, Joe, Joe. I don’t understand, 
                        big guy. You travel all the time.

                                 JOE
                        For work. I haven’t used any of my 
                        vacation days the past six years. 
                                 COOPER
                        But you’re out there - seeing 
                        stuff. 

                                 JOE
                        Like Toledo. I want to go somewhere 
                        tropical.

                                 COOPER
                        Tropical is overrated. I just spent 
                        two weeks in Tahiti - worst time of 
                        my life. I shit you not. How about 
                        this? Next quarter, you and I have 
                        a very serious discussion about 
                        that vacation. No promises, but 
                        we’ll definitely talk about it. 
                        How’s that sound, shooter? 

           Cooper leaves before Joe can respond. Joe eyes a travel 
           brochure with a picture of a beach on it. Across the top it 
           reads, “Discover Belize!” 

           FRANK, late 30s, short with a Napoleon complex, stands up in 
           his cubicle next to Joe’s. 

                                 FRANK
                        Why do you let Captain Douchebag 
                        walk all over you, man? 

                                 JOE
                        He’s the boss. What am I supposed 
                        to do? 

                                 FRANK
                        Work slower. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY -- DAY

           Joe exits his apartment building, saunters through his 
           neighborhood. He wears a winter jacket, snow covers the 
           ground. He stuffs a bunch of large envelopes in the mailbox 
           at the end of the block. 

           TIME LAPSE. 

           By the time Joe returns to his apartment building, the snow 
           is long gone. Joe takes off his jacket and is now in a short 
           sleeved shirt.
           INT. JOE’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Joe rushes in with a stack of mail, tears open one of the 
           letters. 

           CLOSE ON the document, “We regret to inform you that we are 
           not interested in publishing your novel. Best of luck with 
           your writing.”

           Joe grabs another envelope, rips it open. His face indicates 
           a similar message. He tosses it, repeats several times. Joe 
           dejectedly flops on his couch, flips on the tube. 

           The telephone RINGS. Joe reaches over, answers it. 

                                 JOE
                        Hello?

           INT. WALT’S OFFICE -- NIGHT

           WALT WILLIAMS, 40, uber slick, props his feet up on his 
           mahogany desk.  A ridiculous panoramic view of the Big Apple 
           can be seen out the large window behind him. 

                                 WALT
                        Joe Schmidt? 

           INTERCUT JOE AND WALT.

                                 JOE
                        Yes?

                                 WALT
                        Walt Williams - Global Publishing. 

                                 JOE
                             (too excited)
                        Yes, hello! 

                                 WALT
                        I had a chance to read that 
                        manuscript of yours. Come by my 
                        office tomorrow afternoon and we’ll 
                        discuss it.

           A huge grin shows on Joe’s face. 

           INT. WALT’S OFFICE -- DAY

           Joe struggles to keep his composure as he meets with Walt.  
                                 WALT
                        Let me cut to the chase. I loved 
                        your manuscript. Fucking great. A 
                        real page turner. 

                                 JOE
                        That’s what my mom said. Well, she 
                        didn’t use those exact words. 

                                 WALT
                        Joe, tell me this - have you been 
                        talking to other publishers?

                                 JOE
                        I’ve... heard from a few.

                                 WALT
                        Did you talk to that asshole from 
                        Random House? 
                             (off Joe’s blank stare)
                        You did, didn’t you?! Look, I want 
                        to publish it. I believe in this 
                        book so much I’m not going to 
                        change a single word. Not a God 
                        damn one. I don’t say this very 
                        often - I think this has a chance 
                        to be a best seller. 

                                 JOE
                        Am I being Punk’d?

           Walt slides a contract over to Joe, leans back. 

                                 WALT
                        You just need to sign the contract.

           Joe peruses the offer. 

                                 WALT
                        I don’t haggle. I’m making you a 
                        fair offer. You take it - or you 
                        get the fuck out of my office and 
                        you see if that prick from Random 
                        House can touch this. 

                                 JOE
                             (gulp)
                        That’s... not chump change.

                                 WALT
                        If this book does as well as I 
                        think it will, it’s going to change 
                        your life. 
                                 JOE
                        Do you have a pen?

           INT. ACCOUNTING FIRM -- DAY

           With a swagger, Joe heads directly to Cooper’s office. Cooper 
           reads the paper. 

                                 COOPER
                        Morning, Joe. 

                                 JOE
                        I wanted to let you know, I quit.

                                 COOPER
                        Can you grab me some coffee? A 
                        little cream, a couple packs of 
                        sugar?

                                 JOE
                        Cooper, I quit.

           Cooper glimpses over his paper.

                                 JOE
                        My novel is going to be published.

                                 COOPER
                        I’m going to go ahead and say, no.

                                 JOE
                        No?

                                 COOPER
                        I’m afraid I can’t let you. If you 
                        quit on me, I’ll give you a bad 
                        referral.

           Cooper resumes reading.

                                 JOE
                        But, I don’t need a referral. I’m a 
                        writer now.

                                 COOPER
                        We all have hobbies. 

                                 JOE
                        No, no, I’m like a real writer. 
                        They’re paying me and everything. 

           Cooper closes the paper.
                                 COOPER
                        Don’t burn a bridge. You may need 
                        to come back to this job one day.

                                 JOE
                             (politely)
                        With all due respect, I hate this 
                        job. I dread waking up in the 
                        morning knowing I have to come 
                        here. Sometimes I hope the subway 
                        derails and I die so I don’t have 
                        to work here anymore.

                                 COOPER
                        Joe, I consider you a friend. 

                                 JOE
                        Since when?

                                 COOPER
                        Don’t leave me in a bind, okay? How 
                        long till your little novel or book 
                        - whatever you call it, comes out?

                                 JOE
                        Six months.

                                 COOPER
                        So what’s the rush? We’ve been good 
                        to you all these years, haven’t we? 
                        How about, as a personal favor to 
                        me, you stay on for a little while 
                        longer? Get us through tax season. 
                        Train your replacement. Then you 
                        can quit. You can go out the right 
                        way. We’ll even throw you a party. 
                        With a cake. Whatever flavor you 
                        want. I’m a black bottom man, 
                        myself. How about you?

                                 JOE
                        I like vanilla. 

                                 COOPER
                        Boooooring. But, hey, it’s your 
                        cake. We’ll get you vanilla if 
                        that’s what your heart desires. 
                        What do you say, buddy?

           Joe thinks about it. 
                                 JOE
                        I... suppose I could stay on a bit 
                        longer. 

                                 COOPER
                        Fantastic. Would you mind grabbing 
                        me that coffee now?

           Cooper goes back to reading the paper. 

           INT. BREAK ROOM -- DAY

           Frank devours a doughnut. Joe enters, pours some java. 

                                 FRANK
                        What are you still doing here?

                                 JOE
                        I reconsidered. I think I’m going 
                        to stay until my novel comes out. 

           Frank’s mouth drops, can’t believe it. 

                                 FRANK
                        You are such a pussy. 

                                 JOE
                        It wouldn’t be right to not give 
                        any notice.

                                 FRANK
                        Dude, admit it, you have Vaginitis.

                                 JOE
                        I’m being professional.

                                 FRANK
                        A professional pussy. 

                                 JOE
                        I’ll have you know, Cooper made me 
                        a pretty compelling offer to stay.

           A beat.

                                 FRANK
                        Who am I kidding? I’d probably do 
                        the same thing. 
                             (beat)
                        Hey, this is kind of a weird 
                        request, but my chick asked me to 
                        pick up some tampons for her today. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANK (cont'd)
                        I’m not going to be able to do it, 
                        super busy. Is there any chance you 
                        can grab some for me at lunch? 

                                 JOE
                             (reluctantly)
                        I guess - do I need to know her 
                        size?

                                 FRANK
                        You soooo have a vagina! What’s 
                        with you?! 

                                 JOE
                        I was being nice.

                                 FRANK
                        Hello?! You’re too nice. You were 
                        going to pick up tampons for my 
                        girlfriend! I won’t pick up tampons 
                        for my girlfriend! 
                             (another approach)
                        If I just signed some huge contract 
                        to have a book published, I would 
                        have walked into Cooper’s office 
                        and slapped him in the face. I 
                        wouldn’t have even said, I quit. I 
                        would have bitch slapped him and 
                        walked out. Maybe pissed in his 
                        garbage can too. 

           Frank snags another doughnut from the pink box. Joe eyes the 
           coffee pot.

                                                     MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. BREAK ROOM -- DAY

           SUPER: 6 MONTHS LATER

           Next to the coffee pot is a large vanilla cake with the words 
           “Good Luck Joe!” written in frosting. All of Joe’s coworkers 
           toast their mugs. 

                                 FRANK
                        To Joe’s novel and to never having 
                        to look at another spreadsheet 
                        again! God, I hate you! You better 
                        not forget us when you’re famous 
                        and up to your ears in chicks and 
                        coke. Living the dream. 
           Joe glows, a wonderful new life ahead of him. He glances down 
           at his belongings in a neatly organized box. The tropical 
           travel brochure that says, “Discover Belize!” rests on top. 

           INT. BOOKSTORE -- DAY

           The STORE EMPLOYEE, 22, a goth college girl, unlocks the door 
           and flips the closed sign to open. 

           The BELL ON THE DOOR JINGLES as Joe bolts inside. He spots 
           the fiction new release section, eagerly scans for his book. 

           Joe doesn’t see his novel, approaches the Store Employee. 

                                 JOE
                        Hi, I’m looking for a book. It came 
                        out today. The Memoirs of an 
                        International Assassin.

           She types the title into her computer. 

                                 STORE EMPLOYEE
                        Should have plenty in stock. 

                                 JOE
                        I didn’t see it.

                                 STORE EMPLOYEE
                        Did you look in the nonfiction new 
                        release section?

           Joe follows her to a different area of the store.

                                 JOE
                        Uh, no, because it’s fiction. 
                        Fiction as in, made up. It’s okay, 
                        a lot of people get those confused.

           She grabs the book. 

                                 STORE EMPLOYEE
                             (snarky)
                        This book here is nonfiction, as in 
                        not made up. A true story.

           CLOSE ON the book, “THE TRUE MEMOIRS OF AN INTERNATIONAL 
           ASSASSIN.” Below the title, a cheesy pulp-novel illustration 
           of Joe gripping a pistol with a malicious scowl. 

                                 STORE EMPLOYEE
                        Anything else I can help you find?
                                 JOE
                             (horrified)
                        Oh. My. God. 

                                 STORE EMPLOYEE
                        Something wrong? 

           She notices the picture of Joe.

                                 STORE EMPLOYEE
                        Hey, that’s you. Did you write 
                        this? 

                                 JOE
                        Uh, yeah.

                                 STORE EMPLOYEE
                        You were an assassin? Holy shit.
                             (seductively)
                        So, you’ve like, killed people? 

           INT. WALT’S OFFICE -- DAY

           Walt chats on the phone, Joe barges in. 

                                 JOE
                        Walt, there’s been a huge mistake. 

                                 WALT
                             (on the phone)
                        I’ll call you back. 

           Walt hangs up. 

                                 JOE
                        There was a printing error. 

           Joe holds up a copy of the book. 

                                 JOE
                        It says, “The True Memoirs of an 
                        International Assassin.”

                                 WALT
                        Sit down, would ya?

           Joe does, flustered. 

                                 WALT
                        I changed the title. It works 
                        better this way.
                                 JOE
                        Why would you do that?

                                 WALT
                        To sell more of those fuckers. 

                                 JOE
                        I thought you weren’t going to 
                        change a single word?

                                 WALT
                        I didn’t. I added one. 

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, the word “true!” 

                                 WALT
                        Has a nice ring to it now, doesn’t 
                        it? The True Memoirs of an 
                        International Assassin. Rolls off 
                        the tongue. 

                                 JOE
                        It’s fiction. People will think 
                        it’s real! 

                                 WALT
                        Real is subjective. You think this 
                        desk is real mahogany? I mean, it 
                        is. But most aren't.

           Joe paces the room, incensed. 

                                 JOE
                        The girl at the bookstore asked if 
                        I killed people! Me! I can’t even 
                        play violent video games!

                                 WALT
                        Take a deep breath. You’re acting 
                        crazy. 

                                 JOE
                             (realizes)
                        I told my grandmother to buy a 
                        copy! 

           Walt leans back, props his feet up. 
                                 WALT
                        Joe, this is done all the time. 
                        I’ve already scheduled you to do 
                        everything from Good Morning 
                        America to 60 Minutes to Bill 
                        O’Reilly. You just need to play 
                        along. Pretend to be the guy from 
                        your book. 

                                 JOE
                        Colt Rodgers?

           Walt SNAPS his fingers. 

                                 WALT
                        Yeah, him.

                                 JOE
                             (flabbergasted)
                        You want me to pretend that I’m an 
                        assassin?!

                                 WALT
                        Joe, don’t be ridiculous. Of course 
                        not.

           Joe relaxes.

                        Colt murdered people for money!

                        A lot of people for money. And you 
                        were fucking good at it. You make 
                        Jason Bourne look like a bitch. 

                                 JOE
                        Are you out of your mind?! I can’t 
                        go around having the world think 
                        I’ve killed people.

                        Walt - this is fraud! If people 
                        find out, I’ll never be able to

                        going to be a writer. I called 
                        Random House to gloat after you 
                        signed the contract. They told me 
                        they rejected it - as did every 
                        other major publishing company. You 
                        want to be a writer, lie! Tell 
                        people you were an assassin. 

                                 JOE
                        No one is going to believe me - I’m 
                        about as intimidating as Ryan 
                        Seacrest. I’m not going to go along 
                        with this. No way.

           Joe plops down on the couch. 

                                 WALT
                        Yes, you are.

           Walt snatches a golf club from his bag in the corner. He

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY -- DAY

           Joe marches down the sidewalk, talks on his phone.

                                 JOE
                             (discreetly)
                        No, Mom, I didn’t kill anyone! 
                             (beat)
                        Yes, I swear!

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- DAY

           Joe walks with STEVE KROFT from 60 Minutes. A couple of 
           CAMERAMEN and a BOOM OPERATOR record the conversation. 

                                 STEVE KROFT
                             (to the camera)
                        For the last fifteen years, Joe 
                        Schmidt, AKA, Colt Rodgers, was the 
                        world’s deadliest hitman. Luckily 
                        for those who may have become a 
                        target, Schmidt retired. He details 
                        his time as a contract killer in 
                        his book, The True Memoirs of an 
                        International Assassin. The names 
                        of his victims have been changed to 
                        protect Schmidt from prosecution. 
                             (to Joe)
                        What made you become a killer? I 
                        mean, how does someone decide to 
                        start murdering people for money? 

           Joe looks extremely uncomfortable.

                                 JOE
                        You know, I really can’t tell you.  

                                 STEVE KROFT
                             (to the camera)
                        Devoid of emotion, Schmidt would do 
                        the work of the highest bidder. 
                        Only those in the underworld would 
                        even know how to retain his 
                        services. 
                             (to Joe)
                        What do you think made you so good 
                        at assassinating your victims?

                                 JOE
                        I’d rather people just read the 
                        book. 
                                 STEVE KROFT
                        But in your book, none of your 
                        victims ever saw you coming. Is 
                        that true?

                                 JOE
                        I can guarantee you that. 

                                 STEVE KROFT
                             (to the camera)
                        His face and personality are so 
                        forgettable, Schmidt had a distinct 
                        advantage in his line of work. He 
                        could blend into any society and go 
                        unnoticed. 

           Joe gives him a dumbfounded look.

           INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS -- NIGHT

           AGENT JACKSON, 40, bald, sits with AGENT ZUCKER, ugly, 30, in 
           his office. The CIA seal is visible on the wall behind them. 
           They watch Joe’s edited interview on 60 Minutes. 

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        Who is this guy and why have I 
                        never heard of him?

                                 AGENT ZUCKER
                        Could he be that good?

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        Let’s pull up whatever we can and 
                        keep an eye on him. 

           INT. RETIREMENT HOME -- NIGHT

           GRANDMA SCHMIDT, 85, frail, watches 60 Minutes with a group 
           of elderly women. They are all in shock.

                        He used to be such a good boy.

           INT. MAGAZINE OFFICE -- DAY

           The magazine’s editor, SIMON, 45, British, scribbles on a 
           mock-up. Extremely beautiful and sophisticated, CLAIRE BROWN, 
           early 30s, enters with Joe’s book in her hand. 
                                 CLAIRE
                        How would you like to have the 
                        exclusive on the next fake memoir?

           She lobs the book on his desk. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I went to high school with him and 
                        there’s no chance he was an 
                        assassin.

                                 SIMON
                        I’m listening.

                                 CLAIRE
                        He couldn’t kill anyone - he 
                        couldn’t even ask me out. 

                                 SIMON
                        People change. It was twenty years 
                        ago.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Fifteen! 

                                 SIMON
                        Just because he didn’t ask you out 
                        doesn’t mean anything. Were you fat 
                        in high school?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Prom queen. And he was cute, in a 
                        nerdy sort of way.  

                                 SIMON
                        It’s always the quiet unassuming 
                        kind. Look at Jeffrey Dahmer. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Dahmer wasn’t cute. He ate people. 
                        I want to do an exposé. 

                                 SIMON
                        Do a piece on Tom Cruise or Brad 
                        Pitt. Readers love that stuff.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m sick of doing fluff. 

                                 SIMON
                        We sell fluff. 
                                 CLAIRE
                        Give me a shot. I’ve paid my dues. 
                        If I pull this off, it will make 
                        the magazine relevant again. 

           Simon thinks for a second. 

                                 SIMON
                        If you come back with nothing, from 
                        here on out, you will write fluff 
                        and like it. You will be my 
                        personal fluffer. 

           She shoots him a look.

                                 SIMON
                        Not what I meant. 

           INT. GROCERY STORE -- NIGHT

           Joe pushes his cart down an aisle. He stops, grabs his 
           favorite brand of extra sensitive hand lotion. Nerdy 
           teenagers, LANCE, 17, and ZACK, 18, approach Joe. 

                                 LANCE
                        Dude, you’re the guy. You were on 
                        The Daily Show, right?  

                                 ZACK
                        We have your book - it kicks more 
                        ass than Chuck Norris!

                                 LANCE
                        When I get older, I totally want to 
                        be an assassin.

                                 JOE
                        Uh, no you don’t. I recommend going 
                        to college. 

                                 ZACK
                        Assassin college!

                                 LANCE
                        Could you show us some of your neck 
                        snapping techniques?

                                 JOE
                        Bum shoulder.
                                 ZACK
                        From that shrapnel wound in Prague, 
                        right?

                                 LANCE
                        Can we get an autograph?

           Joe shrugs, but seems hesitant. Lance hands Joe a notebook 
           and pen from his backpack.

                                 LANCE
                        Could you make it out to, Lance 
                        “The Blade” Fluer - the only man I 
                        was ever afraid of. I know you’re 
                        not, but it would look cool.

           Joe starts to sign. 

                                 LANCE
                        Oh, would you mind signing it, 
                        “Your Bitch - Colt Rodgers.”

           Joe looks up questioningly. 

                                 LANCE
                        Come on, please? It would be sick.

           Joe shakes his head, signs it. 

                                 LANCE
                             (to Zack)
                        Dude, take a picture of me with 
                        Colt. 

           Zack holds up his camera phone.

                                 ZACK
                             (to Joe)
                        Could you look like you’re about to 
                        shit your pants? That would be so 
                        pimp.

           Zack snaps a picture of Lance with his arm around a grimacing 
           Joe who looks more constipated than anything else. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY -- NIGHT

           Joe fumes, talks on his cell phone as he leaves the market.
                                 JOE
                        Walt, I can’t do this. People want 
                        to take pictures of me shitting my 
                        pants!

                        No, Mom, I’m not running. I’m 
                        taking a vacation. 

           INT. CIA VAN -- DAY

           Agent Zucker listens in on Joe’s phone call, wears 
           headphones. 

                                 JOE (O.S.)
                        I’ll call you when I get back. 

           INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS -- DAY

           Agent Jackson examines a file as Agent Zucker enters. 

                                 AGENT ZUCKER
                        Schmidt’s going to Belize.

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        Belize?

                                 AGENT ZUCKER
                        It’s a small English speaking 
                        country in Central America popular 
                        with honeymooners for its beaches 
                        and warm ocean water. 

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        I know where Belize is! What’s he 
                        going down there for?

                                 AGENT ZUCKER
                        We don’t know, sir. 

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        Well... let’s go find out.
           INT. MAGAZINE OFFICE -- DAY

           Claire sits at her desk, holds the phone against her face. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I was hoping to arrange an 
                        interview with Joe Schmidt. We want 
                        to do a big story on the book.

           INT. WALT’S OFFICE -- DAY

           Walt practices putting, uses the speaker phone.

                                 WALT
                        No can do, honey. Joe’s done doing 
                        press. After O’Reilly roughed him 
                        up, he’s denied all requests for 
                        interviews. 

           INTERCUT CLAIRE WITH WALT.

                                 CLAIRE
                        We went to high school together. I 
                        think I might be able to get him to 
                        reconsider. 

                                 WALT
                        He’s leaving for Belize tomorrow, 
                        but I’ll see what I can do when he 
                        gets back.

           Claire smiles...

                                 CLAIRE
                        Belize, huh?

           INT. AIRPLANE - FIRST CLASS -- DAY

           A PRETTY LADY sits next to Joe, reads his book. She studies 
           the cover, sneaks a peek at him. Awkward.

           EXT. BELIZE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- DAY

           A SHUTTLE DRIVER stands next to a HOTEL LIAISON who holds a 
           sign that reads, “Joe Schmidt.” Joe exits the terminal with 
           his luggage, waves to the men.
                                 HOTEL LIAISON 
                        Joe Schmidt? Welcome to Belize. 
                        Allow us to get your bags. 

           The driver grabs the suitcases. They walk over to a white van 
           parked nearby.

                                 SHUTTLE DRIVER
                        Have you been to Belize before?

                                 JOE
                        I’m a virgin.

                                 HOTEL LIAISON
                        You will like it very much here.

           INT. VAN -- DAY

           Joe rides in the back, views the various oceanfront resorts 
           off to the side of the road. 

                                 HOTEL LIAISON
                        While you are here, you must check 
                        out the Great Blue Hole - it’s 
                        quite magnificent. 

           A property catches Joe’s eye. 

                                 JOE
                        Hey guys, not to be a backseat 
                        driver, but isn’t that my resort?

           The van continues past, SPEEDS UP.

                                 SHUTTLE DRIVER
                        We take a different way in for our 
                        celebrity guests. 

                                 JOE
                        I wouldn’t say I’m a “celebrity.”

           THE HOTEL LIAISON FORCES A CLOTH TO JOE’S FACE. He struggles 
           for a few seconds before he’s out cold. 

           I/E. EL TORO’S MANSION -- DAY

           An opulent estate with multiple pools is backed up against 
           the ocean. 

           Marble floors, sculptures and expensive art; the place is fit 
           for a drug lord or Donald Trump. 
           EL TORO, 55, stands with TEN ARMED MEN in front of Joe, who 
           begins to wake. El Toro’s charm and sophistication hide the 
           evil. 

           Now alert, Joe notices all the guns. He looks close to 
           pissing himself - if he hasn’t done so already. 

                                 JOE
                        I didn’t do anything. You got the 
                        wrong guy!

                                 EL TORO
                             (broken English)
                        Allow me to apologize about taking 
                        you here this way. I assure you, I 
                        mean you no harm. 

           El Toro nods to his guys, the guns are holstered. 

                                 EL TORO
                        My name is El Toro. I would like to 
                        hire you to kill the Prime 
                        Minister. He is a very bad man.

                                 JOE
                        And you want to kill him, kill him? 

                                 EL TORO
                        I want you to kill him good. I want 
                        him very dead. 

                                 JOE
                        I don’t mean to pry, but what could 
                        he have possibly done to you that 
                        was so bad you want to kill him?

           Sadness overcomes El Toro, he stares out to the ocean. A true 
           softer side emerges. 

                                 EL TORO
                        He killed my mother.

                                 JOE
                        Oh my God, that’s awful. 

                                 EL TORO
                        I’m kidding. He costs me a lot of 
                        money. Take a walk with me. 

           El Toro guides Joe through the luxurious mansion. Nothing but 
           decadence. Two of El Toro’s henchmen walk closely behind. 
                                 EL TORO
                        I loved your book. 

                                 JOE
                        Oh thanks. I worked hard to create 
                        a world ... What were you saying?

                                 EL TORO
                        My men don’t have the passion for 
                        killing like you do. They’re 
                        sloppy. For this, I need a 
                        professional. I need you, Colt 
                        Rodgers. 

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, about that...

                                 EL TORO
                        I never take no for an answer. 
                        Seriously. 

                                 JOE
                        There’s something you should know. 
                        I’m not really an assassin. I’m 
                        just an accountant.

           El Toro eyes him very intensely, then LAUGHS MADLY.

                                 EL TORO
                        That is a good one, Colt Rodgers!!!

           The MEN CRACK UP as well. 

                                 EL TORO
                        An accountant! Very funny!

           El Toro hands him a picture of the Prime Minister. 

                                 EL TORO
                        The Prime Minister will be at his 
                        estate for one week. He has forty 
                        or fifty secret service men 
                        protecting him at any given time. 
                        His house has barbed wire and 
                        surveillance cameras everywhere. 
                        Oh, and there are a few dogs. But 
                        that’s it. It should be very easy - 
                        nothing like the job you had in the 
                        Czech Republic, right?
                                 JOE
                        Uh, yeah. Okay, look, I’d like to 
                        help you because you know, I love 
                        assassinating people, but I’m 
                        retired. A few months ago, I 
                        totally would have done it. 

                                 EL TORO
                        I think you should come out of 
                        retirement - for your biggest fan. 

                                 JOE
                        Can’t you talk out your problems? 
                        Work it out like adults? 
                        Assassination should be a last 
                        resort. 

                                 EL TORO
                        It is, that is why I’m hiring you.

           El Toro nods to a cohort. The man leaves briefly, returns 
           with a suitcase. 

           CLICK, CLICK. El Toro opens it. Nothing but tightly bound 
           hundred dollar bills inside. 

                                 EL TORO
                        For your fee. 

           Joe looks unsure how he should react to it. El Toro tries to 
           read Joe. 

                                 EL TORO 
                        Fine!!!

           El Toro motions to his guy again. He brings over another 
           suitcase, CLICK, CLICK. Again, a stupid amount of money 
           inside.

                                 EL TORO
                        This is my final offer. 

           Joe scans all the men located through the house with guns - 
           there’s a lot of them. 

                                 JOE
                        Oh... what the hay! Only because 
                        you’re my biggest fan.

                                 EL TORO
                        This is wonderful!
                                 JOE
                        Yeah, super excited about getting 
                        back to killing.

                                 EL TORO
                        Would you mind signing a copy of my 
                        book?

                                 JOE
                        My pleasure. 

           A bodyguard hands Joe a pen and a copy of his book. He 
           autographs it, “To my biggest fan!”  

                                 EL TORO
                        Very good picture of you.

                                 JOE
                        That’s my best side. 

           Several large crates of weapons get unloaded on the floor. 
           It’s a candy store for terrorists. Machine guns, assault 
           rifles, bazookas, etc. 

                                 EL TORO
                        Please, take whatever you like... 
                        for the job. 

           INT. HELICOPTER -- DAY

           Agent Jackson and a few other CIA Agents stare into the house 
           with binoculars from up in the sky. They observe Joe sifting 
           through the various weapons. 

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        Son of a bitch! Guess this guy is 
                        who he says. It sure doesn’t look 
                        like he’s retired. How could he 
                        have possibly stayed under our 
                        radar this long?!

                                 AGENT ZUCKER
                        Should we intercept him at the 
                        hotel for extradition to the United 
                        States?

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        And what are we going to hold him 
                        on? All those weapons are legal in 
                        this country. We need to get him in 
                        the act. 
                                 AGENT ZUCKER
                        They should seriously rethink their 
                        gun laws here. 

           The chopper reverses course back to the mainland. 

           INT. EL TORO’S MANSION -- DAY

           Enough weapons for a government coup form a pile. 

                                 JOE
                        That’s probably enough. 

                                 EL TORO
                        You don’t want the rocket launcher?

                                 JOE
                        I think I’m good.

                                 EL TORO
                        Take it. It’s always good to have 
                        one around. How about the anti-tank 
                        missile?

                                 JOE
                        Sure. Never know when you might 
                        need one, right?

                                 EL TORO
                        Night vision goggles?

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, okay. Those could be fun.

           The two men stroll to the door. 

                                 EL TORO
                        To protect my investment, Felipe 
                        will be watching your every move. 

           FELIPE, 30, yolked, smiles politely at Joe. 

                                 JOE
                        I wouldn’t try to skip out or 
                        anything.

                                 EL TORO
                             (deadly serious)
                        I know. It’s only a precautionary 
                        measure. Enjoy your time in Belize. 

           Joe grits his teeth, surely the thought crossed his mind. 
                                 JOE
                        What’s happening, Felipe? Give me a 
                        pound. 

           Joe puts his fist out, Felipe doesn’t move or speak.

                                 JOE
                        I have a feeling you and I are 
                        going to hit it off.

           Suitcases in hand, Joe treks outside with Felipe. The weapons 
           get placed into a crate and loaded in the back of the van. 

           I/E. RESORT -- DAY

           Parents and children alike enjoy the five-star resort’s 
           facilities. 

           KENNY, 25, chubby with a baby face, works the registration.

           Felipe carries the stockpile of artillery to the front desk 
           with Joe’s luggage. Joe holds the briefcases of cash, wears a 
           backpack over a shoulder. 

                                 JOE
                        I can take it from here, thanks.

           Felipe takes a seat in the lobby, Joe heads over to check in.

                                 JOE
                             (to Felipe)
                        Do you want to meet at the pool?

           Felipe is not going anywhere. 

                                 JOE
                        Or sit there. Good idea. It’s fine. 
                             (to Kenny)
                        He’s lost without me.  

                                 KENNY
                        Hi, checking in?

                                 JOE
                        The reservation is under, Joe 
                        Schmidt. 

                                 KENNY
                        The Joe Schmidt? 

           The attention makes Joe uncomfortable.
                                 KENNY
                        Can you sign this for me, please?

                                 JOE
                             (angry)
                        You know, I am getting sick and 
                        tired of this. Can’t people leave 
                        me alone! I write one lousy book 
                        and now I can’t go anywhere without 
                        people knowing who the hell I am!!! 

           His tirade causes a commotion, everyone in the lobby gawks. 

                                 JOE
                        You know what, fame is not all it’s 
                        cracked up to be! If I have to sign 
                        another stupid autograph, I’m going 
                        to...

                                 KENNY
                        ...It’s for your room. In case 
                        there are any damages. 

           Joe eyes the document, it’s a hotel form. A GUEST whispers to 
           his WIFE.

                                 GUEST
                        What an asshole. 

                                 JOE
                        But you said, “the” Joe Schmidt 
                        like you knew who I am.

                                 KENNY
                        I do it with all our guests to make 
                        them feel special. 

                                 JOE
                             (humbly)
                        It’s a nice touch.

           Kenny slides the room card to Joe.

                                 KENNY
                        Here is your key. We’ll go ahead 
                        and send your things up. 

           Kenny tags the weapons crate. 

                                 KENNY
                        If there is anything we can do for 
                        you, please let us know. 
           Joe makes his way to the elevator, past the bar. He stops, 
           something catches his eye. 

           At the bar, Claire enjoys a fruity drink. She wears a bikini, 
           looks incredible. 

           In SUPER SLOW MOTION, Claire sensually licks the cherry from 
           her Mai Tai. 

           Claire turns, sees Joe. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Joe Schmidt?!

           Joe snaps out of his daze. 

                                 JOE
                        Claire Brown? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        What are you doing here?

                                 JOE
                        I’m on vacation. What about you?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Same.

                                 JOE
                        This is crazy. I haven’t seen you 
                        since...

                                 CLAIRE
                        High school.

           Claire rises to give Joe a hug. He sets his things down, 
           doesn’t notice a 9MM handgun slip out of his backpack. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        How have you been?

                                 JOE
                        Great. You look hot. Did I just say 
                        that? I mean you look fantastic. 

           She giggles. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        You too.  

                                 JOE
                             (surprised)
                        I did get a haircut.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOE (cont'd)
                             (beat)
                        I can’t believe this. I mean what a 
                        strange coinkydink. I don’t 
                        normally use the phrase coinkydink. 
                        Are you staying here? How long are 
                        you in town?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I just checked in. I’ll be here for 
                        a week. 

                                 JOE
                        Me too. 

           Joe notices the gun, doesn’t know what to do. Claire doesn’t 
           see it.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What a small world.

                                 JOE
                        Are you here with your... husband?

           Joe reaches for the pistol with his foot to slide it back, 
           but misses.

                                 CLAIRE
                        No. How about you?

                                 JOE
                        No, I like women. I came alone. 

           She sees the gun.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        Is that your... gun?

                                 JOE
                        No!

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m pretty sure it was in your 
                        backpack.

                                 JOE
                        Oh right, that is mine. It looked 
                        different for a second. 

           Joe stuffs it away. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why do you have a gun?
                                 JOE
                             (gulp)
                        For... fishing. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        You fish with a gun?

                                 JOE
                        Easier than a pole. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Ooookay. Well, look, why don’t you 
                        go put your stuff away and come 
                        back and have a drink with me?

                                 JOE
                        Seriously?!
                             (cool)
                        I mean, sure, I’d love to.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Great. Then I’ll see you in a 
                        little while.

                                 JOE
                        Not if I see you first. 

           Joe hurries over to the elevator, no clue how retarded he 
           just sounded. 

           As the doors close, a puzzled look wipes over Claire’s face. 
           She pulls out a small notebook from her purse, jots something 
           down. 

           INT. JOE’S HOTEL ROOM -- DAY

           Joe pops open one of the suitcases El Toro gave him. He 
           examines the cash. Picks it up, smells it. It doesn’t smell 
           very good.

           A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. 

                                 JOE
                        Be right there.

           Joe rushes over to the bathroom with the suitcases, lays them 
           on the counter out of sight. He quickly hustles back, grabs 
           the door. 

                                 KENNY
                        Hello again.
           Kenny shoves the bell hop push cart inside. Felipe sits in 
           the hallway.

                                 JOE
                        Sorry again about my behavior. 

                                 KENNY
                        Already forgotten. 

           It takes every bit of strength Kenny possesses to unload 
           Joe’s crate. 

                                 KENNY
                        What do you have in here? This 
                        weighs a ton.

                                 JOE
                        Uh... golf clubs.  

                                 KENNY
                        You do realize you’re only allowed 
                        to have fourteen in your bag? Is 
                        there anything else you need?

                                 JOE
                        I think I’m good. Thanks.

                                 KENNY
                        I guess I’ll be going then.

           Kenny waits for a tip, Joe doesn’t get it. 

                                 KENNY
                        Nice day, huh? Hot. 
                             (beat)
                        There’s actually a chance of 
                        showers later if you can believe 
                        something as nutty as that. Weather 
                        changes fast in Belize. One minute 
                        it’s nice - the next, bam! It’s 
                        pouring. I’m not talking a little 
                        drizzle either - I mean like Noah’s 
                        Arc raining - the world is coming 
                        to an end... 

                                 JOE
                             (realizes)
                        Oh, sorry. 

           Joe digs in his pocket for some cash, but doesn’t seem to 
           have any. An idea...
                                 JOE
                        Be right back.

           Joe scoots into the bathroom, snakes a one hundred dollar 
           bill from the suitcase. He returns, gives it to Kenny. Kenny 
           looks at it twice to make sure his eyes are not deceiving 
           him.  

                                 KENNY
                        Can I give you a massage or 
                        something?

           Off Joe’s look. 

                                 KENNY
                        For... the big tip. Maybe I should 
                        have just said, thank you. 

           Joe nods. Kenny gets ready to leave, turns back.

                                 KENNY
                        Okay, I have a confession. I knew 
                        who you were when you checked in. 
                        I’m a huge assassin junkie. I can’t 
                        get enough of that crap. I’m 
                        honored to meet you. I promise I 
                        won’t bother you. I just thought 
                        you should know.

                                 JOE
                        What’s your name?

                                 KENNY
                        Kenny.

                                 JOE
                        I’ll see you around, Kenny. 

                                 KENNY
                        Make sure you see the Great Blue 
                        Hole while you’re here. It’s quite 
                        magnificent.

           Kenny shuts the door, leaves. 

           EXT. HOTEL BAR -- DAY

           Joe shares a drink with Claire on the patio overlooking the 
           ocean. Felipe sits at the table next to them. Joe waves, 
           Felipe remains stone faced.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Why did you come on vacation by 
                        yourself?

                                 JOE
                        I have needed a vacation for a very 
                        long time. I’m a workaholic.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What do you do?

                                 JOE
                        I’m a...
                             (thinks better of it)
                        ...accountant. Boring.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Everyone needs an accountant.

                                 JOE
                        What about you?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I sell insurance.

                                 JOE
                        Everyone needs insurance.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What we need is another drink. 

           Across the bar, DIEGO MARTINEZ, 25, covered in tattoos, eats 
           lunch. He spots Joe, eyes him suspiciously. 

           Diego discretely picks up his cell phone, dials a number.

           EXT. CARGO SHIP -- DAY

           Lights flash on a police boat tied up to a large cargo ship. 

           On the deck, FEDERALES and THUGS hold the ship’s crew at gun 
           point.

           JESUS SANCHEZ, an intimidating figure with acne scars, puffs 
           on a cigar, commands the operation. He PISTOL WHIPS the 
           ship’s CAPTAIN, 60. 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Do you know whose boat this is? Do 
                        you know what he’ll do to you when 
                        he finds out you are stealing from 
                        him?! 
           Jesus FIRES A BULLET into the sky, terrifies the captain.

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        Do you think I am worried about El 
                        Toro? 

           A GOON emerges from the bow of the ship with a surfboard. He 
           takes a hammer to it, cracks it open. He pulls out bags of 
           cocaine. 

                                 GOON
                        Jackpot. 

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        Unload all of it into our boat. 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        He’s going to kill you! 

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        You annoy me. 

           Jesus’ guy throws the Captain overboard. SPLASH. 

           The men pull the loot out of more surfboards, toss it onto 
           the police boat with precision. They’ve done this before.  

           Jesus’ CELL PHONE RINGS. 

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        This better be important.

           INTERCUT JESUS WITH DIEGO.

                                 DIEGO
                        Boss. You’ll never guess who is at 
                        the hotel right now? 

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        Ricky Martin.

                                 DIEGO
                        Uh, no. Colt Rodgers.

           Jesus grows frustrated, luckily for Diego he’s not nearby. 

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        Who is Colt Rodgers?!

                                 DIEGO
                        An assassin. He wrote a book. He 
                        was on 60 Minutes.
                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        And you’re telling me this, why?!!!

                                 DIEGO
                        In one of the chapters he said he 
                        assassinated a scuba instructor. 

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        Thanks for the book report. I’ll 
                        make sure to buy a copy the next 
                        time I’m at Barnes and fucking 
                        Noble. 

                                 DIEGO
                        But, your brother was a scuba 
                        instructor.

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        My brother taught sailing. 

                                 DIEGO
                        Man, I thought for sure it was 
                        scuba.

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        Nope. Sailing, you idiot.

                                 DIEGO
                        Well why do you think he’s in 
                        Belize?

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        How should I know?! Maybe he’s on 
                        vacation! 
                             (to himself)
                        I’m surrounded by morons today.

                                 DIEGO
                        Okay, fine. I just thought it was a 
                        little weird a world renown 
                        assassin is hanging out with one of 
                        El Toro’s guys.  

           Jesus suddenly looks very concerned.

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        What did you say?

                                 DIEGO
                        I saw them come in together. 
                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        So El Toro hired an assassin to 
                        kill me, huh?
                             (beat)
                        Take him out! 

           EXT. HOTEL BAR -- DAY

           Diego puts his phone away, throws some cash on the table and 
           bounces. 

           The WAITER places a couple more drinks in front of Joe and 
           Claire. They look like they are starting to get a little 
           tipsy. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why do you really have a gun?

                                 JOE
                        For fishing, I said. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Fishing?

                                 JOE
                        I shoot sharks and stuff. 
                        Underwater. It’s fun.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What a bizarre interest to have. 

                                 JOE
                        I’m a big shark hunter. I know I 
                        don’t look like it, but I am. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sounds dangerous.

                                 JOE
                        My life is danger. Some guys play 
                        softball, I shark hunt.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You’ve sure changed since high 
                        school.

                                 JOE
                        What do you mean?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don’t know. Hard to explain. 
                                 JOE
                        You’ve changed too. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        How?

                                 JOE
                        You were always doing crazy stuff.

           She rolls her eyes. 

                                 JOE
                        Streaking in the quad - at lunch. 
                        Stealing Jefferson’s mascot - 
                        toilet papering the principal’s 
                        house. I never would have imagined 
                        that girl would end up selling 
                        insurance. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah, me neither. 

                                 JOE
                        I thought maybe you would be in 
                        prison. Or dead. 

           She hits him on the arm - kinda hard.  

           EXT. BEACH -- NIGHT

           Hours have passed. Joe and Claire walk along the water. 
           Felipe follows a little ways back.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Maybe I’ve had too much to drink, 
                        but I think that guy is following 
                        us. 

                                 JOE
                        Oh that’s Felipe. My bodyguard. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        You have a bodyguard?

                                 JOE
                        I am one bad ass accountant. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’ll say. 

                                 JOE
                        We met earlier. He’s harmless. 
                                 CLAIRE
                        It’s getting late. I should 
                        probably get going.

                                 JOE
                        I had a nice time tonight.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I guess I’ll see you around then, 
                        huh?

                                 JOE
                        Hey, Claire?

           He wants to ask her out. She knows. Hopeful, she smiles to 
           encourage him.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah...

                                 JOE
                        Don’t drink the tap water. It will 
                        give you diarrhea. 

                                 CLAIRE
                             (confused)
                        Thanks. I’ll remember that.

                                 JOE
                        Enjoy your vacation. 

           Mad at himself, he walks away.  

                                 JOE
                        Come on, Felipe. Let’s go.

                                 FELIPE
                        You should have asked her out.

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, I know. Thanks.

           INT. JOE’S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Dressed as a hotel worker, Agent Jackson plants a bug in the 
           lamp shade. He wears a hearing device in his ear. 

                                 AGENT ZUCKER (O.S.)
                        Abort! Abort! He’s on his way back 
                        to the room now.
           Joe opens the door, sees Agent Jackson. Agent Jackson draws 
           his weapon, aims it Joe.

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        CIA! Let me see your hands! 

           Joe puts his hands above his head. 

                                 JOE
                        I come in peace. I’m here on 
                        vacation. 

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        That’s why you were meeting with El 
                        Toro, right?

                                 JOE
                        I can explain.

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        And I bet you can explain what a 
                        crate full of weapons is doing in 
                        your room too, huh?

                                 JOE
                        Okay, that’s a little harder to 
                        explain. Look, I’m not the person 
                        you think I am.

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        For your sake, you better hope we 
                        take you in before Jesus Sanchez 
                        kills you.

                                 JOE
                             (alarmed)
                        Who wants to kill me?!

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        Don’t act stupid. Jesus Sanchez. 

                                 JOE
                        Who is Jesus Sanchez?

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        The man who wants you dead. 

                                 JOE
                        Right. Got that part. Why? 
                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        Have you killed so many people you 
                        don’t even keep track? He thinks 
                        you killed his brother. 

                                 JOE
                        He thinks I did what?!

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        Or at least is here to kill him. 
                        He’s not sure. But either way, he 
                        wants you dead. 

                                 JOE
                        What? No. I’m here to kill... 
                        nothing. Maybe you should take me 
                        in now then, huh?

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        You would like that, wouldn’t you? 
                        We try you with only circumstantial 
                        evidence, you get found not guilty 
                        and you walk. No double jeopardy. 
                        You would be free as a bird. No 
                        chance, amigo. 

           Agent Jackson walks to the door, doesn’t take his eyes off 
           Joe. 

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        I am watching you - like a really 
                        big hawk. 

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY

           Agent Jackson leaves, walks past Felipe seated in the hall. 
           Because Agent Jackson is disguised as a hotel worker, Felipe 
           doesn’t think anything of it.

           INT. JOE’S HOTEL ROOM

           Joe sits on his bed, buries his face in his hands. 

           Joe picks up his cell, dials a number. He paces. 

                                 JOE
                        Walt. It’s Joe. We need to talk! 
                        Call me as soon as you get this! 

           Joe storms out of the room, SLAMS THE DOOR.  
           INT. HALLWAY 

           Felipe follows Joe down to the elevator. 

           INT. HOTEL BAR -- NIGHT

           Only a handful of drunks remain. Joe bellies up, motions to 
           the BARTENDER. Felipe sits at a table.  

                                 JOE
                        I need something - hard. I don’t 
                        even care what it is. 

           Kenny works the check-in desk nearby, spots Joe. Joe chugs 
           his shot, SPITS IT OUT.  

                                 JOE
                             (mouth numb)
                        That ith the worsth thing I’ve ever 
                        tasthed in my life!

           Kenny meanders over slowly. 

                                 JOE
                        Give me another. 

           The Bartender gives him a refill. Joe does his best to get it 
           down. It hurts. 

                                 KENNY
                        You alright?

                                 JOE
                             (mouth still numb) 
                        I’m awesthome! I’m so awesthome 
                        ith’s crazthy! I’m crazthy awesome! 

                                 KENNY
                        You don’t seem like it, man.

           Joe sips some water, his mouth returns to normal. 

                                 JOE
                        Just another day in the life of an 
                        international assassin.

                                 KENNY
                        You are such a gangster!

           Joe downs another shot, visibly worried. 
                                 JOE
                             (quietly)
                        I think I’m going to get killed. 

                                 KENNY
                        Isn’t that one of the risks of the 
                        job? An occupational hazard? 

           Joe makes sure he’s out of Felipe’s earshot. 

                                 JOE
                        I’m not an assassin. I’m an 
                        accountant for God’s sake who wrote 
                        a dumb book. 

                                 KENNY
                        So... none of that stuff you wrote 
                        is real?

                                 JOE
                        I made it all up. 

                                 KENNY
                        Everything?

                                 JOE
                        Everything.

                                 KENNY
                        Even what happened in Hong Kong?

           Joe nods. 

                                 KENNY
                        It felt so real. Man, you’re a good 
                        writer. 

                                 JOE
                        I’m so good some guy named Jesus 
                        Sanchez wants to kill me - the CIA 
                        is after me and I’ve been hired to 
                        knock off the Prime Minister by 
                        this other guy named El Toro. So 
                        much for a freaking vacation!!!

                                 KENNY
                             (to the Bartender)
                        You better keep ‘em coming. 

                                 JOE
                        What do I do?
                                 KENNY
                        I don’t know. Later. Good luck.

           Kenny starts to walk away.

                                 JOE
                        Where are you going?

                                 KENNY
                        I’m staying far away from you. 
                        Those are some bad dudes. 

                                 JOE
                        Kenny, come on. Help me. 

           Kenny thinks for a second.

                                 KENNY
                        Why don’t you tell people the book 
                        isn’t true?

                                 JOE
                        I’ve tried! No one believes me!

           The Bartender sets another shot down. Kenny drinks it.

                                 KENNY
                        Alright, this might be some 
                        terrible ass advice, but I’ll throw 
                        it out there. 
                             (beat)
                        Since there is a very strong 
                        possibility your time on earth is 
                        about over, maybe you should live 
                        the time you have left like Colt 
                        Rodgers.

                                 JOE
                        That hasn’t worked out so well for 
                        me.

                                 KENNY
                        I don’t mean pretend to be an 
                        assassin. I mean, be the guy who 
                        isn’t scared of shit - lives every 
                        moment like it’s his last. I guess 
                        what I’m trying to say is - if you 
                        die, would you be happy with your 
                        life?
                                 JOE
                        No. My life has sucked and it’s 
                        gotten a whole lot worse since I’ve 
                        come to this stupid country.

                                 KENNY
                        Then be Colt Rodgers. 

           Joe gives it consideration.  

                                 JOE
                        I guess I can try.

                                 KENNY
                        Not... 
                             (mocks Joe)
                        “I guess I can try.” 
                             (firmly)
                        I am Colt Rodgers. Let me hear you 
                        say it. 

                                 JOE
                             (weak)
                        I am... Colt Rodgers.

                                 KENNY
                        Colt mother fucking Rodgers.

                                 JOE
                        I am... Colt mother fucking 
                        Rodgers. 

                                 KENNY
                        You’re a mother fucker.

                                 JOE
                        I fuck mothers. 

                                 KENNY
                        Good enough for now. 

           EXT. RESORT RESTAURANT -- DAY

           Claire sips coffee, reads the paper. Joe takes a deep breath. 
           He marches over, determined.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Morning.

                                 JOE
                             (confidently)
                        I’m taking you to lunch today.
           She smiles sweetly. 

                                 JOE
                        ...If you want.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’d love to.

           That was easier than he thought. 

                                 JOE
                        Then, I’ll see you later. 

           Joe leaves, grins from ear to ear. Felipe follows him out. 

           EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT -- DAY

           Joe leans against a compact piece of crap that rents for $19 
           a day. Claire exits the hotel lobby, waves to Joe.

                                 JOE
                        Your chariot awaits you, my lady.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Nice... car.

                                 JOE
                        I think it has air bags. 

           Claire smiles, climbs in. 

           -- Joe backs the car out, heads for the exit. 

           -- Felipe backs his car up, follows right behind Joe. 

           -- Down another row of cars, Diego drives behind Felipe.

           -- In a van, CIA Agents Jackson and Zucker fall into 
           position. 

           EXT. HIGHWAY 

           The four vehicles turn onto the two lane highway. They look 
           like a caravan. 

           INT. JOE’S RENT-A-CAR

           Joe sees Felipe in his rear view mirror. Joe PUNCHES the gas. 
           THE ENGINE ROARS. 
                                 CLAIRE
                        In a hurry?

                                 JOE
                        Just want to see what this baby can 
                        do. 

           THE ENGINE MAKES A HORRIBLE HUMMING SOUND like it’s about 
           ready to explode.  

                                 JOE
                        Eighty two. 

           Joe eases up on the gas. He looks back, watches Felipe close 
           the distance. 

           EXT. DOWNTOWN BELIZE CITY -- DAY

           The sidewalks are awash with tourists and locals.

           Joe drives his car down a one-way street. He sees the only 
           parking place in the area, takes it. 

           Felipe, Diego and the Agents pass by, but they have no where 
           to park. All three circle the block, fast. They are helpless 
           as Joe and Claire enter a restaurant. 

           As Felipe rounds the corner, a Mini-Cooper pulls out of a 
           VERY TIGHT PARKING SPOT.

           Felipe overshoots it, tries to back in, but Diego is right 
           behind him. Frustrated, Felipe circles the block. 

           Diego scoots forward to parallel park, but the Agents rush up 
           preventing him from doing so. Diego motions for them to back 
           up, but they refuse. Diego grits his teeth, circles the 
           block. 

           The Agents pull forward to parallel. As Agent Jackson puts it 
           in reverse, Felipe REVS HIS ENGINE directly behind their 
           bumper stymieing them from backing into the spot. Agent 
           Jackson drives away. 

           This repeats several times before Felipe finally double parks 
           the car in the street and gets out. If he’s not getting the 
           spot, no one is. 

           INT. DIEGO’S CAR

           Diego watches Felipe run inside the restaurant.
                                 DIEGO
                        Screw it.

           Diego hops out. 

           INT. CIA AGENTS’ RENT-A-CAR

           Agent Jackson looks confused.

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        What the heck are these guys doing?

                                 AGENT ZUCKER
                        Maybe it’s okay to park like that 
                        in this country. 

           Agents Jackson and Zucker shrug and follow suit.

           INT. BELIZE CITY RESTAURANT -- DAY

           The men keeping an eye on Joe are spread out around the 
           restaurant trying to keep a low profile. 

           The SERVER brings a couple of dishes over, sets the plates in 
           front of Joe and Claire.

           Joe and Claire try their food. 

                                 JOE
                        Delicious.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Mine too. This is great. Good call 
                        letting the waiter choose for us.

                                 JOE
                        I’ve reached a point in my life 
                        where it’s time to try new things. 
                        Take chances. 

           The Server returns.

                                 SERVER
                        And how is the iguana and sea 
                        turtle?

           Joe and Claire spit their food out.  
           EXT. DOWNTOWN BELIZE CITY -- DAY

           Joe and Claire exit the restaurant, no doggy bags, and get in 
           their car. 

           The men trailing them emerge and find ALL OF THEIR CARS HAVE 
           BEEN TOWED. 

           They watch Joe’s car turn down a street out of sight. 

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY -- NIGHT

           Joe and Claire stand in front of her room. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Thanks for today.

                                 JOE
                        I’ll see you in the morning.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hey, Joe. Do you think the sea 
                        turtle I ate for lunch had a name? 

                                 JOE
                             (nods)
                        Probably had a family who loved him 
                        too.

                                 CLAIRE
                        That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever 
                        heard! 

           They both laugh. 

           Claire gives him a very quick kiss on the cheek, ducks into 
           her room. Joe touches his face, shocked. 

           Joe heads down the hall tickled pink. 

           INT. CLAIRE’S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Claire sits in front of her laptop, chats with Simon through 
           ICHAT.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m getting closer. I’m trying to 
                        get him to trust me first so he’ll 
                        open up.
           Simon’s mug is on the screen.

                                 SIMON
                        Stay at it. Let me know when you 
                        have more.

                                 CLAIRE
                        He’s a lot different than he was in 
                        high school. He’s fun. 

                                 SIMON
                        I really don’t give a shit. 

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY-- DAY

           Joe closes his door, spots Felipe camped out. 

                                 JOE
                        Morning, Felipe. 

           Felipe nods, follows Joe to the elevator. 

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- DAY

           The men walk past the bar. 

                                 JOE
                        Felipe, take the day off.

                                 FELIPE
                        No.

                                 JOE
                        Yes.

                                 FELIPE
                        No.

                                 JOE
                        Please?

                                 FELIPE
                        No.

                                 JOE
                        Come on, I’m not going anywhere. I 
                        want to spend some time with Claire 
                        without you up my ass. 

           Felipe takes a moment to consider it.
                                 FELIPE
                        You can’t tell the boss or he’ll 
                        kill me. Then he’ll kill you. 

                                 JOE
                        It will be our little secret. 

                                 FELIPE
                        Okay. 

           Joe digs in his pocket, hands Felipe a C-note.

                                 JOE
                        Buy yourself some drinks. 

           EXT. BEACH -- DAY

           On the dock, Joe and Claire get ready to snorkel. Joe gazes 
           over his shoulders, cautiously checks his surroundings as he 
           straps his fins on. He places his mask over his face, looks 
           like a complete idiot. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        That’s a good look for you.

           Claire smirks, jumps in the water with her gear on. 

           From the cliffs above, over a mile away, Diego stares through 
           the scope of a silenced rifle.

           He has Joe perfectly in his sights. Diego’s finger straddles 
           the trigger. 

           Joe dives into the water. The bullet misses. 

           Joe and Claire take in all the fish below them. 

           Diego lines up the scope again. He has the back of Joe’s head 
           zeroed in. 

           CLICK.

           Joe dives beneath the surface. The bullet misses.

           A large sail boat comes into view, completely blocks Diego’s 
           sight line. Diego looks angry. 

           LATER -- 

           Claire drives a jet ski with Joe behind her. She drives like 
           a maniac, Joe hangs on for dear life. 
           In a small boat nearby, Diego tracks Joe in his rifle’s 
           viewfinder again. 

           CLICK.

           Claire makes a crazy turn, JOE FLIES OFF THE JET SKI AND 
           BELLY FLOPS INTO THE WATER. The shot misses. 

                                 CLAIRE
                             (innocently)
                        My bad.

                                 JOE
                        You think you’re so cute, don’t ya?

           LATER -- 

           Joe and Claire lay out on the beach. Claire’s eyes are 
           closed. Joe struggles to relax, keeps a lookout. 

           From up in a palm tree a few hundred yards away, Diego has an 
           ecstatic grin on his face. He can’t miss now. 

           Diego gets Joe in his cross-hairs, but right as he is about 
           to pull the trigger, a FAT WOMAN next to Joe holds up her 
           tanning reflector. The sun light bounces off the reflector, 
           blinds Diego. He doesn’t have a shot. 

           By the time the Fat Woman moves the reflector and Diego can 
           see again, Joe and Claire are gone. Diego punches a tree.

           INT. HOTEL -- DAY

           Returning from their day, Joe and Claire walk past Kenny.

                                 KENNY
                        Joe, can I have a quick word? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I should freshen up before dinner. 

           Claire waves flirtatiously, takes off. 

                                 JOE
                        Do you realize how big of a crush I 
                        had on her when I was in high 
                        school? I mean, she was a goddess 
                        and I was in band. Not easy 
                        convincing girls you’re cool 
                        holding a tuba. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOE (cont'd)
                        Kenny, I don’t care if I die now - 
                        I had the greatest day of my life. 

                                 KENNY
                        Well, that might happen sooner than 
                        you think.

           Joe’s excitement fades quickly. 

                                 KENNY
                        I got word from a few of the guests 
                        they saw a guy running around with 
                        a gun earlier. 

                                 JOE
                        You think he was after me?

                                 KENNY
                        You seem like the most popular 
                        choice.

                                 JOE
                        Did they say what he looked like?

                                 KENNY
                        He had tattoos.  

           Concern sets in.

                                 JOE
                        I don’t want to die yet! We had so 
                        much fun today!

                                 KENNY
                        Then I suggest you keep your eyes 
                        open for anyone who looks 
                        suspicious, okay? And if they do, 
                        fuck ‘em up! You’re Colt Rodgers 
                        God damn it and don’t forget it! 

           A renewed sense of confidence.

                                 JOE
                        Alright. I’m Colt Rodgers.

                                 KENNY
                        Who?

                                 JOE
                        Colt mother fucking Rodgers!
                                 KENNY
                        That’s more like it. And you might 
                        want to check on your buddy over 
                        there.

           Felipe sings karaoke to Jimmy Buffet’s, “Margaritaville.” He 
           is trashed. So drunk he can barely stand. The singing is not 
           good. 

                                 FELIPE
                             (brings the chorus home)
                        Wastin’ away again in 
                        margaritaville / Searching for my 
                        lost shaker of salt / Some people 
                        claim that there’s a woman to blame 
                        / But I know, it’s nobody’s fault-- 

           Joe shakes his head, pulls Felipe off the stage. 

                                 JOE
                        Come on, Felipe. 

                                 FELIPE
                        I was sober for ten years before 
                        today. Joe, I need to score some 
                        blow. 

           INT. JOE’S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Felipe sleeps on Joe’s bed, SNORES LOUDLY, clearly having 
           failed to score any blow. Joe shuts the door, leaves for the 
           evening. 

           INT. HOTEL BAR -- NIGHT

           Joe waits for Claire at the bar. He sizes up everyone in the 
           room. 

           -- A SKINNY WIMP sips wine. No tattoos. Can’t be him.

           -- An enormous BODY BUILDER - no tattoos. Thank God. 

           -- A FAT DUDE eats peanuts, drinks a beer. No tattoos. 

           The Bartender sets a cocktail in front of Joe.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Compliments of the guy over there. 

           Joe peeks at a BAR PATRON, 40, grinning at him. Joe didn’t 
           see him in his earlier survey of the room. 
                                 JOE
                        Did he say why he bought me a 
                        drink?

           The Bartender shrugs his shoulders. 

           The Bar Patron stares at Joe. CLOSE ON a dolphin tattoo on 
           the guy’s bicep. 

           The Patron is big - at least 6’5”. Strong. Looks tough. Below 
           the table, something in his hand is obscured by a napkin. Oh 
           shit.

           Joe inspects the drink, appears worried. 

                                 JOE
                        Did you make this? 

           The Bartender nods.

                                 JOE
                        So the only person who has touched 
                        this glass was you?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Something wrong with it? 

                                 JOE
                        I’m not drinking it. 
                             (suspiciously)
                        You’re not going to poison me.

           Joe looks back over to the Bar Patron, but he’s gone.

           Joe scans the room, can’t see him. Beads of sweat form on 
           Joe’s head. 

           From behind him, Joe feels a tap on his shoulder.

                                 BAR PATRON
                        Hello, Colt Rodgers.

           Joe swipes a beer bottle from the bar, SMASHES IT OVER THE 
           GUY’S HEAD. 

           WOMEN SCREAM. 

           The guy falls to the ground, instantly struggles back up to 
           his feet. This is a big son of a bitch. 

           Joe KICKS HIS FACE. 

           The dude is woozy, but still has some fight in him. 
           Joe searches for another object, doesn’t see anything of much 
           use. Fuck it, THROWS THE SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS AT HIM. 

           Does nothing, just bounces off the guy’s forehead. 

           The guy works his way up. JOE BREAKS HIS BAMBOO BAR STOOL 
           OVER THE GUY’S BACK.  

           That does the trick. He’s asleep now. 

           But just to make sure, Joe does a WWE FLYING ELBOW to the 
           guy’s face. The guy probably didn’t feel it since he is 
           unconscious. 

           Kenny runs over, pulls Joe off of him.

           Joe breaks free, GIVES HIM A FINAL KICK TO THE BALLS to 
           finish him off. Everyone winces. It definitely wasn’t 
           necessary. 

           Diego witnesses the whole thing go down. He slips out, 
           stunned that Joe could take down such a ginormous dude with 
           such brutality. 

                                 KENNY
                        What are you doing?!

                                 JOE
                        He was going to kill me. He has a 
                        tattoo. 

                                 KENNY
                        So do I! A yin and yang symbol. 
                        He’s here with his wife and kids. 
                        He recognized you earlier, asked me 
                        if he thought it was okay if he 
                        bought you a drink. 

           The man MOANS IN PAIN.  

                                 JOE
                        He doesn’t want to kill me?

                                 KENNY
                        He might want to now.

           Joe sees his book lying next to the guy. The guy tries to get 
           to his feet, but falls down.

                                 JOE
                        You have no idea how sorry I am. 
                        Are you okay?
                                 BAR PATRON
                        I only wanted an autograph!

                                 JOE
                        Someone give me a pen!!!

           Kenny removes one from his shirt pocket, hands it to Joe. 

           Claire meanders in, sees the commotion. Joe signs the book, 
           waves to Claire.

                                 JOE
                        Are we good?

                                 BAR PATRON
                        I got a headache. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        What’s going on?

                                 JOE
                             (to Claire)
                        I think he had a little too much to 
                        drink. 
                             (to Claire)
                        Ready? 

           Joe pushes Claire towards the exit, fast.  

                                 BAR PATRON
                        It was an honor to have you kick my 
                        ass, sir.

                                 JOE
                        Okay, you’re welcome. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        What’s he talking about? 

                                 JOE
                        I have no idea.

           INT. BEACH RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

           Joe and Claire dine at a romantic eatery. He nervously looks 
           around the room for anyone suspicious, not really listening 
           to Claire. 

           Claire SNAPS her fingers. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Joe? 
                                 JOE
                        What were you saying?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Are you expecting someone?

                                 JOE
                        What? Why do you ask? Do you see 
                        someone who looks like they know 
                        me?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Are you alright?

           Joe puts his napkin on the table, takes a deep breath. 

                                 JOE
                        No, I’m not. I need to tell you the 
                        truth. Can I confide in you?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Of course.

                                 JOE
                        This is something you can’t tell 
                        anyone. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        You can trust me.

                                 JOE
                        I’m not an accountant anymore. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        What do you do?

           Joe leans in really close. 

                                 JOE
                        I’m a... writer. 

           Across the room, Agent Zucker poses as a waiter. He positions 
           a mini camera, the size of a shirt button, to monitor Joe and 
           Claire. He has a listening device in his ear. 

           INT. CIA VAN -- NIGHT

           Agent Jackson sits with a couple of other Agents and views 
           the feed Agent Zucker provides him on a little TV.
                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        Get closer. We can’t hear what they 
                        are saying. 

           INT. BEACH RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

           Agent Zucker meanders over, clears some plates. He lingers, 
           making Claire and Joe uncomfortable. They stop talking and 
           wait for him to leave. 

           Agent Zucker retreats casually.

                                 CLAIRE
                        My life is so boring compared to 
                        yours. When I signed up for my job, 
                        I thought it was going to be 
                        exciting, you know. Full of 
                        adventure. 

                                 JOE
                        Why would you think insurance was 
                        so exciting?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Uh, I don’t know. Forget it.

                                 JOE
                        Claire, your life might be in 
                        jeopardy sitting with me. I don’t 
                        want anything to happen to you.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m in danger?

           For some unknown reason Claire seems to be getting turned on. 
           They lock eyes. She bites her lip. 

                                 JOE
                        You could be. There’s a chance 
                        someone in this room is here to 
                        kill me. God forbid he misses and 
                        shoots you in the face. I wouldn’t 
                        be able to live with myself. Maybe 
                        we should... go.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Or maybe...

           Joe seizes the moment, kisses her - hard.  
                                 JOE
                        I’ve thought about doing that ever 
                        since sophomore year.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You probably shouldn’t have waited 
                        all these years to make a move.

           Claire kisses him.

           INT. CIA VAN -- NIGHT

           Agent Jackson watches them kiss.

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        I want to find out who this chick 
                        is. 

           EXT. BEACH -- NIGHT

           CLOSE ON Joe and Claire as they break from smooching. They 
           are now outside. The waves crash against the shore in front 
           of them. 

                                 JOE
                        I don’t think I could write 
                        something as perfect as this.

           She smiles, turns and kisses him again.

                                 JOE
                        Then again, my book was filled with 
                        mostly guys getting their necks 
                        broken.

           INT. CLAIRE’S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Claire uses her MacBook to talk on ICHAT again with Simon. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I was right. The book is a lie.

                                 SIMON
                        Great job, Claire! I’ll never doubt 
                        you again. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I can’t write it. His publisher 
                        will deny it and sue him. 
                                 SIMON
                        That’s not our problem.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I promised I wouldn’t tell anyone.

                                 SIMON
                        Promised? You’re not in junior high 
                        anymore!

                                 CLAIRE
                        It was high school. 

                                 SIMON
                        You think Woodward & Bernstein 
                        "promised" Deep Throat they 
                        wouldn't tell anyone what they 
                        talked about?!

                                 CLAIRE
                        You don’t understand. 
                             (beat)
                        He’s a good guy...

                                 SIMON
                        What? Do you like him or something?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don’t know. 

                                 SIMON
                        You wanted this assignment, you got 
                        it. If you do not write the 
                        article, you’ll be lucky to find 
                        work as a fluffer. And yes, I mean 
                        that kind. 

           INT. JOE’S HOTEL ROOM -- DAY

           Joe lays in bed next to Felipe, starts to wake up. Joe rubs 
           his eyes, sees El Toro and five of his henchmen blocking the 
           door.

                                 EL TORO
                        Good morning. 

           Joe rises, startled. 

                                 JOE
                        You scared me. 

           Joe squints at Felipe, still asleep. 
                                 JOE
                        Nothing happened between us. 

           El Toro turns the TV on. The PRIME MINISTER, 45, salt and 
           pepper hair with a thick mustache, speaks to a few hundred 
           Belizeans. 

                                 EL TORO
                        Can you tell me what’s wrong with 
                        this picture?

                                 JOE
                             (confused)
                        Well... it’s not HD.

           El Toro tries a different approach.

                                 EL TORO
                        How about you tell me why the Prime 
                        Minister is on TV? 

                                 JOE
                        To give a speech?

                                 EL TORO
                        Why is he still alive?!!!

                                 JOE
                        I haven’t killed him yet.

                                 EL TORO
                        I know that! What are you waiting 
                        for?

                                 JOE
                        I’m still trying to figure out how 
                        I’m going to do it.

                                 EL TORO
                        If you get cold feet and decide not 
                        to go through with our arrangement, 
                        I’ll be forced to... ask for my 
                        money back. I might also pay your 
                        mother in New Jersey a little 
                        visit. 

           A new side of Joe emerges, looks irate. He stands up, gets in 
           El Toro’s grill. El Toro seems unsure what he should do.

                                 JOE
                        Have you forgot who you are talking 
                        to? I will kill the Prime Minister 
                        when I’m good and ready. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOE (cont'd)
                        But, if you don’t get off my back 
                        I’m going to get pissed. And trust 
                        me, I’m the last person in the 
                        world you want pissed off! 

           El Toro’s men have never seen anyone show such blatant 
           disrespect before, it makes El Toro uneasy. 

                                 EL TORO
                        Why are you getting so upset? We’re 
                        just having a conversation. 

                                 JOE
                        I retired, okay? I’ve killed enough 
                        people. We all know how much blood 
                        is on my hands. I came on vacation 
                        to relax and now you have me 
                        working. Do you have any idea how 
                        long it’s been since I’ve taken a 
                        real vacation?! Had a little time 
                        off for myself?! Do you?!

           Off El Toro’s look.

                                 JOE
                        A long time! You people never 
                        understand. It’s just work, work, 
                        work, work, work with you. I told 
                        you I would kill him, didn’t I? 
                        Then he’ll be dead by the time I 
                        leave. Now, do me a favor and get 
                        out of my room before I change my 
                        mind!

                                 EL TORO
                        Okay, okay. We’re leaving. 

                                 JOE
                        And if you ever threaten my mother 
                        again...

                                 EL TORO
                        Joe, please forgive me. 

           Joe takes a deep breath, collects himself. 

                                 JOE
                        I’ll think about it. 

           They all start for the door. El Toro turns back.
                                 EL TORO
                        See the Great Blue Hole while 
                        you’re here. It’s quite 
                        magnificent.  

           El Toro pushes his men out of the room. 

           Felipe wakes up, realizes he slept in Joe’s bed.

                                 FELIPE
                        Did something happen between us 
                        last night?

           INT. CIA VAN -- DAY

           Agent Jackson and his men take their headphones off. 

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        And that’s why he’s here - to kill 
                        the Prime Minister of Belize. 

                                 AGENT ZUCKER 
                        Our intelligence says the Prime 
                        Minister is corrupt. He’s on the 
                        take with Jesus Sanchez. 

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        Who do we have in line to replace 
                        the Prime Minister should something 
                        happen to him?

                                 AGENT ZUCKER
                        There’s an ex pat living in Cabo, 
                        very pro U.S. - he’d make a great 
                        choice. We could bring him back. 

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        Can he win at the ballot box with a 
                        re-election?

                                 AGENT ZUCKER
                        We can make sure he does. This is 
                        just Belize after all.

           Agent Jackson flashes a devilish grin. 

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        Then let Colt Rodgers do his thing. 
                        And afterwards, we nail the 
                        bastard. 
           INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- DAY

           Kenny mans the front desk. Joe steps off the elevator, makes 
           a beeline to him.  

                                 JOE
                        This is going to be a stupid 
                        question, but I figure it doesn’t 
                        hurt to at least ask. 
                             (beat)
                        Do you have any idea how I might be 
                        able to get a meeting with the 
                        Prime Minister of Belize? 

                                 KENNY
                        For what?

                                 JOE
                        I need to warn him what El Toro is 
                        up to. 

                                 KENNY
                        I could probably set it up. He’s a 
                        friend of a friend. 

                                 JOE
                        Seriously?

                                 KENNY
                        Dude, less than 300,000 people live 
                        here. Everyone knows everyone - 
                        which really sucks sometimes. 

                                 JOE
                        You are hands down my favorite 
                        Belizean! 

           Kenny picks up the phone, dials a number.

                                 KENNY
                        Hey, it’s Kenny. I have a guest who 
                        would like to meet the Prime 
                        Minister. Can you make it happen? 

           Kenny puts his hand over the phone.

                                 KENNY
                             (to Joe)
                        He’s pretty busy. How about in an 
                        hour?
                                 JOE
                        Yeah, sure. 

                                 KENNY
                             (on the phone)
                        He’ll be there. Thanks.

           Kenny hangs up.

                                 KENNY
                        You’re going to have to hustle - it 
                        takes 45 minutes to get there.

                                 JOE
                        What if there’s traffic?

                                 KENNY
                             (laughs)
                        Traffic? We don’t have traffic. 

           Joe’s CELL PHONE RINGS. 

                                 JOE
                        Walt, thanks for finally calling me 
                        back!

           EXT. GOLF COURSE -- DAY

           Walt drives in his golf cart with his cell phone pressed 
           against his head.

                                 WALT
                        Look, only have a second. 

           INTERCUT JOE AND WALT.

                                 WALT
                        A reporter wants to do a piece on 
                        you for when you get back.

                                 JOE
                        I told you, I’m not doing any more 
                        interviews.

           Walt stops his cart, grabs a club out of his bag.

                                 WALT
                        That’s what I told her, but she 
                        said she might be able to convince 
                        you since you two went to high 
                        school together. 
           Joe stops dead in his tracks, aghast. 

           EXT. BEACH -- DAY

           Claire sunbathes, Joe hotfoots it over to her. Felipe tries 
           to keep up. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hey, good morning. 

                                 JOE
                        Why? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why what?

                                 JOE
                        I know, Claire. 

           She looks away, doesn’t want to have this conversation. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I was doing my job.

                                 JOE
                        Hang on a second. 

           Joe grabs a wad of cash, gives it to Felipe.

                                 JOE
                        Go get a Piña Colada. 

           Felipe gets excited, leaves quickly.

                                 JOE
                        What was the plan? Pretend you like 
                        me so I would tell you I wasn’t an 
                        assassin. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Uh, yeah, actually. But it’s not 
                        like that.

                                 JOE
                        I’m just a story to you. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Don’t act like you’re completely 
                        innocent. You lied to me too!

                                 JOE
                        But then I told you the truth! 
                                 CLAIRE
                        The truth was going to come out 
                        eventually. It always does.

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, maybe. But what makes it 
                        worse is that it’s you who is doing 
                        it. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I told my editor I didn’t want to 
                        write the article. 

                                 JOE
                             (hopeful)
                        Oh...

                                 CLAIRE
                        But, he said he’d fire me if I 
                        didn’t. 

                                 JOE
                        Well, congratulations. Your plan 
                        worked exactly the way you wanted.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You have a couple of days to get in 
                        front of the story.

                                 JOE
                        What is that going to do? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Maybe save your life! 

                                 JOE
                        Save my life?! 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Jesus Sanchez will know you didn’t 
                        kill his brother and you’re not 
                        here to assassinate him. 

                                 JOE
                        That doesn’t get El Toro off my 
                        back! I’m dead no matter what. Oh, 
                        and if I do somehow happen to live - 
                        I’ll be an international laughing 
                        stock!

                                 CLAIRE
                        Joe, I didn’t mean for it to turn 
                        out like this. 
           Joe leaves hastily. 

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY 

           Joe heads outside, passes by Felipe boozing it up. 

           INT. JOE’S RENT-A-CAR -- DAY

           Joe speeds down the highway.

           EXT. PRIME MINISTER’S ESTATE -- DAY

           The Prime Minister’s palatial home overlooks Belize City. 
           BELIZE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS patrol the grounds with DOGS. 

           INT. PRIME MINISTER’S FOYER 

           Impatiently, Joe flips through a tourism magazine. The 
           SECRETARY presses the intercom button. 

                                 SECRETARY
                        I’ll send him in. 
                             (to Joe)
                        The Prime Minister will see you 
                        now.

           The Secretary opens the door for Joe, leads him inside. 

           INT. PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE 

           The Prime Minister leans against his grand desk with the 
           Belize flag behind it.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Prime Minister, this is Joe 
                        Schmidt. 

           Joe shakes hands with him. His moustache is even more awesome 
           in person. It’s so thick and bushy. 

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        Joe, it’s wonderful to meet you. 

                                 JOE
                        You as well, sir.

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        How has your vacation been?
                                 JOE
                        It beats Toledo. 

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        Is this a beautiful country or 
                        what?

                                 JOE
                        I haven’t seen as much as I’d like.

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        Have you seen the Great Blue Hole 
                        yet?

                                 JOE
                        It’s on my list. 

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        It’s quite magnificent. 

                                 JOE
                        That’s what everyone tells me.

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        I hope you’ll tell all your friends 
                        about us down here, we could use 
                        the tourism. 
                             (beat)
                        So, what is it you would like to 
                        talk to me about?

                                 JOE
                        Sir, this isn’t easy for me to 
                        say...

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        Even though I’m the Prime Minister 
                        of a country, I love saying that, 
                        feel free to speak freely.

           Joe gets down to business, stares soberly. 

                                 JOE
                        Do you know who El Toro is?

                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        Of course.

                                 JOE
                        He has paid me an excessive amount 
                        of money... to kill you. 

           The Prime Minister gets nervous, looks alarmed. 
                                 PRIME MINISTER
                        You’ve been hired to kill me?

           He struggles to breathe. 

                                 JOE
                        Yes. And when I say an excessive 
                        amount of money - I am not lying. 
                        He really wants you dead. 

           The panic attack intensifies. He turns red. 

           THE PRIME MINISTER FALLS TO THE GROUND. 

                                 JOE
                        Uh, sir? Are you okay?

           Joe leans down to the floor, checks on him. The Prime 
           Minister is not doing well.

           Joe tries to give mouth to mouth, it doesn’t look like he 
           knows how to do it correctly. 

           Joe BANGS FURIOUSLY ON THE PRIME MINISTER’S CHEST.

                                 JOE
                        Come on! Please! 

           Joe tries more mouth to mouth. 

           He checks for a pulse, there isn’t one. It scares the crap 
           out of Joe. The Prime Minister stares wide eyed at the 
           ceiling. 

           THE PRIME MINISTER IS DEAD.

                                 JOE
                        Oh God, I’ve killed him! 

           Joe takes a glimpse out the window, security all over the 
           place. 

                                 JOE
                        Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. I’m so 
                        screwed! 

           Joe thinks, doesn’t have an idea what to do. 

           Impulsively, Joe drags the body over to the desk. 

           Joe struggles to pull him into the chair. He props the Prime 
           Minister up.
           INT. PRIME MINISTER’S FOYER  

           Joe shuts the door behind him in such a way that prevents the 
           Secretary from seeing the body. 

                                 JOE
                        He said he was very tired and wants 
                        to be left alone. If anyone 
                        disturbs him, he said they’re 
                        fired. 

           The Secretary continues about her work. Joe zips down the 
           hall.

           I/E. JOE’S RENT-A-CAR -- DAY

           Joe turns the ignition. It won’t start. 

                                 JOE
                        Damn it!

           He turns it over again, zilch. 

           A couple of the Secret Service Men point at Joe. 

                                 JOE
                        Come on! Come on! 

           The ENGINE STARTS, he takes off. 

           Joe pulls up to the gate, waves to the GATE GUARD. 

           In Joe’s rear view mirror, he sees an extremely fit SECRET 
           SERVICE AGENT sprinting towards him. 

           The gate raises slowly. 

           The Secret Service Agent radios something to the Gate Guard.

                                 GATE GUARD
                        I’m going to need you to wait a 
                        minute. 

                                 JOE
                        Is something the matter? I’m kind 
                        of in a hurry. 

                                 GATE GUARD
                        I said you’ll need to wait. 

           The Secret Service agent reaches Joe’s car.
                                 SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                        You dropped your hotel room key.

           Joe lets out a huge sigh of relief. 

           EXT. BEACH -- DAY

           Sun burned, Agent Jackson lays out in a terrible Speedo. 
           Agent Zucker approaches him.

                                 AGENT ZUCKER
                        Sir, we got word the Prime Minister 
                        is dead.

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        How?

                                 AGENT ZUCKER
                        We believe it was poison. 

           INT. EL TORO’S MANSION -- DAY

           El Toro watches TV as two of his men torture some POOR 
           BASTARD in the BG.

                                 EL TORO
                        He didn’t even fire a bullet.
                             (beat)
                        He’s good. Really good. 

           INT. CLAIRE’S HOTEL ROOM -- DAY

           Claire clicks, “Send” on an e-mail, looks guilt stricken. 

           She walks in the bathroom and STARTS THE SHOWER. She hears a 
           KNOCK at the door.

                                 DIEGO (O.S.)
                        Room service?

           Claire opens it. Diego, dressed as a resort employee, stands 
           in the hallway. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I didn’t order any room service.

           Diego produces a gun from under the tray. Claire tries to 
           slam the door shut, but Diego wedges his foot in the door. He 
           bursts into the room, grabs Claire by the hair. 
                                 DIEGO
                        Scream and I’ll shoot. 
                             (beat)
                        Let’s go. Nice and quiet. 

           Diego walks Claire out at gun point. 

           I/E. JOE’S RENT-A-CAR -- DAY

           Joe pulls up to the resort, Kenny races over to the window.

                                 KENNY
                        I set you up for a meeting with the 
                        Prime Minister and you kill him?! 
                        You’re taking this Colt Rodgers 
                        thing too far!

                                 JOE
                        I didn’t kill him! I swear. I mean, 
                        I sort of did, but not 
                        intentionally! 

                                 KENNY
                        It’s all over the news!

                                 JOE
                        When I told him about El Toro, he 
                        had a heart attack. I tried to 
                        revive him. I really regret not 
                        taking a CPR class right now, 
                        okay?!

           Kenny sees on Joe’s face that he isn’t lying. 

                                 KENNY
                        There’s police everywhere. You 
                        shouldn’t be here.

                                 JOE
                        I have nowhere to go.

           Kenny opens the passenger door, gets in. 

                                 KENNY
                        Drive. You can hide out at my 
                        place.

           Joe backs out, high tails it out of the lot. 

                                 KENNY
                        I tell you to be Colt Rodgers and 
                        you rent this?
                                 JOE
                        Yeah, but I declined the insurance. 

           I/E. KENNY’S BEACH HOUSE -- NIGHT

           It’s a shack, but right on the beach. 

           Joe paces the room, worried. Kenny scoops ice cream into a 
           bowl.

           Joe’s CELL PHONE RINGS. He answers it quickly.

                                 JOE
                        Hello.

           INT. JESUS SANCHEZ’S COMPOUND -- NIGHT

           Jesus holds a phone next to Claire’s ear, her hands and feet 
           are bound to the chair. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Joe, help me! Please!

           Jesus rips the phone out of her hand. 

           INTERCUT JOE WITH JESUS.

                                 JOE
                        Claire? Where are you? Are you 
                        okay?

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        If you want to see her alive - come 
                        to my compound at 8:00 Friday. I’ll 
                        trade her life for yours. 

                                 JOE
                        Wait, wait, wait! 
                             (beat)
                        Is that AM or PM?

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        PM! 

                                 JOE
                        Can I get the address? I’ll need to 
                        Mapquest it. 
                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        It’s the only compound in the 
                        entire country. It’s not hard to 
                        find. 

           DIAL TONE. Joe hangs up.

                                 KENNY
                        What is it?

                                 JOE
                        Jesus has Claire. 

                                 KENNY
                        You should come clean. Talk to the 
                        police.

                                 JOE
                        No way. They think I killed the 
                        Prime Minister. I have to do this 
                        on my own. 

                                 KENNY
                        What are you thinking of doing?

                                 JOE
                        Rescuing her. 

                                 KENNY
                        You can’t go at it alone. 
                             (heroically)
                        I’ll help you.

                                 JOE
                        I appreciate it Kenny, but I don’t 
                        want you to get mixed up in this. 
                        I’m the one he wants. This is 
                        between me and Jesus. 

                                 KENNY
                        I was just volunteering to help 
                        train you. 

           Joe looks disappointed.

                                 JOE
                        Oh. Yeah. Okay.

                                 KENNY
                        I’ve watched every assassin movie 
                        ever made. 
           Kenny runs into the other room, comes back with an extremely 
           little hand gun. It could fit in his palm. 

                                 JOE
                        What is that?

                                 KENNY
                        It’s my gun.

                                 JOE
                        It’s a bitch gun. No one will take 
                        me seriously with that. 

                                 KENNY
                        You’re going to need a weapon. 

                                 JOE
                        That’s not a weapon. 

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

           Armed Federales are stationed everywhere. 

           Dressed as hotel bellboys, Kenny and Joe wheel a cart towards 
           the elevator. Joe keeps his hat very low on his head. 

           INT. JOE’S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Joe removes the lid on the crate in the closet. 

           Inside are the rocket launchers, bazookas, grenades, pistols, 
           rifles, shotguns, Glocks, etc. 

           Kenny’s mouth drops. 

                                 JOE
                        These are weapons.

           Joe grabs the suitcases of cash and puts them in the crate. 

                                 KENNY
                        What’s in there?

                                 JOE
                        Don’t worry about it.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

           Joe and Kenny push the cart past the Federales. Joe avoids 
           eye contact. 
           Felipe sleeps soundly at a table; a slutty cougar, empty shot 
           glasses and beer bottles nearby. 

           EXT. SERVICE ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

           The guys exit the building. Joe’s rent-a-car is parked in the 
           loading zone. 

           Kenny and Joe take the crate off the cart and try to force it 
           in the back of the hatchback.  They can only get half of it 
           inside. 

                                 KENNY
                        I don’t think it’s going anywhere.

           Neither looks very confident. 

                                 JOE
                        It’s going to suck if a bunch of 
                        bazookas end up all over the road. 

           EXT. KENNY’S BEACH HOUSE -- DAY

           The crate remains in the car which is parked on the beach. 

           Joe and Kenny stand nearby with weapons in their hands. Joe 
           points a handgun at a beer can.  

                                 KENNY
                        Just aim and squeeze. 

           Joe closes one eye, steadies his hand. He takes a deep 
           breath. Licks his lips. He wants to nail this thing out of 
           the gates. He rubs the trigger with his finger. A final deep 
           breath. 

           CLICK. Nothing comes out.

                                 KENNY
                        Why don’t we start by taking the 
                        safety off. 

           Kenny undoes the latch. 

           Joe repeats the order of operation. Closes an eye. Deep 
           breath. Wets his lip. Massages the trigger. Breathes.

                                 KENNY
                        For the love of God! Pull the damn 
                        trigger!!!
           BAM!!!

           The can does not move. He missed. 

                                 KENNY
                        It’s okay, try again.

           BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!

           The can remains in place.

                                 JOE
                        It’s a lot tougher than it looks. 

           Kenny takes the gun away from him, reloads it. 

           BAM! 

           The can flies into the ocean, obliterated.

                                 JOE
                        Good shot. 

           Kenny hands him the gun back, chugs a beer. Sets the empty 
           can on the rock. 

                                 KENNY
                        Let’s try it again.

           BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!

           Kenny shakes his head. The can just sits there, taunts Joe.

                                 KENNY
                        Why don’t you move a little closer.

           BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!

           Not even close. 

           Kenny rolls his eyes, hands him a shotgun. 

                                 KENNY
                        This is going to have a kick, but 
                        let’s try this instead.

           Joe points the shotgun, fires. 

           BOOM! 

           The can does not die. 

           THE PALM TREE TO THE LEFT OF IT SPLITS - FALLS OVER. 
           LATER -- 

           Joe holds the rocket launcher over his shoulder.

                                 JOE
                        You think I’m going to need this?

                                 KENNY
                        No. Not at all. It just looks fun 
                        as shit. 

           Joe fires it. 

           WHOOSH!

           They wait for an explosion. Nothing.

                                 JOE
                        Maybe it was a dud. 

           KABOOM!!! 

           The hill becomes engulfed in flames. 

           LATER -- 

           Joe lays face down, Kenny straddles him.

                                 JOE
                        I’m not going to lie to you, this 
                        feels weird right now.

                                 KENNY
                        I’m teaching you some basic MMA. 
                        Try to get out of my hold.

           Kenny chokes Joe. Joe is a stuck pig. He GURGLES FOR AIR, 
           passes out. 

           LATER -- 

           Joe stands in the middle of the room blindfolded.

                                 KENNY
                        Attack me before I get you.

                                 JOE
                        But I can’t see you.
                                 KENNY
                        This is ninja assassin training. 
                        The objective is to heighten your 
                        sense of hearing. 

           Kenny tip toes towards Joe. Joe listens intently.

           KENNY PUNCHES JOE IN THE FACE. 

                                 KENNY
                        Alright, we’re going to have to 
                        work on that one.

           LATER -- 

           Joe drinks raw eggs, then vomits. 

           LATER -- 

           Joe swings nunchucks - strikes himself in the face. 

                                 JOE
                        AHH!!! Those hurt!

           LATER -- 

           Joe tries to climb up a rope, he makes it a few feet before 
           he lets go.

                                 JOE
                             (out of breath)
                        This assassin stuff is harder than 
                        it looks. 

           INT. KENNY’S BEACH HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Joe wears ice packs all over his body. He and Kenny inspect 
           satellite photos of Jesus’ compound. 

                                 JOE
                        Where did you get these?

                                 KENNY
                        Google. The compound has a fence 
                        running around the entire thing.

           Kenny circles the buildings he references. 
                                 KENNY
                        The main gate is here - it has a 
                        watchtower directly above it. Looks 
                        like there’s a warehouse of some 
                        kind right here and his house is 
                        here. She could be in either of 
                        those buildings.
                             (beat)
                        Honestly, Joe. I don’t think you 
                        should do this.

                                 JOE
                        I’m the reason she was kidnapped. I 
                        have to. 

                                 KENNY
                        You’re going to die trying to save 
                        her.

                                 JOE
                        Did you forget who you’re talking 
                        to? I’m Colt mother fucking 
                        Rodgers.

                                 KENNY
                        No, you’re Joe Schmidt. 

                                 JOE
                        Not anymore. 

           INT. CLAIRE’S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Agent Jackson and his men enter Claire’s room with the HOTEL 
           MANAGER.

                                 HOTEL MANAGER
                        The housekeeper said the shower was 
                        still running when she came in to 
                        turn the bed down. Seemed 
                        suspicious. 

           The Agents comb through Claire’s stuff. 

           Agent Zucker examines her computer. 

                                 AGENT ZUCKER
                        Sir, you might want to see this.

           Agent Jackson approaches and looks over Agent Zucker’s 
           shoulder.  They read a document on the computer monitor. 
                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        Schmidt is just a writer? 

           EXT. KENNY’S BEACH HOUSE -- DAY

           A five o’clock shadow, war paint and camouflage gear suggests 
           Joe has one objective - to kill bad dudes. 

           He closes the trunk of his rent-a-car. The entire back is 
           filled with weapons and ammo. 

           Kenny hands him the midget gun. 

                                 KENNY
                        Take it, for luck. 

                                 JOE
                        Thanks for everything.

                                 KENNY
                        Hey, Joe...
                             (beat)
                        ...don’t die.

           Joe gets in the car, pulls away.

           EXT. JUNGLE -- DAY

           Armed to the teeth, Joe crawls around the backside of the 
           compound. 

           Joe discovers a vulnerable section of fence, out of sight of 
           any GUARDS. He pulls out some wire cutters, creates a small 
           hole. 

           He quickly tries to squeeze through, but his AK47 on his back 
           causes him to get stuck. 

           Joe backs out, strips off the various weapons. He tries 
           again, this time successful. He makes it to the other side, 
           pulls the equipment through the hole. 

           He straps back up. It takes a second, he brought a shitload 
           of stuff. 

           EXT. JESUS SANCHEZ’S COMPOUND

           He rushes behind an old storage shed, canvasses the 
           watchtower with his binoculars. A lone gunman works the 
           lookout post.  
           A GERMAN SHEPHERD rounds the corner, GROWLS at Joe. Saliva 
           drips from its sharp teeth designed to tear skin off bones. 

                                 JOE
                        Easy... Easy...

           The dog LEAPS at Joe. Joe pushes the dog past him into the 
           fence. 

           JOE JUMPS ON THE DOG’S BACK, THROWS HIM IN THE CHOKE HOLD 
           KENNY TAUGHT HIM. 

           The dog struggles, but can’t escape. He gives up, sleeps. The 
           dog SNORES.

           Out of breath, Joe pushes himself off the dog right as a 
           GUARD rounds the corner.  The Guard tries to pull his gun, 
           but Joe already has his midget gun in his hand aimed at the 
           assailant. 

                                 JOE
                        Don’t even think about it.

           The Guard smirks at Joe’s gun.

                                 GUARD
                        Does that even fire real bullets? 

                                 JOE
                             (offended)
                        Yes.

           The Guard stares into Joe’s eyes, tries to determine if Joe 
           really has the courage to end another man’s life. The Guard 
           rolls the dice, goes for his gun. 

           Joe pulls the trigger. CLICK.  

                                 GUARD
                        You might want to take the safety 
                        off next time. 

           The Guard LAUGHS, rubs the trigger.

                                 GUARD
                        Goodbye.

           JOE THROWS HIS MIDGET GUN AT THE GUARD LIKE A CHINESE STAR, 
           STRIKES HIM IN THE TEMPLE. 

           The Guard goes down, out cold. 

           Joe drags the unconscious body out of sight. 
           Joe takes a peek around, he has a clear path to the 
           watchtower.

           Joe makes a break for it, climbs up.

           EXT. WATCHTOWER 

           Joe summits the top, the WATCH GUARD dozes off. 

           Joe rears back, PUNCHES the Watch Guard in the nose. 

           The Watch Guard wakes up, blood drips down his face. 

                                 WATCH GUARD
                        I’m going to kill you!

           The Watch Guard reaches for his gun, Joe PUNCHES HIM IN THE 
           NOSE AGAIN. 

           This time, it does the trick. The Watch Guard slumps to the 
           floor, lays motionless.

           Joe grabs a pair of binoculars from his cargo pants, spies 
           Claire tied up in the warehouse a couple hundred yards away.

           Joe removes his belt, loops it over a wire that connect the 
           buildings. Just as he is about to leap off, Joe accidentally 
           kicks the ALARM BUTTON. 

           THE SIREN SCREAMS. 

                                 JOE
                             (to himself)
                        You idiot!

           Guards reluctantly spring into motion, scramble to find the 
           intruder. 

           Joe dives off the roof, zip-lines over a moat... but HALF WAY 
           TO HIS DESTINATION GETS STUCK. 

                                 JOE
                        Uh, oh. 

           Crocs stir in the water below him. Joe hangs above a COUPLE 
           OF PATROLMEN, but they fail to notice him. 

           Quietly, Joe kicks and wiggles and squirms. 

           Finally, he gets his zip-line in motion. He descends on the 
           warehouse fast. This is going to hurt. 
           INT. WAREHOUSE 

           JOE CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW, combat-rolls over shards of 
           glass like he knows what he is doing. (Definitely got lucky.)

           Arms bloody, he races past rows of shipment containers to 
           untie Claire.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Joe!

           Joe presses his finger to her lips. 

                                 JOE
                        Shh. I know. I feel the same way. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Joe!!!

                                 JOE
                        Tell me later. We need to get out 
                        of here. 

           THE BUTT END OF A SHOTGUN SMASHES INTO JOE’S HEAD. 

           Joe’s eyes roll back, he collapses. Diego drags Joe away by 
           the feet.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           LATER -- 

           The facility holds a criminal enterprise’s spoils; cars, bags 
           of drugs, electronics, etc. 

           Bound to a chair in only his undies, Joe wakes with blurred 
           vision. 

           RACK FOCUS. As his sight returns to 20/20, he makes out 
           several men with automatic firearms drawn at his head. Jesus 
           holds a machete. Diego grips Claire’s arm. 

                                 JOE
                        Don’t worry. I’m going to get us 
                        out of here. 

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        I don’t think so. 
                                 JOE
                        Listen to me very closely because I 
                        will only say this one time. I’m 
                        going to make you an offer...

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        You’re going to make me an offer? 

                                 JOE
                        Let us go now and I’ll let you keep 
                        your life. I’ll forget this whole 
                        thing ever happened. 

           JESUS LAUGHS MENACINGLY. 

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        You’re outnumbered, you don’t have 
                        a weapon and you’re in your tighty-
                        whities! 

           Joe looks down, realizes he indeed does not have any pants 
           on.

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        You don’t make the offers! I make 
                        the offers! 

                                 JOE
                             (scary confident)
                        Do you have any idea who I am?

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        But of course.
                             (to his men)
                        Torture him. Then kill him. 

                                 JOE
                        Wait, wait, wait! Can’t we talk 
                        about this first?! 

                                 CLAIRE
                        He’s not Colt Rodgers! 

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        I know, that’s just an alias. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        He’s not an assassin! He’s a 
                        writer. The book is a lie. It’s 
                        going to be all over the news 
                        today. 

           Joe nods his head.
                                 JOE
                        I didn’t kill your brother and I’m 
                        not here to kill you. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        His publisher changed it to sell 
                        more copies. 

                                 JOE
                        What do you say we forget about all 
                        of this and you let me buy you a 
                        Sex on the Beach?

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        Even if what you say is true, you 
                        still killed the Prime Minister of 
                        Belize. He was a great man and my 
                        partner. Now, because he is dead, I 
                        don’t have the Federales to help me 
                        with my operation. 
                             (beat)
                        Kill him! 

           A couple of guys grab Joe.

                                 JOE
                        I just can’t catch a break, can I?!

           Out of nowhere, KENNY BUSTS THROUGH THE WAREHOUSE DOORS IN A 
           BIG ASS HUMMER, sprays bullets. 

           He drops six of Jesus’s guys. Parks it strategically in front 
           of Joe for cover. 

           Four bad guys remain, including Diego. They sprint for safety 
           behind a shipment container. 

           JESUS GRABS CLAIRE, DRAGS HER OUT THE SIDE DOOR. He scoops up 
           a dead guy’s machine gun from the ground as he flees. 

           Kenny unties Joe, tosses him a weapon. They press their backs 
           up against each other.

           A HAIL OF GUN FIRE FLIES OVER THEIR HEADS. 

                                 KENNY
                        You should get some clothes on - 
                        you look terrible in your 
                        underwear! 

           A guy fires at Kenny, gives enough of his location away that 
           Kenny adjusts his position to get a better shot. 
           BANG. 

           Kenny kills him. 

           A bad guy moves to get a cleaner view of Kenny, but he 
           doesn’t realize Joe has a clear shot at him. 

           Joe goes through the pre-shot routine. It takes FOREVER.

           Finally, Joe pulls his trigger, CLICK. 

           BANG.

           The guy goes down, dead.  

                                 JOE
                             (in disbelief)
                        I got him? 

           Joe looks over his shoulder, Kenny holds his gun next to his 
           ear (Kenny got him). Kenny removes Joe’s safety, shakes his 
           head. 

           Diego jumps off the Hummer onto Kenny, knocks the gun out of 
           his hands. 

           Kenny and Diego fight in a crazy display that is part Kung 
           Fu, Muay Thai and Choi Kawang Do. 

           -- Tons of punches get blocked by both guys.

           -- Kenny lands a kick to the face. 

           -- Joe doesn’t have a clear shot.

           -- Diego flips Kenny to his back, pulls a knife. 

           -- Kenny pushes the knife away from his throat.

           -- The two roll over, take turns threatening to cut the 
           other.

           Joe sees the last BAD GUY sprint across the floor. 

           Joe crawls to where he has a better view. Joe has a perfect 
           line of sight to take him out.

           Diego rolls Kenny back over. Kenny struggles to keep the 
           knife from slicing his neck. It’s less than an inch away. 

           Joe goes through his pre-shot routine...

           BANG!
           THE BULLET’S POV as it leaves the chamber in a flame, slices 
           through the air and heads in the direction of the Bad Guy. 

           But... it misses. 

           It sails right over the Bad Guy’s head... INTO A PROPANE 
           TANK. 

           KABOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

           THE PLACE EXPLODES!

           Joe flies back in the air. 

           The blast knocks Diego off Kenny. Kenny doesn’t hesitate, 
           finally gets the upper hand and begins to beat the shit out 
           Diego.

                                 KENNY
                        Go after Claire!

                                 JOE
                        Okay, I’m going after Claire!

                                 KENNY
                        Good idea! I’m going to fuck this 
                        dude up some more. He slept with my 
                        sister in high school!

           Joe hops in the Hummer, backs it out. Knocks a bunch of crap 
           over. Kenny continues to wallop on Diego.

           INT. JEEP 

           Jesus and Claire turn down a muddy road.

           INT. HUMMER

           Joe takes off through the main gate, speeds down the same 
           road. 

           INTERCUT BOTH VEHICLES.

           Jesus crosses over a stream, tears down the side of a hill.

           Seconds later, Joe boosts over the water. 

           EXT. BEACH

           The Jeep emerges from the trees, barrels onto the sand. 
           A helicopter waits for Jesus near the ocean. The rotors whip 
           around. 

           Jesus parks the Jeep, dashes over to Claire’s side with his 
           gun in hand. He yanks her arm, she BITES him. 

                                 JESUS SANCHEZ
                        You bitch!

           Jesus tugs on her arm again, she KICKS HIM IN THE NUTS. 

           Jesus drops to his knees, watches the Hummer exit the bush.

           He gets up, takes a chunk of her hair and tries to jerk her 
           out. Claire grips her seat, doesn’t let go despite the 
           intense pain.  

           The Hummer gains ground and is now only a few hundred yards 
           away. 

           Jesus walks away from the Jeep and makes a stand. 

           HE FIRES A BARRAGE OF BULLETS AT JOE.

           Joe dives to the floor of the Hummer.

           The windshield is bullet ridden in seconds. It’s an all out 
           assault. 

           The Hummer continues full speed towards Jesus as he 
           relentlessly lights it up with gunfire. 

           Jesus should think about moving any second now...

           Too late.

           THE HUMMER RUNS OVER JESUS - CRASHES INTO THE HELICOPTER. 

           A GIGANTIC EXPLOSION!!!

           The chopper and Hummer burn in a ball of fire. 

           Claire climbs out of the Jeep, runs over to the blaze.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Joe!!! Joe!!! No!!!

           Joe runs up behind her, still in his undies, but no worse for 
           the wear. A few scratches here and there. Somehow, Joe got 
           out of the Hummer before it collided with the chopper. 

                                 JOE
                        Where did Jesus go?!
           Joe has no idea he ran him over.

           She turns, thrilled to see he’s alive. Joe takes Claire into 
           his arms, holds her tight. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        He’s... right there. 

           Jesus lays dead on the ground, squashed to death. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I think there’s some of him over 
                        there too. 

                                 JOE
                        Oops.

           The setting sun silhouettes the two as they kiss.

           The fire continues to burn. Claire’s face gets smudges of 
           Joe’s war paint on it. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Can you forgive me?

           They go back to kissing, that’s probably a yes. 

           Kenny, Agent Jackson and several CIA Agents pull up. 

           Joe greets Kenny, gives him a hug.

                                 JOE
                        Kenny, what were you thinking?! You 
                        could have died! 

                                 KENNY
                        I was saving your life.

                                 JOE
                        You didn’t have to do that. 

                                 KENNY
                        It’s my job.

                                 JOE
                        Man, your hotel has excellent 
                        service.

                                 KENNY
                        I don’t work for the hotel. I work 
                        for the BIA.  
                                 JOE
                        The BIA?

                                 KENNY
                        The Belize Intelligence Agency.

                                 JOE
                        Belize has intelligence agents?

                                 KENNY
                        Well... there’s only four of us. 
                        Where do you think I got the 
                        Hummer? When we learned you were 
                        coming into the country, I went 
                        undercover to watch you. That’s how 
                        I set up the meeting with the Prime 
                        Minister so easily.

                                 JOE
                        Thanks.

           The guys shake hands. 

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        Would you mind covering up, please?

           Agent Jackson hands Joe a blanket.

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        So, yeah, we kind of realize you 
                        aren’t an assassin now and you 
                        didn’t kill the Prime Minister. 

                                 JOE
                        The CIA is not after me anymore?

                                 AGENT JACKSON
                        You’re free to go. 

                                 CLAIRE
                             (to Joe)
                        Let’s go home.

                                 JOE
                        There’s something we need to do 
                        first. 

           EXT. GREAT BLUE HOLE -- DAY

           Claire and Joe snorkel around the incredible reef. They 
           emerge from the water, kiss passionately. 
           EXT. BELIZE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- DAY

           Claire and Joe exit a cab, grab their luggage from the trunk. 
           Joe’s two items are the suitcases of cash.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Is that all you have?

                                 JOE
                        I’m a light packer. 

           Joe grabs her hand, walks towards the terminal. They stop 
           when they see a TV with the news on. 

                                 TV NEWS WOMAN
                        Like several memoirs in recent 
                        years, we have learned another 
                        simply isn’t true. Joe Schmidt’s 
                        account of being a professional 
                        hitman in The True Memoirs of an 
                        International Assassin was a lie.

           The news report cuts to an interview with Walt.

                                 WALT
                             (on TV)
                        Joe Schmidt duped me. He said his 
                        book was true - I believed him. 

                                 TV NEWS WOMAN (O.S.)
                        So you had no idea?

                                 WALT
                        None whatsoever. 

           Claire tugs on Joe’s hand, continues towards their gate. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        You okay?

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, I’ll be alright. 

           A twinkle of sadness shows on Joe’s face. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY -- DAY

           Walt steps out of a restaurant, flags a cab. 

           A cab pulls up. 
           INT. CAB 

           Walt climbs in, shuts the door.

                                 WALT
                        Upper West Side.

           Felipe opens the door, slides in next to Walt.

                                 WALT
                        Cab’s taken buddy.

                                 FELIPE
                        We’ll share.

                                 WALT
                        I’m going uptown.

                                 FELIPE
                        Me too.

           Walt scoots over.

                                 WALT
                        Fine.

           As the cab pulls away, Felipe forces a cloth to Walt’s face. 
           Walt falls asleep. 

           A closer look reveals the cab driver was the shuttle driver 
           who abducted Joe in Belize.

           Joe and Claire watch TV. 

           An ANCHORMAN delivers the news.

                                 ANCHORMAN
                        This is a breaking report. 

           The news cuts to Walt in front of a microphone.
                                 WALT
                             (on TV)
                        A couple of weeks ago, it came out 
                        that Joe Schmidt’s book, The True 
                        Memoirs of an International 
                        Assassin was a lie. I’m here today 
                        to set the record straight. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. EL TORO’S MANSION -- DAY

           Walt stands in front of the news cameras. 

                                 WALT
                        Joe wrote the book as a novel. It 
                        was me who changed it to a memoir 
                        to sell more copies. Joe had 
                        nothing to do with it. All blame 
                        falls squarely on my shoulders. Not 
                        Joe’s. 

           PULL BACK: Behind the news cameras, El Toro and 20 of his men 
           point machine guns at Walt.

           Claire turns to Joe.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Did you have anything to do with 
                        that?

           A devilish smiles wipes across Joe’s face.

                                 JOE
                        I might have called in a favor.

           She slaps him in the arm playfully.

           INT. EL TORO’S MANSION -- DAY

           El Toro’s men hold Walt over the cliffs by a rope. 

                                 WALT
                        I went public with the truth! What 
                        else do you want from me?! 

           El Toro snaps his fingers. A henchman brings over a briefcase 
           like the one he gave Joe.
                                 EL TORO
                        I want you to...

           Joe sits on the couch next to OPRAH. 

                                 OPRAH
                        I can’t believe your publisher 
                        would put you in that position. But 
                        your new book is fantastic. 

                                 JOE
                        I had a lot of real life 
                        experiences to pull from.

                                 OPRAH
                        And I hear it’s being made into a 
                        movie. Well, best of luck. Thanks 
                        for being here today. Joe Schmidt’s 
                        new book is “Colt Rodgers: Out of 
                        Retirement.” We’ll be right back 
                        with more. 

           Claire smiles at Joe from the audience.
