           FADE IN:

           EXT. ISOLATED COVE, CALANCHES, CORSICA - DAY

           Inky blue sea, stark Corsican rock. 

           Two seventeen year-old boys are swimming against a strong
           current - trying to get around a steep outcrop.

           Both are strong but MARCO finds it harder than SAUVEUR,
           who makes the turn and reaches back to help his friend.

           They clamber onto the rocks, recover their breath -

                                 SAUVEUR
                        That was the easy part.  Come on.

           Bronze-backed and agile, they edge along dangerous rocks,
           drop down onto a patch of smooth sand.

           Before them is a CAVE, its mouth guarded by large rocks.

           Sauveur gestures Marco in like a proud hotel doorman. 
           Marco enters with slight apprehension. 

           In the half-shadows of the cave is a SMASHED CAR, bent in
           two.  The engine lies to one side.  All that's left of
           the car is its buckled chassis - seats, bodywork and glass
           have all gone.

                                 MARCO
                        How long you think it's been here?

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Years.

                                 MARCO
                        A storm must have carried it over
                        those rocks.  It fell off a ship?

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Maybe it's from here.

                                 MARCO
                        Someone drove it off a cliff?

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Or got forced off...

           Marco stares at him.  Sauveur looks back grimly.  Then
           breaks into a huge smile and they both laugh.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Keep to ourselves or tell the cops?

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARCO
                        I should check with my uncle. 
                        Just in case.

           Sauveur is surprised.  Marco is embarrassed.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        You're serious?

                                 MARCO
                        You know what he's like.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Then we'll just keep it to
                        ourselves.
                            (slaps his back,
                             heading off)
                        No cops.  No mafia.

           Marco observes him a moment then follows on.

           EXT. BEACH, CALANCHES - DAY

           Beside a Vespa, Sauveur is finishing getting dressed. 
           Marco catches up, a little out of breath.

           Sauveur lights up a cigarette and watches the sea as Marco
           gets dressed.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Maybe that's what happened to my
                        dad?  An accident.  A skeleton
                        stuck down a ravine somewhere?

           Marco doesn't know what to say.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        More like stuck in a bar somewhere.

           Then he moves to the bike, struggles, pushing it through
           the sand.  Marco soon joins him, together they get it
           going faster, laughing at the strain of it all.

           EXT. CLIFFTOP ROADS - DUSK

           The Vespa rounds a bend, Marco riding pillion, the sun
           sinking over the horizon.  The engine drones on as the
           boys wind their way up to a small jewel of a village,
           lights twinkling on.

           INT. FLOWER MARKET SQUARE, OLETTA - EVENING

           A band strikes up.  A small traveling carnival is in town. 
           A carousel spins.  

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Locals and the odd tourist are just making their way
           through.  The flower market has closed down, the stall
           holders still packing away.

           The boys walk through it all.  Sauveur stops and looks at
           a wall covered in GRAFFITI - Corsican separatist slogans
           in Corsican.  Except a more artistically precocious wording
           in French.  Sauveur nods toward it, warmly:

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Janvier.  

                                 MARCO
                        You should get your brother in
                        line.  Don Louis wants to clean
                        things up for the tourists. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           THE TWO OF THEM ON THE CARNIVAL'S SHOOTING RANGE.

           Marco is a dead shot.  Sauveur is not. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           THE BOYS WALKING THROUGH THE CARNIVAL, Marco now feeling
           stupid, carrying a garish trophy, a GIANT INFLATABLE ALIEN.

                                 MARCO
                        Maybe we should join the carnival.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Or a circus?

                                 MARCO
                        That's right, see the world.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Or the inside of a big tent.

                                 MARCO
                            (an old theme)
                        Come with me tomorrow.  Marseilles
                        needs guys like you.  Strong,
                        fast, -

                                 SAUVEUR
                        - Handsome?

                                 MARCO
                        We'll have a blast.  We'll get
                        rich.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        You're really going to leave me?

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARCO
                        Come on, what's here for you on
                        this lousy little island?

           Through the revelers Sauveur sees a BEAUTIFUL GIRL packing
           away boxes of flowers into a small car.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        I don't believe it.  That's not -

                                 MARCO
                        The orphan girl?  Lucia Silvino?

                                 SAUVEUR
                        She didn't look like that last week. 

                                 MARCO
                        You fool, we haven't seen her for
                        a year... or more.  She's...
                        bloomed, she's become... 

                                 SAUVEUR
                        - A firecracker.  Come on.

           He drags Marco toward her.  But as they get closer and
           her beauty grows, Sauveur is suddenly shy, dropping back
           as Marco keeps going. 

           He watches from a distance:  Marco handing the toy balloon
           over, the beautiful Lucia smiling, being friendly, but
           slightly shy herself.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           MOMENTS LATER

           Sauveur comes towards them, three drinks in his hands,
           hair plastered down in a last moment attempt at ...
           something.  Marco turns to him:

                                 MARCO
                        I thought you'd run off. 
                            (to Lucia)
                        Remember Sauveur?

           Sauveur hands him a drink, then to Lucia, with a smile:

                                 SAUVEUR
                        You looked like you needed this.

           She wipes sweat from her brow.  Takes in his muscular frame.

                                 LUCIA
                        Thanks.  
                            (re:  big biceps)
                        You've ... changed.

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Sauveur smiles, bashful.

           EXT. SQUARE, OLETTA - LATER

           The three of them are dancing to the music.  The boys
           taking turns to dance with Lucia...

           She breaks away, takes a breather.  Leans against the
           side of a stall.  

                                 LUCIA
                        My Aunt will wonder where I am.

           Marco holds up a coin, points out a telephone kiosk:

                                 MARCO
                        Call her.  Tell her you're not
                        coming back because you've met
                        your future and you're running
                        away with him.  She'll understand.

           She smiles at his bravado.  Marco moves closer, rests his
           hand against the wall, leans in, tries to kiss her but
           she turns her head, bursts out laughing. 

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Leave it Casanova, go get us some
                        more drinks. 

           Marco, a little pissed off, heads over to the bar.

                                 MARCO
                        A man's got to try!

                                 SAUVEUR
                        A man's got to know his limitations!

           Marco gives him the finger, then breaks into a grin.

                                 LUCIA
                        He's funny.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Yes, I often find myself laughing
                        at him.

                                 LUCIA
                        Don't be cruel.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        I'm not, he's my pal.  If you
                        can't make jokes at your pal's
                        expense then who can you?

                                 LUCIA
                        Yourself?

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           They're still watching Marco when he gets approached by a
           burly man (TATTOO), who hands him a slip of paper.  Marco
           stiffens.  Sauveur recognizes that reaction:  

                                 SAUVEUR
                        His uncle calls.

           Marco says something to Tattoo, jogs over to them:

                                 MARCO
                        I've got to get going myself. 
                        Marseilles.    
                            (to Sauveur)
                        Coming?  Last chance.

           Sauveur shakes his head and smiles. 

                                 MARCO
                            (backing away)
                        See you, Lucia.  You've got a
                        great smile!  I'm telling you,
                        you're missing out on me!  
                            (to Sauveur)
                        Boat leaves at eight, in case you
                        change your mind.

           And he waves as he leaves.

                                 LUCIA
                        Shouldn't you be going along with
                        him?  To get advancement?  

                                 SAUVEUR
                        I'm not in his clan.  I'm not in
                        any clan.  I come without
                            (mock gallant)
                        Obligations.

                                 LUCIA
                            (smiles)
                        I'm pleased.  Marco's nice but
                        the mafia is ... evil.  

           The feeling with which she says this surprises him.

                                 LUCIA
                        Well.  I really have to go too.

           He pulls down the balloon by the string on his wrist. 

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Don't forget this.  It will remind
                        you of us.

                                 LUCIA
                        Two crazy boys?

           They look at one another.  Something going on between them.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        No.  Remind you of me... and you.

           He releases the balloon.  They watch it rise.  

                                 SAUVEUR
                        I give him what he wants.  Freedom. 

                                 LUCIA
                        He's going home.

           When she looks back down, Sauveur is close to her.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        You're incredible.

                                 LUCIA
                        You're drunk.

           She knows he's going to try to kiss her.  With Marco she
           resisted - but with Sauveur, she knows she won't.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Can I see you again?

                                 LUCIA
                        Maybe?

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Like every time I open my eyes?

                                 LUCIA
                        Does that line always get the girls?

           Sauveur feigns being affronted.  

                                 SAUVEUR
                        It's new.

           He leans back in to kiss her... and she responds.  In the
           hurly-burly of the carnival these two are in a world of
           their own.  The kiss goes on and on, surprising each of
           them.  

                                                               FADE OUT:

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           ON ANTOINE:

           twenty, gangly, earnest...

           He watches the local CHIEF OF POLICE typing out a FORM as
           Antoine responds to his questions.  Booking him?

                        Name?

                                 ANTOINE
                        Antoine Milhaud.

                                 CHIEF OF POLICE
                        Date of birth?

                                 ANTOINE
                        February 26, 1952.

                                 CHIEF OF POLICE
                            (a moment's calculation)
                        So that makes you twenty. 
                        Employment?

                                 ANTOINE
                        Law student, Lyon, last two years.

                                 CHIEF OF POLICE
                            (surprised)
                        You ... were made to leave?

                                 ANTOINE
                            (without resentment)
                        Papa had an accident, can't help
                        with the fees now.

           The Chief reappraises.

                                 CHIEF OF POLICE
                            (stands, smiles)
                        I've always wanted a legal expert
                        on the team.

           INT. POLICE STATION - LATER

           Antoine is handed his kepis, tries it on.  In the mirror,
           he sees his reflection as GENDARME, in full, pristine
           uniform.  He looks good.

                                 CHIEF OF POLICE
                        Wear it with pride, Antoine.

           Antoine nods.  This may not be his heart's dream, but he
           is eternally positive.

           The Chief's gaze settles on a view through the open door: 
           across the way, a surly group of MAFIA MEN sit outside a
           cafe, served by an intimidated waiter.

                                 CHIEF OF POLICE
                        There's not a soul I know in Oletta
                        who doesn't hate the mafia.

                                 CHIEF OF POLICE (CONT'D)
                        But that doesn't mean they will
                        help us stand up to them.  In the
                        old days the whole town would
                        hang out their sheets to say
                        'enough'.  I haven't seen that in
                        thirty years.  We police are alone. 
                        You understand that?

           Antoine nods, resigned to this.

                                 CHIEF OF POLICE
                            (brightly)
                        Shall we go out and celebrate?

                                 ANTOINE
                            (awkward)
                        I'm er... meeting some friends.

           The Chief looks crestfallen.

                                 CHIEF OF POLICE
                        This is not a good start.

           Then he LAUGHS at Antoine's mortified face:

                                 CHIEF OF POLICE
                        Only joking!

           EXT. BEACH BAR - DUSK

           Antoine (back in civvies) carries two beers to his friend
           CLEMENT - same age, unkempt hair, John Lennon spectacles. 
           Beside him sits a younger boy, nursing a Coke.  This is
           Sauveur's younger brother, JANVIER (15, a little simple). 
           He has a small cage on the table, a bird inside.  In his
           own world, he plays with the bird through the bars.  

                                 ANTOINE
                            (resuming debate)
                        The Technics deck uses stroboscopic
                        pulses to set the speed.

                                 CLEMENT
                        Yes, but Bang & Olufsen are
                        introducing linear tracking.

                                 ANTOINE
                        So?  You'll never be able to afford
                        a Bang & Olufsen. 

                                 CLEMENT
                        One day.

           CONTINUED:

                                 ANTOINE
                        By then, none of the great bands
                        will still exist, the Stones, the
                        Floyd, Sabbath.

                                 CLEMENT
                        What would a cop know about music?

           Evil smile.  Antoine nods.  Best get used to it.  

                                 ANTOINE
                        Good point.

           They look over as a VESPA pulls up, LUCIA'S arms around
           SAUVEUR'S waist.  They are at ease together, a long-
           established item.  A year has passed.  Her hair is shorter,
           he has a small MUSTACHE. 

                                 CLEMENT
                        It's the lovers.

           Sauveur goes straight to the bar, Lucia comes to the boys. 
           She takes a CIGARETTE from Clement's pack. 

                                 LUCIA
                            (to Antoine)
                        How's the uniform?

                                 ANTOINE
                            (shy)
                        I'll get used to it.

                                 LUCIA
                        Come to the salon when I'm cleaning
                        up, I'll cut your hair for you.

                                 CLEMENT
                        What about me?

                                 LUCIA
                            (holds her nose)
                        With that stink of dope?

                                 CLEMENT
                        Oops.

           Mugging for Antoine, he holds out his wrists to be cuffed.

           Sauveur arrives with beers for the men, a coke for his
           kid brother and a Campari for Lucia.  He drinks, happy,
           not a big talker. 

                                 CLEMENT
                        So guess who I heard is getting
                        back tonight?  Marco. 
                            (to Sauveur)
                        You knew?

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Sure.

                                 LUCIA
                        Why didn't you tell me?

           Sauveur shrugs.

                                 CLEMENT
                        Let's go meet the boat?

                                 LUCIA
                        Great.  Sauveur?

           Sauveur shrugs.

           EXT. COAST ROAD - NIGHT

           Two Vespas weave and bounce along the coast road, carefree. 
           There's three on one bike:  Janvier (birdcage dangling at
           his side) sits behind Antoine who clings to the back of
           Clement.  On the other, Lucia's hands proud on Sauveur's
           muscular waist. 

           EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

           The ferry docks.  MARCO stands atop the steps, carrying
           two large FILM CANISTERS.  He's wearing a sharp SUIT and
           DARK GLASSES, a far cry from the island boy we last saw.

           Then his cool disposition changes, he raises his glasses,
           checking what he thought he saw:

           MARCO POV:

           beyond the CUSTOMS POST - LUCIA, leg up on a wall, smoking. 
           Cool and sexy.  CLEMENT and ANTOINE kick a can around in
           the dirt.  JANVIER sits crosslegged with his birdcage. 
           And leaning on his Vespa, smoking, moody - SAUVEUR.

           MARCO 

           offers a nonchalant salute and heads down the steps. 
           Saunters through Customs with the suspicious film canisters
           under his arm.  The CUSTOMS OFFICER sees nothing.

           As Marco steps into the parking lot, an open-top Fiat
           SPORTS CAR swoops up, driven by a serious-looking guy,
           late twenties - AUGOSTINO.  He nods a hello to Marco,
           leans over and opens the door for him.

                                 MARCO
                        Thanks - but I've got some friends
                        here.

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           His eyes meet Sauveur's.

                                 MARCO
                        Tell you what, Augostino - maybe
                        you could take Sauveur's scooter
                        over to The Babylon?

                                 AUGOSTINO
                        Louis won't be happy -

                                 MARCO
                        Louis will love me for what I'm
                        bringing.  Trust me. 

           Augostino isn't happy but goes over to Sauveur's scooter. 
           Sauveur nods to him, approaches Marco.  But Marco is giving
           Lucia a lingering kiss on the cheek.

                                 MARCO
                        How I wish I'd never gone away. 
                        A year seems like eternity.

           He smiles at Sauveur, who finally smiles back:

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Hands off.

           Then they hug, pleased to see each other.

                                 CLEMENT
                        I knew they were homos.

                                 ANTOINE
                        They can be arrested for that you
                        know.

           Marco gets behind the wheel, holds the passenger seat
           forward for Lucia to hop in back.

                                 MARCO
                        So you guys won't wanna ride with
                        us then? 

           That makes Antoine and Clement clamber into the back,
           noisily protesting as they push Sauveur out of the way. 
           As he gets in beside Marco:

                                 JANVIER
                        I gotta get some more feed.
                            (holds cage up for Marco)
                        Hey Marco, you like Dandino!?

                                 MARCO
                        Cool.

           Sauveur smiles, nods to his brother. 

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           They head off, enjoying the car, Marco feeling flash,
           Lucia relishing the night air in her hair.

           EXT. CAR, COAST ROAD, TRAVELING - NIGHT

           Sauveur beside Marco, old friends once again.  Sauveur
           looks to the film canisters he's cradling:

                                 SAUVEUR
                        What's this?

                                 MARCO
                        A movie.  Fell off a truck.  

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Burt Reynolds?

                                 MARCO
                        Yeah maybe.  The guys in Marseilles
                        love it.  'The French Connection'. 
                        It's got this great chase.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        So how long you around for?

           Marco shrugs.

                                 MARCO
                        Louis wants to show me the ropes.  

                                 SAUVEUR
                        So you're staying.  We'll get you
                        out of your undertaker's clothes.

           He tugs at Marco's tie but Marco's hand goes up - not
           liking the horseplay.  He catches himself, smiles, loosens
           the tie.  They both recognize the divergence between them.

           EXT. THE BABYLON OPEN AIR CINEMA - NIGHT

           A natural amphitheatre with seats set out under the stars. 
           Behind the giant screen, the glistening sea.  

           The SPORTS CAR is parked next to Sauveur's Vespa.

           INT. THE BABYLON, PROJECTION ROOM - NIGHT

           The elderly PROJECTIONIST/PROPRIETOR is setting up the reels.

           MARCO is on the telephone:

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARCO
                            (into phone)
                        But Don Louis, the places we
                        protect won't have to deal with
                        distributors, their profits will
                        double and so will our cut.  My
                        guy can get pristine prints of
                        every new movie, free.  Then we
                        go to the other cinemas --

           (He is interrupted, hears out a protest, nodding).

                                 MARCO
                        You may be right, but come and
                        see this movie anyway?  You'll
                        love it I guarantee.

           He listens to a rebuff, puts the phone down ... pauses. 
           Then, to the Projectionist, with composure:

                                 MARCO
                        Roll it.

           EXT. THE BABYLON OPEN AIR CINEMA - MOMENTS LATER

           Passing a grim-faced Augostino, Marco joins Antoine,
           Clement, Lucia and Sauveur, sitting in a loose group.  He
           pulls off his tie as the movie starts to play, determined
           they all enjoy this.

           He takes a sidewise glance at Sauveur, sees Lucia's hand
           clasped tight in his.  They're both focused on the screen.  

           Marco's gaze starts to linger on Lucia, in her distracted
           beauty.  And then she turns to look at him, very directly,
           unabashed - available?  Yet her hand still planted in
           Sauveur's.  Marco is embarrassed, looks back to the screen.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           (LATER) - ON THE CINEMA SCREEN -

           Popeye Doyle's car chases the overhead train...  Pure
           adrenaline.

           ON OUR VIEWERS

           in rapt attention.  Including Augostino, crunching nuts,
           into it...

           Sauveur leans over to Marco:

                                 SAUVEUR
                        This is great.

           Marco nods.  Then, casual;

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARCO
                        So how's it going with Lucia?

                                 SAUVEUR
                            (watching screen)
                        Great.  You got a girl in Marseille?

                                 MARCO
                        Not one like her.

           Sauveur looks at him.  Sees only a fond smile.  They watch
           some more...

                                 MARCO
                        ...How come no ring on her finger?

           Sauveur instinctively shrugs.  Keeps watching the action
           ... but now a flicker of doubt in his eyes.

           Both of them steal a look at her.  Her eyes shining with
           the excitement of what's onscreen.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - DAY

           A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT in the hills - a new bridge replacing
           an ancient one at the inner elbow of a pass.  DIGGERS,
           TRUCKS, ROADLAYING EQUIPMENT.  Fifteen men are sweating in
           the midday sun.  One of them is SAUVEUR, bare muscled torso
           rippling as he heaves a rock out of the way. 

           Pleased with that, he rests, wipes sweat from his eyes to
           see a FANCY CAR pulling up by the FOREMAN'S HUT.

           Out get DON LOUIS - compact, dapper mafiosa... AUGOSTINO,
           business-like... and MARCO, in another sharp suit... 

           Sauveur watches Don Louis and Augostino and Marco meet
           with the foreman and contractor.  Business is being done. 
           Marco looks this way, doesn't seem to see him.

           Sauveur takes him in - dark glasses, suit, but more than
           that - poise, confidence.

           And suddenly Sauveur is terribly aware of how all he has
           to offer is muscles and a strong heart ...

           He makes a decision.

           INT. HAIR SALON, OLETTA - DAY

           A small, downmarket hair salon.  Lucia is busy sweeping
           giant masses of cut hair.  

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The door bursts open - SAUVEUR stands there, fired-up,
           with one thing on his mind...

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. OLETTA - DAY

           The cobbled hillside streets are empty, still...  Until a
           BUSTLING NOISE BUILDS, people chattering, laughing... 

           A couple of smartly-dressed children appear around a
           corner... Not far behind, Lucia in a white flowing wedding
           dress, hand in hand with her new husband, Sauveur.  Almost
           alongside is Marco, the best man.  Behind them, the whole
           town.  A riot of color and flowers squeezed into the narrow
           streets.  Buzzing behind the bride and groom, as is the
           tradition, an old man with an accordion (UNCLE PIERRE).

           EXT. FARM TERRACE - DAY

           The peasant wedding party is spread along a huge table. 
           The eating over, people are chatting, dancing, flirting.

           A tannoy plays TRADITIONAL POLYPHONIC MUSIC. 

           We DRIFT AROUND:

           Sauveur is well-oiled, breezy, his arm hooked over his
           younger brother, Janvier.  They're with Antoine, looking
           sharp in his Gendarme uniform.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Now you have responsibilities -
                        you should join the Gendarmerie.  

                                 SAUVEUR
                        I'd never be able to rise above
                        you, Antoine, I wouldn't be able
                        to live with that.

           Antoine smiles.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Besides, I'd always be out
                        arresting the kid with the spray-
                        can, eh?

           The scamp Janvier pulls away, feigning innocence:

                                 JANVIER
                        Why d'you think I'm the graffiti
                        guy?

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Because you stink of paint.

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Fooled, Janvier sniffs himself to check.

           Sauveur and Antoine laugh, they all know he's the one. 
           Uncle Pierre (sixty, warmly drunk) is sitting nearby and
           growls out some wisdom.

                                 UNCLE PIERRE
                        That boy's going to work for me. 
                        Learn my secrets before I go. 
                        There has always been Pinedo honey
                        in Oletta. 

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Janvier can bring in new flavors,
                        Uncle.  Chewing gum, coca-cola?

                                 UNCLE PIERRE
                        You laugh at the simple bee.  But
                        have you ever really thought about
                        the bee? 

           This is a well-worn path when Pierre is in his cups. 
           Sauveur propels Janvier over to Uncle Pierre:

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Learn at the feet of the master.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Marco:  best man, best friend, dances with the girl he
           missed out on.

                                 MARCO
                        You realize you only ended up
                        with Sauveur because I was called
                        away on business?

                                 LUCIA
                        Of course, Marco.  It's painful
                        for me too - making do with the
                        scraps knowing I let the prime
                        beef get away. 

           They pause before breaking into laughter.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           AT THE TABLE:  OLD WOMEN IN BLACK.  And breaking the mould,
           SAUVEUR'S MOM, MARIUCCIA - FORTY YEARS OLD, sexy red dress.  

           She watches LUCIA DANCE WITH MARCO.  Sauveur comes and
           puts an arm on her:

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Dance, Mama?

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        You should be dancing with your bride.

           Sauveur sits.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Let Marco have his moment with
                        her.  I have my whole life.  

                                 MARIUCCIA
                            (watching Lucia)
                        It's a big day for an orphan to
                        start her own family.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Hey, we're not having kids yet!

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        I wouldn't be so sure.

           He lights a cigarette in a particular, rakish way.  She
           eyes this, unnerved.

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        How did you learn that?  It's the
                        way your father used to smoke.

           He meets her gaze:  they don't talk about him very often.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        I can't help it if I look like
                        him.  I'm not going to disappear.

           She smiles, moved.

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        No.  You're stronger than he ever
                        was.  Less complicated. 

           She falls silent as her gaze goes back to Lucia and Marco. 
           Holding back an opinion?

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        But your friend, he will be a
                        powerful man one day.

                                 SAUVEUR
                            (half-serious)
                        Are you saying she'll run off
                        with him?

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        Not if you become powerful yourself.

           He hears this.  Defiant:

           CONTINUED:

                                 SAUVEUR
                        I am the lucky one.  I have
                        freedom.  Marco has no choice. 
                        He is born into that family.  

           Janvier approaches, clothes ruffled, a stain on his shirt.

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        Janvier, you mucky pup.

           And she spits on her hand, tries to rub the stain away.

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        When will you learn?...  
                            (teasing him)
                        Did you feed Dandino today because
                        if he's dead when I get home I'm
                        cooking him.

           Janvier looks alarmed.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           LATER

           Songs are being sung.  A football game is going on between
           the men, young and old.  Sauveur and Marco compete hard
           for the ball.  Sauveur easily the stronger.  Then a little
           kid takes the ball off him.  They laugh and slump down,
           looking out over the olive groves. 

           Sauveur's lost most of his wedding suit by now.  Marco
           somehow still looks pretty smart, dignified.  A man always
           careful to stay in control.  Sauveur slugs back some water. 
           Returning to a conversation.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        ...Yeah.  It won't be anything
                        much, but... you've seen that
                        hotel they're building outside
                        Bastia?  Huge!  More people than
                        ever are coming.  And that little
                        beach I found, one day I tell you - 
                            (taps nose, winks)
                        Maybe in a couple of years I'll
                        be putting up a hotel?

                                 MARCO
                        I've got to hand it to you, you've
                        always had big ideas.  I'll set
                        up a meeting with Don Louis.

           Sauveur laughs this off.

                        Hey, I'm the winner, here.  This
                        is my idea. 

                                 MARCO
                        We are drinking his wine.  

                                 SAUVEUR
                        You're right.  Tell your uncle I'll
                        only serve his wine at the kiosk.

           Marco considers Sauveur, decides to let it pass.  It's
           just bravado.  He'll come to his senses in time.

           EXT. FARM - NIGHT

           A MERCEDES has been decked out with flowers by Lucia's
           friends from the flower market.  The guys have added tin
           cans and balloons. 

           The young couple are taking their leave, receiving kisses
           and presents.  Marco hands Sauveur an envelope.  Sauveur
           pockets it, unopened, and hugs him.  Marco's eyes stay on
           Lucia.  He loves her. 

           Sauveur helps her into the car and CLEMENT gets behind
           the wheel, drives them off with much hooting.

           INT. MERCEDES, DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER

           Sauveur and Lucia kissing in the back.  In love, and happy. 
           Then he notices the car swing off the expected route.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Hey Clement.  This isn't the way.

                                 CLEMENT
                        Surprise.

           Lucia smiles, in on it.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Where are we going?!

           He laughs as he starts tickling her for the truth...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN LODGE, HILLS - NIGHT

           High up in the maquis, the car finds a lodge twinkling
           with lights and festooned with flowers.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        This is Don Louis'?

                            (off her nod)
                        I turned that offer down.

                                 LUCIA
                        Well I didn't.  You're too proud.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        No, I just don't want to get mixed
                        up with ...them.

                                 LUCIA
                        You know how I feel about them. 
                        But this is our wedding night. 
                        This only happens once.

           She holds his gaze.  His is soon a lost cause.

           INT. BEDROOM, MOUNTAIN LODGE - NIGHT

           A hundred candles bathe them gold.  Sauveur strips Lucia
           of her wedding dress... They make love. 

           INT. BEDROOM, MOUNTAIN LODGE - LATER

           They lie in the dark, entwined.

           EXT.  TERRACE OF MOUNTAIN LODGE - DAY

           A glorious morning, the start of their life together.  

           Lucia is opening presents.  Full of life, Sauveur proffers
           a plate of bread and ham, waiting on his new wife. 

                                 SAUVEUR
                        ...Just a small place.  But it'll
                        be mine.  'Sauveur's Shack'? 
                        What do you think?

                                 LUCIA
                        I'm not sure I want to be working
                        there?

                                 SAUVEUR
                        You won't have to.  Janvier will
                        help me.  You keep cutting hair and
                        building up the flower business. 

           He sees that ENVELOPE from Marco on the table.  Starts to
           open it without much thought.

                                 LUCIA
                        You're so good to Janvier.

                        What about money?

                                 SAUVEUR
                        We just need to save up for a
                        year or ...  

           He breaks off - silenced by the sight of the LARGE AMOUNT
           OF MONEY IN THE ENVELOPE.

                                 SAUVEUR
                            (smiles)

                        Marco!

           He kisses her.  

           EXT. DECK OF FERRY, TRAVELING - DAY

           Bright sunshine.  Sauveur and his brother Janvier sit on
           a large crate near the bow of a ferry as it cleaves the
           waters of the busy port of Ajaccio...

           Janvier is rolling bits of paper and spitting them at
           Sauveur who gets irritated - makes to slap him, Janvier
           raises his hands pleased to have got a rise from him.

           EXT. TRUCK, HILL ROAD, CORSICA - DAY

           A truck trundles along in the heat, the crate on its back,
           engine faltering,... until the truck stutters to a halt.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           HOOD UP, SAUVEUR TRYING TO FIX THE ENGINE

           Oily, he slams the hood down.  Shakes his head.  Then
           looks to his brother - who knows what he's thinking.

                                 JANVIER
                        No, no.  You've got to be kidding!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. HILLCREST - DAY

           The two boys, the huge crate on their backs, trying to
           climb a hill... until the box slides off them - crashing
           to the ground, wood splintering.  A beer tap slides out.

           Sauveur shoves it back in and they start hauling the crate
           along... up and up...  

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           They reach the brow of the hill - take a breather looking
           down at the beach and the sea.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           MOMENTS LATER

           They hurry down the sandbank, dragging the crate behind,
           almost falling over as they go...

                                 JANVIER
                            (breathless)
                        Sauveur.  What do I get for all
                        this?

                                 SAUVEUR
                        The ... satisfaction ... you were
                        there when it all began.

                                 JANVIER
                        Fuck that - I want a half share
                        in the business.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Don't make me laugh or -

           And he can't help dropping the crate as he falls tumbling
           down the sand...

           EXT. KIOSK - DAY

           The crate lies broken open on the beach.

           The kiosk is almost constructed.  Janvier is trailing
           some lights across the top, Sauveur is painting a sign.

           MARCO'S FIAT

           pulls up at the edge of the beach.  Marco looks out at
           the boys' new venture.  Grim-faced.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Marco's shadow passes over Sauveur - he squints up,
           surprised to see his friend. 

                                 MARCO
                        You didn't talk to Don Louis about
                        this.

           Sauveur looks nonplussed.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Get out of here, are you joking? 
                        It's just a ... hut!

           CONTINUED:

           He sees that Marco is not kidding.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        But you gave me the money for
                        this.  I thought you approved?

                                 MARCO
                        It's not for me to approve.  Things
                        have to go through Louis, you
                        know that. 

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Why?

                                 MARCO
                        It's just the way things are! 
                        This area is under the family's
                        control - move further up the
                        coast and you don't have to worry.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        I'd just have to ask someone else,
                        Don Giorgio, Don Carlos, right? 
                        Don't be ridiculous, Marco.  Just
                        leave us alone.

           Janvier hasn't really been listening, concentrating on
           readying the lights:

                                 JANVIER
                        Hi, Marco.

           Marco doesn't reply, trudges back to his car...

           Janvier flicks a switch.  The lights don't come on.

                                 JANVIER
                        Shit.

           INT. LIVING ROOM/BATHROOM, APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           A very modest apartment.  Lucia is washing her hair in
           the bathroom, when Sauveur comes in, grabs a WRENCH.  He
           goes to the fridge, pulls out a pint of milk, gulps it.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        How can he talk to me like that? 

                                 LUCIA  (O.S.)
                        Who?

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Marco.  He just talks this... crap,
                        the Don says this, the family demands
                        that.  It's poisoning his mind.

                        He's lucky to have a friend outside
                        the mafia.  Most people would
                        just turn their back on him.

           He goes through to her, puts his arms around her, shrugs:

                                 SAUVEUR
                        He's my friend.  What can I do?

           He leans in and kisses her.

           EXT. BEACH - DUSK

           Janvier tightens up a screw on a junction box.  Flicks
           the switch.  Colored lights flicker on.  He smiles to
           himself.  Then sees that three dark figures are walking
           down the beach from the silhouette of their parked Citroen.  

           They close, their faces picked out in different colors.

                                 BLUE FACE
                        Hi.

                                 RED FACE
                        You a Pinedo?

           It's tense.  Janvier doesn't know what to do. 

                                 JANVIER
                            (nervous)
                        Hey, aren't you Raggio, I know
                        your sister.  We're not open yet,
                        come back tomorrow, yes?

           Raggio pulls out a big KNIFE.  It glints in the red light.

                                 JANVIER
                        What's wrong?

                                 RAGGIO
                        Time for a little lesson, you
                        dumb ass.

           Janvier looks to the big screwdriver in his own hand.

                                 RAGGIO
                        Drop it.  I'm just going to cut
                        you up a little. 

           Janvier's grip tightens on the screwdriver:

                                 JANVIER
                            (through tears)
                        Why?

                        Your brother needs to learn to listen.

           Terrified, Janvier HOWLS and charges him with the
           screwdriver.  Raggio blocks the blow with his knifehand -
           the blade severs two of Janvier's fingers at the knuckle. 
           They drop obscenely into the sand.

           Janvier shrieks and goes white, sinks to the sand.  Raggio
           too looks sickened.  He watches as the moaning Janvier
           scrambles around in the sand looking for his fingers. 
           This isn't what was planned.

           The other two come forward for a look, queasily excited. 
           One of them is holding a PISTOL, the other a monkeywrench.

                                 LELE (BLUE FACE)
                        Who said you were allowed to bleed
                        on this beach, cretin?

           Janvier keeps scraping the sand.

                                 LELE
                        I said get up you little shit.

           Janvier's fingers close around a sharp ROCK in the sand...
           he YELLS and hurls it into Lele's face.  BLAM!  The gun
           goes off accidentally, blasts the sand at Raggio's feet.  

           Raggio stares back at Lele, who has blood streaming down
           his face.  Janvier starts to run.  In panic and anger -
           BLAM!  BLAM!  - Lele shoots him twice in the back.

           The three men stare at each other.  Fear.  Anger.  Panic. 
           They start back for the car.  

           WE STAY ON THE COLORED LIGHTS REFLECTING IN THE DARK BLOOD
           PUMPING FROM JANVIER'S BODY.

           EXT. VESPA - EVENING

           The Citroen zips past Sauveur, heading in the opposite
           direction.  They don't look at him.  Sauveur now uneasy.

           EXT. BEACH - EVENING

           Sauveur walks towards the beach bar:

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Okay little brother, so you fixed
                        the lights, doesn't mean we waste -

           No sign of Janvier - he scans around.

                        Hey, Janvier? 

           A bundle of clothes has been dumped in the shadows away
           from the bar.  He walks over... and sees it's his brother. 
           He falls to his knees, cradles him.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Janvier!  What?...

           Janvier's eyes open.  Barely alive.

                                 JANVIER
                        They've messed up my clothes. 
                        Mamma... she'll be angry.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Who?

                                 JANVIER
                        Raggio, Toto,... Lele.  

                                 SAUVEUR
                        I'll get an ambulance.
                            (to Janvier)
                        Hang in there, little one. 

           But Janvier's eyes fix open, dead.  Sauveur can't believe
           it.  He hugs Janvier.  With all the blood you can't tell
           where one ends and the other begins...

                                 SAUVEUR
                        NO NO NO...

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sauveur stands, staring out of the window, into the gloom. 
           Antoine the cop is at the kitchen table.  Lucia is there
           too.  Shell-shocked, wet-faced.

                                 ANTOINE
                        He told you their names?

           Sauveur is brooding.

                                 ANTOINE
                        If he told you, tell me.  I'll
                        bring them in.  That's my job. 
                            (beat)
                        How long have we known each other? 
                        Twelve years?  I'm your friend. 
                        We need to stop this now.  They
                        have to go to prison.  I want to
                        help, don't you believe me?

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           But Sauveur isn't interested in talking.  Antoine looks
           to Lucia for help.  She looks away.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Lucia.  Talk to him.

           He makes to leave. 

                                 ANTOINE
                        I'm sorry, Sauveur.

           But Sauveur won't look at him.

                                 ANTOINE
                        I'll call you tomorrow.

           Once the door closes, Lucia comes over to Sauveur. 

                                 LUCIA
                        He can't do anything.

           Sauveur squeezes her hand - then moves to his coat, puts
           it on, doesn't look at her as he leaves.  She slumps down
           and weeps.

           EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

           Sauveur is immune to the freezing air by the docks. 
           Waiting for someone.

           The Fiat pulls up, hood in place.  Marco gets out, walks
           to him.  Nervous, wary, pale.

           A tense silence as they look at each other.  Finally:

                                 MARCO
                        It was a mistake, my uncle didn't
                        intend -

                                 SAUVEUR
                        - You're gonna tell me about your
                        fucking uncle?!

           Sauveur grabs him by the lapels, pushes him back against
           a container.

                                 MARCO
                        You're to blame too.  You knew
                        what could happen.

           Sauveur punches him. 

           Marco takes it, doesn't throw one back.  As if he knows
           he deserves it.

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Sauveur explodes, hitting him again and again, fists raining
           in, until Marco is a heap on the ground.  Sauveur lifts
           his head up by the hair, is about to deliver the final
           punch, tears in his eyes - a punch that could kill him. 
           But somewhere inside himself, he realizes this is wrong,
           drops the head... 

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Get away from me.  Keep away!

           And he wipes away his tears as he walks into the shadows...

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Half-light.  Lucia is tense, worried about what may have
           happened.  She hears footsteps.  The door opens, a BLOODY
           KNUCKLE the first thing she sees as Sauveur attempts to
           enter quietly.  He looks at her.  He's still wired. 

           Relieved, she moves forward to hug him.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           SAUVEUR'S FISTS

           raw and bloody, gently dabbed with cotton wool.  Lucia
           tries to appear calm...

                                 LUCIA
                        What happened?  Did you ... kill
                        them?

           Even in his dazed state he is surprised by this assumption, 
           shakes his head.

                                 LUCIA
                        So what happened?

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Marco.  Didn't defend himself. 
                        He'd have let me kill him.

           She continues to dab his hands - but a look crosses her
           face.  Does he notice a sudden coolness about her?  She
           hands him a towel but doesn't look him in the eye.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           She gazes fiercely into the distance.  He lies behind
           her.  Puts an arm around her, wanting comfort.  She does
           not respond.

           We stay on Lucia - and a MEMORY she is reliving:
           INT. BUTCHERS SHOP - 1950S - NIGHT (MUTE FLASHBACK)

           SIX YEAR OLD LUCIA, huge worried eyes watching from under
           a table.  Her father is remonstrating with two much bigger
           men in suits.  One of them pushes past him, steps into
           the cold room carrying a big sack.  The father is shrieking
           now (though we hear no sound).  The man comes back out
           and shoves the empty sack into his hands.  Flies buzz out
           of it, and he throws it away as if it is infected.

           Now the mafia men have gone.  The father steps into the
           cold room.  The little girl moves to get a view.

           Two sides of beef, a pig carcass, rabbits and chickens. 
           All now covered with dripping rotten offal, the air thick
           with flies...  The father miserably tries to scrape them
           clean.  He senses her there and turns to look; ashamed,
           humiliated.

           EXT. SQUARE, OLETTA - DAY

           Sauveur's tiny van pulls up in the square.  People stop
           and watch as he gets out.  He's acting as if nothing has
           happened.  For a moment he's hit by the sight of the
           killers' Citroen parked nearby.  But he snaps out of it.

           Leaving the back doors of his van open, he walks past a
           cafe where some tough guys are smoking.  They watch as he
           heads into the shop.  A moment later he comes out carrying
           a crate of cokes, which he loads into the van with his
           swollen-knuckled hands.  As he heads back into the shop,
           word reaches the inside of the cafe... Raggio, Toto and
           Lele come outside to watch him now load a crate of beers
           into the van.  He's making it perfectly obvious to all he
           is going to open up the kiosk.

           As he closes up the doors, he glances over in their
           direction, defiant, hiding his nerves.  His look tells
           them he knows they are the ones.

           Raggio shrugs contemptuously and heads back into the cafe. 
           Lele's big idea is to spit on the floor, but by then
           Sauveur is already pulling away in the van.

           EXT. MARIUCCIA'S HOUSE - DAY

           Dressed in black, raw-eyed, Mariuccia keeps herself busy,
           hanging out the washing.  Some of the items are Janvier's. 
           She keeps a stoic face as she pegs them up.

           Suddenly another pair of hands is helping her.  Lucia.

           They carry on in silence.

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        How is he?

                                 LUCIA
                        I think he broke his hand.  Punching
                        Marco.  He won't go to the hospital.

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        That one is clever.  Letting
                        Sauveur get it out of his system. 
                        If this capo is walking around
                        with bruises for all to see, our
                        honor has been satisfied.
                            (then)
                        He hopes.  
                            (she spits)
                        That would be the end of your husband.  

                                 LUCIA
                        Like my father.

           The two women stare at each other, then Lucia's eyes flood,
           she drops the washing and crashes into Mariuccia's arms. 
           Mariuccia consoles her through her own tears.

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        I know you won't let Sauveur be
                        weak.

                                 LUCIA
                        I can't lose him now. 

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        If he doesn't make a stand, he
                        will be lost.  Your poor mother
                        would tell you that if she was
                        still here. 

           Lucia nods, steeling herself.

           EXT. KIOSK - DAY

           The area around the kiosk has been raked and combed. 
           Forensic cops are finishing the crimescene examination.

           Antoine is with Sauveur by his van, taking FINGERPRINTS
           from his swollen, bruised hands.  He hands him a rag to
           wipe away the ink:

                                 ANTOINE
                            (re:  fists)
                        I saw Marco - someone beat him good.  
                            (drops pretense)
                        I know you know who killed Janvier.  
                                 (MORE)

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ANTOINE (CONT'D)
                        The fingerprints will probably
                        turn up the killers anyway.  But
                        they might get away unless you
                        help me now. 

           Sauveur lights a cigarette, hiding his torment.  He looks
           Antoine squarely in the eye, shakes his head.

           Antoine knew this would be his response, files away the
           fingerprint chart.

                                 ANTOINE
                        We're done here.  I guess that
                        means you can reopen.  Make a
                        widow of your wife.

           And he heads off with the others.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           LATER - A WOODEN FLAP BANGS DOWN  

           Sauveur sets about opening up the kiosk.

           After a while he becomes aware of TWO MEN watching from
           the shade of the sea pines.  These are older guys, who'd
           been sitting at the cafe earlier.  One has a tattoo, the
           other an ear-ring.

           They shake their heads, get to their feet, brushing away
           the sand from their clothes.

                                 TATTOO
                        Hey. 

           Sauveur ignores him.

                                 TATTOO
                        Hey, what are you doing?!

                                 SAUVEUR
                        What does it look like?

                                 TATTOO
                        You crazy?  You know what will
                        happen.

           Sauveur says nothing, goes about his business.  Determined.

           EAR-RING AND TATTOO walk around the shack studying him... 

                                 EAR-RING
                        Don't you care what happened to
                        your brother?

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SAUVEUR
                        You did it?

           Tattoo draws a knife from his belt.

                                 TATTOO
                        Walk away from here now.

           Sauveur turns, holding a glass.  Ready for anything.  He
           can feel his leg shaking in fear.  Tattoo notices.

                                 TATTOO
                        You're terrified aren't you.  You
                        won't be able to fight if you're
                        shaking.  I'll stick you so easy.  

                                 EAR-RING
                        Hold it.

           He's indicating back up the sand - Marco has arrived.

                                 MARCO
                        Everything fine here?  I think
                        the sun might be going in. 

           Tattoo and Sauveur stare back at one another, still ready
           to fight.

                                 MARCO
                        Put it away. 

           Tattoo doesn't want to.

                                 MARCO
                        I don't want any more killing here. 

           Marco waits, tense... 

                                 MARCO
                        Neither does my Uncle.

           Tattoo slowly sheathes his knife. 

                                 TATTOO
                            (eyes Marco, under breath)
                        Where were you when God was handing
                        out balls?

           And Sauveur continues stacking his glasses - and carries
           on opening the kiosk. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. ROAD/BEACH - DAY

           It's now overcast.

           CONTINUED:

           Antoine drives his cop car along, looks out at the beach. 
           Marco and the others seem to have gone.  A few people are
           swimming but it doesn't look inviting.  No-one seems
           interested in buying anything from Sauveur.  

           Antoine carries on by... 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lucia and Sauveur lie in bed.  Again, she has her back to
           him.  He touches her shoulder:

                                 LUCIA
                        It's late, I want to sleep.

           He takes his hand away.  Exhales.  Doesn't know what to
           do.  After a pause:  

                                 SAUVEUR
                        What do you want from me?  I stood
                        up to them, didn't I?  

                                 LUCIA
                        You know who did it. 

                                 SAUVEUR
                        ... So you want me to tell Antoine?

                                 LUCIA
                        Of course not.

           He lies there staring at her back, scared of what she
           might mean with all this.

           EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY

           Sauveur is among the pallbearers carrying his brother's
           coffin through the graveyard on the edge of town.  It is
           crammed full of ornate, grandiose family tombs.  

           A massive procession.  The whole town is there, it seems. 
           Everyone we met at the wedding.  And now, of course,
           Sauveur's mother wears black like the other women.  She
           will never wear another color. 

           MARCO

           stands on a dusty hill overlooking the scene, watching
           from a distance. 

           ANTOINE the cop also keeps a respectful distance.  His
           eyes meet Marco's.

           THE COFFIN 

           is lowered into position.  

                                 PRIEST
                        ...It is terrible for us all to
                        be here.  But it is right.  This
                        is how we stand against the
                        killers.  Shoulder to shoulder,
                        in honor of Janvier...

           ...Uncle Pierre sees Marco up on the hill, cuts across
           the priest:

                                 UNCLE PIERRE
                        What's he doing here?  

           The Priest continues:

                                 PRIEST
                        God will look after him now...

                                 FAUSTINO
                        It's not right.  

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Leave him. 

           But the well-built cousin is headstrong, breaks away from
           the group.

                                 FAUSTINO
                        He likes this graveyard, he can
                        move in.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        No.  Forget it.

           Another young relative (MAX) wants to join Faustino.
           CLEMENT grabs him. 

                                 CLEMENT
                        Listen to Sauveur. 

                                 MAX
                            (hisses)
                        He's the one who caused this!

           Sauveur hears this and closes his eyes.

           MARCO

           can see the trouble his presence is causing.  He turns,
           heads back to his car...
           EXT. GRAVEYARD - LATER

           The service over, the family heading out and back to town. 
           Lucia and Sauveur together.  His tearful mother and Uncle
           Pierre are next to them.

                                 UNCLE PIERRE
                        You are young, it's not your fault
                        you were arrogant.

           Sauveur walks on, reaches for Lucia.  She holds his hand
           tightly.

           They all walk on into the town, no-one registering the
           nationalist graffiti on a boulder (Janvier's legacy)...

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sauveur downs some vodka.  Wet-eyed.  Tries to roll a
           joint.

           Lucia can see him from the darkness of the bedroom, where
           she is undressing for bed.

                                 LUCIA
                        Where did you get that?

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Clement.

           He lights up inexpertly, takes a toke, coughs.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        They're wrong about me.  They're
                        all wrong.

           She comes out, half-undressed. 

                                 LUCIA
                        Let me try that.

           She takes a drag, feels the dope calming her a little. 
           Hands it back.  Touches his neck.  Affectionate.  But
           deadly serious.

                                 LUCIA
                        You know who did it.  They're out
                        there somewhere now. 

           He touches her hand. 

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Let me make love with you.

           She takes her hand from his.

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCIA
                        Don't you understand?

           She walks away, into the bedroom.  The door closes.

           LATER - IN THE EARLY HOURS

           Still dark outside.  Blanket pulled over him:  Sauveur
           restless on the couch.  He can stand it no longer.  Throws
           the blanket off.  Starts to dress. 

           IN THE BEDROOM

           Lucia's eyes are closed.  We HEAR the front door open as
           Sauveur leaves.  Her eyes open, a look of fear - and
           resignation.

           EXT. BEE FARM - NIGHT

           Moonlight shows us a row of beehives.  All is quiet.  The
           dark figure of Sauveur moves silently toward a SHED.

           INT. SHED - NIGHT

           In the moonlit shed, Sauveur is looking for something... 
           Picks up a spade, puts it to the side.  Opens a cupboard,
           fumbles about inside... until his fingers clasp the barrel
           of a shotgun.

           EXT. STONE HOUSE, VINEYARD - NIGHT

           A small stone house on the edge of a vineyard.  Inside, a
           light on, a couple of figures moving about inside.

           EXT. AMONG VINES - NIGHT

           A leg shakes.  A hand reaches to stop it.  Can't.

           EXT. STONE HOUSE, VINEYARD - NIGHT

           Moonlight glistens on the grapes.

           Outside the house, someone is taking a pee.  Raggio.  He
           thinks he sees something in among the vines.  A shadow.  

           Then that shadow looms out at him, resolves into Sauveur -
           Raggio has no time to react as a shovel SMASHES HIM.

           He staggers back and falls with a sickening sound, blood
           spurting up onto Sauveur.  

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Raggio is half sitting, looking at something red and hard
           protruding from his chest - he is IMPALED on a vine stake. 
           He SCREAMS.

           TOTO AND LELE 

           are drinking coffee in the small house - HEAR THE SCREAMS. 
           Spill their coffee as they run out... 

           RAGGIO 

           has fallen silent before they reach him.  They turn at
           the sound behind them - ONE SHOTGUN BLAST sends Toto
           tumbling over Raggio and into some bushes. 

           Lele sits back on the ground.  Shocked.  Terrified.  As
           Sauveur cocks the gun, blasts him flat.  

           Raggio looks up at Sauveur, AIR HISSING out of his wound.

           Sauveur turns the gun around, raises it above Raggio's
           head, about to finish him off with the butt.  Brings it
           down hard as we -

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The front door bangs open.  Sauveur enters, bloody.

           Lucia comes out of the kitchen, sees his eyes filling up
           with tears.  Devastation on his face.  She holds his head,
           tearful herself, just staring at him, deep into his eyes.

           Then they kiss.  Just like the first time at the carnival.  

           The kissing becomes more passionate.  His manhood has
           been asserted, the shadow of inaction that was hanging
           over him has been banished.  And they both know this has
           happened thanks to her.  More heat, almost something
           aggressive in the way they're feeding on each other.  She
           starts to pull his bloody clothes from him...

           INT. BATHROOM, APARTMENT - DAWN

           Post-sex.  She's in the bath with him, sponging the blood
           from his skin, his hair... 

           Then he does the same for her... 

           EXT. AMONG VINES - EARLY MORNING

           Birds tweet.  A sleepy young worker ambles across the
           soil to start the day's work.  

                                                      (CONTINUED)

           He stops in his tracks as the grotesque dead BODIES
           coalesce in the early light.  Birds hop around them.  One
           has shat on Raggio's head.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT/EXT. POLICE CAR - DAY

           Antoine in grim-faced shock as he and his colleagues race
           along, ahead of another cop car.  They pull up outside
           Sauveur's apartment building, just as Lucia is getting
           out of Sauveur's van.

           She looks appropriately alarmed as the armed police get
           out of their cars.

                                 LUCIA
                        What...?  It's Sauveur, isn't it? 
                        What's happened to him?  I can't
                        find him.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Where have you been?

                                 LUCIA
                        Looking, everywhere.  No-one's
                        seen him.  What's happened Antoine,
                        tell me?

                                 ANTOINE
                        Three of Louis Maldini's workers
                        have been killed.  

                                 LUCIA
                        Oh my god.

                            (numb)
                        We're going to have to see inside.

                                 LUCIA
                        He's not here, I woke and he was gone.  

           Antoine nods to the others to go in, as he lingers:

                                 ANTOINE
                        If I could find him maybe I can
                        help him.

                                 LUCIA
                        But he'd come to me, he wouldn't
                        just disappear.  Something's
                        happened to him!

           He puts a firm arm on her:

                        If he's hiding out on his own he's
                        going to die.  He didn't tell you
                        anything, where he would go?

           She shakes her head, a good little actress.

           INT. VICTIMS' RELATIVES' HOUSE, OUT OF TOWN - NIGHT

           Tears and wailing.  The newly-bereaved mothers and their
           children cry.  Marco watches helplessly. 

           A car pulls up outside, doors slam.

           Don Louis enters.  Well-dressed, a WATCH FOB MEDALLION
           with a Moor's head insignia - his Union Corse (Mafia)
           credentials hung on his waistcoat.  The room goes silent,
           the people are calmed.  He hugs a female mourner.

                                 DON LOUIS
                        It is a calamity.  I will make
                        sure you are looked after.  Raggio
                        served me well.  Toto and Lele
                        will not be forgotten.

           He kisses the mothers' foreheads, then joins Marco and
           Augostino.

                                 DON LOUIS
                        You thought he would do this?

                        He's not the type.

                                 DON LOUIS
                        So what has changed him?  The
                        girl?

           Marco shakes his head - but he thinks it could just be true.

                                 DON LOUIS
                        No-one would take us on without
                        some protection, even your
                        headstrong friend.  He has some
                        ...strength behind him.  Another
                        family, Don Giorgio for instance
                        he knows.  Yes?

                                 MARCO
                        Maybe.  But if he's got any sense
                        he'll be off the island by now.

                        Not if he hears his friends and
                        family are dying because of him? 
                        Soon he will emerge, raw,
                        unreasoning - and that is how we
                        will kill him and end this.
                            (eyes Marco - a test:  )
                        Take your time, make a choice you
                        are comfortable with. 

                                 MARCO
                        A choice?

                                 DON LOUIS
                            ('what could be simpler?')
                        Who we kill, of course.

           Then he rejoins the grieving relatives, leaving Marco
           with a problem.  The ever-watching Augostino would be
           smiling if he didn't have dead eyes. 

           EXT. MARIUCCIA'S HOUSE - EVENING

           Lucia walks toward the house.  She hears a NOISE, looks
           around nervously.  Just a cat.

           INT. MARIUCCIA'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Lucia lets herself in and finds Mariuccia smoking in the
           dark.  Her eyes are still red but she keeps composed.

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        Do you know where he is?

           Lucia nods, watching her reaction anxiously. 

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        He had to do it.  You just made
                        sure he knew that.  

           Beat.  Lucia senses just what Mariuccia has now lost. 
           She picks up an old black and white photo of a rakish man
           smoking (Sauveur's father).

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCIA
                        What ... happened with his father?

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        He was ...a ball of fire.  Handsome
                        like a bull.  But I was young,
                        didn't know how to... 

           Lucia nods, understanding.

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        All that strength wasted on
                        drinking and foolishness.  Stupid
                        fistfights over nothing.  Making
                        enemies cheap. 

                                 LUCIA
                        He was like Sauveur?  Too proud
                        to join the clan?

                                 MARIUCCIA
                            (nods)
                        'Independent'.  But Sauveur is
                        different.  When trouble came,
                        his father disappeared.  I know
                        Sauveur will be back.

                                 LUCIA
                        I'm proud of what he did.

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        Hide it.  Let the world think you
                        are weak, nothing.  For now, you
                        need to be... invisible.

           INT. POLICE STATION, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY

           Antoine watches as the POLICE CHIEF opens a box he's been
           awaiting.  It contains a telescopic stick, to which he
           screws a mirror.

                                 CHIEF OF POLICE
                        So he knew the killers all along
                        and he wouldn't tell you.  I
                        thought you were his friend?

                                 ANTOINE
                        I am.  But this is Corsica. 
                            (suddenly weary)
                        It's not our problem now I guess.

                                 CHIEF OF POLICE
                        What do you mean?

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ANTOINE
                        He killed three of the Maldinis. 
                        They'll deal with him.  Unless
                        you're going to try to stop them.

           The Chief is disappointed, hurt even.  But not altogether
           surprised.  He gets up and ushers Antoine along with him.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           The Chief and Antoine step onto the street. 

                                 CHIEF OF POLICE
                        So you think I am in the Maldinis'
                        pockets. 

                                 ANTOINE
                            (not meeting his gaze)
                        This is Corsica.

           They reach the Chief's CAR and he starts waving the mirror
           under it, checking for bombs. 

                                 CHIEF OF POLICE
                        Antoine.  It's bad enough already. 
                        We don't need a full-scale blood
                        feud in this town.  'Men of honor'? 
                        Bullshit!  But if you were able
                        to bring him in?  If we got him
                        locked up, safe?  

           Antoine nods - but uncertain how he can achieve it...

           EXT. HILLS - MORNING

           TWO POLICE CARS parked high up a scrubby hill.  Antoine
           and three other cops are looking around, sweating even
           though it's still early.  One of them slips and gets
           scratched on some thorns.

                                 COP 1
                        Aagh shit!  This is stupid.

                                 COP 2
                        Dunno, might catch a hare for the
                        pot.

           Antoine knows they're right, but keeps scouring the hills.

                                 COP 1
                        You ever hear about Aldo Guerin?  
                        He hid out up here for twenty
                        years, they never found him.

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ANTOINE
                        That was a hundred years ago. 

                                 COP 1
                        Yeah but what's changed?

           The third cop is peeing into the scrub when he sees
           something: 

                                 COP 3
                        Hey, Antoine.

           Antoine comes over.  Down below on the tarmac road is
           LUCIA'S CAR.

                                 COP 3
                        Isn't that the wife?  So what's
                        she doing heading over that way
                        when she works in town?

           Antoine watches the car disappear, too far away for him
           to follow.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROADS - DAY

           Lucia drives along, glancing into the woods where Sauveur
           might be.  She keeps checking her rear-view mirror, but
           the road is clear.

           EXT. AJACCIO - DAY

           The car drives into the big town of Ajaccio on the other
           side of the island.

           Lucia parks and gets out.  She glances around, but no-one
           gives her a second look.  

           Across the way is a SWANKY HAIR SALON - LUIGI'S.  She
           goes in.

           Through the glass we see her talk with the PROPRIETOR, to
           whom she seems to be a stranger. 

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE, OLETTA - NIGHT

           Antoine, out of uniform, sits nursing a drink.  He's apart
           from the wise guys, playing chess with an old man.

           He looks up to see Lucia drive past.  Calls to the barman:

                                 ANTOINE
                        Two more.

           The old man looks at him:

           CONTINUED:

                                 OLD MAN
                        You're drinking more than normal.

                                 ANTOINE
                            (makes move)
                        Tomorrow's my day off.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Check.

           EXT. HILLS - DAY

           Antoine sits in his beaten-up old car down a lane which
           hides him from passing cars.  He's bored, eating an apple.

           Finally, Lucia passes in the van.

           Antoine jolts alert, then forces himself to calm down. 
           Counts to himself, then starts the car to follow.

           EXT/INT. ANTOINE'S CAR - HILL ROADS - DAY

           Antoine maintains a good distance.  THEN -  

           Without any warning her car PULLS UP.

           Flustered, Antoine realizes he'll have to drive by.  He's
           nervous, excited:  if she's turning off into the maquis
           then he may have hit the jackpot?  Unless she spots him.

           He sits low in his seat, sneaks a look - and is surprised
           to see Lucia stoop over and VOMIT into the dust.  

           WITH LUCIA

           She wipes her mouth, disturbed, surprised.  Takes a breath,
           composes herself.  Looks round.  No vehicles in sight.

           EXT. GAS STATION - FURTHER UP THE ROAD - DAY

           Antoine is finishing topping up his tank when he sees
           Lucia drive by.  Reprieved, he jogs over to pay.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF AJACCIO - DAY

           Increasingly unsure of his suspicions now, Antoine follows
           her car into the city. 

           EXT. HAIR SALON, AJACCIO - DAY

           On a busy street, Antoine follows on foot as Lucia enters
           the salon, carrying a bag.  

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He stops at a convenient cafe, grabs a coffee and waits.

           After a while, she is visible in the salon - doing nails.

           Disappointed, Antoine heads off.

           INT. HAIR SALON, AJACCIO - LATER

           A customer pays at the till, admiring her nails as she
           handles her purse.

                                 LADY
                        Your nail girl is good. 

                                 LUIGI
                        Silvistrine?  She's new in town.

           Lucia quietly eats a sandwich.  Then she's watching
           carefully as a fancy car pulls up outside:

           EXT. HAIR SALON, AJACCIO - CONTINUOUS

           The car is driven by DON LOUIS.  He is dropping off his
           fancily-dressed mistress, ANNA.  She leans and kisses him.

           INT. HAIR SALON, AJACCIO - CONTINUOUS

           Lucia is careful not to be seen by Don Louis.  Off he goes.

           Anna enters, glamorous, a little haughty.  Luigi and co
           fawn on her, providing magazines, coffee, biscotti.

           INT. HAIR SALON, AJACCIO - LATER

           Anna's hair is drying and Lucia is finishing off a good
           job on her nails.

                                 LUCIA
                        ... I only charge a little because
                        I want to get people hooked.

                                 ANNA
                        You'll go far, Silvistrine.  Do
                        you have a boyfriend?  

                                 LUCIA
                        No.

                                 ANNA
                        That's good.  If you want nice
                        things, you should consider being
                        a mistress.  Wives get nothing. 
                        Except cooking, and washing.

           CONTINUED:

           Lucia smiles demurely. 

                                 ANNA
                        You think I'm joking but I have
                        it all.  Have you heard of Don
                        Louis Maldini?

                                 LUCIA
                        Over the other side of the island?

                                 ANNA
                        He gives me anything I want.

                                 LUCIA
                        Isn't it dangerous?

           Anna shakes her head.  Lucia keeps at it, head down as
           she concentrates on the nails:

                                 LUCIA
                        I'm sure I heard there was a
                        killing ...?

                                 ANNA
                        If Don Louis isn't worried, then
                        I'm not.  It's way over the far
                        side anyway, I never go there.  I
                        am his mistress, not his wife.

           Lucia finishes the job:

                                 LUCIA
                        There.  Do you like?

                                 ANNA
                            (nods)
                        I can tell you were trained on
                        the mainland. 
                            (hands over money)
                        Keep this.

           Lucia smiles back.

           INT. SHOP - DAY

           Lucia hands over some cash to pay for a TENT and SLEEPING
           BAG, with a few other bits of gear.

                                 SHOP ASSISTANT
                        Like it outdoors, yeah?

           She shakes her head in admonishment, leaves.
           EXT. ROAD - EVENING 

           Lucia checks the rear-view - no cars behind - and turns
           off the road.  The light is starting to fade but she keeps
           her lights off.

           EXT. HILLS - EVENING (LATER)

           The track leads to a TV TOWER.

           Lucia pulls up and puts on a MUSIC CASSETTE.  George
           Harrison's 'My Sweet Lord' - their song - drifts sweetly
           across the valley...

           It's quite still in the twilight.

           Then she feels a hand on her breast.  Sauveur has moved
           in silence.  His hair is wild - she's slightly shocked.

           They kiss, relieved to see each other.  Without intention,
           he ends up taking her against the van, still clothed.

           They remain locked together, in an intense, silent embrace.

           Eventually, she leans back and considers him:

                                 LUCIA
                        Your tan is stronger. 

           He looks at her with burning eyes:

                                 SAUVEUR
                        I nearly came down - I was scared
                        for you.

                                 LUCIA
                        Don't.  You'll have everything
                        you need.  I'll make sure.

           She throws open the doors to the van:

                                 LUCIA
                        Clothes.  Tent.  Books.  And food.

           He tears off a piece of bread and wolfs it down.  She
           watches him devour it. 

           As he eats, his overactive mind resurfaces:

                                 SAUVEUR
                        They have that saying, the
                        honeymoon's over.  
                            (laughs, manic)
                        What are we going to do?  I screwed
                        it all up for us.
                                 (MORE)

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SAUVEUR (CONT'D)
                            (beat)
                        Hiding here isn't going to fix things.

           She calmly lays out some ham on a plate.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        If I went to Antoine.  What would
                        I get?  Ten years.  Maybe?  Then
                        we carry on.

                                 LUCIA
                        No.  I can't lose you.  

           INT. CAVE, HILLS - NIGHT

           A blanket is laid on the ground deep inside a cave where
           he's been hiding out.  She unpacks more supplies.  Even
           lavatory rolls.

                                 LUCIA
                        This is perfect.  Nobody knows
                        these caves like you do.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Marco does.

                                 LUCIA
                        Marco isn't going to be a problem.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        What do you mean?

                                 LUCIA
                        He wouldn't want to dirty his suit.  
                            (smiles)
                        No.  He knows you.  He knows how
                        strong you are 
                            (gestures to heart)
                        In here.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Am I?

                                 LUCIA
                        And you've got me.

           And then she pulls out the last object - the birdcage
           with Janvier's white homing pigeon in it (Dandino).  

                                 LUCIA
                        And him.  Well who else is going
                        to look after him?
           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Marco watches as a truck backs into the warehouse.  A tarp
           on the back is whipped off to reveal a 1960s PRINTING PRESS.

           Marco looks to the three other men in the warehouse, takes
           off his immaculate jacket.  Revealing an immaculate shirt.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           The four men sweat as they struggle with the heavy press.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           The power-cord is connected, a lever is thrown, the machine
           groans into life...  Relieved, Marco breaks out some beers.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A SMALL WOODEN BOX IS OPENED:

           it contains an engraved printing PLATE.  

           An elderly man admires it for a moment, removes it from
           the box with exaggerated care.  He sets about loading the
           plate into the press, watched intently by Marco.

           EXT. MARCO'S CAR - DAY

           Quietly excited, Marco thrashes his Fiat sports car. 
           Racing for the future.

           EXT. VINEYARD - DAY

           AN AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVELER'S CHECK 

           held out for inspection.

           DON LOUIS

           studies the forgery.  Serious - because this is new
           territory.  He stands in a row of vines, where Marco has
           caught up with him.  Louis gestures to him, and Marco
           supplies an AUTHENTIC traveler's check.

           There's nothing between them.

                                 DON LOUIS
                        And you can guarantee this quality
                        every time?

           Marco nods.  Still Don Louis reserves his approval.

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARCO
                        I have buyers waiting in
                        Marseilles, Barcelona, Hamburg,
                        Athens...  But the paper has to
                        be of that quality.

                                 DON LOUIS
                        And for this you need - ?

                                 MARCO
                        Half a million Francs will make
                        us twenty million. 

                                 DON LOUIS
                        Your source is selling cheap.

                                 MARCO
                        That's what I thought.

           Louis laughs.  Which we haven't seen him do before. 

                                 DON LOUIS
                        Perhaps he's encouraging
                        enterprise.

           Decided, he starts to amble along the vines.  Marco falls
           in alongside him. 

                                 DON LOUIS
                            (at leisure)
                        You can have two hundred thousand.
                            (sees Marco's look)
                        As you anticipated?

           Louis busies himself inspecting some grapes on the vine.

                                 DON LOUIS
                        One day you will have to deal
                        with the question of these grapes. 
                        So far I have been defeated.

           Marco smiles.  As does Louis, pleasant:

                                 DON LOUIS
                        So.  Who have you have chosen to
                        die?

           INT. BELLY OF SHIP - DAY

           An unshaven man in a vest is counting money - a thick wad
           of grubby notes onto a beaten up table.  Cigarettes,
           playing cards, porn.  

           Clement sits opposite him, trying to hide his discomfort. 
           He looks to his fixer, a Lebanese barman.  He nods
           reassuringly.

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 STUBBLE
                        I don't like to sell to strangers.

                                 FIXER
                        Is that why you are charging so
                        much more than they're worth? 

           Stubble shrugs, puts the money in a tin box, nods to a
           tall guy who then goes out the door.  He comes back and
           hands Stubble a rag bundle.

           The rag is unwrapped to reveal TWO OLD REVOLVERS.

                                 STUBBLE
                            (flipping a chamber open)
                        Old - but still beautiful.

           He hands one of the guns to Clement, who takes it awkwardly.

                                 STUBBLE
                        Be careful.

           Clement nods, puts it in his pocket without really looking
           at it, stands.  But the Fixer puts out a hand, slows him.

                                 FIXER
                            (to Stubble)
                        We need ammunition as well.

           EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY

           Clement parts from the Fixer, looks around ... and gets
           into a small car.

           INT. SMALL CAR - DAY

           Lucia is sitting waiting for him.  Clement doesn't want
           to talk.  He hands over a pistol.  Lucia raises the big
           gun, it makes her hand look small...  She weighs it, nods.

           He hands her the second pistol.  She refuses it.

                                 LUCIA
                        It's for you.

                                 CLEMENT
                            (a beat)
                        But ... it's not me... I'm not
                        part of that.

           Lucia refuses to take the gun and hands the normally
           carefree Clement a heavy burden.

                                 LUCIA
                        We're all a part of it.
           EXT. MAQUIS - DAY

           Sauveur is moving silently through the scrub, a few dead
           rabbits on his belt.  He glimpses something in a cave
           mouth, heads in - stepping over an ANCIENT LEATHER BOOT.

           As his eyes acclimatize he sees the remains of an old
           hideout.  Old black pots, cider flasks, a lantern.  A
           very old shotgun and a scythe.  And semi-mummified in an
           old blanket, a man's CORPSE. 

           Sauveur lifts the fabric with his knife.  Most of the
           skin has rotted away, but you can tell the man was old
           when he died.  Clasped in his skeletal fingers, a rosary.

           Nearby, a very old bible.  Sauveur picks up a harmonica,
           and an oxidized mirror.  He looks at his reflection in
           the mirror.  Seeing his own fate.

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Lucia throws up again.  She knows the reason.

           INT. DOCTOR'S CLINIC - DAY

           The end of an examination.  The Doctor is a philosopher:

                                 DOCTOR
                        A beautiful disaster.  

                                 LUCIA
                        No.  A blessing.

           Lucia is calm, knows it is a good thing.

           EXT. MARIUCCIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A bottle of wine is opened.  Drinks poured for a small
           group of family members.

           Uncle Pierre hugs Lucia.

                                 UNCLE PIERRE
                        This child will have greatness. 
                        You and Sauveur are both strong.

           Music goes on. 

                                 UNCLE PIERRE
                        Shall we?

           Lucia smiles, before she has to dance with the crazy old
           guy.  Everyone claps to the beat, enjoying the spectacle.
           EXT. ROAD, CLOSE TO MARIUCCIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Uncle Pierre is walking home singing, drunk.

           A car pulls alongside - a window is open - darkness inside.

                                 UNCLE PIERRE
                        Lost?

           A gunbarrel appears from the darkness - fires three bullets
           into the old man.  He staggers back, sits down, his head
           lolls forward.  Probably dead.

           The door to the car opens.  The gunman calmly walks over
           to the body, puts another bullet in his head just to make
           certain.  As the moonlight catches the killer's features
           we recognize him as TATTOO.  As he gets back in the car
           we see the driver is his pal, EAR-RING.

           In the shadows, CLEMENT drops his JOINT.  Can't believe
           what he has seen.

           EXT. ROAD - LATER

           Wet-eyed, Lucia puts a coat over the corpse, as Mariuccia
           wails.  The lights of an AMBULANCE approach and Lucia
           moves that way.  Then she sees something on the floor: 
           CLEMENT'S DISCARDED JOINT.  Without even needing to think,
           she kicks dirt over it, concealing it from the police.

           INT/EXT. MARIUCCIA'S HOUSE - DAY

           A somber wake around Pierre's open coffin.  

           Lucia stays focused on Clement.  He can feel her eyes
           upon him.

           WHEN HE STEPS OUTSIDE, SHE FOLLOWS.

                                 LUCIA
                        You saw them?

           He is too weak to lie to her.  Nods.

                                 LUCIA
                        You didn't have the gun with you. 
                        You'll always carry it now.  Who
                        was it?

           EXT. HILLS - DAY

           Lucia carries a bag of food toward a cave.  Sauveur comes
           out, so pleased to see her.  

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           But he can tell from her expression, something's not right.

                                 LUCIA
                        Uncle Pierre.  

                                 SAUVEUR
                        What... ?

                                 LUCIA
                            (tears in her eyes)
                        Three bullets in his lovely head.  

           Numb, he takes the bag, sits on a rock.  She comes over.

                                 LUCIA
                        We know who did it.

           He looks up at her, surprised.  She places his hand on
           her swelling belly.  

                                 LUCIA
                        You have more than me to protect
                        now.

           He is delighted and horrified in the same moment:

                                 SAUVEUR
                        We're going to have a baby?

           They look out over the hills, down to the coast.

           A cloud covers the sun, casting them in darkness...

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

           A few lights illuminate men playing boules; among them,
           TATTOO and EAR-RING.  At one end of the court, standing
           in the shadows... 

           ...The dark figure of Sauveur.  

           As he moves out of the shadows, the bulbs strung about
           strobe light onto his face.  MURMURS among these slightly
           drunken folk.  Because of who he is.  And because he's
           pulling out a LARGE KNIFE. 

                                 VOICES
                            (shouting)
                        Get away!  Everybody!  Run!

           Some scatter at the shouts.  

           He keeps coming...  but Tattoo and Ear-ring stand their
           ground.  

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Tattoo pulls a knife too - goes for Sauveur - the blades
           flash in the light - but Sauveur's determination is greater -
           he digs his knife into the killer's stomach - - stabbed,
           but tough, Tattoo slices with his blade and Sauveur pulls
           away, not quick enough, takes a deep cut across the face...

           As Tattoo drops to his knees, Ear-ring tries to run past -
           but Sauveur grabs him, digs the knife into his chest,
           twists it cruelly, then lets the body drop.

           Sauveur's nose is deeply gashed; he wipes blood from his
           face but the wound keeps pouring...  He runs into the
           shadows...  Behind him, the killers' bodies lie in a pool
           of light on the empty boules court.  

           SCREAMS ECHO from other parts of the town as word swiftly
           gets around... 

           TWO POLICEMEN run down the street toward the scene, pulling
           on their jackets (they'd been sitting in the station
           playing cards).  While one radios through:

                                 POLICEMAN
                        ...We need an ambulance...

           - The other looks into the shadows where Sauveur disappeared. 
           There's not a sound.  He's gone.  Like a ghost.

           EXT. CORSICA - DAY

           The quiet of a new day.  The sun rises over the rugged
           island.

           EXT. HILLS - MORNING

           Sauveur sits in the shade of his cave entrance, a shaving
           mirror balanced on a rock.  He stitches up his nose as
           best he can.  Stoic in his agony.

           He looks terrible but what he did last night has sealed
           his own legend.

           EXT. SQUARE - DAY

           ANTOINE KNOCKS ON A DOOR.

           An OLD MAN answers.

                                 ANTOINE
                        You were in the square last night.

                                 OLD MAN

           Antoine looks despondent, it's clearly not the first time
           he's been met by this response. 

                                 ANTOINE

           EXT. FLOWER STALL - DAY

           Lucia is serving flowers, her stall is doing great
           business, she's practically fighting off the customers. 
           She offers back change to one man, but he refuses it:

                                 LUCIA
                        I said twenty Francs, not fifty. 

                                 MAN
                        It's okay.  Keep it. 

           She is surprised, but he is deadly serious.

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Lucia has counted out the large sum of cash she took today,
           and is talking into the phone.

                                 LUCIA
                        I can't believe it.

                        It's tribute.  Bring the money
                        here in the morning.  I have a
                        place we can keep it.

           And she puts the phone down, leaving Lucia to ponder.

           There is a knock on the door and she hides the money before
           opening the door on a surprise guest.  

           Marco.

                                 MARCO
                        Can I... come in?

                                 LUCIA
                        To do what, slit my throat?  

                                 MARCO
                        No-one's going to hurt you, you
                        know that.  

           Lucia stares at him, jaw fixed, trying to decide.

                                 LUCIA
                        I'm pregnant.

           He nods.

           INT. KITCHEN, APARTMENT - DAY

           Marco sits at the table.  Lucia stands, waiting to hear.

                                 MARCO
                        We have to make peace.  Or everyone
                        will die. 

                                 LUCIA
                        Then you stop killing.

                                 MARCO
                        I can make that happen.  

           Beat.  Lucia is surprised.  

                                 MARCO
                        And you can talk to Sauveur.

           Suddenly she is overcome, slumps down in tears.

                                 LUCIA
                        It's over.  He was seen.  He'll
                        be identified, they'll catch him -

           Marco moves awkwardly to comfort his enemy's wife.

           CONTINUED:

                                 MARCO
                        Lucia.  Are you crazy?  No-one
                        would dare testify against him. 
                        They won't want him visiting in
                        the night.  

           She looks up at him with wet eyes - maybe he's right? 
           Her pride in Sauveur surges and defiance and victory
           flashes in her eyes:  

                                 LUCIA
                        Maybe one day my Sauveur will
                        make you the Don.

           Something takes over Marco - he pulls her to him, kisses
           her fiercely - she responds... both heating up, her
           pregnant bump touching his body... until she pulls away.

                                 LUCIA
                        Go.

                                 MARCO
                        I want you.

                                 LUCIA
                        I'm his.

           She stares at him, hand instinctively going to her belly. 
           Marco is tormented - was she playing with him, showing
           him what he's missing?  He suddenly seems exhausted.

                                 MARCO
                        Call him off.  I know he'll do
                        anything for you.

           EXT. STREETS OF OLETTA/CEMETERY - NIGHT

           Leaving Lucia, Marco walks the quiet streets at the edge
           of town.  The moon is high.

           Something makes him head over into the CEMETERY. 

           He finds himself at JANVIER'S GRAVE, festooned with fresh
           flowers.  He stares, weighed down.  Then he senses
           something, looks around in the moonlit graveyard.  Is he
           being watched.  Is Sauveur here?

           His gaze rises to the hills.  Where his friend lurks. 

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. FLOWER STALL - DAY

           The flower stall is now three times the size, and a team
           of people are putting it away for the night.  

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           One of them is FAUSTINO, burly cousin of Sauveur's.  He
           walks to a car and hands the bag of takings to Lucia, who
           is being driven by Clement.

                                 FAUSTINO
                        Ciao.

           EXT. NURSERY IN COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK

           Clement smokes, Lucia walks among the flowers with the
           owner of the nursery.  We now see she is EIGHT MONTHS
           PREGNANT.

                                 OWNER
                        But I charge everyone the same,
                        that's how I've always done it. 

                                 LUCIA
                        So.  You won't help me...

           Neutral words that feel like a threat.  A lump is suddenly
           there in his throat.

                                 OWNER
                        The best I can do is twenty
                        percent.

           She says nothing.  Rubs her belly.  The child of her hider
           in the hills.

                                 OWNER
                        Any more and I'd be destroying my
                        business!

           She waits.  We know he's going to relent.

           EXT. HILLS - DAY

           Clement drives through the beautiful countryside, shaking
           his head at how she just handled the nursery man.

                                 CLEMENT
                        I have to hand it to you...

           Lucia just strokes her full belly.  Sees something through
           the window:

                                 LUCIA
                        Stop.

           They do.  Clement follows her gaze:  on top of a defensible
           hill above the road, an old run-down FARMHOUSE.  An old
           PEASANT is feeding some chickens.

                        That will do.  That can be the
                        place.

           Clement looks at her as if the pregnancy is giving birth
           to fantasies.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE/DOCKS - NIGHT

           Bundles of COUNTERFEIT TRAVELER'S CHECKS wrapped in plastic
           are slipped into barrels of olive oil.

           The barrels are loaded into a CONTAINER... 

           INT. CAR, DOCKS - NIGHT

           Don Louis, Augostino and Marco walk away from the CONTAINER
           as it is loaded onto a ship.  

                                 DON LOUIS
                        Marseilles is impressed.  They'd
                        like to set the same thing up in
                        New York.  

           Marco looks pleased but there's soon a cloud of doubt:

                                 DON LOUIS
                        Things are calm here, this peace
                        is going to hold.  You should go.

                                 MARCO
                            (nods)
                        I'll think about it.

           He walks off distractedly.  Don Louis looks to Augostino,
           who shakes his head.

           INT. CAVE - EARLY MORNING

           Lucia wakes in a sleeping bag.  Sauveur is brewing coffee
           over a camping stove.  She gets up and puts an arm around
           him tenderly.  He is bearded and his hair is longer, but
           he's no caveman, it suits him.  His big hand moves to
           cover hers tenderly.  They kiss, calm.

           She yawns, stands:

                                 LUCIA
                        I have to go, nail appointment.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Why keep that up?  All the
                        killing's over.

                        I just want to know what they're
                        thinking, that's all.  Doesn't
                        hurt to be careful.

           EXT/INT. HAIR SALON, AJACCIO - DAY

           Don Louis' mistress Anna flounces in. 

           LATER

           Anna's hair is being dried.  In a well-oiled routine, LUCIA
           pulls up a stool to start working on her nails.  As if the
           girl with the successful flower business doesn't exist.

           Anna barely looks up from her magazine.

                                 ANNA
                        How long now, Silvistrine?

                                 LUCIA
                        A month.

           Anna shudders.

                                 ANNA
                        Just think what else it's going
                        to do to your body.

           Lucia doesn't look up.

                                 ANNA
                        ...But you wouldn't listen to my
                        advice.

                                 LUCIA
                            (direct, cheeky)
                        You're just worried who'll do your
                        nails when I'm away with my baby.

           Beat.  Anna smiles, "true".  Lucia/Silvistrine is the
           strong one - hard as nails - and Anna is soft and
           dependent.

                                 ANNA
                        I'll miss you.  You could come to
                        my new house, bring the bambino?

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Late, drinking, dancing.  Some money is handed over by
           FAUSTINO to CLEMENT.  In return, Clement gives him his
           old PORTABLE RECORD PLAYER/GRAMOPHONE, counts the money. 

                                 FAUSTINO
                        So you got your new machine?

           Clement smiles mischievously. 

                                 CLEMENT
                        Come round some night and hear
                        how records are meant to sound. 
                        But you'll wanna chuck that piece
                        of shit away.

                                 FAUSTINO
                        Hey!

           But Clement has already gone.

           'POPCORN' BY HOT BUTTER COMES ON.  

           FAUSTINO is in high spirits, slaps the bottom of a girl
           in hot pants.

                                 FAUSTINO
                        Hey wanna come and listen to some
                        real music?

           Another guy shouts from another table:

                                 PATRICK
                        She's mine you fat fuck.

                                 FAUSTINO
                        Who are you calling a fuck?

                                 PATRICK
                        It was "fat fuck", fat fuck.

           People laugh.  Faustino roars to his feet:

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 FAUSTINO
                        You made a mistake.  You know who
                        I am, you know who my cousin is?! 
                        Sauveur Pinedo.  So you and your
                        shitheads better get out now.

           Even though Faustino is a buffoon, Sauveur's name causes
           a chill.  Patrick's friends try to calm him.  They start
           making to leave:

                                 FRIEND
                        Hey, it was a misunderstanding.

                                 FAUSTINO
                        Yeah, yeah that's right.
                            (as they go,
                             overplaying it)
                        Just run away, you fucking coward
                        shits, just run.

           But this is too much for Patrick who screams and comes
           running back to Faustino, grabbing a GLASS ASHTRAY AND
           SMASHING IT INTO HIS FACE.  FAUSTINO goes down.  Patrick
           starts kicking his head in, a dynamo of hate.  Women scream.  

           INT. VINEYARD - LATER

           Slumped, dazed, drained, Patrick sits before Don Louis
           and Marco.

           This is not their fight, the truce has held.  But they
           can't escape being drawn in:

                                 DON LOUIS
                        ...So you want our protection.

           Patrick nods.

                                 DON LOUIS
                        And why should we help you against
                        this killer, Pinedo?

                                 PATRICK
                        ...I've worked hard... my business
                        is swimming pools, a good business.
                            (weary)
                        If you keep him away, and the police,
                        you'll have a tenth of it all. 

                                 DON LOUIS
                        Half.

                                 PATRICK
                        Half?  Why didn't you deal with
                        this guy a year ago?

           CONTINUED:

           He knows he's said too much.  He sees a look between Don
           Louis and Marco, a pained recognition of this truth.

                                 DON LOUIS
                        Sauveur Pinedo will not harm you. 
                        And you will give us half.

           EXT. HILLS - DAY

           We follow JANVIER'S PIGEON as it flies through the trees...
           it lands beside Sauveur. 

           Despite the scars, there is an air of tranquillity about
           him as he sits beside a mountain stream:  a fishing rod
           on his knee and a book lying open on the bank. 

           He reaches to the pigeon, carefully removes a message
           from a ring around one leg.

           CLOSE ON MESSAGE:

                        FAUSTINO KILLED BY PATRICK THURAM 

           SAUVEUR 

           crumples the note, in bitter disappointment.  He hurls
           the fishing rod into the stream.

           EXT. AIRPORT/ISLAND ROADS - DAY

           Marco stands by a car, watching people exit the airport. 
           A heavyset, anonymous man with a medallion appears and
           Marco nods at him.

           The man gets into the car.  He is the silent type.  Marco
           gets in and drives them off.

                                 MARCO
                        How is Marseilles?

           The man gives him a disdainful look.  This is the way of
           the 'Trawler', whose only functions are to kill and to
           rest between killings. 

           As they leave the airport area, the man opens a CANVAS
           BAG that was waiting in the footwell of the car. 

           Inside, PISTOLS, SHOTGUN, AMMUNITION.  He looks them over.

                                 TRAWLER
                        Got a photo?

           Marco fishes in his pocket and hands him a photograph.

           his proud best man.

           TRAWLER

           studies the photograph and casts a wry eye over Marco.

                                 MARCO
                        It wasn't me who sent for you. 

           A long beat, as they drive. 

                                 TRAWLER
                        I guess you want this back?

                                 MARCO
                        Keep it.

           The man studies Sauveur some more.

                                 TRAWLER
                        Will he agree to meet you?

                                 MARCO
                        No.

                                 TRAWLER
                        Have you been watching the wife?

           Marco nods.  Then;

                                 MARCO
                        There's a baby due.  Any day.

           The Trawler smiles, nods.  Then lets the photo drop onto
           the floor.

           INT. LAW OFFICE - DAY

           A typed legal document.  Clement watches as Lucia signs -
           followed by the toothless old Peasant farmer.

           Lucia comes in, tired.  The place is dark.  She starts
           turning on lights.

           Lucia recovers from her surprise - and knows not to turn
           on the light.

                            (low)
                        This is a risk.

                        You know Faustino.  He probably
                        asked for it.

                                 LUCIA
                        So?  If we don't hit back, the
                        rest of us will be next.  All of
                        this will be lost.

                        All of what?  I'm living in a
                        fucking cave!

                                 LUCIA
                        But your sons will live in a fine
                        house.  Thanks to you.

           We can make his face out now in the dark.  A look of shock.

           Her belly is full.  He can't ignore it.  He drops to his
           knees and kisses it.  Buries his face against it.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        My God, my God!

           She cradles his head against her jutting belly.

                            (soothing)

           EXT/INT. PATRICK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A man with a machine gun (UGO) patrols a house surrounded
           by swimming pools of all sizes - prefabricated, stood on
           end, stacked.

           The gunman looks out to the hills where Sauveur is lurking. 
           Two more men here with machine guns.  He opens the front
           door, takes another look before stepping  

           INTO THE HOUSE.

           Patrick sits in the living room, watching TV.  

                                 THURAM
                        What's it like out there?

                        Quiet.  Look, don't worry -

                        Why should I worry, I've got you.

                        Maybe I should just take the next
                        boat out of here?

                        You don't need to run.  He's just
                        one guy.

                                 THURAM
                        One guy just waiting quietly for
                        the right moment.  Why didn't you
                        lot finish him off six months
                        ago?  I'd be better off in prison.

           Ugo looks back though the window.  Despite his machine
           gun, he looks anxious.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           lowers the binoculars.  This looks too difficult.  Decides
           not to go for it, runs low away from the scene...

           INT. VINEYARD - NIGHT

           Don Louis sips some wine, not pleased by it.  He's at a
           chess board, but his opponent Marco is on his feet, by
           the window, clearly anxious.

                                 DON LOUIS
                        You know in the old days the queen
                        could only move one square at a
                        time.  Bishop too.

                        and everyone was suddenly in a

                        they changed the rules.  Give the
                        queen more power, and it changes
                        everything.  Sometimes impatience
                        is good.  We're doing the right

           Marco nods, wanting to be convinced.

           EXT. SAUVEUR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sauveur arrives among the shadowed bushes, looking towards
           his own apartment block.  

           HIS POV:

           A car drives fast down the road, brakes hard.  Antoine
           the cop yanks his door open, helps a Doctor out.  The man
           hurries into the house.

           SAUVEUR

           moves closer... From the first floor apartment window THE
           SOUND OF LUCIA MOANING IN LABOR.  And yet he can't go
           inside.  Tears well in his eyes.  

           Then rain starts to patter through the trees, a deep rumble
           from the sky above. 

           A FLASH OF LIGHTNING LIGHTS UP THE SCENE:  the road, the
           trees,... and him - a lonely furtive figure.  The outsider.

           He backs away, looks around - sees a man is getting out
           of a parked car.  A car he hadn't noticed before.

           The man breaks into a run, coming at him.  The Trawler.

           Sauveur isn't prepared for this, runs into the trees. 
           The chasing man pulls a pistol, lines it up, fires at the
           dodging figure - catches him in the shoulder.  Sauveur
           crashes down into the soaking leaves.

           The guy pursuing slows as he approaches the body.  About
           to drill him with another bullet - when he's surprised by
           Sauveur suddenly throwing a KNIFE - INTO HIS CHEEK - the
           force knocking him back - 

           He staggers, gun firing wildly - drops it to grab the
           handle of the knife in his cheek - 

           Then Sauveur is on him, tearing the knife out - PLUNGING
           it into his chest, turning it up into his heart... 

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The two men fall back hard into one tree - then another -
           Sauveur holds him as he dies... Sauveur's shirt slicking
           with rain and blood...

                                                               INTERCUT:

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Blood is wiped from the baby as it is born.  It is passed
           up to Lucia's chest.

                                                               INTERCUT:

           EXT. TREES - NIGHT

           Sauveur rests back on the wet earth, lets the dead man
           slip off him... Reaches inside the dead man's jacket,
           pulls out a wallet, a picture of the man and his wife and
           two kids.  Lets it drop.

           He drags himself to his feet, looks back through the trees -
           at the distant light coming from his apartment window. 
           Then runs away.  The THUNDER RUMBLES DISTANTLY...

           INT. LUCIA'S APARTMENT - DAY

           A knock at the door.

           Mariuccia opens it - onto an old woman from the village,
           holding flowers.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        For the new baby.

           She is ushered in. 

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           As the woman leans over the cot, Lucia opens the flowers:

                                 LUCIA
                        You didn't have to.  I just hope
                        you got these from my stall?

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Of course.

           Lucia looks at her - she'd only meant it as a joke, but
           the woman is genuinely anxious.  As Lucia unwraps the
           flowers a bundle of Francs falls from inside the bunch. 
           The old woman's eyes beseech her to take the money.

           ANOTHER KNOCK.

           CONTINUED:

           Lucia is pleased to see another olden from the village.

                                 VILLAGER
                        I heard the good news.  

           She gives Lucia a kiss and as she does she whispers:

                                 VILLAGER
                        We're all behind Sauveur. 

           As the man who runs the baker's is admitted, Lucia opens
           an envelope:  inside a NEW BABY card, more Francs.  

           INT. MORTUARY - DAY

           The body of the stabbed Trawler is lowered onto the slab. 
           The Police Chief examines his disfigured face.  Antoine
           stands against the wall.

                                 POLICE CHIEF
                        He's not from around here.

           A deputy brings over a tray of the dead man's possessions. 
           AUTOMATIC PISTOL, TWO EXTRA CLIPS, A STILETTO KNIFE.

                                 POLICE CHIEF
                        Assassin.  They brought in a
                        'trawler'.  And Sauveur Pinedo
                        gutted him.

           Antoine stares at the horrible corpse and the horrible
           handiwork of his old friend. 

           EXT. HILLS - DAY

           His injured arm now patched up, Sauveur is doing one arm
           pulls ups on a tree branch.  He is muscular and agile. 
           With honed animal instincts he senses a change in the
           environment.  Drops down.  Moves through the trees, drawing
           his knife...

           - To find the PIGEON waiting for him near the cave.

           EXT. LAKE - DAY

           Mariuccia drives up to a quiet lake.  After a while,
           Sauveur emerges from the maquis.  He is wary, but emotional
           to see his mother again.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Mamma.

           She is brisk, practical, hiding her shock at his state.

                        No-one followed us.

           He looks confused, then sees what looks like a bundle of
           washing on the back seat of the car - and in it, a BABY. 
           Who starts crying loudly.

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        He has your lungs.

           Sauveur goes to the car and pulls out the baby, so gently,
           tears filling his smiling eyes.

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        We did a switch, they're watching

                        What's his name?

                        Lucia says it is the man's
                        decision.

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        So, have you a name for him?

           He looks lovingly at the boy.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Janvier.

           Mariuccia smiles but is holding back her tears.

           EXT. PATRICK'S HOUSE - DAY

           Marco stands with others among the stacked swimming pools,
           the perimeter dotted with gunmen.  A car swoops up and
           out steps Don Louis, agitated. 

                                 DON LOUIS
                        Get rid of those men, it looks
                        ridiculous, like we're afraid for
                        our lives!
                            (calms)
                        He's not stupid.  He knows we're
                        protecting this guy.  He won't
                        come.  

           He takes a gun from one of the gunmen and heads into the
           house.

           CONTINUED:

           We hear TWO SHOTS.  After a while, Louis comes out,
           strangely calm.  Marco is quietly shocked, never seen him
           like this before.

                                 DON LOUIS
                        Our family has ruled Oletta for
                        sixty years.  I'm not about to
                        let that end.

           He lights a cigar to calm himself.

                                 MARCO
                        I will deliver his body.  When
                        the snow comes he'll be easy to
                        track.

                                 DON LOUIS
                        There's a faster way to flush him out.

                                 MARCO
                        Louis.  If you kill the girl or
                        the child you will lose Oletta
                        for sure.  The people will turn
                        against us.

                                 DON LOUIS
                        They're already against us!

           With an effort, Louis calms himself again.  Considers
           Marco, and what is driving him:

                                 DON LOUIS
                        Why didn't you marry her?

           Marco can't deny the supposition behind this.

                                 DON LOUIS
                        Didn't want to steal from your
                        friend, eh?

                                 MARCO
                        I won't let you down.

                                 DON LOUIS
                        What about you?  You could be
                        making a name for yourself in
                        Marseilles, even New York.  She
                        holds you back and she's not even
                        yours. 

                                 MARCO
                        There will be time for that when
                        Sauveur is dead.

                                 DON LOUIS 
                        The snow won't change things.

                        back.  Again and again.  Until
                        he's in a frenzy, not careful any
                        more.  And you will have a whole
                        army ready for that moment.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Marco slips into a booth.  Antoine is there, nursing a drink,
           pale from what he has seen and the expectation of the
           violence to come.

                                 MARCO

                            (joking to hide
                             his surprise)
                        You trying to get rid of me?

                        One day you might come back.  Be

                        The devil's lawyer? 

           Marco smiles for the first time in a good while.  The
           envelope lies there.  Antoine runs his finger under the
           flap, sees some bills.

                                 ANTOINE
                        I can't, it's...

                        Bribery?  

           He looks very directly into Antoine's eyes, not wanting
           to say any more - the emotion is too great.  Antoine
           understands ... this is to keep him from harm, maybe even
           to keep him alive.

                                 MARCO
                        I'm bribing you to make the most
                        of yourself. 

           Antoine is tempted.

                        No strings?

           Antoine picks up the envelope, a lifeline he hadn't dared
           hope for.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Having to leave college ... that
                        was hell.  For me.

           So he pockets it.

                                 ANTOINE
                        I'll pay you back.  Start with a

                        get out and make me proud.

           He stands again.

                                 ANTOINE
                            (serious)
                        You should leave as well.

                        I know.  And you know I can't.

           They share a sad smile of recognition, before Marco leaves. 
           People part for him to pass - the mafia shadow descending.

           smoulders in the new day.  Inside a cadaver is fixed,
           charred.

           ANNA opens the door on a very different, smiling Lucia.

                        wanted to see him smile.

                        Next time, I'll keep him awake.

           Anna doesn't notice the intelligent gleam in Lucia's eye
           as she checks the layout of the apartment - stairs to the
           roof, balconies, etc.,... 

                                 LUCIA

                        to talk him out of what needs
                        doing.  He's the friend of the
                        bandit.  But Louis has lost
                        patience.  There are going to be
                        some big changes.

           EXT. CAR - DAY

           Lucia drives into a tunnel - but doesn't emerge on the
           other side.

           INSIDE THE TUNNEL

           The car stopped, window down.  A SHADOW beside the car. 
           Sauveur.

           EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK, MARINA DEVELOPMENT - DAY

           The sun is low.  Don Louis arrives for his regular
           assignation with his mistress.  A car is behind him, his
           bodyguards inside.  
           EXT. ROOFS - DAY

           A SILHOUETTE leaps between two roofs, risking a drop of
           six floors.

           INT. STAIRS/APARTMENT - DAY

           The elevator doors open.  Don Louis steps out with one
           bodyguard, taking his apartment key, lets himself in.

           The bodyguard takes up position in the corridor, opens
           his sports newspaper.

           INSIDE

           Anna is fixing a drink.  Slips some ice into the glass.

                                 DON LOUIS
                            (perky)
                        Mathilde is visiting her sister.

                                 ANNA
                        Ooh.  You can stay all night!

           He takes off his jacket, undoes his tie.  He unhooks his
           watch, lays it on the table.  Takes the drink.

                                 DON LOUIS
                        How's your mother?

                                 ANNA
                        Better.

           He touches her face.  Soft.  Caring.  She holds his hand
           there.  They're comfortable together.  

                                 DON LOUIS
                            (smiles)
                        I've missed you.

                        Happy here?

                                 ANNA
                        Yeah,...  Let's go build up an
                        appetite...

           And she leads him to the bedroom.

           INT. APARTMENT - LATER, DUSK

           Don Louis slips some fresh ice into his abandoned drink.

           He's wearing his trousers but has yet to put his shirt
           back on.  Anna, from the bedroom:

           CONTINUED:

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        So shall I fix us food here or
                        shall we go out? 

                                 DON LOUIS
                        Oh let's go out. 

           He sips the drink as he walks to the balcony window, takes
           out a cigar, lights it... 

           As he's about to blow out the match a gust of wind
           extinguishes it.  He glances briefly at the balcony sliding
           door, very slightly ajar.  Thinks nothing of it.

           He puffs on the cigar, surveying the marina, the fabulous
           launches burnished in the dying light.  He seems at peace. 
           But then ill ease creeps up on him as he thinks more about
           that open door,... his eyes go to it, then - on the edge
           of his vision - a SHADOW against the wall.  He takes a
           breath to shout but in two quick steps SAUVEUR is on him,
           clasping his mouth and CUTTING HIS THROAT.  A huge wound
           opens up and a ghastly whizz of cigar smoke comes out.  

           ANNA 

           steps into the room, half-naked.

                                 ANNA
                        I think you don't trust my cook -

           But she freezes, then stumbles back.  She screams.  Doesn't
           stop screaming at the unbelievable horror: 

           Louis' body shakes and shudders and Sauveur hangs on
           grimly.  The weight of Louis forces them closer to the
           window.  Sauveur can't stop himself - they crash against
           the glass - their combined weight cracking it, taking
           them through it.  They fall onto the balcony in a splash
           of glass and blood. 

           A FIST HAMMERS ON THE APARTMENT DOOR. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Don Louis?!

           Anna can't form words, can only scream.

           A BOOT KICKS THE DOOR IN - the bodyguard bursts into the
           room. 

           Follows Anna's eyeline to the balcony - where glass
           crunches as Sauveur is getting to his feet.

           The bodyguard pauses briefly - you have to before taking
           on Sauveur - then he races to the window.

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Sauveur climbs on the balcony wall - leaps across to the
           next balcony.

           Then runs, leaps up on to the next wall, across to the
           further balcony - 

           The bodyguard FIRES TWICE - chipping masonry by Sauveur
           as he jumps down - disappearing from view.

           The bodyguard pulls his radio.

                                 BODYGUARD
                        He's here - Pinedo is here!  Moving 
                            (checks street name)
                        Uh, dropping down to Paoli -  

           He looks to the body of his boss, the only thing moving
           is his blood.

                                 BODYGUARD
                        He got him.  Don Louis is dead.

           EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK, MARINA DEVELOPMENT - DUSK

           The bodyguards in the waiting car panic into action.

           EXT. STREET - DUSK

           Sauveur drops from a pipe, races down the middle of the
           street - behind him... the bodyguards' car skids around
           the corner, coming for him...

           INT. CAR, STREET - DUSK

           The bodyguard in the passenger seat has his radio out - 

                                 BODYGUARD 2
                            (into radio)
                        Marco - we're chasing him, Pinedo. 
                        He got the Don.

                                                               INTERCUT:

           INT. RESTAURANT - DUSK

           Marco is in the restaurant, on his radio.  The news is
           difficult to swallow.

                                 MARCO
                        Don't lose him.

           He looks to the three guys he was eating with.  They get
           to their feet.
           EXT. BAR - EVENING

           Marco comes out to the street, the others not far behind.

           He opens the trunk of his car - pulls out a FLARE GUN -
           points it into the sky and fires.

           It's like the bat signal for Don Louis' men.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           SHOTS OF:

           TWO GUYS IN CAFES COME RUNNING OUT. 

           WEIRD SHADOWS ARE CREATED AS THE HOUSES, STREETS AND TREES
           ARE LIT BRIGHT GREEN - THE FLARE GLOWS STRONGLY, DRIFTING
           THOUGH THE DARKENING SKY...

           A MAN SEES THE LIGHT THOUGH HIS WINDOW, LEAVES HIS SUPPER,
           HEADS OUT...

           MEN PUTTING JACKETS ON, JUMPING INTO CARS, ONTO BIKES...

           THE CARS, MEN AND BIKES ROAR INTO A PIAZZA - THE PRE-
           ARRANGED RALLYING POINT.

           Meanwhile...

           EXT. NEAR MARINA DEVELOPMENT - NIGHT

           Sauveur races down an alley - one man following. 

           The other bodyguard is taking the car around the block...

           Sauveur runs to a bar at the end of the alley, a few kids
           hang around two Vespas (keys in ignitions)...  He yanks
           one Vespa off its stand, fires it up.  

           Shoots the scooter down the road, as the car turns into
           his street, rejoins the chase...

           Sauveur turns into some traffic, mounts the pavement...

           SHOTS OF:

           SIX CARS, THREE SCOOTERS

           The babble of radios.  Drivers and riders keeping in close
           contact.

           Don Louis' squadron getting closer to the pursuit...
           EXT. CLIFFS/HILLS/COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

           The Vespa hurtles along - but the bodyguard's car still
           has him in his sights...

           And now - more headlights - here come the rest of them.

           The mass of cars and bikes join the chase... gaining on
           their prey...

           Sauveur switches his headlamp off - and bumps the Vespa
           straight off the road - 

           The cars follow, spreading out wide, their headlights
           bouncing shafts of light over the dry scrub, occasionally
           picking out their target...

           A few gunshots ring out, a couple of guys leaning out
           with guns - but it's so bumpy it's difficult to keep the
           pistols steady...

           They seem to be closing, the Vespa struggling with the
           rugged landscape...  when the front wheel hits a rock,
           the Vespa flips and Sauveur is catapulted into the air...

           Hits the ground hard, recovers quickly, starts scrambling
           away, breathing hard as he clambers over rocks and into
           the thorny hinterland, making his way back up to his home:
           the maquis.

           The pursuing cars and bikes can go no further - the terrain
           too steep, too rough...

           They all jerk to a stop at different angles.  Twelve men
           head off on foot.  Torches, pistols and shotguns in hand. 

           MARCO LEADS THE PACK.

           He has another flare ready, shoots it high...

           THE STARK ROCKS, DRY GRASS AND TREES EXPLODE BRIGHT GREEN.

           A green Sauveur is visible too.  A volley of shots smash
           all around him - he ducks from view... 

           As the shadows return and the flare lands - it ignites a
           small patch of grass, the wind quickly developing it into
           a larger fire...

           WITH MARCO AND HIS MEN

                                 MARCO
                        Set it alight!  Set the maquis
                        alight!

           CONTINUED:

           He grabs a few branches, races past the fire the flare
           caused - lets the branch catch alight - and drags it across
           the scrub...

           The others grab branches, set them alight with lighters...
           spreading out, hurling them forwards or dragging them
           across the bushes...

           Then they withdraw as soon a hellish fire is burning,
           spreading rapidly through the landscape...

           SAUVEUR

           turns to see the raging flames, quickly leaping from tree
           to bush.  He scrambles further up the hill... but the
           flames aren't far behind. 

           EXT. HILLS, WITH MARCO - MOMENTS LATER

           Marco and the others have withdrawn a good way and watch
           the fire rage.  It's hot even here.

                                 MARCO
                        He won't outrun that...

           Awed by the scale of the fire they have unleashed, the
           guys share nervous but hopeful looks - nobody could survive
           that.

           Through the heat haze and flames he thinks he sees someone:
           Sauveur.  He stands there.  Defiant.  Yelling in rage at
           them - as the roaring flames seem to engulf him, swallowing
           him up...

           - Then a branch beside Marco sways.  Then another.  He
           and the others look up, feel the breeze in their hair, an
           ominous distant woosh.  And they know what it means. 
           They RUN.

           With the change of wind, the FIRE now races after them. 
           ROARING.  Black smoke looming over them like an evil ghost.  

           They are quickly separated.  Marco looks back - hears the
           SCREAMS of his own men.  He keeps running...

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. HILLS - DAY

           A FIRETRUCK is wetting down the burnt ruins of the
           Maldini's MOUNTAIN LODGE where Sauveur and Lucia spent
           their wedding night.

           A dazed-looking Marco is there, watching.  Shell-shocked. 
           But it is done.
           EXT. HILLS - DAY

           VULTURES circle.

           FOREST RANGERS follow the wheeling of the vultures through
           blackened scrub and find THREE CHARRED BODIES, burnt beyond
           recognition.

           EXT. VINEYARD - DAY

           A place in a state of shock.  Snow starting to fall.

           INT. HOUSE, VINEYARD - DAY

           Don Louis in his open casket, neck wound concealed.  His
           widow wails, consoled by the other women.  Anna is nowhere
           to be seen. 

           THE KITCHEN 

           The men of the clan stand in silence.  A sense of
           paralysis.  Nobody knows what to do.  Marco comes in,
           carrying a SHOULDER BAG.

                                 AUGOSTINO
                        You did this.

           Marco has been expecting this accusation.

                                 MARCO
                        Louis is avenged.  Sauveur is dead.  

                                 AUGOSTINO
                        Is he?  We need a body.

           Marco puts the bag on the table.  Facing the men:

                                 MARCO
                        You need a leader.

           He UNZIPS the bag.  It is full of CASH - more than any of
           them have ever seen in their lives. 

                                 AUGOSTINO
                        What's this?  You think you can
                        buy us?

                                 MARCO
                        No.  I'm showing you why Louis
                        chose me to take over.  I brought
                        all this in.  More than all your
                        racketeering - ten times over.  I
                        am the future.

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Augostino looks to the others, they are impressed.

                                 MARCO
                        I have ideas.  What do you have,
                        Augostino?  Guts?  Then why didn't
                        you challenge Louis' choice when
                        he was alive?  

           Augostino glares at him, faced down.

                                 AUGOSTINO
                        Your friend better be dead.

           Marco gazes back, lifts two stacks of notes:

                                 MARCO
                        Ten thousand dollars to the man
                        who finds his body.  Let's put
                        Augostino's mind at ease.

           EXT. LUCIA'S NEW FARM - DAY

           Clement and another cousin keep watch outside.  Lucia
           chose this place well:  they have good views of all
           approaches.  Inside, we can hear CRIES of the toddler.

           INT. LUCIA'S NEW FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Mariuccia tends to the kid.  Red-eyed, Lucia paces,
           grieving for Sauveur, worried for the child.  We haven't
           seen her so vulnerable before.

           Mariuccia now has the child calm in her arms.

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        If they think his father is dead
                        ... there's nothing to stop them
                        coming for Janvier.  The world
                        needs to think Sauveur is alive.

           Lucia looks at her quizzically, then understands her
           meaning.

           EXT/INT. CHURCH - DAY

           Snow dusts the church.

           INSIDE THE CHURCH

           A large gathering for the funeral of Don Louis.  The coffin
           stands on a trolley before the altar. 

           The priest performs the sign of the cross over it, then
           looks to Marco.

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Marco moves out of his pew and the congregation observes
           him walk toward the coffin.  He stops by it - and now we
           realize DON LOUIS' WATCH AND FOB MEDALLION have been placed
           at one end of the coffin.  

           Marco takes the watch and chain, bows to the coffin,
           returns to his place.  Augostino watches him with contempt.

           As the mass continues, he turns the watch fob medallion
           over in his hands, rubs his thumb over the Moor's crest
           insignia (the sign of the UNION CORSE) then clasps it
           tightly.  The new Don. 

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE, OLETTA - DAY

           A cold day.  Men are drinking:

                                 OLD DRINKER
                        It had to happen sooner or later. 
                        How he survived so long...?
                            (raises glass)
                        Good luck to Hell!

           Then a hush falls as Lucia walks through the square.  She
           looks calm, serene. 

           She buys some fruit, smiles at the owner of the stall. 
           The men look to each other.

                                 YOUNG DRINKER
                        Can he be alive? -

           A JOURNALIST 

           sits in a car, points a long lens camera at Lucia.  Snaps.

           EXT. TABAC, OLETTA - DAY

           On the newspaper rack:  

           LE CORSE MATIN:  FRONT PAGE PHOTO OF LUCIA.  HEADLINE: 
           BEAUTY CAUGHT IN BLOOD FEUD.  DEATH TOLL RISES AS LOUIS
           MALDINI SLAUGHTERED.

           INT. LUCIA'S NEW FARM - NIGHT

           The toddler sleeps.  But Lucia lies there awake, looking
           awful, drained by the effort of publicly pretending he's
           alive when she has no idea.

           Then there's a flutter.  She sits up.  On the window sill,
           the pigeon has landed, a message wrapped around its leg.

           Lucia's spirit soars, her prayers answered. 
           EXT. ROADS - DAY

           Clement drives Lucia up the island.  She looks resolved,
           re-invigorated.  The toddler plays in the back...   

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           Holding the toddler's hand, Lucia walks through a room of
           men.  In the back, the only diner is a grizzled man with
           a mustache, elegantly dressed.  He looks up at her, his
           brow furrowing at the sight of the kid.

                                 LUCIA
                        Don Giorgio.  Thank you for seeing
                        me.

           He considers her.

                                 DON GIORGIO
                        You want someone to take the child?

           She shakes her head.  

                                 LUCIA
                        He won't disturb us.

                                 DON GIORGIO
                        Sit.  I have an idea why you are
                        here.  You want some of my men to
                        help protect your husband? 

                                 LUCIA
                        You are as wise as I expected.

           He lets this temerity pass.

                                 DON GIORGIO
                        Why should I get involved?

                                 LUCIA
                        Because Sauveur is a thorn in Don
                        Marco's side.  And Don Marco has
                        ambitions here in Bastia.

           Don Giorgio hides his surprise, as is his way.

                                 DON GIORGIO
                        How do you know this?

                                 LUCIA
                        I get to hear what the women say. 
                        Wives, mistresses...

           The Don reconsiders her.

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DON GIORGIO
                        I've heard about you.  Your
                        husband, he's just a killer, a
                        good one I hear - But you ...

           He ponders.

                                 LUCIA
                        I love my husband.

                                 DON GIORGIO
                        But now you have a child to love
                        more.

                                 LUCIA
                            (re: child)
                        If my husband dies, this one will
                        follow.

           He ponders.

                                 DON GIORGIO
                        My mother was like you, God rest
                        her soul.  

           Lucia looks back at him evenly.

           EXT. VINEYARD - EVENING

           Marco stands among the vines in the dusk.  One of his men
           is walking away from him and Marco looks like he's just
           heard very bad news.  We've never seen him this agitated.

           He sees a car arrive.  Augostino gets out with a couple
           of other men.  Looks this way.  A crisis meeting.

           Marco steels himself.

           INT. KITCHEN, HOUSE AT VINEYARD - EVENING

           Augostino sits at the kitchen table, his back to the door. 
           Knocking back grappa.  Readying himself for his next shot. 
           His cohorts are on edge, uncomfortable.

           He hears Marco come in.

                                 AUGOSTINO
                        She has brought the Castellinis
                        in.  What are you going to do
                        about it?  

                                 MARCO
                        I have a plan.

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 AUGOSTINO
                        No more plans.  This is about
                        showing force.  And we are not
                        going to be led by a man with no
                        blood on his hands.

           BANG!

           Augostino's brains spray across the table and he slumps
           dead.

           Marco holds the gun.  And now there is blood on his hands.

           His eyes meet those of the others, who have seen this
           coming.

           Ugo nods, measured, respectful.

           EXT. HILLS - DAY

           Stew simmers on a camping stove.  Sauveur is sharing a
           JOINT with Clement, looking out to the distant sea.  A
           couple of BODYGUARDS (Don Giorgio Castellini's men) we
           haven't seen before keep lookout, cradling shotguns. 
           Another is unloading the supplies that Clement has driven
           up here.

                                 CLEMENT
                            (low)
                        So what are these guys like?

                                 SAUVEUR
                            (shrugs)
                        Someone to talk to.  We play cards.

                                 CLEMENT
                        You trust them?

                                 SAUVEUR
                        What choice do I have?  It was
                        all her idea.

           Clement snorts a laugh.  What an understatement.

                                 CLEMENT
                        Yeah.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Tell her I want a visit.  
                            (leans in)
                        Or I'm gonna turn homo with these
                        guys.

           They both burst out laughing.

                        That would show her, heh?

           He roars with high laughter.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. FLOWER STALL - DAY

           ON LUCIA'S FACE,

           unsmiling as Clement stops by to deliver the message.  He
           thinks it's hilarious.

                                 CLEMENT
                        You needed to be there I guess. 
                        No need to shoot the messenger!

           A car door slams across the street - someone comes toward
           them -  

           ANNA is a little unsteady on her feet, and not as well
           presented as she usually is.  She carries that NEWSPAPER
           with Lucia's photo on the cover.

                                 ANNA
                        You killed him.

           Clement turns, uncertain how dangerous this is - does she
           have a gun?  Lucia SHOUTS to the guys on the flower stall:

                                 LUCIA
                        Janvier!

           The toddler is bundled away.  Anna is oblivious:

                                 ANNA
                        You were never my friend.  I
                        trusted you.

           She throws the newspaper at her. 

                                 ANNA
                        And you just wanted his blood.

           She dives at Lucia.  They struggle, she scratches Lucia's
           face.  The two women crash into the stall of flowers.  An
           explosion of color, flying in all directions.  The women
           disappear into the chaos until Clement pulls Anna off
           Lucia. 

                                 ANNA
                        You destroyed my life.  You did!  

           Lucia clambers up, in shock.  Clement bundles Anna to her
           car.

                        She is worse than any of them.

                                 LUCIA
                        NO!  I have my family!  I am his
                        wife!

           She shakes.  We haven't seen her like this before.

           People nearby make themselves scarce, don't want to catch
           her eye.

           THE UNION CORSE WATCH FOB SWAYS

           Marco walks toward Lucia's farm.   

           A couple of heavies are just behind Marco.  One of Lucia's
           sentinels is on a radio, he's already warned everyone
           inside the building.  It's tense.  Will there be killing?

           Lucia opens the door, holding her son's hand.  She hands
           him to a nanny, who takes him away swiftly.  Anna's
           scratches are visible on her face, despite the make-up. 

           INT. LUCIA'S NEW FARM - DAY

           Marco looks out to the fields.  They're alone together.

                                 MARCO
                        You've done well.

                                 LUCIA
                        I'd like to say the same for you.

                                 MARCO
                        You said Sauveur would make me
                        boss.

           She shrugs - maybe not a memory she wants to revisit?  He
           senses this.

                                 MARCO
                        You remember that night?  Of
                        course, you were just leading me
                        on.  To keep me thinking I had a
                        chance.  Yes?

                                 LUCIA
                        - What do you want?

                                 MARCO
                        Or was it real?  Did you really
                        want me for a moment there?

           He has moved in close, full of angry desire.  She glares
           up at him, trying to hide her fear.

                                 LUCIA
                        How could I ever want you?  A
                        mafia man!  Your kind drove my
                        father to kill himself!

                        You hate the mafia - but you've
                        created your own one right here. 

           She stares at him, for his temerity in stating the unspoken
           truth.

                                 MARCO
                        Don't you see how you've used
                        Sauveur?  How you use everyone?

           To even consider this would be weakness.

                                 MARCO
                        You befriended that simple stupid
                        woman, just so you could plan my
                        uncle's murder...

                        No!  I had to know!

           He moves away, strained by a grief he hasn't yet faced up
           to:

                                 MARCO
                        Louis was good to me.

           She stares at his turned back.  Does he want her comfort?

                                 LUCIA
                        Why don't you have a woman that
                        you can share this with?

           And even as she says it, and his neck stiffens - she
           apprehends the answer:  he loves her still?

                                 LUCIA
                        I see.

                        Am I so foolish?

           After a dangerous hesitation...

                                 LUCIA
                        ...Of course you are.

           He turns, serious, searching her face.

                        stop to it all.  For Sauveur's sake.

           He grabs hold of her.  Tormented.  He wants her.  Her
           defiance infuriates him yet makes him want her more.  He
           loves her and he hates her.  Then he gets control of
           himself, and remembers what he came here to say.

                                 MARCO
                        It's not that simple.  I have to
                        keep my people onside.  There has
                        to be proof that it will not

                        in the hills. 

           Lucia nods slowly.

                                 LUCIA
                        He will.

                        And he must not respond to what

                        What ... happens now?

           She looks at him questioningly.  Is he going to force
           himself on her?  He sees this flash before her.  Is that
           what she really wants?

                                 MARCO
                        Don't worry.  It's not you.

           She frowns.  What the hell does he mean?

           INT. CLEMENT'S PLACE - DAY

           An unlit JOINT waits on a plate.

           Careful hands remove the inner sleeve from an extravagant
           gatefold LP.  DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.

           CLEMENT lovingly blows the surface of the vinyl, carefully
           places it on the super-chic Bang & Olufsen deck.

           He presses buttons and the special parallel tracking arm
           selects the third track in.  'GREAT GIG IN THE SKY'.  A
           lyrical then ominous piano build-up as Clement lights the
           joint, anticipating aural ecstasy -

           As the track's mordant female moan grows in intensity,
           Clement closes his eyes, communed with the ineffable...

           The door is suddenly smashed off its hinges.  In they walk.

           Clement goes for his gun but a bullet knocks him back. 
           Then they go to town - they shoot him fifty times.  Job
           done.

           As the dust settles one of the killers moves to the hi-tech
           hi-fi, peers at it with some bemusement as the moaning

           can see Lucia on the terrace, watching him.  Her child is
           brought back to her.  

           Ugo, in the passenger seat, holds his radio to his ear:

           Lucia takes a phone call.  Her eyes close tight as she
           hears the dreadful news of Clement.  She lets out a dreadful
           howl and collapses, inconsolable, hysterical.  It's all
           just too much.  Through her tears, she looks to the others
           who are just staring at her, unsure what to do:

           TWO well-dressed boys are playing demurely with plastic

                        This is because of what you've
                        read about my family -?

                                 HEADMASTER
                        Of course not.  I mean... I am
                        aware ...

           He trails off, embarrassed.

                                 LUCIA
                        I'd do anything for my boys.  You
                        understand that?  This is the
                        best school - a beautiful school. 
                        They need this.  To change their
                        lives.  Please.

           The headmaster knows he's on dangerous ground here, but:

           CONTINUED:

                                 HEADMASTER
                        I'm sorry.  We have no space.

                                 LUCIA
                        No, no, you're not understanding
                        me...

           Is this a threat?  The sudden surprising intensity of her
           need for this could make it seem so:

                                 HEADMASTER
                            (stands)
                        Bullying is something all
                        schoolmasters understand.  

           She stares back at him, only now understanding that he
           thinks she was threatening him.

           EXT. ROADS - DAY

           Lucia is driven away, hurt, angry, silent.

           EXT. TAVERN, HILLSIDE VILLAGE - DAY

           On a terrace, Sauveur and two men are dining.

           An old man hurries past the place, clearly afraid. 

           The eyes of Sauveur's bodyguards are on him, positioned
           at either end of the stretch of road bordering the
           restaurant.  A couple of guys also sit on the hillside
           above the restaurant.

           The BMW slows by one sentinel, is waved through, draws up
           at the restaurant.  Lucia gets out.  

           INT. BAR, HILLSIDE VILLAGE

           Sauveur takes a seat opposite Lucia in a nook by the fire. 

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Where are the boys?

                                 LUCIA
                        They won't be coming anymore. 
                        Too dangerous.

           This hits Sauveur hard.

                                 LUCIA
                        And this headmaster needs to see
                        he was wrong...  Perhaps - I don't
                        know -

           CONTINUED:

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Wait.  You want me to - what? 
                        Beat up a teacher -?- because he
                        doesn't want a bandit's kids mixing
                        with decent people's children? 
                        Don't you think he might have a
                        point about the type of people we
                        are?  Or we've become?

                                 LUCIA
                        We're on our own, Sauveur.  No-
                        one's going to help us.  We have
                        to do everything ourselves.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        I may be nothing more than... 
                            (he won't say 'an animal')
                        ...But you can't send me in any
                        direction just to make a point!  I
                        don't want to hurt people anymore.   

           Lucia looks at him. 

                                 LUCIA
                        You can't just retire.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Why not - ?

                                 LUCIA
                        - What, so we move to another
                        part of the island?  Sell up? 
                        Try and teach the kids ourselves?

                                 SAUVEUR
                            (explodes)
                        Listen to me!

           She sees that ferocity that has helped him survive.  She
           quietens, waits.  

                                 SAUVEUR
                        We sell up?  Yes.  We take the
                        money we've made.  Good money. 
                        More than maybe we deserve.  
                        Then... we leave the island.  Go
                        somewhere - Toulouse, maybe, get
                        a farm, start afresh.  

                                 LUCIA
                        Leave Corsica?  Leave our home? 
                        No.  You've been up there too
                        long - we have our position to
                        protect.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        - You're right.

                                 SAUVEUR (CONT'D)
                            (long beat, quiet)
                        I have been up here too long.

           Beat.  She stands.  Says nothing.  

                                 SAUVEUR
                        I want to see my sons.  

           Without a word, she leaves.  Pissed off, Sauveur stares
           after her. 

           EXT. SQUARE, OLETTA - DAY

           A normal spring day, life goes on as usual, a few cars,
           the baker's van, the corpses of pigs are shouldered into
           the butcher's...

           And then there's a stir.  Heads turn.  Several tough-
           looking men are taking seats at the cafe.  In their midst
           is SAUVEUR.

           He makes no effort to disguise himself.  He's been
           drinking, and his bodyguards are wary of him:  this trip
           is obviously his idea and they're not too happy.

           The Waiter comes up nervously.  Sauveur acts normal, but
           is acutely aware this commonplace little ritual is now a
           luxury he can no longer enjoy.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Ciao.  Brandy, all round.  And
                        for yourself.

           He feels the Waiter's eyes linger involuntarily on his
           scarred face.  But he is not angry.  He is after all, a
           living legend.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        You want my autograph or something?

           The guy hurries away, to the amusement of the bodyguards.

           Sauveur looks around the square, a place he knew so well. 
           The others watch as a couple of men (must be Marco's) get
           up and leave. 

                                 BODYGUARD
                        This is stupid, Sauveur.

           Sauveur doesn't answer.  The drinks arrive. 

                                 SAUVEUR
                            (holding his gaze)
                        Drink up my friend.

           CONTINUED:

           And as Sauveur downs it, we see the need he has for escape
           and oblivion.

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           Marco is going over some accounts when the two men from
           the square arrive, with a look on their faces.  Marco
           stands.

           EXT. SQUARE, OLETTA - LATER

           Sauveur looks up to see a car stop.  Marco and several
           bodyguards get out.

           On both sides - hands in pockets, nursing concealed weapons.

           WITH MARCO:

           Ugo holds his arm -

                                 UGO 
                        This is no good.

           Marco can't take his eyes off Sauveur, staring back at him.

           SAUVEUR 

           motions his men to leave his side.  Reluctantly, they
           withdraw.  Sauveur nods to Marco.

                                 MARCO
                            (to Ugo)
                        Keep away from them.

           He walks forward and joins Sauveur at the table.

           They consider each other.  Marco in his smart suit,
           controlled, groomed.  Sauveur a scarred peasant - but
           with a panther's presence.  His big rough hands pour a
           drink for Marco...  Finally:

                                 SAUVEUR
                        It's funny the little things you
                        miss.

                                 MARCO
                        So, you've had enough.

           Sauveur looks at him and then starts laughing.

                                 SAUVEUR
                            (through laughter)
                        Oh yes, you could say that. 
                            (then, soberly:  )
                        Hasn't everyone?

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Marco nods.  Then aware of watching eyes.  The whole town
           has gone silent.  Focused on this meeting.

                                 SAUVEUR
                            (detached, curious)
                        Do you think ... there's any way,
                        we both can live?

           Marco stares back at him.  That tells Sauveur enough.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        I thought not.  I've been out of
                        touch, you see.

                                 MARCO
                        Sauveur.  You can leave, and keep
                        going.

           Sauveur pours himself another drink, knocks it back, looks
           Marco in the eye, with fire in his own.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        I should have killed you at the
                        docks.

                                 MARCO
                        You're not like that.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Is that why you're sitting there? 
                        Because you think you know I won't
                        kill you?

                                 MARCO
                        Have you come to die?

           Sauveur realizes something about himself, and nods.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        By your hand alone.

           Marco is on the spot, aware of his watching men.

                                 SAUVEUR
                        This has to end.

           Then, with warmth - the friend, the co-conspirator:  

                                 SAUVEUR
                        Let's go together.  Go the way we
                        should?

           He sees shock in Marco's eyes.  Disgusted, Sauveur shakes
           his head and stands - Marco's men pull their pistols -
           matched by Sauveur's -  

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                 SAUVEUR
                        A true friend would know what to
                        do.

           Sauveur is not scared.  He looks back at the gunmen and
           sees their fear in his presence.  He puts his arms out
           and HOWLS:

                                 SAUVEUR
                        WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ALL OF
                        YOU!?

           His shout ECHOES around the streets.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           MARCO IS DRIVEN IN A CAR.  HE LOOKS DEVASTATED, A MAN WHO
           HAS LOST.  HIS BODYGUARDS KNOW HE BLEW IT. 

           He makes a decision.  Taps Ugo on the shoulder.

                                 MARCO
                        Arrange a meet with Don Giorgio. 
                        Tonight.

           INT. LUCIA'S FARM - EVENING

           Lucia reacts to the news of Sauveur's appearance in town,
           utterly shocked.  She withdraws from the others, 

           TO ANOTHER ROOM, 

           And we stay with her as she makes a decision.

           She moves to her desk, takes a pen and some writing paper.

           CLOSE ON PAPER as she writes:

           DEAREST SAUVEUR, I HEARD ABOUT TODAY,

           WE HEAR HER VOICE, TENDER, SINCERE:

                                 LUCIA (V.O.)
                        And now I know you were right,
                        and it's time to go.  I will find
                        us somewhere, away from here,
                        where we can be together as we
                        wanted, that lifetime ago.

           EXT. LUCIA'S FARM - NEXT MORNING 

           With a perky, hopeful look on her face, Lucia comes out,
           beckons over a young lad.  Hands him an envelope.  We
           don't hear what is being said.
           EXT. ROADS - DAY

           The boy rides a Vespa along a road leading into the
           mountains...

           INT. LUCIA'S FARM - DAY

           Lucia leafs through the property listings in a French
           newspaper.  She circles an advertisement:  a small black
           and white photograph shows a modest but charming farmhouse
           with 3,000 HECTARES.  Lucia smiles. 

           EXT. INN IN HILLS - DAY

           A sentinel ushers a car past, it pulls up by the side of
           the inn.  A large guy gets out, is heading into the house,
           just as the Vespa arrives.  The young rider is recognized
           and allowed past the sentinel.  

           The messenger parks in front of the house, some yards
           from the car.  Then he notices the guy who went in the
           house has reappeared out the back.

           He frowns, wondering why the guy is heading away from the
           house.  The guy dips, start running low, away up a hill...

           The boy shoots a look to the car the guy just left.  Then
           to Sauveur through the window by the car, playing cards
           in the kitchen.

           The boy takes a quick breath, about to shout warning to
           Sauveur.  As if connected to him, Sauveur turns to look
           out at him as -

           KABOOM!  The car explodes.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           ANTOINE IN AN OFFICE, HEARS THE DULL BOOM

           MARCO GETTING IN HIS CAR, HEARS IT ECHO, TURNS TO THE
           MAQUIS.

           WORKERS ON LUCIA'S FARM HAVE HEARD IT.

           LUCIA LOOKS OUT OF THE WINDOW.  FEAR IN HER EYES. 

           BACK TO:

           Dazed and cut, the messenger boy struggles to his feet,
           having been thrown yards by the blast.  The kitchen has
           been destroyed.  Nobody inside could have survived.
           INT. LUCIA'S FARM - NIGHT

           The messenger boy stands before Lucia as she supports
           herself against the door frame to the house.  The boy is
           bloodied, clothes mussed up.  

           Behind in the field, several old women are crying.  But
           Lucia isn't wailing like them.  She is numb, dead. 

           EXT. OLETTA - DAY

           SHOTS OF:

           AN OLD WOMAN TYING A WHITE BEDSHEET TO HER BALCONY. 

           ANOTHER VILLAGER DOES THE SAME THING.

           YET ANOTHER DRAGS A SHEET THROUGH HER APARTMENT, HANGS IT
           OVER HER BALCONY.

           An old man is watering his tomatoes.  It is the Chief of
           Police, now retired.  He looks up and sees more and more
           white sheets being draped up.  He wells up, sad and yet
           proud.  He disappears inside and is soon unfurling a sheet
           over his balcony... 

           The streets are suddenly full of white sheets hanging
           from the balconies.  It's an amazing sight.  The whole
           town in mourning for Sauveur.  

           MARCO'S CAR 

           pulls up at the edge of town.  He watches from the back
           seat.  Shakes his head slightly in wonderment.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Sauveur's coffin is lowered into the ground.

           Mariuccia, Lucia and the rest of town in attendance.  Her
           two sons seem devoid of emotion, confused by it all. 
           Lucia is still just a drained husk, a shadow of the
           assertive woman she had become.  More than one concerned
           glance in her direction.

           MARCO IS IN HIS CAR  

           He sits watching from a distance.  Not pleased about what
           he has achieved.  But his authority strengthened by it.

           ANTOINE

           walks up the graveyard path, moves through the throng. 
           Lucia eyes him, unseeing.  He can't manage a smile.
           INT. LUCIA'S FARM - NIGHT

           As Lucia steps through the door, weighed down with grief,
           several of the men are pulling off their jackets and
           loading shotguns.  Not your normal funeral wake.

                                 COUSIN MAX
                        They'll be the next target.

           He means the boys, who are watching but not understanding.  

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        The boys should go away.  We must
                        hide them.

           A quiet voice surprises them.

                                 LUCIA
                        No.  That's not the way.

           A look between the others - she hasn't said much since
           Sauveur's death. 

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        What then?

                                 LUCIA
                        I will sort this out.

           INT. BEDROOM, LUCIA'S FARM - NIGHT

           Lucia sits in front of the mirror.  She composes herself. 
           Unzips her makeup bag.  Begins to make herself up.  An
           empowering ritual. 

           She slips into a tight skirt, smoothes down the material. 
           Checks her reflection again.  It's as if she's going on a
           date.  Or putting on her armor.

           She notices Mariuccia watching from the doorway.  The
           older woman knows what she is going to do.

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        You will be hated by everyone.

                                 LUCIA
                        ...Including you? 

                                 MARIUCCIA
                        The boys' safety is all that matters.
           EXT. CAR, FARM - NIGHT

           Lucia helps her two boys into the car.  She gets in, fires
           the engine, drives away...

           EXT. OLETTA - NIGHT

           Lucia drives along a street lined with sheets draped from
           balconies, the fabric tinted blue by the moon... 

           EXT. MARCO'S VINEYARD - NIGHT

           Lucia stands beside the car.  Her children watch confused
           as she is patted down by Ugo.  Then the boys themselves
           are searched.

           Marco stands by the front door, watching.

           She heads towards him.  He steps aside as she walks in,
           holding her sons' hands.  Resigned.  Proud.  Beautiful.

           Marco follows them in.

           His men look to each other.  No-one can believe this.

           INT. BEDROOM, MARCO'S VINEYARD - NIGHT

           The two, pliant boys are in a bed.  Lucia tenderly kisses
           them both good night.  

                                 LUCIA
                        This will be our new home.  So
                        much to explore tomorrow.  Sleep
                        now.

           Marco watches from the doorway.  Mesmerized by this woman.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM, MARCO'S VINEYARD - NIGHT

           Lucia strips in the moonlit room. 

           Marco watches.  Her eyes slowly rise to meet his.  He
           can't hold back any longer.  He comes to her.  They kiss.

           Then she slaps him.  He pulls her to him, kisses her again. 
           She struggles ... then kisses him fiercely.  

           They collapse onto the bed.
           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - DAY

           Lucia walks down the street carrying a shopping bag.  An
           old woman spits at her.  She doesn't react, just brushes
           the spittle from her clothes...

           UP AHEAD - SHEETS BLOW ACROSS THE SQUARE, DIRTY, TORN...

           INT. MARCO'S VINEYARD - DAY

           Trunks are being carried to the main house from a couple
           of cars.  Lucia, inside the house, watches them being
           brought in.

                                 MARCO
                        The boys will get only the best. 
                        They're my sons now. 

           EXT. MARCO'S VINEYARD - DAY

           Lucia rides a horse.  Marco rides alongside her.  A
           handsome couple, on handsome steeds.  They slow as they
           reach a car parked on the borders of the vineyard. 

           Inside, Ugo eyes her with barely concealed contempt.

                                 MARCO
                        The families have been joined. 
                        The war is over.  Understand?

           Ugo hesitates before nodding assent.  Lucia rides away. 
           Marco digs in his heels, follows.

           INT. BEDROOM, VINEYARD - NIGHT

           Lucia and Marco kissing in bed.  As Marco gets more
           passionate, she breaks away.

                                 LUCIA
                        No, I don't... feel right.

           She turns away from him.  He is surprised.  History repeats.

                                 LUCIA
                            (beat)
                        Who betrayed Sauveur?  One of Don
                        Giorgio's men?

           Marco won't answer.  Somehow he knew this would come,
           though he hoped not.

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCIA
                        I need to know that whoever did
                        it is dead.  

                                 MARCO
                            (beat)
                        I understand.  It can be arranged.

           Propped on an elbow, he traces her proud, strong, desirable
           back.  

                                 LUCIA
                        A strong man would take care of
                        it himself.

           She's impossible.  

                                 MARCO
                        How can you doubt my manhood?

                                 LUCIA
                        I was married to quite a man.

           He slumps back onto the pillow, looking at the ceiling...

           She turns around to face him and he sees she is now holding
           a small purple medicine bottle:

                                 LUCIA
                        They need to die in pain. 

           EXT. MARCO'S VINEYARD - DAY

           Marco works on the vines, but something's troubling him. 
           Bids Ugo to come over.

           INT. RESTAURANT, HILLSIDE VILLAGE - DAY

           Marco and Ugo are sitting in a small restaurant when two
           men enter, join them.  These are two of the bodyguards
           Giorgio provided for Sauveur's protection.

                                 MARCO
                        After this you should disappear for
                        a while.  Introductions are being
                        arranged in Marseilles.  Your reward
                        for helping end this war.

           Marco makes a fuss of pouring a glass for each of them
           from a carafe.  He raises his glass.

                                 MARCO
                        To the peace you helped bring.

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BODYGUARD
                            (raising glass)
                        And the money we made - for our
                        wives.

                                 MARCO
                            (laughs)
                        Of course. 

           The waiter brings menus then a look from Marco sends him
           away.  The men drink...

           And their agony begins. 

           Now we see the rest of the restaurant is empty.  Marco
           and Ugo push their chairs back, step away, watching with
           some disgust.  

           The two bodyguards fall to the floor, clutching their
           throats, their chests...  As they writhe about, their
           feet kick out at tables, chairs... 

           INT. KITCHEN/SITTING ROOM, HOUSE, VINEYARD - NIGHT

           The purple medicine bottle is placed on the kitchen table. 
           Marco goes through to 

           THE SITTING ROOM

                                 MARCO
                        I did as you wished.  They're dead.

           She comes to him, pulls him to her, kisses him fiercely.

           INT. BEDROOM, HOUSE, VINEYARD - NIGHT

           Dead of night.  Lucia is careful not to disturb Marco as
           she slips out of bed.

           EXT. CAR - HOUSE, VINEYARD - NIGHT

           A CAR ENGINE SPLUTTERS.  Lucia turns the key again, her
           sons - scared - watch as she PRAYS for it to start.  

           INT. BEDROOM, HOUSE, VINEYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Marco stirs as the engine coughs in the night...  Then he
           slumps asleep, all spent.
           INT. HOUSE, OLETTA - NIGHT

           A door opens - Lucia stands there looking at a very tired
           Antoine.  She's just woken him.

           INT. KITCHEN, ANTOINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Antoine on the phone.  The medicine bottle in an evidence
           bag.  Lucia's arms around her sons.

           EXT. ANTOINE'S CAR, ARMY CHECKPOINT - NIGHT

           Antoine drives Lucia and her boys into an army base...  

           INT./EXT. VINEYARD - DAWN

           Marco opening doors...

                                 MARCO
                        Lucia?

           He peers into a couple of rooms:  no sign of her or the
           boys.  He moves into the kitchen - looks to where the
           medicine bottle had stood.  The incriminating evidence! 
           He races to the trash can, looks inside.  Rummages in the
           hope of finding it. 

           But in his heart he knows...

           Then - through the window:  POLICE CARS stream up the
           drive to the house.  

           THE SOUND OF GUNFIRE.  A police car drifts off the drive,
           smashes through a fence - 

           UGO

           shooting from the vines.

           POLICE RETURNING FIRE 

           shredding the vines.  Ugo is blown to hell.

           MARCO 

           moves to a dresser, opens the drawer - a sawn-off SHOTGUN. 
           But something else in the drawer arrests him -

           He picks up the WEDDING PHOTOGRAPH.  SAUVEUR, LUCIA AND
           MARCO, young and happy.  Everything goes still and silent. 
           He leaves the shotgun where it is, mesmerized by the photo. 
           He slumps down at the kitchen table, holding the photo.   

                                                      (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           And through his tears he smiles at Sauveur's image.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. ARMORED CAR, COURTS, BASTIA - DAY

           Lucia applies her make-up.  Light streams in as the doors
           of the armored car open.  

           She readies herself.  Puts on dark glasses.  Steps into
           the light.  Composed.  All emotion suppressed. 

           The sound of HELICOPTER ROTORS overhead.  Lots of armed
           POLICE OFFICERS.  The highest security for this trial.

           Crowds watch from behind a cordon.  Lucia briefly locks
           eyes on a small child holding an ALIEN BALLOON.  She
           doesn't smile, just keeps going... 

           FADE DOWN

                                   Superimpose:

                    On Lucia's evidence, Marco received a life
                 sentence for killing Sauveur's assassins.  After
                 serving three years for her part in the murders,
                  Lucia moved away with her sons, to live under a
                                 new name.

           FADE UP:

           EXT. CAR, COAST ROAD, TRAVELING - NIGHT

           MUTE, MUSIC OVER:

           An open-top Fiat SPORTS CAR swoops along the coastal road.

           Marco behind the wheel, his friend Sauveur in the passenger
           seat.  In back, Lucia, Clement and Antoine.  Meandering
           behind on his Vespa, Janvier with his birdcage.  The gang
           feel great.

           Lucia relishes the night air in her hair...

           FADE DOWN AND ROLL CREDITS

                                   - THE END -
