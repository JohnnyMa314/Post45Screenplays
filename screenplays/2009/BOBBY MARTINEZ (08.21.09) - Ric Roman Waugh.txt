                                                            OVER BLACK:

           A thunderous liquid explosion...  Pounding...  Rumbling...        

           EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - SANTA BARBARA, CA - DUSK

           Remnants of the sun have left a fire red sky -- silhouetting 
           a FEW SURFERS bobbing in the undulating tide.  Enjoying an 
           epic sunset and the last of a tranquil So Cal beach day.

           A six-foot wall of water rises from the powerful ocean behind 
           them.  Two of the surfers paddle hard and drop into the wave  
           -- carving at break-neck speed down the face -- adrenaline 
           pumping -- the rush is what it’s all about.

           ON SHORE

           Blankets of foamy water surge onto the pristine beach -- 
           wiping away evidence of the day's activities.  Including the 
           trailing footprints of a LONE COUPLE walking along the shore.   

           A FIT JOGGER overtakes them -- heading up the beach.  iPod 
           strapped to his muscular arm -- keeping at pace with the   
           pop song JAMMING in his headphones.  As he veers up the soft 
           sand toward the boardwalk, enjoying his run -- suddenly --

           The sound of SCREECHING TIRES overtakes the music, scaring 
           the shit out of him -- his eyes dart toward the street, and 
           WE WHIP PAN TO --

           CABRILLO BLVD

           Honking horns.  Smoking rubber.  Panicked ONLOOKERS.  One car 
           REAR-ENDS another.  Followed by a SECOND COLLISION in the 
           opposite direction.  An instant 4-lane traffic jam.  Then the 
           cause comes into view -- racing through the vehicular mess --

           FREDDY, a 13 year old Hispanic pee wee with tangled black 
           hair, face dripping in sweat, runs as fast as his wiry legs 
           will take him.  Scared shitless.  Not of the near death 
           experience of barreling into the speeding traffic, but of the 
           HORDE right behind him!

           SIX HISPANIC GANGBANGERS and a CHOLA (all in their 20s) blast 
           through the log jam -- in pursuit -- jumping over hoods, 
           darting through cars -- malice in their hardened stares.

           Freddy tightly clutches a cell phone to his ear as if it were 
           his last life-line.  It is...

                                 FREDDY
                             (into his cell)
                        They’re right on top of me, Bobby!
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ (O.S.)
                             (over cell)
                        -- just keep going, we’ll be there!

           Freddy glances back fearfully at the pack gaining inch by 
           inch, SHOUTING THREATS.  He charges through a grass area and 
           into the near-vacant beach parking lot -- looking for 
           salvation -- but he finds no one.  

           The gangbangers nearly have him in their grasp -- Freddy 
           knows he’s a goner -- until BASS-THUMPING HIP HOP rushes 
           toward us, and then --

           A ‘74 CONVERTIBLE VW BEETLE

           Screeches up.  Top down, black on black, lowered with Dayton 
           rims.  Beats BLASTING.  But more importantly -- the cavalry 
           inside --

           A MUSCULAR BRAWLER (20) jumps out -- eyes intense.  Head 
           shaved.  Body inked.  A product of the streets and the beach.  

           Meet BOBBY MARTINEZ. 

           He’s followed by CRUISER (21), EDDIE (20) and ANGELA (19).  
           All Hispanic as well.  They charge into the fray --

           A CHISELED RIVAL BANGER starts to pummel Freddy, but Bobby 
           tackles the rival to the ground -- their bare knees and 
           elbows shredding on asphalt.  As Bobby mounts the banger and 
           starts to drill him with lefts and rights --

           The parking lot turns into a fierce MINI-RIOT --

           SERIES OF FRENETIC CUTS:  

           Bobby’s crew battling.  Fighting hard with lesser numbers.  
           Yet no one is backing down.  Fighting two at a time.  Taking 
           their licks.  Whatever it takes.  They’re used to this.

           ANGELA

           With her black hair pulled back into a ponytail, muscular 
           with a sexy tomboy build -- she takes a shot to the eye from 
           the RIVAL CHOLA.  A gash opens -- bleeds.  

           Angela just drills her right back -- fists flying -- doesn’t 
           see the HEAVY-SET DUDE bum rushing her from the side --

           But Bobby does --

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        On your left, Ange!
           Bobby lurches forward, putting himself in the path of the 
           heavy-set dude to save Angela -- gets hammered to the ground  
           -- starts taking a flurry of punches to the face --

           Angela continues to fight the Chola:

                                 ANGELA
                        Beat his ass, primo!

           Somehow, Bobby gets out from under the heavy-set dude and 
           with a hard right, he knocks the dude senseless.  But doesn’t 
           see the wild kick coming -- it rocks Bobby’s head sideways -- 
           and just like that, Bobby’s battling another RIVAL BANGER.

           ACROSS - IN THE MELEE

           The rest of the crew still got their hands full.  Cruiser 
           fights two-on-one.  Eddie gets smashed to the ground from 
           behind, head hitting asphalt.  Beyond them, Freddy is getting 
           his ass handed to him by a POCK-MARKED RIVAL.  

           TIGHT ON - BOBBY

           Exhausted, still fighting -- sees his outnumbered crew is in 
           serious trouble.  Especially as a THICK MUSCLED RIVAL 
           brandishes a serrated locking knife --

           Bobby takes in the way the gangster holds the razor-sharp 
           blade -- he knows how to use it.  Eyes lethal.  

           Bobby bravely gets right in front of the gangster and 
           challenges him -- wanting to protect anyone in his crew   
           from being stabbed -- 

           ANGELA

           She’s never lost sight of Bobby.  Real concern in her eyes.

           BOBBY

           His adrenaline surges.  Focused.  Unarmed hands ready to 
           deflect the blade.  To counter and strike. 

           The gangster lunges forward -- slashes with the knife.   
           Bobby sidesteps the blade and hammer-fists him in the throat.  
           The gangster buckles, gasping.  

           Bobby shows no mercy -- knees him in the face.  Snatches the 
           dropped knife from the cracked asphalt.  Hovers over him --

           He could easily stab the gangster.  End his life.  But Bobby 
           doesn’t -- he’s not ready to take this further.

           Suddenly, a HELICOPTER is heard overhead -- its intense 
           spotlight cuts through the near dark sky like a light saber.
           WIDER

           The combatants see SANTA BARBARA POLICE CARS rushing in.  
           COPS get out, SHOUTING.  Guns drawn.  

           Everyone takes off --

           Bobby grabs Angela to bolt.  But first, Angela shoots a 
           fierce look at the Chola she just beat up.  The girl stares 
           daggers right back. 

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Ange -- lets go!

           Angela jumps up and takes off with Bobby.  Both on the run.  
           TWO COPS give chase on foot --

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           A quick intense foot chase.  Through alleys.  Cutting between 
           houses.  Over backyard fences.  The cops right behind.  Bobby 
           always making sure Angela’s with him.  But she has no problem 
           keeping up -- a product of the streets also.  

           Finally -- they lose the two cops.

           BEHIND A STORE

           Bobby and Angela.  Breathing hard.  Bent over, hands resting 
           on their knees.  Both show damage from the brawl.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (reaches for her face)
                        Lemme see.

           Angela bats his hand away.

                                 ANGELA
                        I’m fine.

           He gets a look at the nasty cut over her eye.  Blood smeared. 

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Yeah, so fine.

                                 ANGELA
                             (grins)
                        Shiiiiiit.  I cracked some off on 
                        that bitch.

           Bobby shakes his head and grins back.  His cousin is tough as 
           any dude in their clica.  She’s proven that.
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        I’m gonna “crack” Freddy's ass when 
                        I see him.

           Angela merely nods, never one to question Bobby’s call.    
           She knows he’s pissed. 

           EXT. WEST SIDE BARRIO - SANTA BARBARA, CA - NIGHT

           A lower income neighborhood, predominately Hispanic.  The  
           101 FWY roars loud on one side.  A dense hillside on the 
           opposite end cuts off any view of the Pacific Ocean.  Unless 
           we knew better, we’d have no idea we were in Santa Barbara. 

           The small houses and graffiti-ridden apartment buildings are 
           packed so close, the walls almost touch.  Wary eyes of all 
           ages stay on calm alert.  Sitting on porches.  Leaning 
           against second story railings.  Hanging on street corners.

           HOLD ON - A DETERIORATING CRAFTSMAN

           The windows are fogged with moisture as hip hop music pounds 
           through the walls.  A party is going off.

           TWO LATINAS (early 20s), strut across the street toward the 
           house.  Hair done.  Nails shining.  Tight-ass jeans and low 
           cut tops.  Stilletos.  As the girls walk inside, two other 
           figures emerge down the street -- 

           BOBBY AND ANGELA

           Walking.  Still filthy from the brawl.

                                 ANGELA
                             (hears the party)
                        Glad to see everyone’s so worried --

           Bobby shakes his head as they head onto the porch.  This is 
           their crew’s crash pad.  Whoever rented it to them was nuts.

           INT. CRASH PAD - CONTINUOUS

           The decibel level just raised a notch or two or ten.  Bobby 
           and Angela walk in -- a party’s in full effect.  The limited 
           furniture means more bodies per square inch. 

           Bobby is exhausted and hurting.  Would love some peace and 
           quiet, but rolls with it.

                                 ANGELA
                        Pisto?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        So thirsty I’m ready to double 
                        fist.
           Angela nods, heads to the kitchen.  Bobby only gets two steps 
           before Freddy rushes up -- adrenaline still pumping from the 
           brawl.  Eyes reddened from alcohol. 

                                 FREDDY
                        Man, I thought you guys got busted!  
                        That shit was so crazy -- 

           Bobby cuts him off, heated:

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        -- what’d I tell you about blazing 
                        tags in East Side?  In fact, I told 
                        you not to go there period, didn’t 
                        I?  You caused a full-on wreck, 
                        Freddy --

           CRUISER, a familiar face from the brawl walks up.  Some cuts 
           and scrapes on his wiry, chiseled frame.  Blunt dangling from 
           his lips.  Eyes locked on Freddy also.

                                 FREDDY
                        I wasn’t doing nothing, I swear.

           Bobby grabs Freddy's hand and turns it over.  His fingertips 
           are blue, covered in spray paint.  Busted.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Real stupid.  You represent this 
                        clica -- which means it was us.

                                 FREDDY
                        I’m sorry --

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        -- everything was all chilled, too.    
                        Now they’ll wanna retaliate.

           The 13 year old hangs his head.  Bobby stares at him.  
           Finally relents a bit -- has a real soft spot for this kid.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        No more drama, you hear me?  Or 
                        we’re all livin’ with tension...

                                 CRUISER
                             (chimes in)
                        ...and tension means heat, which 
                        means I ain’t earning...

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        ...which means we ain’t makin’ rent 
                        either, and you’re back to mowing 
                        lawns.  Got it?
                                 FREDDY
                        Simon.

           Cruiser flexes on Freddy.  He flinches.  Cruiser smacks him 
           hard three times in the arm.  Freddy grabs his arm in pain.

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        Damn, Cruiser.  Thought it was two 
                        for flinching!

                                 CRUISER
                        Three for lying.  Now get us some 
                        pistos, youngster.

           Freddy shakes his head, does as he’s told.  Bobby sighs, 
           watching him go.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Any one get hooked up?

                                 CRUISER
                        Naw, homie.  All’s good.  Just 
                        lickin’ some wounds, but that’s 
                        what mota’s for.

           Cruiser holds out his joint.  Bobby gladly takes it.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Definitely.  

           THE BACK ROOM

           More partying going on.  From behind, we see Angela 
           straddling a dude in a chair.  His head is tilted back, 
           squirming like he’s in pain -- 

                                 ANGELA
                        Stop, stupid!

           REVEAL - EDDIE, her boyfriend.  The lumped-up eye reminds us 
           that he was a combatant also.  He flinches as Angela holds an 
           ice cold beer on his skin, trying to relieve the swelling.   
           A moment, then she finally grins:

                                 ANGELA (CONT’D)
                        Start, stupid....

           Eddie grins back as she seductively kisses him -- he grabs 
           her ass and all bets are off.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ (O.S.)
                        Jesus, prima -- get a room already.  
           Angela and Eddie look over.  See Bobby and Cruiser hovering.  
           Fresh 40s locked in their grip now.  Bobby toasts her:

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and thanks for that beer...

                                 ANGELA
                        My bad.

           Angela simply goes back to making out with her man.      
           Bobby just shakes his head.

           SALAZAR “SOLID” DIAZ (26), a six-five 350 pound behemoth and 
           resident loafer, walks over.  Guards a 12-pack under his arm.  
           Not a scratch or bead of sweat on him.  That’s because Solid 
           was “absent” when the brawl happened.  As usual.  And yet, 
           still talks all bravado.  As usual.

                                 SOLID
                        Man if I was out there tonight, 
                        heads woulda rolled, ese.  Why 
                        didn’t you dudes hit up my cell?

                                 CRUISER
                        You had other things to handle, 
                        Solid.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Simon.  Bigger things.

           Bobby motions to the corner.  Everyone looks over and sees a 
           HEAVY-ASS LATINA taking up the sofa, hoarding a large bag of 
           Cool Ranch Doritos, sucking down a 40 like it was a slurpee.

                                 SOLID
                        Damn...she ain’t with me.

                                 HEAVY-ASS
                             (barks)
                        Solid!  Get me some dip, these
                        chips is dry as hell!

                                 SOLID
                        ...whatever...

           Everyone busts up.  Solid shakes his head, shrinks away.  

           TIGHT ON - BOBBY

           With his crew.  Everyone’s safe.  He’s happy.  A moment, then 
           Angela comes up next to him:

                                 ANGELA
                        Bet Rincon’s breaking.  Rip a 
                        midnight set?
           Bobby can’t believe what he’s hearing.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        You serious?  

                                 ANGELA
                        Salt water rinse do us good.

           Bobby looks at the dirt, grime and dried blood on his body.  
           Both of them grin.

           EXT. OCEAN - RINCON POINT - CARPINTERIA - NIGHT

           Under a canopy of clouds and the faint glow of moonlight... 
           Bobby and Angela sit on their boards just outside the break.  
           Her used surfboard is two-feet longer than Bobby’s short gun.  
           Both have wetsuits on.  Bobbing silently.  Shivering.  

                                 ANGELA
                        Nipples are hard as rocks.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        You kidding, it’s like a jacuzzi.

           Bobby splashes some frigid water on his face, acts like he 
           enjoys it. 

                                 ANGELA
                        Yeah right.

           Bobby laughs.  Angela anxiously looks out into the void. 

                                 ANGELA
                             (impatient)
                        I can’t see the set coming --

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Don’t need to.  Just listen for it.

           Bobby peers into the dark.  Ears tuned.  A relaxed smile on 
           his face now.  At peace.  Loves being out here.  His escape.

           The faintest sound of surging water.  Building...

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Hear it?

           BUILDING...

                                 ANGELA
                        Hear what?!

           Bobby slides down onto his belly, motions to Angela.
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        It’s coming.  Paddle next to me.

           Angela does with devoted trust.  Arms stroking like oars. 
           Side by side on their boards.  The tide starts to pull --

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Feel it --

                                 ANGELA
                             (excited)
                        Yeah --

           The swell surges.  Both rising on a liquid elevator.  
           Momentum picking up... faster... FASTER... 

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (over the wave’s roar)
                        Drop in and cut right!

           With expertise, Bobby drops into the wave.  Pops up with 
           ease.  Looks back, sees Angela mirroring his timing.  She 
           awkwardly gets up with a huge smile.  Rides next to him.

           NOTE:  All surf sequences/maneuvers throughout will be 
           designed and orchestrated by the real-life, Bobby Martinez. 

           Seeing Angela’s up, Bobby cuts hard with explosive force -- 
           creating momentum -- powerfully railing back and forth like a 
           skateboarder on a half-pipe.  He breaks up the crest, tail-
           kicks his board and catches some air -- feet glued to the 
           board -- lands back into the wave and races across the face.

           Bobby's got mad skills.  Raw.  Aggressive.  It’s just too bad 
           he doesn’t know what to do with this God-given talent.

           ANGELA

           Is just a novice, riding her long board straight down the 
           wave like Gidget.  Loving every precious second until she 
           falls into the foamy water.  Ride over, ready to go again.

           BOBBY 

           Skitters down the choppy wave to the end and kicks out.  
           Looks across at Angela reappearing over a swell.  All smiles.

           Angela HOLLERS out into the night.  Bobby LAUGHS, loving it.

           OVERHEAD - BIRD’S EYE VIEW

           The two alone in the moonlit surf.
           INT. CRASH PAD - MORNING

           A quite house.  Empty beer bottles, full ashtrays, a few 
           leftover bodies.  The aftermath to a successful night.

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sparse.  Simple mattress set.  Surf magazines stacked on an 
           old dresser.  What else do you need when you’re twenty?

           A body lies under the sheets.  A pillow covers the head.      
           No movement, until a slight stir.  Followed by a low moan.  

           Then Bobby bolts upright in bed -- panicked -- reddened eyes 
           adjusting as he glances at the clock.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Dammit -- 

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MONTECITO - DAY

           A wealthy community adorned with multi-million dollar homes.  
           A CONSTRUCTION CREW hangs drywall inside the skeleton of a 
           massive remodel.  Most are Hispanic.  Been at it all morning.

           DOWN THE STREET

           A ‘64 IMPALA rolls to a stop and parks.  Surfboard on top.  
           This is Bobby’s ride; a work-in-progress lowrider with black 
           primer for paint, sporting new chrome 22s and the ironic 
           barrage of surf stickers on tinted windows.

           Bobby gets out, glances at the job site -- wondering if 
           anyone saw him arrive.  He groans, rubbing his sore neck from 
           the fight.  A lumped-up bruise has formed on his cheekbone. 

           He grabs his tool belt in the trunk.  Slings it on over his 
           black Dickies and oversized shirt -- tries to enter the chain-
           link fence without being noticed.  But barely gets two steps -- 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey, glad you could join us --

           Bobby turns, sees MANNY (30s), the pot-bellied foreman, 
           eyeing him with a smirk.  Bobby looks like shit.

                                 MANNY
                             (has to laugh)
                        -- but it looks like you shoulda 
                        stayed in bed.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        My pops still here?
           No way Manny’s letting the boss’ son off the hook.  Lays the 
           sarcasm on thick:

                                 MANNY
                        You probably don’t remember 
                        this...after getting your head 
                        rocked...but we start work at 7am.
                             (checks his work)
                        And damn, can you believe it, it’s 
                        already 10:15.  Bet he’s checked 
                        the other two sites by now.  Home 
                        reading the paper.

           Bobby knows he screwed up.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        He was pissed, huh?

                                 MANNY
                        Wouldn’t you be?  Grab a sheet, 
                        junior.  Let’s go --

           Bobby sighs, heads over to the stack of drywall sheets.     
           As he hoists one over his head...

           EXT. LEADBETTER BEACH - SANTA BARBARA - AFTERNOON

           The sky is blue.  The sand warm and golden.  A cool breeze.  

           The area is alive with activity.  VOLLEYBALL PLAYERS, BIKE 
           RIDERS, JOGGERS and IN-LINE SKATERS go about their day.  A 
           few WINDSURFERS race across the flat wind-chopped ocean.    

           Then, we find the antithesis --

           BOBBY’S CREW

           Solid and Cruiser kick it on a picnic table in the grass 
           area.  Thirty feet away in the parking lot, Eddie and Angela 
           lean against Eddie’s convertible V-Dub.  Hip hop bumping low.  

           Across the way by the bike path is Freddy, pulling guard 
           duty, sitting on his custom stretched-out lowrider bicyle -- 
           eyes on the street.  

           The guys all wear black baggy Dickie shorts, white socks 
           pulled high, oversized t-shirts and baseball caps slung low.  

           Angela’s rocking boardshorts, a wife-beater with a black 
           bikini underneath.  That scabbed-over cut shows just above her 
           dark wrap-around shades.  Hair pulled in a high ponytail.  
           It’s chola meets surfer girl, but definitely leaning on the 
           gangsta side.  Her dinged-up board sticks out of Eddie’s ride.
           THREE MILK TOAST PIMPLE-FACED COLLEGE KIDS walk up to 
           Cruiser.  All smiles -- they know this Mexican crew.

                                 COLLEGE KID
                        Hey, Cruiser.

           The kid shakes hands with Cruiser -- discreetly slips      
           TWO FOLDED-UP TWENTIES into Cruiser’s hand.  

                                 COLLEGE KID
                        Thought you were further down the 
                        beach until I got your text.   

                                 CRUISER
                        Gotta keep the shop moving, homie.  
                        Stay stealth.
                             (motions)
                        Roll by the V-Dub --

           The kid grins as he and his friends walk toward Eddie and 
           Angela.  Eddie catches Cruiser’s nod -- Cruiser subtly 
           flashes five fingers twice -- 

           Eddie nods back, reaches into a small dufflebag in his ride.  
           Slips a DIME BAG of weed into the college kid’s hand.       
           The kid’s about to stop, say hello --

                                 ANGELA
                             (with a head nod)
                        Keep moving, Opie.

           Actually scared now, the kid and his friends do as they’re 
           told -- head back toward the street.  

           And that’s when we realize SANTA BARBARA CITY COLLEGE is 
           directly across the way.  College kids are everywhere.

                                 EDDIE
                             (smirks, to Angela)
                        “Opie?”  You keep slammin’ these 
                        fools, they ain’t gonna come back.

                                 ANGELA
                        Could kick ‘em in the head and 
                        they’d still come back.

           Bobby’s Impala swings into the parking lot.  He gets out, 
           still in his work clothes -- which is basically what all of 
           them are wearing, just dirty.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (motions to the college kids)
                        Class out, blunts in, huh?
                                 EDDIE
                        Siempre.

           He and Eddie bump fists.  Cruiser, Solid and Freddy move 
           over.  Bump fists with Bobby also.  Freddy looks at Bobby:

                                 FREDDY
                        You still mad?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Yesterday’s news, little homie.
                             (OFF Freddy's relieved grin)
                        Just keep it yesterday.

           The 13 year old nods that he will, a gleam in his eye.  
           Angela knows how much Freddy idolizes Bobby, teases him:

                                 ANGELA
                        You gonna tickle his balls, too?
                        Get back over there and spot --

           Freddy shakes his head, starts moving -- knows better than to 
           talk back to Angela.  Bobby looks toward the flat ocean:

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        No waves, prima?

                                 ANGELA
                        Zero, nada.  Wanna roll down to 
                        Silver Strand?  Bet there’s a 
                        little somethin’ somethin’...

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Maybe.

           Cruiser looks down at his cell as it VIBRATES again.  Looks 
           at the text message, then starts texting back.

                                 CRUISER
                             (to Eddie)
                        Damn, we’re gonna run outta weed.  
                        That’s ten texts in a hour.  

                                 EDDIE
                        I’ll call Ernesto -- see what he’s 
                        still holding.

           Eddie dials on his cell, walking away.  Just as a 12 YEAR OLD 
           HISPANIC KID walks up, money in his hand.

                                 12 YEAR OLD
                        Hey Cruiser -- hook me up?

                                 CRUISER
                        Sure, homie.
                                 12 YEAR OLD
                        How much can I get for --

           Before he can finish, VAL, a 21 year old stunner rushes up.  
           She’s a Caucasian-looking girl with piercing eyes and long 
           dark brown hair, wearing a black business-like dress and tall 
           black boots.  But don’t let her light skin and hip look fool 
           you, this girl’s straight from the neighborhood.  

           Val yanks the 12 year old by the arm --

                                 VAL
                        Dammit, Issac...what’d I tell you?

                                 ISSAC
                        What are you following me?

           Val glares at the entire crew:

                                 VAL
                        What the hell’s wrong with you -- 
                        he’s twelve!

           The crew stays all attitude, staring right back.

                          CRUISER
           Whoa, chill.  Little man came 
           to us --
                                                          SOLID
                                              Don't get your panties in a 
                                              bunch, J-Lo.

           Val throws a hard look at Solid, the behemoth -- hates the 
           reference, although she does kind of resemble a younger 
           Jennifer Lopez: 

                                 VAL
                        “J-Lo?”  Kiss my ass, Fat Joe.

                                 SOLID
                             (offended)
                        Man, I’m Solid.

                                 VAL
                             (sarcastic)
                        Yeah, solid as steel, big boy.

           Val finishes with the flick of her hand dismissing him.  The 
           guys fall out laughing, pointing at Solid.  Poor Solid never 
           had a chance.  He just shakes his head, mutters:

                                 SOLID
                        Just meant it’s my name.

           Val sees Bobby staring at her with a grin.  They lock eyes -- 
           both subtly checking out the other.  But Val’s still pissed:
                                 VAL
                        You got something smartass to say, 
                        too?  Sellin’ weed to my little 
                        brother...

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (hands up)
                        Not me.  I ain’t sellin’ nothing.

                                 VAL
                        Yeah right.

           Val glances at Angela who’s staring right back.

                                 VAL
                        What’s up, Ange?  It’s been awhile.

           The guys are shocked as Angela hugs her and laughs.

                                 ANGELA
                        Just lettin’ you crush these fools.  
                             (looks down)
                        Those boots is sick, Val.  I’d rock 
                        the hell outta those.

                                 VAL
                        Any time, girl...
                             (checks her watch)
                        Damn, I’m late for work.  Come by 
                        so we can catch up.

                                 ANGELA
                        Definitely.  Good to see you.

                                 VAL
                        You, too.  Let’s go, Issac --

           Val storms away with her little brother in tow.  The crew’s 
           hard-core attitude suddenly shifts into them gawking at her -- 

                          CRUISER
                                                          FREDO
           Damn, she's fine as hell.
                                              That mommy’s muy bonita.

                                 SOLID
                             (still sour)
                        It ain’t all that.

                                 CRUISER
                        Sure, Fat Joe.

                                 SOLID
                        ...whatever...

           Eddie doesn’t say shit as he moves back up next to Angela -- 
           doesn’t want his ass kicked.  But he’s still looking.
                                 CRUISER
                        Walk a mile to get up in that culo, 
                        huh Bobby?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        She’s alright.

           Angela smirks, seeing Bobby still glued on Val walking away.  
           Attitude in her step.  That long dark shiny hair.         
           That tight ass.

                                 CRUISER
                        How’s that pee wee her brother? 

                                 ANGELA
                        Think her dad is white.  I know her 
                        mom’s definitely Mexican though.

                                 EDDIE
                        And why she dressed for the prom?

                                 ANGELA
                        She’s got a real job, stupid.  
                        Works at the mall...

           Bobby realizes he’s still staring at Val, and the guys have 
           noticed.  He plays it off, gets ready to leave.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Laters.

                                 ANGELA
                        Thought we was checking Silver 
                        Strand?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Gotta see my pops -- make peace so 
                        I still got a job.

                                 ANGELA
                        We’re still leaving in the morning 
                        for Mavericks though, right?  

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (grins)
                        Hells yeah.  Gonna be epic. 

           Bobby trades a “hang loose” followed by “the finger” with her.

           INT/EXT. MARTINEZ HOUSE HOUSE - WEST SIDE BARRIO - AFTERNOON

           Bobby’s modest childhood house.  The same size as the rest on 
           the block, but kept up with care which makes it stand out.  
           It’s also the same neighborhood as the crew’s crash pad.
           INSIDE THE KITCHEN

           BOB SR. (late 40s), already graying, but still built with a 
           working man’s body, sits at the table with the newspaper 
           spread out.  Bobby’s mom, JOANIE, prepares him a sandwich by 
           the sink.  A cool breeze flows through the open window.

           The front door is heard opening and shutting.  Bob Sr.’s eyes 
           shift toward the sound, then go back to his paper.  Just as 
           Bobby walks into the kitchen, kisses his mom on the cheek.

                                 JOANIE
                        Hi, mijo.  You hungry?

                                 BOB SR.
                        Of course he is.  Always right on 
                        time when it has to do with food.

           Bob Sr. doesn’t look up, keeps reading the paper as his son 
           sits down.  Bobby looks sincere as he apologizes:

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        I’m sorry.  I owe you three hours.  

                                 BOB SR.
                        Those hours are long gone, son.  
                        Good news is I don’t gotta pay you.

           Joanie spots her son’s bruised cheek.

                                 JOANIE
                        What happened to your face?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (covers)
                        Got whacked by my board.

           Bob Sr. looks up -- doesn’t buy it, but says nothing.       
           As usual.  Just leans back in his chair as Joanie sets down 
           his sandwich.  Smiles at her.

                                 BOB SR.
                        Thanks, sweets.

                                 JOANIE
                        Sure thing. 

           As Bob Sr. takes a bite of his sandwich, Joanie heads back to 
           the sink...

                                 JOANIE
                        Didn’t you say you saw Bobby 
                        surfing the other day?

           Sr.’s still perturbed with his son, but manages a nod.
                                 BOB SR.
                        Could never go left and right like 
                        you.  Only left.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Lemme know if you wanna catch a 
                        set.  Teach you to go backside.

                                 BOB SR.
                        Some of us gotta work for a living, 
                        remember?

           Bobby rolls his eyes.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Knew you weren’t gonna let it go.

                                 BOB SR.
                        Damn right I’m not.  I got a 
                        business to run --

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        -- you know I’m usually on time.

                                 BOB SR.
                        Well I don’t care if you embarrass 
                        yourself, but you’re not gonna do 
                        it to me --

           The argument’s about to escalate, when Joanie moves in 
           between them and sets down Bobby’s sandwich.  Kisses her   
           son on the head.  Her subtle way to interrupt the tension.  

           Her husband knows it, too.  

                                 JOANIE
                        Eat up, mijo.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Thanks, mom.

           Bob Sr. shakes his head, goes back to his paper and sandwich. 

                                 BOB SR.
                             (beat)
                        I got more days available on the 
                        new job site.  If you want them.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Two days a week still gets me by.

           Not the answer his father wanted, but expected.
                                 BOB SR.
                        Sooner or later?  “Get me by” turns 
                        into “pass me by.”  
                             (gets up)
                        But hey, it’s your life, not mine.

           His father walks into the living room.  

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Why’s he gotta be that way?

                                 JOANIE
                        Because he cares.

           Bobby eats in silence.  Thinking about what his dad said.  
           But it seems to go in one ear, out the other, as...

           EXT. BIG SUR - MORNING

           Bobby’s Impala navigates a windy road at the edge of a     
           200 foot cliff -- the endless Pacific below.

           INSIDE THE IMPALA

           Sausage McMuffins.  OJs.  Hoodies up.  Windows down.  Shades 
           on.  Tunes blasting.  Bobby and Angela grinning ear to ear.

           Not a care in the world...

           EXT. PILLAR POINT HARBOR - NORTHERN CALIFORNIA - DAY

           Home of Mavericks -- Cali’s answer to Hawaii’s pipeline.  But 
           known to be even more dangerous.  Thirty to fifty foot waves 
           rise into the air -- slashing through massive jagged rock 
           formations that jut high out of the water -- 

           Surfing here is basically a life or death obstacle course.

           ON THE ROCKY SHORE

           No major sponsor tents, flags, media, etc.  Just a simple 
           BANNER stuck in the sand:  “Maverick’s Surf Competition.”   
           An annual event with a massive cult following as the best big 
           wave surfers in the world tackle one of the deadliest breaks.

           Bobby and Angela join other spectators, overlooking the 
           ominous waves.  Their hoodies up and shades on don’t hide the 
           fact that they’re the only Hispanics on the beach.  

           OUT IN THE BREAK

           Dark thunder clouds only make the scene more intense as    
           TWO DOZEN SURFERS line up in an attempt to ride massive  
           sheer-faced waves the size of buildings.  
           The FIRST SURFER paddles, drops in from the top of a forty 
           footer -- board chattering as if he were riding the side of a 
           tornado.  The force is too great -- he spills off, falling 
           three-stories head first into the surging water.  Disappears.

           Everyone points, hands to their face -- hoping to see him pop 
           back up.  RESCUE JET SKIS race in, but see nothing yet.

           ON BOBBY AND ANGELA

           Eyes glued to the scene.  It’s like watching a bad car wreck.

                                 ANGELA
                        Damn, he’s crushed --

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (points)
                        No -- there.

           Sure enough, a head crests the water.  The rescue jet ski 
           charges toward the surfer who grabs onto the floating sled 
           behind the jet ski and is pulled to safety.  Everyone cheers. 

           Bobby’s mesmerized as other surfers drop into the next 
           explosive powerful set.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Can’t wait to see this in the mags.

                                 ANGELA
                        You should be in the mags.  Can rip 
                        like any of these fools.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (doesn’t see it)
                        Nah, these dudes are pros.  

           Angela hip checks him, hands stuck in her hoodies’ pouch.

                                 ANGELA
                        When did you become such a pussy?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        ...shiiiiit...

           Both share a grin.

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           Surfers defy the odds.  Tearing down massive waves.  Others 
           get crushed.  Jettisoned into the air.  Smashed into the 
           jagged rock formations sticking out of the surf.  

           Another one is dragged on shore by rescue personnel --  
           loaded onto a stretcher, face covered in blood.
           The mangled surfer is rushed right by Bobby and Angela, then 
           Bobby spots someone in the line-up out in the break.  

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (lights up, pointing)
                        Damn, it’s Kelly Slater! 

           OUT IN THE WATER

           Real-life KELLY SLATER sits atop his board, totally Zen, 
           watching the next set form.  Slater is the epitome of the 
           definition, “surfer.”  A nine-time world champion.  

           His electric blue eyes find the demon he wants to slay.  He 
           turns his board and takes off.  Catches the liquid giant and 
           takes “it” for a ride.  Ripping at break-neck speed...

           TIGHT ON - BOBBY

           Watches Slater with more than just admiration.  

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        That right there...is what it’s all 
                        about, prima.

           This time, Angela is speechless.  Also in awe.

           CARL (40s), a hulking white figure in a Raiders sweatshirt 
           and jeans, stands next to them.  Shares their enthusiasm: 

                                 CARL
                        Nothing like seeing a natural in 
                        his element, huh...?

           Bobby looks over at Carl, agreeing.  But Angela smirks:

                                 ANGELA
                        Or hers.

           Carl laughs apologetically.  Hands up.

                                 CARL
                        Or hers.  

           OFF the three smiling, watching Slater take on another giant.

           INT. IMPALA - EVENING

           Driving.  Tinted windows up.  Bobby and Angela reflect on an 
           epic day they’ll never forget.  You can see it in their eyes.  

           OVER the usual hip hop playing on the radio:
                                 ANGELA
                        What’s the biggest wave you ever 
                        rode?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (thinks)
                        About fifteen.  And trust me, it 
                        was Mini-Me compared to those 
                        bombs.

                                 ANGELA
                        I’d love to kill a wave like that.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Knowing your crazy ass, you will.

           Angela laughs.  A silent moment, then:

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        How do you know that girl from the 
                        beach yesterday?

                                 ANGELA
                             (smirks)
                        Knew you was trippin’ over her.  
                        Ask her out, dummy.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Whatever.  Just wanted to know 
                        where she’s from?

                                 ANGELA
                        Right... 
                             (beat)
                        I knew her from school.  But she 
                        lives in East Side now.

           A definite buzz-kill.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Serious?

                                 ANGELA
                        Nah, no worries -- Val was never 
                        about that tension.  She’s the only 
                        girl I know with her head on 
                        straight.  Want me to say 
                        something?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Don’t need you to pimp for me.

                                 ANGELA
                             (laughs)
                        Yes you do.
           Bobby laughs back, busted.  He is indeed shy.  The station 
           they’re listening to gets staticky.  Bobby scrolls through 
           stations to find a new one -- rolls past a heavy metal one.  

                                 ANGELA
                             (excited)
                        Stop...Metallica!  Love this song!

           Bobby smirks, puts the station back for her.  Angela starts 
           to SING along to Metallica’s, “And nothing else matters.”

                                 ANGELA
                        Never opened myself this way...  
                        Life is ours, we live it our way...  
                        All these words I don’t just say...  
                        And nothing else matters...
                             (grins at Bobby)
                        This is us right here, primo.

           Bobby grins back.  The chorus kicks in, both sing it: 

                                 BOBBY/ANGELA
                        So close no matter how far...   
                        Couldn't be much more from the heart...  
                        Forever trusting who we are....      
                        And nothing else matters....

           The cousins bump fists.

                                 ANGELA
                        Carnales...

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        ...por vida.

           Angela stares out into the night with a relaxed smile.

                                 ANGELA
                        Think we can?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        What?

                                 ANGELA
                        Live the rest of our lives this 
                        way?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        If you mean surfing, man I hope so.

           Angela nods, loving the escape surfing affords them as well.
           EXT. CRASH PAD - NIGHT

           Bobby’s Impala swings into its parking spot.  Metallica is 
           overtaken by AGGRESSIVE HIP HOP.  Bobby and Angela get out, 
           look toward the house.  Another small party is going on. 

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Damn, I ain’t ever gonna sleep.

                                 ANGELA
                        Want me to call Val?  Have her tuck 
                        you in...?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Shut up.

           Angela laughs as they head up onto the porch --

           INT. CRASH PAD - CONTINUOUS

           They walk in and see Cruiser TATTOOING a shirtless and yoked, 
           shaved head, prison-inked GANGSTER with a penetrating stare so 
           intense, one could only get it from a maximum security yard.  

           This is RICO (28), Angela’s older brother.  The smile says 
           he’s glad to be right where he’s sitting.  Eddie, Solid, 
           Freddy stand around, grinning -- all watch Angela light up:

                                 ANGELA
                        Rico, mi hermano!  They let you out 
                        early?!

           Cruiser takes the tat gun away from Rico’s chest as Angela 
           hugs her older brother for the first time in years.  

                                 RICO
                        Best thing they invented in prison.  
                        “Overcrowding.”

           Everyone laughs.  Rico locks eyes with Bobby, looks him up 
           and down with heavy scrutiny.  His smile never fading.

                                 RICO
                        Look at you.  The youngster’s 
                        become a man.  All cock diesel.

           Bobby grins, hugs his cousin.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Just tryin’ to be like you.  

                                 RICO
                        Shit, don’t be like me.  Waste a 
                        nickel of your life for nothin’.
           Bobby motions to the REDDENED TATTOO on Rico’s chest.  It’s 
           of a gangster clown wearing a fedora, etched with new ink:

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Cruiser’s got mad skills, huh?
                             (motions to his own body)
                        He’s done all our work -- 

                                 RICO
                        Hells yeah.  The fool who inked 
                        this in the joint made the mouth 
                        look like a damn butt crack. 

           Everyone cracks up as Rico puts his arm around Cruiser --

                                 RICO
                        But not anymore.  My homie here’s 
                        got it shinin’ and smilin’ now.

           Cruiser lets out a proud smile.  Freddy stands off to the 
           side, staring in awe at Rico.  

                                 FREDDY
                        Come on...tell us more.  They still 
                        havin’ gladiator games?

                                 RICO
                             (to Bobby)
                        Been tellin’ them stories.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Chill, Freddy.  Probably the last 
                        thing he wants to talk about.

                                 RICO
                        Hey, I’ll tell ‘em all they wanna 
                        hear as long as it ain’t from 
                        behind glass.

           More laughs.  Rico seems to soak in the attention.  He shares 
           another smile with his baby sister, then hugs her again.

                                 RICO
                        You grew up on me, hermana.  Bet 
                        you’re shakin’ them off with a 
                        stick.

                                 ANGELA
                             (motions to Eddie)
                        Just using that stick on him.

           Rico’s eyes swing toward Eddie.  A glint of a protective 
           stare makes Eddie uneasy.  Just what Rico wanted.           
           He lets it hang, then finally smiles:
                                 RICO
                        You got your hands full, ese.   
                        Good luck with that.

           Eddie now relaxes.  The laughs continue.

                                                              TIME CUT:

           EXT. PORCH - CRASH HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

           Rico sits on the steps, letting the cold night air wash 
           across his face.  Staring out into the darkness.  There’s a 
           hollow look in Rico’s eyes.  Unsure of what his future holds.

           The front door opens behind him.  Rico puts back on a smile 
           as Bobby sits down and hands him a beer.

                                 RICO
                        Gracias, homes.

           An awkward moment.  Rico still seems edgy.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        You alright?

                                 RICO
                        Just tryin’ to remember what it’s 
                        like to live, you know.  Had a year 
                        to go, so wasn’t even thinking 
                        about hittin’ the streets yet.

           Bobby stays silent.  Feels for him.

                                 RICO
                        But hey, I’m breathing fresh air 
                        instead of that stank.  My last 
                        cellie had the shits, 24/7.

           Bobby laughs, then looks down with a guilty feeling.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Sorry I never came to visit, primo.  
                        My pops, he wouldn’t --

                                 RICO
                        -- don’t even trip.  Was better for 
                        me you didn’t.  Livin’ inside with 
                        your mind on the outside don’t 
                        work.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (nods)
                        Glad you’re home.
           Rico smiles, nods back.  Another awkward moment.  The cousins 
           trying to acclimate once again.

                                    RICO
                        Cool if I crash here?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Hey.  Mi familia.

           Rico clicks Bobby’s beer with gratitude. 

           EXT. WEST BEACH - SANTA BARBARA - DAY

           Just west of State Street and the pier.  The beach is filled 
           with all walks of life, people enjoying their day.  Cruiser 
           and Eddie set up their usual nondescript shop.  Cruiser on a 
           bench to make the deal, Eddie by his V-Dub to distribute.

           ACROSS THE WAY

           Rico sits by Solid, t-shirt off, soaking in the sun.  He 
           watches Cruiser/Eddie do a deal with a MIDDLE-AGED MAN.  
           Solid looks over at Rico:

                                 SOLID
                        You cool this close to the fire, 
                        ese?  I know you’re on parole...

                                 RICO
                        Hey, just let a homie know if you 
                        see heat...I’ll turn into a      
                        Chicano Carl Lewis.

           Solid laughs.  Rico turns toward the ocean, watches --

           BOBBY AND ANGELA

           There are barely any waves, but the two cousins still have a 
           blast.  BODY-SURFING the tiny rollers.   

           Bobby rides one -- spins like a torpedo, arms stretched 
           forward, then bottoms out in the shallow surf.  

           Angela catches the next roller, rides it straight toward 
           Bobby who jumps up and playfully pushes her down under the 
           water.  Both get up laughing, splashing each other.  

           As they finally head up onto the beach...

           TIGHT ON - RICO

           Scrutinizing them as they walk up and rinse off in the 
           outdoor shower area.
                                 RICO
                             (to Solid)
                        They always hang together?

                                 SOLID
                        Tight as a frog’s ass.

           Rico watches his sister walk toward Eddie in the parking lot 
           and kiss him.  Meanwhile, Bobby heads over to Rico and Solid, 
           sits down.  Rico smiles at him:

                                 RICO
                        Glad to see you and my sister are 
                        so close.  Was hoping somebody 
                        would watch over her.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        You kiddin’, she watches over me.  
                             (OFF Rico’s laugh)
                        Ange makes me laugh more than 
                        anybody.  

                                 RICO
                        Always did.  Remember when I got 
                        her to throw those firecrackers 
                        into that restaurant on State?

           Bobby and Solid both crack up.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Forgot about that.  People was 
                        runnin’ for their lives.

                                 SOLID
                        Left shit right on their table. 
                        Homies ate steak for a week.

           Rico nods, reminiscing.  

                                 RICO
                        Some good times.  Real good times.
                             (beat)
                        You know, that’s the most messed-up 
                        part about doing a bit.  All you 
                        got is memories.  Like livin’ 
                        Groundhog Day in there.

           Bobby doesn’t know how to respond, hearing Rico’s bitterness.

                                 SOLID
                        Couldn’t even imagine, homes.  I 
                        did six days in County, and thought 
                        that was hard.
                                 RICO
                        Good news is some OGs inside took 
                        care of me.  Because I handled 
                        business.  They can make our lives 
                        easier out here, too.

           Rico lets it hang there.

                                 SOLID
                        Simon.  Like the sound of that.

           Bobby just nods, knows what Rico is alluding to.  They watch 
           as THREE FRAT BOYS walk up to Cruiser.

                                 SOLID
                        Speaking of easy -- watch this.  
                        These white boy fools love to talk 
                        “gangsta.”

                                 RICO
                        Who are they?

                                 SOLID
                        Some dudes from a fraternity.  Got 
                        daddy’s paper in their pocket.   
                        Buy mota like milk. 

           Solid gets up and moves over toward Cruiser.  The frat boys 
           bump fist with them -- TALKING hip hop/gang slang like it’s 
           cool as they subtly hand Cruiser some money.  

           Rico takes the exchange in, then looks over at Bobby.

                                 RICO
                        You ain’t slingin’?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Nah, ain’t for me.  

                                 RICO
                        Smart.  Shot callers let the 
                        soldiers take the risk.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (laughs)
                        I ain’t calling any shots.  We just 
                        let each other do our own thing.  

                                 RICO
                             (grows serious)
                        Don’t shit a shitter, primo.  
                        You’re el capitan of this clica 
                        whether you like it or not.
           Bobby’s resisting any such notion.  Never wanted that 
           responsibility.  Definitely doesn’t want it now.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Seriously, it ain’t like that.  You 
                        know how it is...we stay cliqued up 
                        so we don’t get banged up.  East 
                        Side’s treacherous, homes.  
                        Outnumber us 3 to 1.

           Rico looks at Bobby, eyes intense like lasers.  

                                 RICO
                        Forget their numbers.  Real power 
                        comes from who shows the most 
                        heart.  Remember that.

           Bobby can’t hold Rico’s hardened stare.  Nods and looks away.          

           TIGHT ON - ANGELA

           Watching Rico and Bobby.  By the look on her face, she loves 
           her brother, but doesn’t trust him.

           A THUNDEROUS ROAR begins to swell... louder... LOUDER...

                                                          SHOCK CUT TO:

           EXT. OCEAN - RINCON POINT - CARPINTERIA - AFTERNOON

           A MUD COLORED WAVE barrels straight into camera.  Buries us --

           UNDER THE WATER 

           The sunlight barely breaks the murky surface.  A BROWN BODY 
           rolls under the wave, clutching a surfboard, then --

           Bobby breaks the surface.  Looks out at the heavy line-up.  
           The waves are breaking five to six feet.  Bobby knows when 
           it’s this crowded, it usually means tension, not relaxation.

           He sighs, paddles out into the line-up.  Only Mexican out 
           here, but he’s used to that.  He scoops up a handful of water 
           and splashes it over his face.  Trying to chill.  Ride a few.

           A LOUD-MOUTH CREW OF FIVE bob in the water ten feet away.  
           Early 20s, white, grungy hair, some tats.  They represent one 
           of the many rebellious cliques that infect the surf world.   

           Everyone in the water gives them space to avoid conflict.  
           That includes Bobby.  As he looks out into the ocean...  

           A wave starts to undulate under the surface.  Bobby clocks 
           the roller as it becomes a nice-size wave.  He drops to his 
           stomach and begins paddling. 
           So do others including the loud-mouth clique.  The leader of 
           the pack is a kid named, THEO ALGONZI (21).  Has all the 
           tools to be great, just no toolbox upstairs to put them in.  

           Algonzi and Bobby quickly become the only contenders for the 
           wave.  Hands cut into the water almost up to their elbows --

           As the wave comes to life, Bobby drops in and veers 
           diagonally to avoid Algonzi who pops to his feet also.

           But, Algonzi cuts right into Bobby’s line -- 

                                 ALGONZI
                        Get off my wave!

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        I had the inside -- !

           Bobby doesn't relent -- they’re about to collide.  Algonzi 
           has no choice except to cut back into the closing white 
           water.  Gets spun 360 degrees and nastily wipes out.   

           Meanwhile, Bobby finishes his ride.

                                                              TIME CUT:

           OUT IN THE LINE-UP

           Bobby surges through a wave, paddling back out.  Sees Algonzi 
           and crew waiting for him.  Algonzi is steaming.

                                 ALGONZI
                        What’s your problem, asshole?!

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        I had the right-a-way --

                                 ALGONZI
                        -- I don’t give a shit!  This is 
                        our break!

           Bobby watches Algonzi’s crew paddle and surround him so he 
           can’t escape.  All are ready to fight him.  

           But Bobby instinctively isn’t backing down -- glares right 
           back at Algonzi with that warrior’s stare.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        I might get rat-packed, homes...but 
                        I’m dropping you first.  So bring it --

           Algonzi sees Bobby’s intense look.  Fists clenched.  He 
           expected Bobby to back down.  Knows it’s his move now.  
           Seeing everyone watching, Algonzi starts toward Bobby, then 
           hesitates, as --

           Carl, the white guy who was at Mavericks, paddles up next to 
           Bobby -- stares Algonzi and crew down with a fiery gaze.  The 
           guy’s intensity is intimidating, not to mention his size. 

           He motions to one of Algonzi’s arm tattoos:

                                 CARL
                        Nice barbwire tat, tough guy.  
                        About as mean as Pam Anderson’s.

                                 ALGONZI
                        This don’t involve you.

                                 CARL
                        When it’s five on one it does!  You 
                        punks are always out here causing 
                        tension.  This isn’t your break, 
                        shithead.  It’s everybody’s!

           Algonzi sees OTHER SURFERS ready to back up Carl.  Which 
           means they’re backing up Bobby.  But Bobby looks ready to 
           escape the drama altogether.  Shoots Carl a grateful nod.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        It’s all good, man.  Thanks.  I’m 
                        done anyway.

           Bobby slides down on his board, starts to paddle in.

                                 ALGONZI
                        Damn rights you’re done.

                                 CARL
                             (snaps back)
                        Shut your mouth!

           Algonzi sees Carl is still ready to brawl all of them.  He 
           shoots Carl a quick sneer and paddles away with his crew.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - RINCON POINT - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby gets out of his wetsuit, still heated about the 
           exchange in the water.

                                 CARL (O.S.)
                        Don’t let those guys get to you.  
                        They’re all talk --

           Bobby looks over, sees Carl leaning his board against a WHITE 
           VOLVO STATION WAGON with two colorful child seats inside.    
           The antithesis to his tough guy persona. 
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Dude, last thing I thought you’d be 
                        rockin’ is a white Volvo.  Figured 
                        you be in a monster truck or 
                        something.

           Carl laughs with a sigh.

                                 CARL
                        All I can say is don’t get married, 
                        man...because the only manhood 
                        you’ll have left...
                             (points to surf)
                        ...is right out there.  

           Bobby laughs back.  

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        You were at Mavericks, right?

                                 CARL
                        Yeah, thought that was you.

           An awkward beat.  Two guys from different worlds, with only 
           one thing in common.  The ocean.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Well, thanks for getting my back.  
                        Figured I was gettin’ pounded.

                                 CARL
                             (grins)
                        We’d have stomped those punks.

           Bobby shoots him a smile back, nods.  A connection made.    
           He straps his board on top of the Impala.  

           Meanwhile, Carl puts his on top of his white Volvo --      
           his face says it all -- back to the real world.

           INT. LA CUMBRE PLAZA - SANTA BARBARA - DAY

           An upscale mall.  The usual suspects browse stores.  White 
           collar moms.  The elderly.  Rich college kids.  And then...

           Angela comes into view.  All hard-core.  Her hair pulled 
           tight in two pigtails with the usual wrap around shades, 
           black dickies, wife beater and a black bra underneath.  
           Somehow, she makes it all look sexy.

           On the move, she sees a YUPPIE GUY checking her out.

                                 ANGELA
                             (as she passes by)
                        What, fucker?
           The yuppie sheepishly looks away.  Angela keeps walking,   
           all attitude.  But can’t help a grin.

           INT. COSMETICS COUNTER - MACY’S - CONTINUOUS

           Val, dressed in a women’s suit like we last saw her, sits 
           behind a Mac Cosmetic’s display.  Watching the WELL-TO-DO of 
           Santa Barbara pass by her counter.

                                 ANGELA (O.S.)
                        Thinkin’ I need a makeover...

           Val looks to her left, sees Angela staring at her.

                                 VAL
                        Uh uh.  That look is slammin’.

           The girls grin and hug.

                                 ANGELA
                        Thought I’d say a proper hello.

                                 VAL
                        Was good to run into you.  Man, I 
                        only moved ten blocks...and it 
                        feels like I’m in another world.

                                 ANGELA
                        Instant East Side.

                                 VAL
                        You can keep all that drama.  I’m 
                        not with any side but my side. 

                                 ANGELA
                        That’s what I told my cousin, 
                        Bobby.

                                 VAL
                        Wait, he the one with the eyes and 
                        the cute smile?  He’s your cousin?

                                 ANGELA
                        Cool as hell, too.  Just not big on 
                        initiative.

           Val laughs, realizing Bobby noticed her as well.

           EXT. MARTINEZ HOUSE - WEST SIDE BARRIO - SANTA BARBARA

           Music swells, people mingle -- Bobby’s parents throw a 
           BBQ/party for Angela’s birthday.  It’s already divided into 
           the two usual camps:  the OLDER FOLK and WOMEN at the patio 
           tables.  While the “MEN” hover near a makeshift bar and ice 
           chests of beer.  KIDS run and play in the grass...
           AT THE PATIO TABLE

           Conversations are going on.  Bob Sr. sits next to his sister, 
           TINA, Angela’s and Rico’s mother.  Tina has the look of a 
           recovering alcoholic.  Weathered beyond her 45 years.  But 
           having your first child at 17, who’s a convicted felon, will 
           do that to you.  Dead center is a birthday cake for Angela.  

                                 TINA
                             (humble, to Bob Sr.)
                        Thanks for having Angela’s party 
                        here.  You’re a good brother.

           Bob Sr. smiles, knows how broke his sister is.

                                 BOB SR.
                        That’s what family’s for.
                             (motions toward Rico)
                        Guess it turned into a welcome home 
                        party, too.

           They both glance over at the bar area as Rico holds court.  
           Seems like everyone’s having a good time. 

                                 TINA
                        I just hope it’s Rico’s last one.

           Bob Sr. nods, but the looks says he ain’t betting on it.

           Bobby comes out from the house, followed by his mom, carrying 
           appetizer trays.  Both set them down on the patio table.

                                 JOANIE
                        Thanks, mijo.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Sure thing.

           Someone across the way suddenly catches Bobby’s eye.  

           Standing near a FEW GIRLS, is Val.  Dressed stylish, yet 
           casual in hip hugger jeans, chic sandals and a flowing 
           blouse.  She looks radiant.  Her eyes meet with Bobby’s for a 
           second, then she continues talking to the girls. 

           Angela appears next to Bobby with a devilish grin.  Bobby 
           instantly realizes what’s up, gets nervous --

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Come on, prima...you invited her?

                                 ANGELA
                        It’s my party.
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Told you I can handle my own damn 
                        business.

           Eavesdropping, Joanie blatantly looks over at the girls:

                                 JOANIE
                        Which girl are you talking about?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Chill, moms.  It’s nobody.

           Angela knows he’s embarrassed and loves it.  She walks off, 
           then looks back as if daring him.  Bobby shakes his head, but 
           his eyes subtly never leave Val as she chats with the girls.  

           Their eyes connect again, this time with a smile, but Bobby 
           breaks the moment -- “coolly” heads over to the men.

           AT THE BAR AREA

           Rico puts his arm around Bobby as he walks up.  Hands him a 
           beer.  EIGHT OTHER GUYS are here with an age range of 20s to 
           50s.  Most of them are cousins, 2nd cousins or related in 
           some way.  Cruiser, Eddie and Solid are also present. 

                                 RICO
                             (motions to Bobby)
                        And here’s one of the only 
                        relatives we got left without a 
                        prison number. 

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Keepin’ it that way, too.  No 
                        reason to follow you fools.

           They all laugh.

                                 OLDER COUSIN #1
                        Good for you, primo.  Trust me, the 
                        joint don’t make you a man.  

           All agree from experience.  Except Rico.  He just takes a 
           swig of beer, then reaches over and pats his hand against 
           Cousin #1’s baggy shirt -- as if to prove a point.     
           There’s a definite clank of metal.

                                 RICO
                        Dude, you’re strapped up here?

                                 OLDER COUSIN #1
                             (shrugs)
                        Hey, I carry in church.  Never know 
                        when it’s going down.
                                 CRUISER
                        Bob Sr. finds out...it’s gonna go 
                        down right here.

                                 EDDIE
                        For reals. 

           They all look toward Bobby’s dad across the way -- the legit 
           statesman of the family.

                                 COUSIN #3
                        Speaking of joints, who’s got one?  
                        You dudes are too serious.  
                        Bringin’ me down...  

                                 SOLID
                        Yeah, lets get this party started.  
                        Get on some chicas.

           Cruiser pretends like he’s scanning the party:

                                 CRUISER
                        Damn Solid, I don’t see any Jenny 
                        Craig dropouts.  And we all know 
                        you like a whole lotta woman.

                                 SOLID
                        Your moms never complained.

           The guys all crack up.  So does Solid at his own comeback -- 
           he finally got a jab in.

                                                              TIME CUT:

           THE PATIO TABLE

           Is lined up with Mexican food, buffet-style.  Everyone 
           surrounds it, digging in.  Bobby suddenly ends up next to 
           Val.  She looks absolutely beautiful.  Smells amazing. 

           Bobby tries to hide his nervousness.  Plays it cool:

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Hey, what’s up?

                                 VAL
                        Nothing.  You?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        You know, it’s all good.

           Bobby continues to put food on his plate, trying to act 
           nonchalant.  A bit thrown, Val merely nods, walks off.  Bobby 
           knows he just blew it -- curses himself under his breath.  
           Angela moves up next to him with a huge smirk.  Mocks him:

                                 ANGELA
                        Damn, glad we’re cousins.  Wouldn’t 
                        want to fall under that sick spell 
                        of yours.  I mean, you got her 
                        eatin’ right outta your hand...

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (tries to cover)
                        Shiiiiiit, if I wanted her to.  

                                 ANGELA
                        Yeah right.

           As Angela lightly hip checks him...

           TIGHT ON - RICO

           Across the way, watching the exchange between Bobby and 
           Angela, still playfully jabbing at each other.  Their tight 
           bond is undeniable.  Rico looks around the backyard.  
           Everyone is huddled into small groups -- eating, laughing.

           The harmonious atmosphere makes Rico edgy.  Feels even more 
           disconnected.  Isolated.  And the alcohol isn’t helping...

           He gets up, walks straight over to Bobby and pulls him aside:

                                 RICO
                        Primo, let’s roll.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (surprised)
                        Now?  Where??

                                 RICO
                        Don’t matter where.

           Bobby nods, sees Rico’s edgy state.  Looks over to where Val 
           is sitting and sighs a bit -- knows his chance is blown.

           INT. IMPALA - NIGHT

           Bobby, Rico next to him, Cruiser and Solid in back, roll down 
           State Street.  All at different levels of intoxication, but no 
           question feeling buzzed.

                                 CRUISER
                        Never knew so much of your family 
                        did time, homes.  I know I gotta 
                        few...including myself.

                                 RICO
                        Hell, even our abuelo.
           Bobby looks over, listening.

                                 SOLID
                        Wait, which side?

                                 RICO
                        My mom’s and senior’s old man.  

                                 CRUISER
                        Damn, for what?

                                 RICO
                        Murder, in the 50s.  Did a dime and 
                        nickel at Chino, right primo?

           Bobby plays it off like he knew.  But, he didn’t.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Something like that.

           Rico realizes now that Bobby didn’t know -- scrutinizes him 
           for a beat, but doesn’t bust him.  Rico looks out at the 
           mixed crowd of upscale locals.  His mind in overdrive. 

                                 RICO
                        Could never figure out how we ended 
                        up here.  

           Bobby looks over, sees Rico’s resentful stare.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        What do you mean?

                                 RICO
                        Look at this place.  Beach Blanket 
                        Beverly Hills.  I’d tell dudes 
                        inside I was from SB...and they’d 
                        laugh...think I was lying.

                                 SOLID
                        Oxnard Ventura’s hard-core.  Ain’t 
                        that far away.

                                 CRUISER
                        Light-years away, homes.  No clica 
                        down there sweats us.  If you ask 
                        me, I like livin’ in a small pond.  
                        Stay under the radar.  

           Rico thinks about that.

                                 RICO
                        Simon.  Means we can make some   
                        real-ass money.  
           Bobby sees Rico’s wheels spinning even more now -- the 
           criminal mind at work.  It concerns him.

                                 CRUISER
                        Hey, there’s two of them fools from 
                        East Side.

           Bobby’s eyes dart to the far street corner.  Recognizes the  
           TWO EASTSIDERS (from the opening brawl).  One is SLEEPER; a 
           chiseled banger with half-mast eyes.  He and his homeboy spot 
           Bobby and crew as well in the Impala.  Look ready to bolt -- 

           Especially as Rico opens his door, on the move with a fierce 
           stare --

                                 RICO
                        Let’s get down on these busters.  
                        Cut ‘em off, primo --

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        -- no, wait --  

           But Rico takes off on foot, chases the two Eastsiders down a 
           side street.  Bobby wheels the Impala around the corner, 
           knows he has to back his cousin’s play.  

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Damn it --

                                 CRUISER
                        It’s on now.

           Bobby blows by Rico in the Impala, who’s still chasing the 
           Eastsiders.  Sleeper clocks the Impala trying to cut them off 
           -- both bangers change direction and dart down a back alley.

           Bobby pulls over, jumps out and chases them with Rico.  
           Cruiser and Solid are not far behind.

           IN THE BACK ALLEY

           Rico catches Sleeper’s homeboy -- kicks him to the ground.  
           The banger Pete Rose’s hard, chin scraping asphalt.  Rico    
           jumps on top of him, starts pounding him.

           Sleeper turns, locks on Bobby and swings -- Bobby takes a 
           shot to the head, then counters.  And it’s on -- both start 
           fighting toe-to-toe.

           Cruiser and Solid run up, cheering Bobby and Rico on:

                           SOLID
                                                         CRUISER
           Crack it off, homies!
                                              Book his ass, Bobby!
           Suddenly, Cruiser’s tone changes to shock:

                                 CRUISER
                        -- oh shit --

           It gets eerily silent as both Solid and Cruiser stop shouting.  

           Bobby, who’s still fighting Sleeper, hears something now -- 
           the excruciating sound of metal entering flesh -- 

           He looks to his right and sees Rico on top of his guy, 
           stabbing him repeatedly in the side with a buck-knife. 

           Time stops.  Rico doesn’t -- committed to finishing his foe.  
           Sleeper stops fighting Bobby and starts to go for Rico --

                                 SLEEPER
                        Stop, man!  Don’t kill him --

           Bobby holds him back, then realizes “he” has to stop Rico 
           himself -- rushes in and grabs his cousin --

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Primo -- let’s go!

           It takes all of his strength, but Bobby finally pulls Rico 
           off.  They all quickly start heading back to the Impala.  

           Bobby glances back, sees the banger still lying on the 
           ground, writhing in pain, his side saturated in blood.  

           Sleeper kneels over his fallen homeboy, then looks right at 
           Bobby with an anguished, vengeful stare.           

           Bobby is too stunned for any reaction back...

           AT THE IMPALA

           All four jump in.  Rico’s eyes are like lasers.  Amped from 
           the violence.  Reaches over and shakes Bobby by the neck --

                                 RICO
                        That’s how we handle business.

           Bobby silently nods, starts the car and drives.  No question 
           he, Cruiser and Solid are shaken by the bloody outcome.

                                 SOLID
                        He muerta?

                                 CRUISER
                             (shakes his head)
                        I saw him still moving.
                                 RICO
                        Who cares -- hope the puto bleeds 
                        out.  East Side’s gettin’ the 
                        message now --

           Rico turns in his seat so he can see all three of them.  
           Blood still on his hands.  He stares them down with a 
           hardened look of conviction:

                                 RICO
                        -- we’re stickin’ this whole place 
                        on lock.  You hear me?  Time to put 
                        SB on the map, homies.

           The guys stay silent.  Realizing Rico’s truly operating on a 
           different level coming out of prison.

           OFF Bobby's distressed look, driving...

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MONTECITO - MORNING

           Bobby’s already worked up a sweat, positioning a sheet of 
           drywall with a nail gun.  Other workers surround him, but 
           Bobby seems in another world.  Mind still reeling.

           As Bobby grabs another sheet and starts nailing it up --

                                 BOB SR. (O.S.)
                        One minute I can’t get you here... 
                        now you’re like a machine.

           Bobby turns and sees his dad staring at him, clipboard in 
           hand.  Bobby tries a smile, goes back to work.

                                 BOB SR.
                        What’s going on?  You okay?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Yeah, just gettin’ it done.  Why?

                                 BOB SR.
                        You don’t look your usual “chilled” 
                        self.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (covers)
                        Just tired.

           Bob Sr. nods, but knows something’s up.

                                 BOB SR.
                        I hear Rico’s staying at your 
                        place.

           Bobby stops working, sees the wary look on his dad’s face.
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Yeah, just until he gets his feet 
                        on the ground.

                                 BOB SR.
                        That’ll be the day.  I know he’s 
                        family, but don’t let him leach off 
                        you too long, son.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        I ain’t sweatin’ it.

           But Bob Sr. is.  He starts to leave.

                                 BOB SR.
                        Coming over for dinner?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Maybe.  Gonna try and catch a set 
                        before dark.

                                 BOB SR.
                        Thought you were tired?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (tries a smile)
                        Never too tired to surf.

           His dad smiles back, walks off.  Bobby returns to his work.

           INT. IMPALA - AFTERNOON

           Bobby drives home, dirty, still in his work clothes.  

           He’s about to swing into his parking spot, when he sees Rico 
           through the front window -- sitting inside with some serious-
           looking GANGSTERS.  Eddie and Cruiser are there also.

           The unknown gangsters are a bit older.  Bobby watches for a 
           minute as Rico holds court with a serious expression.  
           Something big is going down...

           Bobby chooses not to go in, simply drives away.

           EXT. BEACH - RINCON POINT - CARPINTERIA - LATER

           The fiery sun is nearing the horizon.  Bobby squats in the 
           sand with an intense look.  His board lays parallel over his 
           thighs.  Elbows resting on top.  He just sits there, 
           motionless -- studying the waves.

           TIGHT ON - BOBBY

           Edgy.  The last 24 hours a violent blur.  He looks out at the 
           surf.  Then springs to his feet and bolts into the water.  
           Duck dives under a crashing wave.  Tide pulling him back 
           toward shore.  Relentlessly spears through the next wave as 
           well.  Arms paddling hard.  Legs kicking fiercely.  Using the 
           strenuous exercise to expel the tension within him.

           He gets out past the break and sits up on his board.  Bobs in 
           the water, waiting.  Then a wave grows behind him, and in 
           perfect synchronicity, Bobby paddles forward and drops in.   

           With ever increasing speed, Bobby rides the wave as if he were 
           trying to break its back.  His form is raw, unconventional.  
           Unorthodox is an understatement.  He lowers his center of 
           gravity, drops his back leg, bends his right front knee 
           towards the center and aggressively hulks over the board.

           NOTE:  This will become his trademark signature.  It's as if 
           Bobby’s surfing is fueled by the angst of the streets. 

           Bobby cuts back, snaps against the face -- gets some backside 
           air.  Silhouetted against the blistering sun.  He then flies 
           off his board and dives headfirst into the turbulent water.

           Bobby resurfaces.  His face more relaxed.  A sense of calm.

                                                              TIME CUT:

           EXT. LINE-UP - RINCON POINT - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby paddles back out where a DOZEN SURFERS chill and wait 
           for the next set to roll in.  It includes Carl.  He paddles 
           over next to Bobby and smiles:

                                 CARL
                        Hey, you missed your buddies.  They 
                        were just out here.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (laughs)
                        Bummer...

           Both bob on their boards next to each other. 

                                 CARL
                        So you live near here?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Up in SB.  You?

                                 CARL
                        Montecito.  
                             (sizing him up)
                        No offense, but I haven’t seen too 
                        many Hispanics surfing before.  
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (jokes)
                        I’m a trendsetter.

                                 CARL
                             (laughs)
                        Guess so -- you’re damn good.  

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Thanks.

                                 CARL
                        I’m whatcha call abysmal.  But hey -- 
                             (motions inland)
                        -- anything to escape the land of 
                        Blackberrys and stock tickers. 

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Man, I’d live out here if I could.

           So would Carl.  He points to a tall white building:

                                 CARL
                        I get to sit in that dungeon all 
                        day and watch the waves break -- 
                        wishing I was out here.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (can’t see it)
                        You’re a stock broker?

                                 CARL
                        “Financial analyst” -- which is 
                        basically yeah, a stock broker... 
                        so don’t tell anyone.

           Bobby laughs.

                                 CARL
                             (points)
                        You see who’s in the line-up?

           Bobby’s looks 50 yards south and sees Kelly Slater catching a 
           wave, effortlessly starts to shred it.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (eyes light up)
                        No way. 

           Carl sees the look in Bobby’s eyes, watching Slater rip.

                                 CARL
                        Go show ‘em what you’re made of. 
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Shiiiiit, I can’t touch Slater.  

                                 CARL
                        And here I thought you were some 
                        hard-core badass.  Wait here, I’ll 
                        give you the keys to my Volvo...

           Bobby smirks, knows Carl’s trying to bait him.  He sees Slater 
           kick out and finish his wave.  Carl motions to another coming:

                                 CARL
                        You need a bump start or what?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Alright, I’m going --

           Bobby grins, starts paddling hard.  Easily catches the wave 
           and starts to eviscerate it.  Surfing with reckless abandon -- 
           challenges it with a TAIL WHIP on the face -- curses it with 
           a BACKSIDE BARREL -- devours it with a JUMP to a 360 and OUT. 

           He looks toward the last place he saw Slater.  He’s gone -- 
           never saw it.  But there’s still a sense of pride on   
           Bobby’s face.  He absolutely killed that wave.

           EXT. LINE-UP - RINCON POINT - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby paddles up next to Carl who grins big.

                                 CARL
                        Best damn wave of the day, buddy.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Serious?  

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        One ride like that will keep you 
                        coming back forever, won’t it?

           Bobby turns his head, sees Slater paddling up behind him.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (smiles ear to ear)
                        Definitely.

                                 KELLY SLATER
                        Love the way you attack, man.   

           Bobby’s about to shit himself. 

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Don’t even know what to say.  
                                 KELLY SLATER
                        No need.  Just kill another.

           Slater paddles after another wave and drops in.  The moment 
           was mere seconds, but the memory will last a lifetime. 

           Carl smirks at Bobby -- sees the excited look in his eyes.   
           Carl’s actually pumped also.

                                 CARL
                        You just blew what?  At least three 
                        loads in your wetsuit --

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        At least three.

           They share a laugh. 

                                 CARL
                        What the hell’s your name anyway?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Bobby.  Bobby Martinez.

           Carl leans across and shakes his hand.

                                 CARL
                        Glad to meet ya, Bobby Martinez.  
                        I’m Carl Winther.

           OFF the two new friends, smiling.

           INT. IMPALA - DUSK

           Bobby drives up the 101 FWY, on his way back from surfing.   
           A proud smile on his face.  Tunes bumping.  Still pumped.  

           He's about to swing off his exit, but a quick decision is 
           made and he veers back onto the freeway.  

           As he checks himself in the rearview mirror...

           INT. MACY’S - LA CUMBRE PLAZA - DUSK

           Val is in her usual stylish work clothes.  Hair up.  Skin 
           glowing.  Wrapping up a horde of products for a RICH WHITE 
           WOMAN (50s), draped in jewelry.  One look at her face and 
           body and you know she’s a plastic surgeon’s dream come true.  

           The woman signs the receipt, shoots Val a cursory smile, 
           takes her bags and walks off without a word.

           Val simply smiles back -- past letting the hoity-toity SB 
           clientele get to her.  She starts putting things away.  Until 
           she notices someone leaning against the adjacent counter --
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Was thinkin’ of getting something 
                        for my mom’s birthday...

           Val knows it’s his lame attempt to break the ice.  Her turn 
           to play it cool -- stays right where she is. 

                                 VAL
                        Funny, I don’t remember any of your 
                        family talking about her birthday 
                        coming up?

           Bobby moves over toward her --

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Can’t I just get something nice for 
                        my moms?

                                 VAL
                        Sure.  Or you can just get to the 
                        point of why you’re here.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (busted)
                        Damn.  You ain’t no joke --  

           They both laugh.  Now face to face.

                                 VAL
                        That cute smile’s probably gotten 
                        you real far, but you’re gonna have 
                        to dig deeper here.  I don’t like 
                        wastin’ my time.

           Their eyes remain locked.  

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Okay.  Do you like the ocean?

                                 VAL
                        No.  
                             (smiles)
                        But I like the beach.

           OFF his smile back...

           INT. CRASH PAD - EVENING

           Bobby walks in, still in great spirits.  Sees Cruiser, Solid, 
           Angela, Eddie and Freddy all fired up.  Smiles on their faces.  
           40s in their grip.  Standing around like they’re about to head 
           off somewhere.  Linkin’ Park PLAYS LOUD on the stereo.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        What’s going on?
           Rico comes out of the hallway with a grin.  Blunt dangling 
           from his lips.  Freddy looks at Bobby, points to the stereo:

                                 FREDDY
                        Rico’s taking us to see Linkin’ 
                        Park at the County Bowl!  He’s got 
                        great seats! 

                                 RICO
                        Grab a pisto and let’s go, primo.  
                        Concert’s about to start --

           As Bobby grins, the reverberating sounds of Linkin’ Park 
           PLAYING LIVE start to overtake the version on the stereo...

           EXT. HILLTOP - SANTA BARBARA - NIGHT

           Overlooking the crowded Santa Barbara County Bowl down below.  
           Sporadic silhouettes of groups who have snuck up here litter 
           the hillside.  The smell of weed and alcohol rises into the 
           air from a sold-out concert below.

           Linkin’ Park is on stage playing “Numb” -- rocking the house.

           Bobby and crew emerge with Rico in the lead.  By the look on 
           the crew’s faces, they thought they were actually “going” to 
           the concert.  Rico grins, fired up:

                                 RICO
                        See -- best seats in the house!  
                        Can’t believe you dudes haven’t 
                        snuck up here before.  All the 
                        homies back in the day used to get 
                        lit up and chill for free...  

           Freddy turns to Bobby, excited:

                                 FREDDY
                        This is the bomb, huh Bobby!?

           Before Bobby can respond, Rico swings his arm around Freddy's 
           shoulders and steers him away.  On purpose.

                                 RICO
                        Come on youngster, let’s party!

           They raise their 40s and holler.  Bobby knows Rico's move was 
           to keep the attention on himself.  Subtly shakes his head. 
           Walks over and stands by Cruiser.  

           Meanwhile, Eddie has his arms wrapped around Angela.  Solid 
           is high as a kite, standing like a redwood.  

           All of them digging the show.
           ON BOBBY AND CRUISER 

           Cruiser motions to Rico:

                                 CRUISER
                        Your primo got us the hook up.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        On what?

                                 CRUISER
                        Some new mota.  Gets it cheap as 
                        hell, too.  Triple our grip.

           Seeing Cruiser’s expression, Bobby is waiting for the catch.

                                 CRUISER
                        Thing is, we gotta kick fifteen 
                        percent back to some OGs.  Rico 
                        made the connection.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        What’d you say about staying under 
                        the radar?

           Cruiser is still wrestling with this decision himself.

                                 CRUISER
                        I know, homes.  But Eddie’s all 
                        fired up.  And you know how it is, 
                        ain’t like we got a choice now.  
                        Rico says we're on the hook. 

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (shakes his head)
                        Be careful, man. 

           Both go silent as Rico heads over, all smiles.  Already 
           heavily intoxicated and high.

                                 RICO
                        You putas gonna spoon all night?  
                        Let’s get lit --

           Rico obnoxiously wrestles Bobby by the neck.  Bobby smiles, 
           trying to go along with it.  Rico downs the rest of his 40 
           and chucks it.

                                 RICO
                        Ange -- go down and buy us some 
                        pistos.  
                             (pulls out a small wad)
                        Here --

           Angela doesn’t move from Eddie’s arms.
                                 ANGELA
                        I ain’t your bitch.  You do it.

           Rico’s hair trigger ignites -- glares at his sister.  

                                 RICO
                        Easy hermana.  Remember who you’re 
                        talking to.

           Angela tries to remain tough, knowing what her brother is 
           capable of.  Pretends to ignore him and watches the concert.

                                 RICO
                        Hey, did you hear me!?

           Furious, Rico starts to pull her away from Eddie, but Angela 
           shoves him off.  Eddie isn’t about to stand up against Rico -- 
           tries to reason with his girlfriend.

                                 EDDIE
                        Ange, maybe you should just do it.

                                 ANGELA
                             (turns on Eddie, furious)
                        You can kiss my ass, too.

           Rico snaps, grabs Angela and starts to force her by her neck.  

                                 RICO
                        I said you’re going --

           Bobby protectively intervenes, getting between them. 

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Whoa -- chill, guys.
                             (to Angela)
                        Come on, I’ll go with you.

           A tense beat, then Angela follows Bobby down the hill.  Rico 
           stares daggers as they disappear.  Doesn’t like one bit that 
           Bobby could control her so easily...and he couldn’t.

           But he covers it up, grins at the others who are all staring.

                                 RICO
                        Does my sister got balls or what?
                             (to Eddie)
                        Told you, you have your hands full.

           The guys laugh, going along with it, but no question they 
           aren’t into the way he handled Angela.  Although none of them 
           are ready to do anything about it.
           EXT. UPPER ROWS - SANTA BARBARA COUNTY BOWL - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby and Angela silently slip through the top railing, 
           coming down off the hillside.  PAID PATRONS don’t seem to 
           care and just watch the show -- they’re used to it.

           ON BOBBY AND ANGELA

           Angela is still visibly angry.  So is Bobby, but he tries to 
           reason with her.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        He’s just lit up, Ange.  Let it go.

                                 ANGELA
                        You let it go.  I’m tired of him 
                        already.  He hasn’t changed one 
                        bit, only got worse.

           Bobby can’t disagree.  Feeling the pressure of Rico around 
           also.  A moment, then he playfully hip checks Angela to break 
           her dour mood.  Teases her:

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Man, you’re such a baddass, prima.  

                                 ANGELA
                             (smirks)
                        You know it.

           Both laugh.  And this little move...this subtle way to show 
           that he understands...is why she loves Bobby.  And so do we.  

           EXT. PARKING LOT - SANTA BARBARA COUNTY BOWL - LATE NIGHT

           The concert is over.  The crew is winding their way through 
           rows of cars.  The massive hillside they were on behind them.  
           The paid crowd is everywhere, leaving also.

           Rico is still sour -- glances over at Angela as she walks 
           close to Bobby.  Eddie’s keeping his distance from both of 
           them -- in the doghouse with one and afraid of the other.

                                 RICO
                             (motions to Bobby)
                        Primo.  Wanna talk to you.

           OFF Bobby’s reluctant look...

                                                              TIME CUT:
           RICO AND BOBBY - WALKING

           A row over and out of earshot are the rest of the crew.  
           Bobby doesn’t like being singled out.  But he sees the dark 
           drunken state Rico is in.  He’s stuck.

                                 RICO
                             (all smiles)
                        Sorry about earlier, homes.  You 
                        know I got a short fuse...

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        It’s Ange you should say sorry to.

           Rico grits his teeth, trying to keep his anger in check.  
           Nearly slurring his words from being so screwed up.

                                 RICO
                        I know.  I’m just saying...see the 
                        way you handled that shit up there?  
                        That’s why they look up to you.  
                        You’re the glue...

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        And you’re high.

                                 RICO
                        Still know what I’m talking about.  
                        Look, there’s two arms to any real 
                        crew... 
                             (motions to others)
                        They’re the left -- the money 
                        makers.  We, primo?  We’re the 
                        right arm -- the warriors.  It’s 
                        our duty to lead them.  Defend our 
                        barrio.  That’s the way the OGs 
                        taught me...like I’m trying to 
                        teach you.

           Bobby starts to rebuke this notion, but knows there’s no 
           reasoning with Rico right now.  Especially as Rico puts his 
           arm around him.

                                 RICO
                        Got real high hopes for you, ese.

           Bobby stays silent.  Discreetly glances over at Angela and 
           the others.  Sees they’re all still watching the exchange.

           EXT. BEACH - SILVER STRAND - OXNARD, CA - DAY

           The sun is overhead.  Val lies by herself on a beach towel -- 
           bikini and sunglasses on. 
           OUT IN THE SURF

           Bobby shreds a choppy wave with usual skill and aggression.  
           He’s a far cut above the plethora of novice surfers out today.  

           He rides the wave until the end and kicks out.

           TIGHT ON - VAL

           Watching him.

                                                              TIME CUT:

           EXT. BEACH - SILVER STRAND - OXNARD, CA - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby walks up with his board, sits down next to Val in the 
           sand.  A smile on his glistening wet face.  Val smiles back. 

                                 VAL
                        Should I be impressed?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (facetious)
                        Hells yeah.

                                 VAL
                        Well I am.  You’re really good from 
                        what I can tell.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Maybe it’s just ‘cause the others 
                        out there really suck.

                                 VAL
                        That’s probably it.

           They both laugh. 

                                 VAL
                        How’d you get into surfing anyway?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        My pops...when I was eight.  
                        Probably thought it would keep me 
                        outta trouble.

                                 VAL
                        Did it?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Sort of.
                                 VAL
                        You’re lucky you have a dad like 
                        that.  Mine split before I was 
                        born.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        So you and Issac have different 
                        fathers then?

                                 VAL
                             (shrugs)
                        We got an older half-sister, too.  
                        Guess my mom got around.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Doesn’t make her a bad person 
                        though.

           Val doesn’t answer that, changes it up:

                                 VAL
                        Speaking of trouble, I know you’re 
                        “cliqued up” West Side and all 
                        that, but word is your crew’s more 
                        about partying...

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (laughs)
                        Wait, you checked up on me?

                                 VAL
                        Well I’m just asking, because I 
                        don’t wanna get stuck in the middle 
                        of anything.  I heard things are 
                        escalating again...  

           Bobby can’t look her in the eyes.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        If I had it my way, there wouldn’t 
                        be an East or West period.  
                        Actually sick of it.

           Val senses his sincerity.  Nods.

                                 VAL
                        Me, too.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (beat)
                        Wait, maybe I better check up on 
                        you?
                                 VAL
                             (smiles)
                        Hey, I’m squeaky clean -- 

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (laughs)
                        -- yeah right.

           Just as things start to ease with them, Bobby suddenly sees 
           something in the parking lot.  Theo Algonzi and two of his 
           surf crew are next to Bobby’s Impala.  Bobby stands up:

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Shit --

           Val turns and sees what he’s looking at.  Algonzi stares down 
           Bobby, then punctures the rear tire of the Impala.  Stays 
           right there -- taunting Bobby to come face him.

           Bobby goes into attack mode, ready to brawl.  Starts to head 
           that way, but Val jumps up and stops him.

                                 VAL
                        Whoa, you just gonna leave me here?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        He ruined my tire --

                                 VAL
                        -- there’s three of them, Bobby.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Don’t care -- I’ll kick it off with 
                        all these fools.

                                 VAL
                        Hey --

           Val gently turns his face toward hers.  There’s serious fire 
           in his eyes, but something in her expression calms him.  The 
           fact that she understands his frustration.  Because she grew 
           up around it as well. 

                                 VAL
                        You got a spare, right?

           Bobby watches Algonzi and crew flip him off, yelling “pussy”  
           -- realizing he’s not coming to fight.  As they leave, it 
           takes every bit of strength Bobby has not to chase them down.

           As he looks back at Val, both gauge each other...
           EXT. EAST SIDE BARRIO - SANTA BARBARA - DUSK

           Bobby’s wounded lowrider rolls into frame.  Stock tire on 
           with a rusted rim -- a contrast from those three shiny 22s. 

           They pull up in front of a newer apartment building.

           INT. IMPALA - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby’s leery of being in East Side.  Already sees a few 
           YOUNG EASTSIDERS on the corner checking him out.    

           Val looks over, sees Bobby’s concern.  Fact is, she’s 
           concerned also -- knows the rules of rival neighborhoods.

                                 VAL
                        Pull around back into the garage... 
                        I’ll get out there.

           Bobby looks a bit relieved.  Drives around to the back of the 
           building.  Val reaches in her purse, hits a garage clicker.  
           The metal gate to the communal parking garage opens up -- 

           Bobby pulls inside and comes to a stop near the rear door.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Sorry about the drama.

                                 VAL
                        Thought you handled it like a man.  
                        Not a punk like them.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Thanks.

           The two lock stares.  Still gauging each other.  There’s 
           serious chemistry here.  And it makes Bobby pause -- he 
           really likes her.  Knows this would mean a commitment. 

           Val moves her face closer to his.  Smiles:

                                 VAL
                        For being so shy...you sure get all 
                        fired up.  

           Bobby isn’t shying away now.  Moves closer.  Their faces 
           inches apart.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Only when I’m messed with...or 
                        someone I care about.

                                 VAL
                        The protector.  I like that.
           Closer.  Feeling each other’s breath.  Eyes locked. 

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        What else you like?

           A beat, staring.  Their lips come together.

                                                          SHOCK CUT TO:

           EXT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby backs her up against the wall.  Kissing each other 
           intensely.  He starts unbuttoning her blouse.  Then slides  
           his hands inside, caressing her soft skin.  

           She exhales, tries to maintain.  Their lips part for a 
           moment.  Looking at each other.  Their breaths quick and 
           short.  Until the sexual tension overtakes them again --

           Val kisses him deep -- pushes him back and they fall on her 
           bed.  Their hands wander without restraint, exploring each 
           other’s bodies.  She seductively climbs on top of him.   

           Hips gently rocking.  Staring at each other.  They begin to 
           make love.  

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Bobby lies in her bed.  Smiling.  Spent.  A quiet moment, 
           then he looks over -- realizes Val is standing by the 
           bathroom door in her robe.  Watching him.

           There’s a strange, impassive look on her face.  The opposite 
           one would think after their passionate encounter.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Something wrong?

                                 VAL
                        You can leave if you want to...     
                        no worries, no promises.  

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Where’s that coming from?

                                 VAL
                        I’m not gonna be some hoochie you 
                        can booty call whenever you want.  
                        It ain’t gonna work like that.         
                        You feelin' me?  

           Bobby looks at her, trying to figure out what’s going on.
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Yeah, I’m feelin’ you.  Wouldn’t 
                        treat you like that anyways.

           Val’s face softens a bit.

                                 VAL
                        Come here, I wanna show you 
                        something.

           Bobby nods, follows Val out to another bedroom door.  She 
           opens it.  Inside is a little girl’s room filled with pink 
           and frills.  Pictures of Val and an adorable toddler.

                                 VAL
                        My little girl’s at the sitters... 
                        until I pick her up later.  She 
                        just turned three.

           Val looks at Bobby, makes her point. 

                                 VAL
                        This is why I moved.  To get out of 
                        my mom’s crappy single room dump... 
                        so Angel has a better life. 

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Where’s her father?

           Val answers in a matter of fact tone -- attempting to shield 
           the pain and hardships she’s faced.  But it’s still evident.

                                 VAL
                        He wants nothing to do with us.  
                        But hey, we got a good life going 
                        here.  And I might be a single mom, 
                        like mine, but I’m not gonna be 
                        like her -- sitting on my ass 
                        collecting welfare, going nowhere. 
                        The minute I can afford a three-
                        bedroom, I’m getting my brother, 
                        Issac away from there, too.

           Val suddenly looks vulnerable -- all of her cards laid out on 
           the table now.  

                                 VAL
                        You still feelin’ me?

           Val seems ready for Bobby to run for the hills.  To her 
           pleasant surprise, he doesn’t.  Simply smiles.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        You said your daughter’s name is 
                        Angel?
                                 VAL
                             (nods)
                        Because that’s what she is.  

           Bobby nods back, sincere:

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        I’d like to meet her.

           Val smiles, touched.  Bobby takes her into his arms.

           INT. CRASH PAD - WEST SIDE BARRIO - EVENING

           Cruiser and Eddie are on the couch, watching the Lakers game.  
           Rico walks in, agitated -- amped up on something.

                                 RICO
                        What’s up?

                                 CRUISER
                        Watching the Lakers kill Sac.  
                        Gonna make a few drops after.

                                 RICO
                        Where’s Bobby?

                                 EDDIE
                        Nada.  Hasn’t been around.

                                 RICO
                        Whatever.  Come on, let’s go make 
                        some money.  You can ride with me --

           They look outside and see a shiny ESCALADE parked outside.

                                 EDDIE
                        Where’d you pimp the Eskie, homes?

                                 RICO
                        A gift.  

                                 CRUISER
                        Can’t make drops in a stolen ride, 
                        ese.  We’ll get hooked for sure.

                                 RICO
                        I told you it’s a gift.  Clean and 
                        mean.  Got some OG love for layin’ 
                        down their cut. 

                                 EDDIE
                             (lights up)
                        Damn, what do we get?
                                 RICO
                        The privilege of riding with me. 

           Eddie laughs, gets up.  Ready to roll.  Cruiser still looks 
           wary, but goes along with it and gets up also.

           EXT. ZETA TAU FRAT HOUSE - UCSB - GOLETA, CA - NIGHT

           Rico pulls up outside in the Escalade.  Eddie next to him, 
           Cruiser in back.  The small dufflebag of weed at his feet.  

           Cruiser sends a text message, looks toward the door of the 
           frat house.  A moment, then two of the milktoast Frat Guys 
           who bought from the crew at the beach appear and head over.   

           One is LANCE.  The other is TROY.  Both move over to Eddie’s 
           passenger window, all wanna-be street attitude:

                                 LANCE
                        What up, homies.  I’m ready to get 
                        blunted.

                                 TROY
                        Hear this new chronic rocks the 
                        house, dawg.

                                 EDDIE
                        Crushes.

           Lance bumps fists with Eddie.

                                 LANCE
                        Bring that cush then --

           Rico simply smiles.  Listening to their “gangster talk.”    
           He motions to Lance’s stainless steel watch --

                                 RICO
                        Dude, is that a Rolex?

                                 LANCE
                             (proud)
                        Submariner, homie.  

           Rico looks at both Cruiser and Eddie.  Laughs.  

                                 RICO
                        Damn, I shoulda went to college.  
                        Dude’s got it made in the shade.

           The tone of his voice is eerie.  Malicious.  Cruiser and Eddie 
           pick up on it.  The Frat Guys don’t, they just laugh back.

                                 RICO
                        So how much you want?
                                 TROY
                        Usual quarter-ounce.

           Troy palms a $100 bill.  Slips it to Eddie.  Cruiser is about 
           to grab a zip-lock baggie out of the dufflebag, but sees Rico 
           suddenly lean over in his seat toward Eddie’s window --

                                 RICO
                        Uh uh.

           Both Frat Guys shit their pants and freeze as Rico holds a 
           GLOCK .45 below the door, pointed right at their chins.  

           Eddie and Cruiser freeze also -- this is Rico’s show now.

                                 RICO
                        How much you holding, Cruiser?

                                 CRUISER
                             (looks down at the dufflebag)
                        Full half.

                                 RICO
                        Good.  Rollers like this need to 
                        step up into the big leagues.      
                        A half-pound it is.

                                 LANCE
                        Wait, we only wanted the quarter --

                                 RICO
                        -- don’t care what you want.  I’m 
                        telling you what you’re buying.  A 
                        half-pound.  Which means you owe us 
                        1500 bones.  Right the hell now.  
                        And every week from here --
                             (motions to the gun)
                        -- or you’ll be smokin’ this blunt.

           Both college kids are too scared to speak.  Rico relishes 
           having the power.  Lets it simmer for a moment.  

                                 LANCE
                             (stuttering)
                        We...we don’t have that much cash.

                                 RICO
                             (all heart)
                        No worries.  I know we just sprung 
                        this shit on you.  I’ll hold that 
                        fat-ass Rolex for collateral, until 
                        next week.

           Lance is so frightened, he practically rips the Rolex off his 
           wrist and hands it to Rico.  Rico motions to Cruiser:
                                 RICO
                             (pure sarcasm)
                        Hand these gangsters their 
                        “chronic.”

           Eddie grins.  Cruiser doesn’t.  It’s suddenly clear to him -- 
           Rico is muscling in on their business.  But, Cruiser stays 
           quiet knowing Rico’s strapped.  Hands the full dufflebag to 
           the shaking college kids.

                                 RICO
                        See you next week, homies.

           Rico drives off, leaving the stunned kids holding the 
           dufflebag of weed in his rearview.

                                 RICO
                        I think Eminem on the left just 
                        pissed himself.

                                 EDDIE
                             (laughs)
                        We’re makin’ some real money now.

           Rico knows he has his hooks into Eddie, bumps fists with him.

                                 RICO
                        Only the beginning, homes.

           OFF Cruiser in back, trying to hold his anger.

           EXT. HAYWARD LUMBER COMPANY - SANTA BARBARA - MORNING

           Bobby and his father load 2x4s and other BUILDING SUPPLIES 
           onto a huge steel cart.  Working in unison.  But, Bobby 
           definitely has something on his mind.  A beat, debating.  
           Subtly checks that no one is in earshot, then:

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Was your dad really in prison for 
                        murder? 

           Bob Sr. stops what he’s doing.  Knew this day and question 
           would come.  He nods yes.

                                 BOB SR.
                        He stabbed a man.  In a fight.  Did 
                        fifteen years...before I was born.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Why didn’t you ever tell me?

                                 BOB SR.
                        Didn’t want it to influence you the 
                        wrong way.
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        How?

                                 BOB SR.
                        Some see it as a badge of honor.  
                        Look at Rico --

           Neither needs to say it, this is who told Bobby.

                                 BOB SR.
                        Your abuelo would be the first to 
                        tell you it isn’t.  He was ashamed.  
                        Lucky for me, I felt the same.

           Bobby realizes how much his father has tried to protect him.

                                 BOB SR.
                        Why do you think I took you to the 
                        beach when you were young?  I get 
                        you into that water...it’s the 
                        furthest place from the influences 
                        of the neighborhood.
                             (makes his point)
                        But you’re a man now, son.  Nobody 
                        can walk in your shoes for you. 

           Bobby nods, smiles at his father.  The grateful look is 
           better than a thousand words.  Sr. smiles back -- knows he’ll 
           have to trust his boy to make the right decisions as a man. 

                                 BOB SR.
                        Now quit loafing around.

           Bobby laughs.  As the two continue to work in unison...

           EXT. LILLY'S TAQUERIA - AFTERNOON

           Best tacos in town, a block off State Street.  Bobby sits 
           across from Angela at an outdoor table.  Stuffing their faces.

                                 ANGELA
                        So she gave it up, huh?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        I never said that.

                                 ANGELA
                        Shiiiiit, you just did.  And you 
                        still like her?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (evasive)
                        Val’s good people.

           Angela smirks.
                                 ANGELA
                        You’re in love.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Whatever.  
                             (beat)
                        You know she has a kid?

                                 ANGELA
                        Yeah, didn’t want it to scare you 
                        off.  Why...does it?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (shakes his head)
                        No.  Actually think it’s amazing 
                        how she does it all on her own.

                                 ANGELA
                        That girl don’t depend on nobody.  
                        Told you she’s cool.
                             (OFF Bobby’s nod)
                        Okay, I approve.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Good to know.

           Mutual smirks.

                                 ANGELA
                        Think I’m gonna dust Eddie.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (surprised)
                        Why?  You guys been together since 
                        high school.

                                 ANGELA
                        It's like he's becoming Rico's 
                        bitch.  All up his ass.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Thought Eddie was your bitch?

                                 ANGELA
                        That's what I'm saying.

           They laugh, still eating.

                                 ANGELA
                        Seriously, it’s like Rico's trying 
                        to control everyone.  Tell you 
                        right now, he ain't controlling me.
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Who could.
                             (OFF her cocky grin)
                        You’re seriously breaking up with 
                        Eddie?

                                 ANGELA
                             (beat)
                        I don’t know.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Come on, lets go soak that hot head 
                        of yours before you do something 
                        you regret.

           As they get up from the table, Bobby sees something that 
           alarms him -- pushes Angela inside the restaurant to hide.  

                                 ANGELA
                        What?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (motions outside)
                        East Side.

           As they peer out a window --

           THEIR POV - ON THE STREET

           A METALLIC BLUE LOWRIDER full of VATOS with serious stares 
           drives by, scrutinizing each place.

                                 ANGELA
                        Rollin’ deep, too.

           Bobby notices the one driving is Sleeper -- remembers his 
           vengeful stare as the banger kneeled over his fallen homeboy 
           who Rico stabbed in the alley.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Knew this tension would come.

           Angela nods in agreement.  Both stay inside until the coast 
           is clear.  Taking the threat serious.  That’s because it is.

           EXT. OCEAN - RINCON POINT - CARPINTERIA - DAY

           Outside the break, Carl and Angela stand up on old longboards 
           that Carl brought -- each paddling with an oar, Hawaiian-
           style.  One of the latest fads, and a serious workout.

           Carl sweats profusely, loving the challenge.  Digging hard 
           with his oar, trying to stay balanced in the strong tide.    
           He checks his watch for a moment, then keeps paddling. 
           Angela is sweating also, barely moving, and over it.  It’s 
           obvious they’ve been formally introduced at this point:

                                 ANGELA
                        Screw this -- it’s too much work.

                                 CARL
                             (laughs)
                        Kinda the point.

           Angela gets frustrated and sits down on her board.

                                 ANGELA
                        Whatever, I'm laying out.

           She lies back on the plank and soaks in the sun.  Carl shakes 
           his head and continues his paddle-workout.  He checks his 
           watch again.  Angela notices:

                                 ANGELA
                        Dude, you’re making me nervous.  
                        What, you gotta be somewhere?

                                 CARL
                        Was supposed to be home a hour ago.

                                 ANGELA
                        Short leash, huh?

                                 CARL
                        Hey, I’m the man of my house.

                                 ANGELA
                             (smirks)
                        Yeah right.

           Both laugh.  Carl sighs, sits down on his board for a break 
           also.  He looks toward the back side of a six-foot wave  
           rolling fiercely.  Just about to crash and explode -- when  
           Bobby emerges -- blasting up into the air out of the wave, 
           rail-gripping his board.  Lands in the water with expertise. 

                                 CARL
                        Why doesn’t Bobby compete in 
                        surfing? 

                                 ANGELA
                             (shrugs)
                        The ocean’s just an escape to him.  
                        Don’t think he’s ever thought of it 
                        as anything else...

                                 CARL
                        Sure waste of talent.
           Bobby paddles up, sees both of them staring at him.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        What?  You guys talkin’ shit?

                                 ANGELA
                        Wouldn’t waste our breath on you.  
                        Got better things to do.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Yeah right.
                             (looks at Carl)
                        Lets see you rip one on that gun, 
                        big dog.

           A moment, then Carl starts to rub his knee.

                                 CARL
                        I’m done, man.  Knee is killing me.  
                        Price of football.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Wait, did you play pro?

                                 CARL
                        For five minutes.  Blew my knee in 
                        Raiders training camp.  Was only 
                        one game short of the regular 
                        season, too.  

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (lights up)
                        Damn, you almost made the Raiders?  
                        Love the Raiders!

                                 CARL
                        What I wouldn’t give to live that 
                        life...best day job in the world 
                        being a pro athlete.

           This seems to resonate with Bobby.  Angela can’t help a grin, 
           knowing what Carl is up to.

                                 CARL
                        Ever think about trying it with 
                        surfing?  You got the goods...

           Bobby smirks and eyeballs Angela.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Now I know who’s been talking shit.

                                 ANGELA
                        Ain’t me -- he’s the one who 
                        brought it up.
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Uh huh.

           The look on Bobby’s face says he’s definitely thought about 
           it though.  Just not ready to admit it.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Not sure surfing comps is my dream 
                        job.  Would rather just surf.

                                 ANGELA
                        That’s so stupid.  Surfing is 
                        surfing.  Why not get paid for it?

                                 CARL
                        Smart girl here.  You should 
                        listen.

           Bobby mulls it over, staring at the waves.  

                                 CARL
                        Look, I’m with the Ventura Surf 
                        Club and we’re putting on a small 
                        contest this weekend.  Nothing 
                        fancy.  I’ll sign you up as my 
                        guest.  Come give it a shot.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        I don’t know...

                                 ANGELA
                        Seriously, you’re gonna turn down a 
                        day of surfing?

                                 CARL
                        Yeah, what do you got to lose?

           A beat, then Bobby finally grins. 

           EXT. C-STREET - VENTURA, CA - DAY

           On the beach is a tiny sponsored competition by local shop 
           owners, restaurateurs and bars.  About a half dozen small 
           tables and tents are on the sand.  Surfers and their families 
           and normal beachgoers mingle.

           IN THE PARKING LOT

           Bobby’s Impala pulls up, surfboards on top.  Bobby and Val 
           get out.  Angela, Freddy and Cruiser pile out from the back.  
           All in their normal gangster attire -- peering out at the 
           very white crowd.  Some heads turn.

                                 CRUISER
                        Damn, where’s all the brown people?
           Bobby nervously grabs his board and wetsuit.  They walk 
           toward the beach and find Carl who’s all smiles.  One of his 
           longboards in his grip.  Bobby does the introductions:

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Hey, Carl.
                             (motions)
                        This is Val.  Cruiser and Freddy.

                                 CARL
                        Nice to meet you guys.  Any of you 
                        surf, too?

                                 CRUISER
                        Hells no.  No sand in the crack for 
                        me, homie.

           Carl laughs, motions to his ten foot gun.

                                 CARL
                        I entered the longboard class.  
                        Going old school.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Nice.  Is your family coming?

                                 CARL
                        Nah, they’re not into this.

           Bobby notices Carl’s underlying disappointment, switches 
           gears:

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Okay, so what do I do?

                                 CARL
                        Simple.  I signed you up in the 
                        men’s open class.  It’s one heat.  
                        Best rider wins.  Easy as that. 

           OFF Bobby’s anxious breath...

           EXT. OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby and his heat of TEN LOCAL SURFERS bob in the ocean on 
           their boards.  Some talk shit in a friendly manner, trying to 
           mess with their buddies.  One looks over at Bobby --

                                 SURFER
                        You Carl’s friend?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Yeah.
                                 SURFER
                        He sure talked you up.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Great.  

           The guy laughs, sharing a smile with Bobby.  Then -- an 
           AIRHORN blasts and the surfers all take off.  

           ON BOBBY

           Still sitting there on his board, unsure.

           ON THE BEACH

           Carl and Bobby’s crew watch from the shoreline.

                                 CARL
                        What’s he doing?

                                 ANGELA
                        Meditating.

                                 CRUISER
                        I call it choking.

                                 FREDDY
                        Maybe he’s just waiting for the 
                        right wave.

                                 VAL
                             (yells, cheering him on)
                        Come on, Bobby!

           OUT IN THE OCEAN

           Bobby seems to hear Val.  He blows out a nervous breath, then  
           begins paddling.  Hands cutting through the water.  Slowly at 
           first then faster --

           The powerful elevator ride begins rising behind him.

           He thrusts up into his signature hulking stance and drops 
           into a wave.  Quickly starts to maneuver, aggressively 
           cutting back and forth --

           ON THE BEACH

           The gang roots him on, excited.  Carl is thrilled -- it’s as 
           if he’s living his dream through Bobby now.

           IN THE WATER

           Past the nervous jitters, Bobby puts on a clinic with 
           aggressive maneuvers.  
           His back hand trails, fingers slicing through the water -- 
           cuts so hard into the face of the wave that he’s suddenly 
           scaling vertically up the wall.  Finishes with a 360 aerial.

           ON THE BEACH

           The small crowd cheers loud, extremely impressed.  A few guys 
           nudge Carl, ribbing him.

                                 GUY #1
                        Nice sandbagger, Carl.  Where’d you 
                        find this kid?

                                 CARL
                        It’s his first tournament.  Can you 
                        believe it?

                                 GUY #2
                             (smirks)
                        No, I don’t.

           Angela, Val, Cruiser and Freddy hear Bobby getting props.   
           It makes them all smile proudly.

           EXT. SCORER’S TABLE - BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           A few small surf trophies sit on the table.  One of the EVENT 
           DIRECTORS hands them out one at a time:

                                 EVENT DIRECTOR
                        And in the men’s open division, 
                        first place goes to Bobby Martinez.

           Everybody claps as Bobby takes his trophy.  He looks at it 
           with pride, then moves over to his crew.  Gladly takes a kiss 
           from Val.  And nobody is more thrilled for him than Angela.

                                 FREDDY
                        You crushed ‘em, Bobby!  Will you 
                        be in the magazines?!

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Nah, this was just small time. 

                                 ANGELA
                             (ribs Freddy)
                        Kinda like your dick.

           Freddy flexes his wiry frame.  Grabs his crotch.

                                 FREDDY
                        Shiiiiit, then this was like the 
                        Superbowl.  NBA Finals, homes.

           As they all laugh --
           LONG LENS - POV

           Someone watches the crew surrounding Bobby as he bumps fists 
           with Freddy who beams.

           TIGHT ON - RICO

           In his parked Escalade.  Scrutinizing the scene with a 
           jealous expression.  Next to him is Eddie. 

                                 RICO
                        No more half-steppin’ this shit...

           A moment, then Rico drives off.

           BACK ON THE BEACH

           Carl approaches Bobby and crew with a GUY (late 50s), salt 
           and pepper hair and beard.  Definitely an old-time surfer.

                                 CARL
                        Bobby, this is Al Merrick.  He owns 
                        Channel Island boards --

           Bobby shakes hands with Merrick.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Hey, it’s nice to meet you.

                                 AL MERRICK
                        Likewise.  That was some impressive 
                        surfing.  Enough so that I’d like 
                        to make you a custom board.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        For reals?

                                 FREDDY
                        Like for free?

           Merrick smiles, seeing the crew’s excitement.

                                 AL MERRICK
                        I make it my business to support 
                        local surfers who show promise. 
                             (to Bobby)
                        Far as I’m concerned, that’s you.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Damn, thank you.

                                 AL MERRICK
                        You know where our shop is?
                             (OFF Bobby’s nod)
                        Whenever you want, come on in.
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        I definitely will.

           As Merrick leaves, Carl smirks at Bobby, mocking him:

                                 CARL
                        “I don’t know if I wanna surf 
                        comps...I’m too cool for that.”

           Bobby laughs at his own expense along with everyone -- looks 
           at Carl with gratitude. 

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Thanks for everything, homie. 

                                 CARL
                        Hey, life’s hard enough when you’re 
                        not living the dream.  I know.

           OFF their fists bumping...

           INT. CRASH PAD - DAY

           Freddy walks in alone, stops -- sees Rico, Eddie and some of 
           the VATOS we’ve seen here before.  All are staring at him.  
           Freddy stares back tentatively.

                                 FREDDY
                        Hey Rico, you wanted to talk to me?

           Rico’s intense eyes are like lasers.

                                 RICO
                        I’ve had my eyes on you, cholito.  
                        Been watching real close -- 

                                 FREDDY
                             (beat)
                        You have?

                                 RICO
                        Real close.

           Rico gets up, face of stone.  Moves over to Freddy, puts a 
           hand on his shoulder.  A tense moment, then Rico smiles:

                                 RICO
                        And I like what I see.  You ready?

                                 FREDDY
                             (looks around)
                        Does Bobby know?
                                 RICO
                        Doesn’t matter, homes.  I’m the one 
                        giving you this honor.  Not him.  
                        You down or not?

           Eddie chimes in, wanting to show Rico he’s backing his play:

                                 EDDIE
                        You know you been wantin’ this, 
                        Freddy.  What’s it gonna be?

           Freddy knows this is a serious decision.  Finally nods.

                                 FREDDY
                        Totally down.  This is mi familia.

           Eddie and the others get up and surround Freddy with hardened 
           stares.  Ready to pass their legacy onto the youngster.   
           Make him “blood-in/blood-out.”

                                 RICO
                        Simon.  Por vida.

           Freddy tries to remain brave and takes off his shirt -- 
           clenches his fists.  Rico takes the first vicious swing and 
           cold-cocks Freddy.  Freddy falls, then gets up, ready for 
           more.  Mouth bleeding.  And now, all of them start swinging --

           EXT. STATE STREET - SANTA BARBARA - DAY

           Bobby walks with Val and her little girl, ANGEL, as the rest 
           of the Santa Barbara locals and tourist go about their 
           business.  Angel is as cute as they come, her lily face full 
           of life.  She’s the spitting image of her proud young mom.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        So what do you wanna be when you 
                        grow up, Angel?

                                 ANGEL
                             (shy)
                        I dunno.

           Bobby shares a laugh with Val.

                                 VAL
                        What about you?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (thinks it over)
                        Surfing for a living would sure be 
                        unreal.
                                 VAL
                        Like Carl said...gotta go for your 
                        dreams, right?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        What’s yours then?  

                                 VAL
                             (motions to Angel)
                        Simple.  Making sure she has 
                        options that I didn’t.  

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        And you’re doing it, but there’s 
                        still gotta be something for you?

                                 VAL
                        Well, I love traveling.  

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Have you gone anywhere yet?

                                 VAL
                             (smiles)
                        Angel and I have been to Hawaii.  
                        New York.  Miami.  Oh, and Puerto 
                        Vallarta.

                                 ANGEL
                        ...I been Hawaii...

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        You have?  Man, you beat me.  I 
                        haven’t even been out of the state.

                                 VAL
                        That’s something you gotta change. 

           Bobby smiles back at her, then sees two familiar faces up 
           ahead.  It’s Troy and Lance, the two frat guys.  

           Their smiles fade when they see Bobby approaching -- figuring 
           he’s on the same page with Rico.  They awkwardly walk across 
           the street to avoid Bobby.  A sense of fear in their eyes.

           It catches Bobby off guard.  Val’s noticed the exchange.

                                 VAL
                        Do you know those guys?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Yeah, but don’t know what that was 
                        about.
           Bobby looks behind him -- sees the frat guys glance back as 
           well, then disappear.  The tension is troubling to Bobby.  

           His cell phone BEEPS.  He checks it, sees a text message from 
           Cruiser:  “Rico jumped in Freddy.”  

           The news hits Bobby like a ton of bricks.  

                                 VAL
                        Everything alright?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (covers with a smile)
                        Yeah, it’s all good.  Maybe I 
                        should get you guys back.

           Val doesn’t pry.  But knows whatever just rocked him is real.

                                 VAL
                        Okay.

           EXT. BLUFFS - ISLA VISTA - NIGHT

           A well-known local party spot high above the city of Isla 
           Vista and the campus of UCSB.  A BONFIRE rages.  Surrounding 
           it is the West Side crew.  Drinking, smoking blunts, laughing 
           it up.  HIP HOP bumps hard from a lowrider with its top down.

           Headlights approach, then Bobby’s Impala swings in.  He gets 
           out, Angela with him.  Both see Cruiser who motions to --

           FREDDY

           Showing the physical aftermath of the beating.  But feeling 
           no pain as he sways to the music, high as a 747.  All 
           gangster attitude, eyes barely open, until he stumbles and 
           falls.  Rico laughs hard and picks him up out of the dirt -- 
           puts his arm around the 13 year old like a proud father.  

           Rico’s drunken eyes swing toward Bobby’s with a shit-eating 
           grin.  Clocked Bobby the minute he arrived on scene.  

           Angela sees Eddie, steps to him as Bobby storms over to Rico --

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (motions to Freddy)
                        We should’ve talked about this --

                                 RICO
                        Wasn’t your call, homes.  Youngster 
                        wanted to become a man.  Hell, he’s 
                        down now.
                                 FREDDY
                             (almost unintelligible)
                        Simon...Westsider por vida...ese.

                                 RICO
                        See?  Kid’s got real heart.  Took 
                        it like a champ.  This is mi 
                        carnale right here.

                                 FREDDY
                        -- mi carnale --

           Bobby shakes his head as Rico basically holds Freddy up from 
           falling down completely.  

           Another argument gets everyone’s attention.  Angela is right 
           in Eddie’s face -- shouting at him, knowing he was a part of 
           it.  But Eddie stands up to her this time, shouts right back.  

                                 RICO
                             (laughs)
                        Uh oh.  Trouble in paradise.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Bet you’re all heart-broken, huh?

                                 RICO
                        Hey I can’t help it if mi hermana’s 
                        got a big mouth.

           Rico thrives on the tension.  Glares at Bobby, as if daring 
           him to make a stand.  Cruiser, Solid and others are all 
           watching closely. 

                                 RICO
                        Guess you were right, primo.  You 
                        ain’t callin’ the shots here.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Never said I was.

           Bobby looks at Freddy, still staggering.  Knows it’s too late 
           to do anything about it now.  He shakes his head, starts to 
           walk back to his Impala.  Rico shouts after him:

                                 RICO
                        Hey -- it was great seein’ you.  
                        Don’t you worry, we got a real good 
                        handle on things.

           Bobby keeps walking.  Rico doesn’t relent:

                                 RICO
                        And don’t think I don’t know your 
                        chica lives in East Side.
           Bobby snaps -- turns and starts back toward Rico.  Cruiser 
           sees the impending wreck, rushes over and stops Bobby.  

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (shouts, to Rico)
                        She ain’t got nothing to do with 
                        this!  You hear me?!

                                 RICO
                        Everything has to do with this!

           Cruiser holds Bobby back, seeing Rico’s rage-filled eyes -- 
           knows Rico’s ready to spill blood.  Meanwhile --

           Solid stays an island, not choosing sides.  Eddie’s made his.

           TIGHT ON - BOBBY

           Still wanting to fight Rico.  But Cruiser keeps a firm hold --

                                 CRUISER
                             (low, to Bobby)
                        He’s strapped -- don’t do it. 

           Angela moves up next to them, concerned.  Cruiser motions 
           toward the Impala:

                                 CRUISER
                        Get him outta here, Ange.

           Angela knows it’s the right call.  

                                 ANGELA
                        Come on, Bobby.  Let’s go --

           Bobby finally relents after one last hard stare at Rico.  
           Jumps into the Impala and heads off, Angela with him.

           TIGHT ON - RICO

           Gloating.  Knows he’s gaining control of this clique.

           INT. IMPALA - MOMENTS LATER

           Driving.  Bobby is still furious.  Their tight crew coming 
           apart at the seams.  Angela’s feeling the tension also, tries 
           to make light of things:

                                 ANGELA
                        Can you believe it?  Eddie had the 
                        balls to break up with me first --

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (shakes his head)
                        -- no he didn’t.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ (CONT'D)
                        Rico pushed him to do it.  Just 
                        like he did with jumping in Freddy.

           Angela chooses her words:

                                 ANGELA
                        Look, you know I’m on your side, 
                        but Freddy didn’t have to say yes. 

           Bobby doesn’t respond.  Angela lets it go, seeing his 
           conflicted expression.

                                 ANGELA
                        Guess I’m supposed to move out now, 
                        right?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        You ain’t goin’ nowhere.  It’s your 
                        brother who’s hittin’ bricks.  And 
                        Eddie can go with him --

           Suddenly, police lights illuminate the back window...then a 
           bright search light which makes them both squint.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Great.  You holding?

                                 ANGELA
                        No.

                                                              TIME CUT:

           EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

           Bobby and Angela stand tense with their hands on the back of 
           the police car.  An OFFICER hovers -- watching them closely.  
           His hand riding his holstered gun.

           Meanwhile, a SECOND OFFICER searches inside the Impala.  
           Comes up empty handed and heads back.  Shoots a nod to his 
           partner.  “It’s clean.”

                                 OFFICER #2
                        Either of you have gang tats 
                        identifying your set?

           Angela shakes her head, all attitude.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        I just have regular ink on me.

                                 OFFICER #2
                             (motions to Bobby)
                        Please remove your shirt so I can 
                        photograph them for our records.
           Bobby complies, trying to keep his cool.  Stands with his 
           shirt off as Officer #2 uses his camera phone to snap a few 
           pictures of his torso -- front, back and sides.

                                 OFFICER #2
                        Any on your legs?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        No.

           Officer #2 motions to put his shirt back on.  Bobby does.

                                 OFFICER #2
                        I’m citing you for the tinted 
                        windows.  Also for having no mud 
                        flaps.  Any questions?

                                 ANGELA
                        Mud flaps?  It’s an Impala, man.

                                 OFFICER #2
                        The custom rims are oversized for 
                        this vehicle, therefore mud flaps 
                        are required by law.  I could have 
                        it towed if you like --

           Angela starts to fire right back, but Bobby cuts her off 
           before things get worse.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        No, we got it.  Thanks.

           The officer holds out his ticket book for Bobby.

                                 OFFICER #2
                        Sign here.

           Bobby does.  The officer rips out the signed ticket and hands 
           it to him.  Motions that they can head back to their car.

                                 OFFICER
                        Please enter back onto the road 
                        safely.

           Bobby and Angela walk to the Impala and get in.

           INSIDE THE IMPALA

           Angela is seething, not ready to let it go, when that’s just 
           what Bobby wants to do.  He starts the car.

                                 ANGELA
                        I’ll stick a “mud flap” up his 
                        culo.  Tired of gettin’ hassled --
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Just forget it, alright?  We’ve had 
                        enough drama tonight.

           Angela shakes her head as Bobby heads back onto the road, 
           leaving the cops behind.  Angela looks over at him:

                                 ANGELA
                        Lets get blitzed.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Hells yeah.

           EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

           Bobby’s Impala pulls up and parks along the street adjacent 
           to the store’s small parking lot.

           INT. IMPALA - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby looks over.  Angela seems deep in thought.

                                 ANGELA
                        I think we should become cops.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        What?  You serious??

                                 ANGELA
                        Then we could really do things our 
                        way.  No fool would mess with us.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (laughs)
                        Shiiiiiit.  Now I know your crazy.

           She grins back, opens her car door.

                                 ANGELA
                        If I’m walkin’, you’re buyin’.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Deal.

           Bobby digs in his pocket and hands her some cash.  Angela 
           throws him a “hang loose” followed by the finger.  Bobby 
           playfully reciprocates with the hang loose/finger combo.  

           Bobby watches her walk across the small parking lot and head 
           inside the liquor store.  His smile fades now as he turns 
           back and stares out the windshield -- mind still reeling.
           IN THE PARKING LOT 

           Bobby doesn’t see the familiar METALLIC BLUE LOWRIDER pull 
           in...

           INSIDE THE STORE

           Angela pays for two 40s at the counter.  The CLERK brown bags 
           each.  Angela shoots him a nod, then starts to walk out the 
           glass doors -- just as, a FIGURE wearing a hoodie with the 
           hood up heads inside -- purposefully bumps into Angela.

                                 ANGELA
                             (genuinely cool)
                        My bad.  Sorry --

                                 GIRL’S VOICE
                        -- you’re gonna be, bitch.

           The voice registers with Angela.  She turns just as the 
           figure drops her hood, revealing herself --  

           It’s the CHOLA Angela beat up in the opening brawl -- staring 
           daggers.  Angela knows she’s in trouble --

           IN THE IMPALA

           Bobby is still lost in his thoughts, until he looks toward 
           the store to check on Angela and clocks the blue lowrider.    
           Sees Sleeper sitting behind the wheel --

           Bobby’s expression instantly turns to concern -- especially 
           as he now recognizes the Chola standing in front of Angela at 
           the glass doors.  A look of panic washes over his face.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (shouts)
                        Ange!  Look out!!

           As Bobby starts to jump out --

           AT THE GLASS DOORS

           Angela is completely caught offguard -- still clutching the 
           40s, one in each hand.  Her eyes locked with the Chola’s.

           Before Angela can say or do anything, the Chola flashes a 
           blade across her neck.  Angela immediately drops to her 
           knees, clutching her throat as blood leaks from her artery.

           Both 40s shatter on the concrete, instantly mixing with 
           droplets of her blood --
           IN THE PARKING LOT

           Bobby’s already outside the Impala and running -- watches in 
           horror as Angela falls, blood streaming from her neck.  

           Locked on Angela, Bobby doesn’t see the blue lowrider 
           suddenly barrel at speed right at him -- gets BLINDSIDED -- 
           literally taken off his feet, smashing into the windshield, 
           then sent in a heap to the asphalt.

           The Chola dashes across and gets into the blue lowrider -- 
           Sleeper screeches out of the parking lot and both disappear.

           ON BOBBY

           Lying on the ground, hurting, bleeding from several cuts.  
           But his mind is on Angela -- gets up and races to --

           THE GLASS DOORS

           Bobby sweeps down, takes Angela into his arms and presses his 
           hand over the bleeding gash.  YELLS at the clerk behind the 
           counter who’s frozen in shock, staring at the blood.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Call 911!  We need an ambulance!!

           The clerk quickly picks up the phone and starts to dial.  
           Bobby looks back down at Angela.  She is fading fast.      
           The color draining from her face.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Hold on, prima.  You’re gonna be 
                        fine.  I got you --

           Bobby’s hands tremble as he still tries to stop the enormous 
           blood flow coming from her neck.  He sees the scared look in 
           her eyes.  Holds her tight, trying to reassure her --

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        I’m right here, Ange -- just hold 
                        on, okay --
                             (shouts futilely)
                        SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP ME!

           Tears flood Angela’s eyes.  She tries to talk.  But can’t.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        Shhh... Shhh... you’re gonna be 
                        alright.  It’s nothing --

           Angela clutches his arm.  Trying to hold on.  But her eyes 
           begin to flutter...
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        No... come on, Ange... hold on!

           And that quick, Angela is gone.  Her body goes limp.  Bobby 
           is in complete shock...desperately shakes her in an attempt 
           to revive her.  Tears of grief well in his eyes.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        No... Oh god... no... no...

           Bobby cradles her tight, covered in blood, silently rocking 
           her in his arms like a child.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Bobby is being questioned.  Completely distraught.  His 
           blood and Angela’s blood still on his clothes.  Arms and 
           face showing cuts and bruises.  

           By the DETECTIVE’S expressions, Bobby is not a suspect.  
           They are only taking his statement.

           Bob Sr. and Joanie are led into the room by an OFFICER.  
           Bobby immediately gets up and hugs them, sobbing.  

           All three stay huddled together in tears.

           EXT. CALVARY CEMETERY - SANTA BARBARA - MORNING

           A few lowriders line the grass-filled cemetery.  Each car 
           fully detailed, rims glistening, not a spot on any of them.

           Through the rows of gravestones, it seems the entire West 
           Side neighborhood has turned out to pay their respects.  All 
           weave their way through the tombstones, following Angela’s 
           white casket as it’s carried toward its final resting place. 

           Each homie wears a brand new white starched T-Shirt.  On the 
           backs is a photo of Angela, smiling.  The dates of her life 
           under the picture, written in script.

           Val walks amongst the mourners, tears streaking her cheeks. 
           Carl next to her, who’s shown up as well, dressed in a suit.

           UP AHEAD

           Bob Sr. and Joanie hold Tina, Angela and Rico’s mom.  She is 
           inconsolable.  Never did she think she’d be burying her baby 
           girl this early in life. 
           AT THE FRONT

           The crew acts as pallbearers, carrying Angela’s casket.  All 
           dressed in black Dickies, white button-down shirts and black 
           ties.  Bobby is on one side of the casket.  Rico on the other.  
           Along with Cruiser, Solid, Freddy and of course Eddie.

           The minute they set the casket down on its temporary stand 
           over the open grave, Eddie falls to his knees sobbing -- 
           knowing he’ll never get the chance to reconcile with his 
           girl.  Solid reaches down and holds him.

           The funeral procession makes their way around the grave site.

           TIGHT ON - BOBBY

           His eye now purple and black.  Fighting back tears as he 
           looks down at Angela’s casket, his hand never leaving its 
           lifeless touch.  He is devastated.  

           Standing on the opposite side of the casket is Rico.  Black 
           wrap-around shades hide his eyes.  Neither cousin will look 
           at the other, standing a mere three feet away.  The tension 
           between them is crackling.  Everyone present can feel it.

           As the priest stands between them and STARTS THE EULOGY, Rico 
           can’t contain himself anymore -- he takes off his glasses and 
           stares down Bobby.  Bobby can’t escape his gaze.

                                 RICO
                        This is on you. 

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        You wanna do this here?  Now??

                                 PRIEST
                             (hushed)
                        Gentlemen, please calm down.

           But Rico stays locked on Bobby, points down at the casket.

                                 RICO
                        That’s mi hermana.  My blood.  You 
                        were supposed to have her back --

           Bobby doesn’t back down.  Seething:

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Don’t kid yourself -- I was more 
                        family to her than you ever were.

           Rico snaps, his eyes lethal.  Bob Sr. quickly steps forward:

                                 BOB SR.
                        Enough, both of you.
           But too late, Rico headbutts Bobby in the face and the two 
           end up STRUGGLING/FIGHTING literally over Angela.  The crew 
           jumps in to separate them, including Bob Sr. -- everyone else 
           including the priest is reeling back to get out of the way.

           But Bobby and Rico’s combined rage makes it impossible to 
           stop them from fighting, until they slam back into Angela’s 
           casket -- nearly knocking it over.  Both instantly stop and 
           hold the casket -- careful to keep Angela from falling.  

           Their looks speak volumes.  The cousins are now sworn enemies.  

                                 RICO
                        You’re as dead to me as she is.

           Rico gets up and storms off, alone.  Bobby stands up, knows 
           everybody is staring right at him.  Including his crew.  Val.    

           And Carl, who suddenly feels very out of place in this crowd.

                                                              TIME CUT:

           EXT. CEMETERY - LATER

           Most of the funeral crowd are still getting into their cars 
           after the service.  Val waits solemnly by Bobby’s Impala.    

           Bobby walks up and stands next to her.  His clothes rumpled 
           and dirty from the earlier fight.  Val sees his shattered 
           expression.  She reaches and gently touches his face.  

           Bobby hugs her.  Holding each other tight.  Grieving.  
           Finally, he pulls away and wipes his eyes...

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Where’s your car?

                                 VAL
                        Over there.  Want me to follow you?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        I think I need some time alone, 
                        okay?

           Val nods, understanding.

                                 VAL
                        I'm not going anywhere.

           Bobby forces a smile, staring into her teary eyes. 
           EXT. EAST SIDE BARRIO - DAY

           Some EAST SIDE GANGSTERS congregate in a park.  Chilling.  
           Until their attention shifts toward the black primered  
           Impala rolling by...

           INT. IMPALA - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby drives through the streets of the enemy.  Sees the eyes 
           of many clocking him.  Invading their space.  

           Bobby instinctively stares right back.  But that warrior’s 
           stare is gone.  In fact, Bobby looks completely lost.

           Finally, he makes a 180 at an intersection and heads west.

           INT. CRASH PAD - NIGHT

           Rico paces.  The crew is there, minus Bobby.  Everyone can 
           see Rico’s on a mission -- consumed with his own vengeance.

                                 RICO
                        I want to this puta found.

           Eddie’s expression carries a lethal look as well.

                                 EDDIE
                        Simon.  That bitch is muerta.

           Everyone agrees, including Freddy, ready to retaliate.

           TIGHT ON - CRUISER

           Trying to hide his concern.

           INT. BEDROOM - MARTINEZ HOUSE - NIGHT

           Bobby sits in his childhood bedroom, now his father’s office.  
           The small room a meld of the old and the new.  Pictures of 
           Bobby growing up frame a desk of blueprints and paperwork.

           Bobby has pushed some things aside to make room, inflating a 
           blow-up mattress using a small pump.  His mother comes in 
           with some fresh sheets and a pillow.

                                 JOANIE
                        It’s nice having you here...

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (nods)
                        It’s just until I figure out 
                        another situation.
                                 JOANIE
                        As long as my head is under this 
                        roof, mijo?  This is your home.

           Bobby smiles, grateful.  She kisses him on the head and  
           walks out, trying hard to hide her heavy concern. 

           INT. BEDROOM - CRASH PAD - LATE NIGHT

           Rico lays on the floor on his back, shirt off, looking 
           straight up INTO CAMERA.  His muscular tat’d body in view.  

           There’s a sense of underlying guilt in his dark expression.  
           And it’s eating at him.

           Especially as he looks over at the corner of the room.

           REVEAL

           Angela’s clothes all folded perfectly next to empty boxes.

           Somehow, Rico’s eyes finally shed tears.  But he quickly 
           wipes them away, steels his expression.  Gets up, letting  
           his anger fuel him as he starts packing his sister away.

           EXT. MARTINEZ HOUSE - MORNING

           Bob Sr. walks out of the house in his work clothes, stops -- 
           sees Bobby solemnly sitting in the passenger seat of his work 
           truck.  Sr. heads over and gets into the driver’s seat.

                                 BOB SR.
                        News said the waves are up.  
                        Figured you’d be out there already.

           Beat.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        You got those extra shifts, right?

           You'd think his father would be happy, but he's not.

                                 BOB SR.
                        Sure.

           As Sr. starts the truck, Bobby stares out the windshield --    
           in a trance.  He is not only still grieving, but trying to 
           come to terms with himself.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        You know, I drove around East Side 
                        yesterday...

           Sr. knows what that means.  
                                 BOB SR.
                        Getting even won’t bring her back, 
                        son.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Thing is, Rico’s right.  Can’t half-
                        step this life.  You’re either in 
                        it, or you’re not.

                                 BOB SR.
                             (stern)
                        Rico is a lost cause -- don’t you 
                        listen to him.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (near tears)
                        I should’ve had her back.

                                 BOB SR.
                        It could’ve easily been you, Bobby.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Wish it was me.

           Sr. puts the truck back into park.  Looks at his son:

                                 BOB SR.
                        I understand what you’re feeling.  
                        Because I’ve been there.  Faced the 
                        same pressures.  Same guilt.  
                        People I loved...I had to bury.
                             (beat)
                        My point is, it’s easy to follow 
                        the pack, son.  Much harder to walk 
                        alone.  Knowing which is right is 
                        the simple part.   

           A moment, then Bobby finally nods.  Wipes his eyes.  Without 
           another word, father and son head off to work.

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MONTECITO - DAY

           Bobby works hard with a hollowed, empty look.  Laboring.

           His dad stands across the way, going over things with Manny, 
           the foreman.  Yet, Sr. can’t help but stare at his son.   
           More than concerned.

           EXT. CABRILLO BLVD - SANTA BARBARA - DUSK

           SOMEONE’S POV - staring across the street at the beach and 
           ocean just beyond.  The horizon is dark, cloudy.
           TIGHT ON - BOBBY

           Still in his dirty work clothes.  Drinking from a 40.  With a 
           pained expression, he remains fixated on something right in 
           front of him.  Growing angrier by the second.

           REVEAL

           He’s sitting just outside the glass doors of the liquor 
           store, next to the spot where Angela was killed.  A dark 
           stain still there where her blood soaked the cement.

           Bobby continues to stare at it.  He finally can’t take it 
           anymore -- gets up and storms away.  

           EXT. CRASH PAD - NIGHT

           Rico’s shouting voice echoes.

           INT. CRASH PAD - CONTINUOUS

           Rico is a powder keg ready to blow.  His intoxicated eyes 
           blazoned red.  Pacing back and forth in front of the crew.

                                 RICO
                        One stupid puta bitch and nobody 
                        can find her?!

           None of the crew speak up.  No one wants to face his wrath.  
           Cruiser finally does.

                                 CRUISER
                        I say we let things cool down first.  
                        East Side’s got eyes everywhere -- 
                        expectin’ it to crack off --

           Rico furiously charges toward Cruiser -- gets in his face.

                                 RICO
                        I don’t care what they’re 
                        expecting!  

           Rico reaches under his shirt and takes out his GLOCK .45 -- 
           Cruiser remains still as Rico holds it in front of him.

                                 RICO
                        I’ll burn the whole place down if I 
                        have to!!

           Rico wheels on Eddie now who cowers:

                                 RICO
                        And you!  What the hell are you 
                        doing?!  Find this bitch who killed 
                        your girl!  My sister!!
           Suddenly, Freddy comes rushing in through the front door -- 
           amped up, holding a piece of paper.

                                 FREDDY
                        I found out where she is.  Got the 
                        address right here --

                                 EDDIE
                        How?

           Rico shoots Eddie a cold hard stare, then moves over and puts 
           his arm around Freddy.

                                 RICO
                        Don’t matter how.  While all of you  
                        weak-ass lames sit here and bitch, 
                        the youngster went and got it done.  
                             (to Freddy)
                        Come on ese, let’s show ‘em how 
                        real Westsiders handle business.

           Freddy steels himself with a brave expression, nods.  

                                 FREDDY
                        Simon.

           Cruiser stands up, trying to save Freddy from making a huge 
           mistake.  Motions to Rico:

                                 CRUISER
                        No, I'll go with you -- 

           Rico points his gun at Cruiser, who freezes.

                                 RICO
                        You don't get this honor.  He does.

           Cruiser watches futilely as Rico and Freddy leave.

           EXT. SKY - NIGHT

           We’re high above the city and the moonlit Pacific Ocean.  

           The sounds of the world seem to DROWN OUT as a familiar 
           BROODING TONE STARTS.  Becoming a new darker, angrier version 
           of Metallica’s, “And nothing else matters.”  

           It reminds us of Angela, in fact we see a quick flash of her 
           face, staring right at us, then... 

           DOWN IN THE CITY

           CAMERA TRACKS the headlights of a vehicle, growing closer... 
           CLOSER... until we make out Rico’s Escalade.  
           INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS

           Rico drives, eye’s blazing.  Gun in his lap.  Freddy rides 
           silently next to him.  They cross State Street and start to 
           drive into East Side territory.

           Rico glances over and sees the sense of fear in the 13 year 
           old’s overwhelmed expression.  A moment, then Rico has a 
           change of heart.  Pulls over.

                                 RICO
                        Get out.

                                 FREDDY
                             (confused)
                        Why?  I’m with you, homes.

                                 RICO
                        You did good, ese.  Real proud of 
                        you.  But I got this.  Now go -- do 
                        as I say.

           Freddy gets out -- part reluctant, part relieved.  As he 
           watches Rico’s Escalade drive away, heading east...

           EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

           Snarling waves crash toward us.  The world goes MUTE.  The 
           new version of “And nothing else matters” continues, as...

           A LONE SURFER APPEARS

           Charging down a wave.  Ripping back and forth with ferocity.

                                                              INTERCUT:

           THE ESCALADE

           Rico pulls up outside a dilapidated apartment building.  
           Checks the address.  This is it.  Rival eyes are already on 
           him.  Rico shows zero fear and gets out, keeping his gun 
           visible.  PEOPLE scatter as Rico heads for the apartments.

           THE OCEAN

           Bobby blasts into the air against the night sky, flying off 
           the lip of another wave, then rails back into the closing 
           white water -- slamming off it in a massive spray -- 

           Bobby surfs harder than we’ve ever seen him.  He’s not trying 
           to punish the wave this time.  He’s trying to punish himself.
           RICO

           Busts an apartment door in.  He’s found the right spot --  
           THREE EASTSIDERS jump from the couch -- one is Sleeper.          
           All flee toward the back. 

           Rico SHOOTS -- misses them, tearing a chunk out of the wall --

           BOBBY

           Charges solo into another wave and goes for pure speed -- 
           tucking into the void of the thin tube -- lets the surging 
           water of the lip slice through his head, then jettison’s out 
           and launches into the air, sailing off the board --

           RICO

           Wades into the apartment.  Blasts one of the Eastsiders in 
           the back hallway.  Steps right over his body and busts 
           through a bedroom door.  Nothing.  Rico keeps moving, busts 
           into the second bedroom door.  Finds what he’s looking for --

           The Chola who killed Angela.  Her back against the wall.  
           Cornered.

           BOBBY

           Punches his head through a wave, letting the power of the 
           surf crash into his body.  Staring back at the lights of the 
           city.  Lost.

           RICO

           Stalks toward the cowering girl.  Points the gun at her head.  
           He sees she’s shaking, completely scared.  It makes him 
           hesitate for a beat.  Then, he steels himself -- readies to 
           pull the trigger.

           The hesitation was only for a split-second, but that’s all it 
           takes -- a SILENT MUZZLE FLASH suddenly rocks his body.  

           Rico slowly turns, revealing his back covered in blood, tank 
           top shredded in a wide pattern of crimson holes --

           BEHIND HIM

           Sleeper chambers another shell in his 12-Gauge street 
           sweeper.  Eyes filled with hate and unwavering vengeance.            
           He points the 12-Gauge right at Rico’s face.

           Rico staggers, life draining from his body, stares right 
           back.  He seems to accept his fate, simply closes his eyes.

           Sleeper FIRES --
           BOBBY

           Another waves crashes into him.  At this point, we can’t tell 
           if it’s tears or salt water staining his face -- just as the 
           song ends with, “And nothing else matters...”  

           Now, just the RUMBLE and CRASHING of the ocean returns.  

           Bobby paddles back outside the break toward the dark horizon.  
           Then looks down at his board resting under his body.

           That’s when we realize, it isn’t his board.  It’s Angela’s.

           Bobby reaches down and removes the leash from his ankle.  A 
           moment, still staring at her dinged up board, then he pushes 
           it out to sea.  Watches it float away into the darkness.

           A sense of realization forms on Bobby's face --          
           bobbing out here in the waves.

           EXT. MARTINEZ HOUSE - NIGHT

           Bobby pulls up in his Impala, sees a familiar face waiting at 
           the curb with a grim expression --

           Cruiser.

           INT. CRASH PAD - LATER

           Bobby sits on the couch, unengaged.  Cruiser, Solid, Eddie 
           and Freddy are there as well as some other familiar 
           WESTSIDERS we’ve seen.  All are distraught over the loss,  
           yet most seem to have expected this outcome.  

           Solid is freaking, in self-preservation mode:  

                                 SOLID
                        We’re at full-on war now, man.  
                        East Side ain’t gonna let this go.  

           Eddie stays silent, lost.  His entire world crumbling.  
           Freddy appears to be consumed with vengeance:

                                 FREDDY
                        Let’s hit those putos back first -- 
                        let ‘em know we ain’t sittin’ back.

           Freddy sees Bobby’s blank stare which throws him.

                                 FREDDY
                        You’re down, right Bobby?  I’m mean 
                        they killed your primo -- 
                                 CRUISER
                             (gets in Freddy's face)
                        -- what the hell do you know about 
                        it?

           Bobby glares hard at Freddy also, but for a different reason.  
           He wants to get through to him:

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        -- wake up, Freddy...can’t you see?  
                        I lost both my cousins to this 
                        shit. 

           Bobby gets up from the couch. 

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        After you guys hit ‘em back and 
                        they retaliate again?  Maybe it’s 
                        you that gets smoked this time 
                        Freddy...  
                             (looks at Solid)
                        Or you...
                             (to Eddie)
                        Or you...
                             (to everyone)
                        Or any of you.  Who’s gonna handle 
                        that?  I can tell you right now -- 
                        it ain’t gonna be me.

           Bobby walks out the door as a statement.  No one says a word  
           -- gauging each other.  They know he’s not coming back. 

           INT. IMPALA - DAY

           Bobby drives alone, following the coast.  The ocean on one 
           side, the city on the other.  Yet, Bobby’s eyes remain 
           transfixed on the road ahead.  Oblivious to the world -- 
           focused on the thoughts in his head.

           INT. GOLDMANN, STEARNS & WINTHER GROUP - SANTA BARBARA - DAY

           Bobby walks into the reception area, scans the plush setting.  
           Marble, dark wood, paintings, sculptures, no expense sparred.   
           He sees the RECEPTIONIST staring at him with a smile:

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Can I help you?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        I'm looking for Carl Winther?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Is he expecting you?
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Not exactly.  But we’re friends.

                                                              TIME CUT:

           INT. CARL’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby looks around Carl’s large corner office, complete with 
           a view of the city and ocean beyond.  Carl has done well for 
           himself -- and somehow, the crisp white shirt, the Hugo Boss 
           slacks, Italian loafers and manicured hairstyle suit him.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        So this is where you work, huh?

                                 CARL
                        Exciting isn't it?  

           Bobby checks out a wall display of photographs.  Most are of 
           Carl playing college football.  A few from the Raider’s camp.

           Carl knows Bobby is here for a reason, gives him space --
           watching him admire the pictures.  Bobby points to one of 
           Carl, about the same age as Bobby now, in a USC uniform.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Damn, you were yoked back then.  
                        What position did you play?

           Carl stares at the picture fondly, reminiscing.

                                 CARL
                        Right where the action is --  
                        middle linebacker.

           Bobby points to another of Carl in a game, eyes fixated with 
           fierce competitive energy -- ready to crush a quarterback.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Man I’ve seen that stare before.

           Carl laughs.  Bobby continues to stare at Carl’s football 
           wall of fame.  It’s made him nervous and excited at the same 
           time, about the possibilities of where his own life will go.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        After you got hurt...and you knew 
                        football was over.  What'd you do?

           Carl remembers all too well.

                                 CARL
                        Won’t lie, I was shattered -- 
                        thought the world ended.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CARL (CONT'D)
                        Only thing I ever wanted or knew 
                        was playing ball.  
                             (beat)
                        But then you do the only thing you 
                        can.  You pick yourself up.  Change 
                        gears.  Move on to the next 
                        chapter.

           Bobby thinks about that.

                                 CARL
                        You know that saying...about if you 
                        never love?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        No.

           Carl chuckles, remembering the generational gap between them.

                                 CARL
                        Anyway, I'd rather live with the 
                        regret, than not know what it was 
                        like at all.

           Bobby nods, getting the point.  Carl eyes shift to photos of 
           his family.  A beautiful and elegant WIFE.  And two young 
           kids; a BOY and a GIRL.  Ironically, the wisdom he’s trying 
           to pass on to Bobby, becomes a moment of self-reflection.

                                 CARL
                        And you know what?  

           Bobby looks over at him, sees Carl’s proud smile.

                                 CARL
                        I got a good life.

           EXT. RINCON POINT - CARPINTERIA - MORNING

           Bobby sits alone, on the rocks.  Watching SURFERS enjoy the 
           afternoon waves.  He looks down at the surf magazine in his 
           hands.  At one page in particular with the following header:

           “NSSA WEST COAST AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIPS, HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA.”

           Bobby reads the details with keen interest, when --

                                 FREDDY (O.S.)
                        Knew I’d find you here.

           Bobby turns and sees Freddy riding up on his stretched-out 
           lowrider bicycle.  The kid is sweating his ass off, panting.
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Damn Freddy -- you rode that thing 
                        all the way here?  It’s like 
                        fifteen miles.

           Freddy leans his bike against a rock, sits down next to 
           Bobby.  Both stare out at the surf in silence for a moment.

                                 FREDDY
                        I couldn’t even sleep last night.  
                        Are you really out?

           Bobby nods.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Yesterday’s news.

           The 13 year old digests that, then stoically nods back.

                                 FREDDY
                        Then me, too.

           Bobby smiles at him, glad the kid got the message.  

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Just keep it yesterday.

                                 FREDDY
                        I will.

           After a silent beat:

                                 FREDDY
                        So what are you gonna do?

           Bobby shows him the magazine page.  Freddy lights up.

                                 FREDDY
                        Cool!

           INT. CHANNEL ISLANDS SURFBOARDS - SANTA BARBARA - DAY

           Bobby and Freddy wait anxiously in the showroom, staring at 
           the number of boards lined up against the walls.  Freddy is 
           in awe.  A moment then, Al Merrick appears from the back as 
           an EMPLOYEE points out Bobby.  Merrick smiles.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Still down for making me that 
                        board?

                                 AL MERRICK
                        Absolutely.  Come on in back -- I 
                        think I know just the shape that 
                        fits your style.
           OFF Bobby’s big grin to Freddy as they all head in back...

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MONTECITO - DAY

           Bobby works hard.  There’s a bounce in his step.  Excitement 
           in his eyes.  His dad walks up:

                                 BOB SR.
                        Manny says you were late again.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Sorry, I had something to do.
                             (OFF his dad’s frown)
                        Look, I know it’s not the best time 
                        to ask, but I need next week off.

           Sr. thinks his son’s already back to old tricks.

                                 BOB SR.
                        Why?

           Bobby reaches in his back pocket and pulls out the magazine 
           page.  Unfolds it and hands it to his father.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        I entered this competition.  Need 
                        to practice.

           Sr. reads the magazine page in silence for a moment, then his 
           dour attitude suddenly shifts -- shoots his son a relaxed 
           smile and hands the page back.

                                 BOB SR.
                        Take all the time you need.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Serious?  You ain’t mad??

                                 BOB SR.
                        Hey, you can always pound nails -- 

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (finishes the sentence)
                        -- but dreams pass you by, right?  

           Sr. places a fatherly hand on his son’s shoulder.  “Finally.”

                                 BOB SR.
                        Welcome to the real world, son.  

           Bobby laughs and smiles, excited to have his dad’s support.

                                 BOB SR.
                        Now I wish it was my life.
           EXT. LEADBETTER BEACH - DAY 

           Bobby runs on the sand.  Inspired.  Training hard.  Sweat 
           dripping from his tat’d body.  He looks to his right --

           BOBBY’S POV - BY THE PARKING LOT

           Cruiser, Eddie and Solid have their usual shop set up.  

           Bobby debates for a second, still running, then veers up the 
           beach toward them.

           TIGHT ON - CRUISER

           Sees Bobby jogging up, covered in sweat.

                                 CRUISER
                        Damn homie, you got the cops or 
                        chavalas chasing you?

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (laughs)
                        Bustin’ a grape to get in shape.

                                 CRUISER
                        I heard.

                                 SOLID
                        Hell, everybody’s heard.  Freddy's 
                        got all of West Side fired up --

           Bobby grins, then motions to the empty campus of the City 
           College across the street.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        School’s out, blunts out, huh?

                                 CRUISER
                             (shakes his head)
                        Hate the summer.  We can’t even 
                        give it away.
                             (beat)
                        Thinking about getting a gig 
                        inkin’.  You know, in a real tat 
                        shop.  Until I get my own going.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Hells yeah.  Be the next Mr. 
                        Cartoon.

                                 CRUISER
                        That’d sure be cool, huh?
           They share a smile.  All this time, Eddie’s been silent.    
           Bobby sees his humbled and regretful expression.             
           It speaks volumes.  They lock eyes.  

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (sincere)
                        Carnales, homes.  Nothing else 
                        matters.

           Eddie smiles, relieved -- knows Bobby has forgiven him.    
           The two bump fists followed with a gangster hug.

                                 EDDIE
                        Por vida.

           EXT. MACY’S - LA CUMBRE PLAZA - EVENING

           Val walks out the glass doors at the end of her day.  Seems 
           tired and preoccupied, until she sees Bobby there, waiting. 

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Hey.  You like the beach?

           There’s resolve in his eyes.  Val can see it.  She smiles.

                                 VAL
                        Maybe.

                                                          SHOCK CUT TO:

           EXT. BEACH - HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA - MORNING

           SUPER:  NSSA WEST COAST AMATEUR SURF CHAMPIONSHIPS

           Surf City.  Oakley, Quicksilver, Billabong, Body Glove and 
           Roxy branding tents are packed within inches of each other on 
           the beach, right next to the famous HB pier.  Every bit of 
           real estate that can be utilized to sell surf gear is used.

           Surfers of all ages are present, along with countless fans of 
           the sport.  A PUNK BAND plays from a stage on the pier.  
           Tat’d up skaters and BMX riders shred on a half pipe -- 
           pulling aerials to the rhythm of the aggressive music.   
           Girls in wanna-be-seen bikinis are everywhere.

           This is about selling a lifestyle...and they spare no expense.

           UP ON THE PIER

           It’s completely packed with fans.  Bob Sr. and Joanie have 
           staked out a front row spot with some of their friends --  
           all exhilarated to witness Bobby’s first big event.

           As they look down at the surf and scene below...
           NEAR THE BRANDING TENTS

           Carl and his wife, JANE along with their two kids, HUNTER and  
           CLAIRE (4 and 6) walk through the crowd.  Carl has an extra 
           bounce in his step, anxiously scanning the area. 

                                 JANE
                        Relax, Carl...I’m sure he’s here 
                        somewhere.

                                 CARL
                        Swear to God, it feels like my 
                        first day at training camp.

           Jane smiles, seeing how energized her husband is.  But Carl’s 
           kids look completely bored.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m hungry.

                                 HUNTER
                        I wanna see the skateboarders.

           Carl grows flustered -- wants them to share his enthusiasm.

                                 CARL
                        But we came to check out the 
                        surfing, guys --

                                 JANE
                             (knows it’s futile)
                        -- I got the kids, honey.  Go do 
                        your thing.

                                 CARL
                        Really?

                                 JANE
                        Hurry, before I change my mind.

           Carl smiles back, kisses her appreciatively and takes off.

           ON THE BEACH

           Amidst a throng of people, Bobby carries his new Al Merrick 
           board, walking alongside Val.  She sees how nervous he is.

                                 VAL
                        You okay?

           Bobby blows out an anxious, yet excited sigh:
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Shittin’ bricks.  Been to a bunch 
                        of events like this.  But never as 
                        a competitor. 

           Val stops him, grabs his face and stares into his eyes.

                                 VAL
                        Look, I hope you’re not looking for 
                        words of inspiration here, because 
                        I don’t have any.

           Val seductively puts her lips next to his ear and whispers:

                                 VAL
                        But if you win?  Save some energy, 
                        poppa...cuz you're gonna need it.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (laughs)
                        Okay, that's inspiring.

           Val laughs back, pleased that she got the affect she wanted, 
           which was to ease his anxiety.  They share a warm kiss.  

                                 CARL (O.S.)
                        There you are --

           Bobby turns and sees Carl moving toward them.  

                                 CARL
                        Did you already register?

           Carl points to the REGISTRATION TENT -- close to 200 AMATEUR 
           HOPEFULS stand in a very long line.  

           Bobby goes right back to being nervous.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Just going there now.  

                                 CARL
                             (on a mission)
                        I scoped it out.  Everyone’s saying 
                        the best break is next to the pier -- 

           Carl points toward the pier.  Bobby surveys the fierce waves 
           as they slice through the thick aging wood pylons.

                                 CARL
                        -- but watch out if you eat it.  
                        The pylons are covered in jagged 
                        mollusk shells.  They'll shred your 
                        skin like razor blades.  And also --
           Carl stops and grows awkward, realizing he’s a bit over-
           excited. 

                                 CARL
                        I’m sure you know all this.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                             (smiles)
                        Hey, I need all the help I can get.

                                 CARL
                             (smiles back)
                        No you don't.  

           Carl sees Bobby’s new shiny Al Merrick board.

                                 CARL
                        Look at that magic stick.  Merrick 
                        came through, huh?

           Bobby passes it to Carl and lets him inspect it.  A moment, 
           admiring it, then Carl hands it back like a delicate egg.

                                 CARL
                        Bet it fits you like a glove.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        I’m afraid to even ding it.

           Carl locks eyes with Bobby.  Puts on his game face.

                                 CARL
                        Break the thing in half, Bobby.  Go 
                        rip like you never have before.

           Bobby nods, getting psyched up -- looks toward the impending 
           crashing surf...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. OCEAN - DAY

           An explosion of water sprays as Bobby shoots through a wave 
           with his new board, paddling out -- white foam coats the sea.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                             (echoes from loudspeakers)
                        Welcome folks to this year’s NSSA 
                        West Coast Amateur Championships, 
                        here at Huntington Beach.  The 
                        first 30 minute heat is about to 
                        get underway...

           Bobby makes it out to the line-up.  Breathes in and shoots 
           the saltwater from his nose.  Climbs up on his board.
                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        The judges will tabulate the 
                        results of each surfer’s best two 
                        waves so they’ll need to make ‘em 
                        count.  In this first line-up, we 
                        have...

           The announcer’s voice CONTINUES as Bobby studies the other 
           surfers.  Straddling their boards, bobbing in the undulating 
           tide.  Some stay chilled, focused.  Others talk shit.  Some 
           are barely able to sit on their boards they’re so nervous.

           A few like Bobby -- stay islands unto themselves.  Bobby 
           turns his board to face the beach.  He sees the droves of 
           fans fighting for the best view.  Countless others lean over 
           the railing of the pier, looking down on him and the other 
           riders.  That includes his father and mother, both smiling.

           Bobby takes a deep breath, trying to calm himself down.   
           Cups a handful of water and rinses it over his face.  

           But more tension arrives as Theo Algonzi paddles up next to 
           Bobby.  Bobby realizes Algonzi’s in this competition also.  
           His usual antagonistic attitude in full effect:

                                 ALGONZI
                        What, you drive down here on three 
                        wheels?  The border’s still another 
                        100 miles, “homie” --

           The surfers near them look at Bobby, waiting to see if he 
           explodes.  But Bobby stays calm.  Not about to sweat the  
           loud mouth now.  Acts like he’s concerned and looks around:

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Damn, you mean this ain’t it?

           A couple of the surfers can’t help a laugh.  Algonzi doesn’t.

           Suddenly, the AIRHORN SOUNDS OFF -- signaling the beginning 
           of their heat.  No more words -- it becomes all business.   

           The surfers explode out of the gate like a NASCAR start --

           ON BOBBY 

           His BREATHING becomes rhythmic, arms begin paddling, his 
           hands cutting through the water.  Slowly at first, then 
           faster.  His focus becomes laser intense.

           He gets out a good five yards ahead of Algonzi and others.  
           The liquid elevator ride begins rising behind him.  Water 
           picking up speed.  Bobby thrusts up and drops into the wave.
           The wave is perfect.  A six foot roller with a hollow face.  
           Bobby crouches down, drops his back leg and attacks the wave.  
           Cuts back up the face and pulls a table top air, grabbing his 
           inside rail before landing back in the wave.

           Bobby performs a repertoire of moves that happen with machine 
           gun-like speed and natural agility.  He’s feeling great.  
           Losing his nervousness.  Pumps his legs on his board, looking 
           for more speed to attack again.  Glances over his shoulder at 
           the competition behind him.  As he faces forward --

           SMASH!  A KNEE hits Bobby square in the nose --

           Bobby’s head flies back.  Blood and saltwater shoot out of 
           both nostrils.  Algonzi looks back and smirks as Bobby flies 
           off his board and crashes headfirst into the wave, 
           disappearing from view.

           ON VAL

           Her hands go to her face, concerned.

           ON CARL

           With his family, ready to jump in and murder Algonzi.

           UP ON THE PIER

           If you think Carl’s ready to kill, you should see Bobby’s 
           mother.  

                                 JOANIE
                        Can that asshole do that?

           Sr. is hoping his son remains cool.

                                 BOB SR.
                        He just did.

           IN THE WATER

           Bobby resurfaces and sees Algonzi flying down the wave.  

           Absolutely furious, Bobby wrestles his board back in by the 
           leash and gets on.  Blood streams from his nose.

           ON THE BEACH

           Val steps into the water as Bobby reaches shore.  He sets his 
           board down and blows blood and water from his nose.  People 
           point and stare.  Others turn away from the sight of blood.

                                 VAL
                        You alright?
                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        That cheating piece of shit -- I’m 
                        gonna knock his punk-ass out.

           Val hands him a towel to clean away the blood.  She looks up 
           at the electronic time clock over the SCORER’S BOOTH.

                                 VAL
                        Well you only have ten minutes to 
                        do it or he did his job and knocked 
                        you out.  So get back out there --

           Bobby sees she’s all fired up.  Digs it.  Just as Cruiser, 
           Freddy, Eddie and Solid blast through the crowd --

                                 FREDDY
                        We’ll crush that fool, Bobby!

           Bobby lights up, seeing his crew has come to watch him.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        Hey -- when you guys get here?

                                 CRUISER
                        Damn homie, you got less banged up 
                        bangin’.

                                 SOLID
                             (scanning the water)
                        That white boy’s muerta.  Where’s 
                        he at?

                                 VAL
                        Guys, you aren’t helping.

           Carl rushes up -- anxiously wanting Bobby to get back out 
           there.  It’s turning into a circus --

                                 CARL
                        Real bad time for a huddle guys -- 
                        the dickhead’s on his second wave.

           Bobby looks out and sees Algonzi catching another wave.

                                 VAL
                        Go --

           Bobby nods, his eyes get intense, nose still bleeding.  Runs 
           with his board into the water and spears through the surf.

                                 FREDDY
                             (all attitude)
                        Crush ‘em, Bobby!
           OUT IN THE WATER

           Bobby makes it back out to the line up.  Blows another pack 
           of blood from his nose.  Algonzi paddles up next to him.  
           They sit with a dozen other surfers waiting for the next set. 

                                 ALGONZI
                        Damn, my knee hurts.  How’s the 
                        bitch-ass nose of yours?

           Bobby shoots him a look.  Fists clenched.  

           UP ON THE PIER

           Bobby’s parents watch the exchange.

                                 BOB SR.
                        Uh oh.

           OUT IN THE WATER

           Bobby’s fierce stare suddenly turns into resolve.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        You know why you talk so much shit?
                             (OFF Algonzi’s look)
                        Because you’re scared.

                                 ALGONZI
                             (scoffs)
                        Of what?

           The whole time, Bobby has been looking past Algonzi -- at the 
           heavy wave rolling in behind them.  Bobby quickly lies down.

                                 BOBBY MARTINEZ
                        This.

           Bobby paddles hard, getting the quick jump on Algonzi and the 
           pack.  It’s the biggest wave of the day.  A violent nine-foot 
           rocket wall, fast and hollow, with no end in sight.  

           Everyone paddles their asses off.  Bobby in the lead with 
           Algonzi right behind.  They all want this wave.

           ON THE BEACH

           Val, Carl and the whole crew watch, cheering Bobby on.

           OUT IN THE WATER

           Bobby digs forcefully into the water with both arms, picking 
           up speed and drops into the turbulent wave.  Algonzi is the 
           only other surfer who makes it, ten feet to Bobby’s left. 
           Bobby goes on the offensive and rails hard -- his back hand 
           skimming against the fast-moving water.  He cuts up the face 
           and pulls an amazing aerial maneuver --

           To his right, Algonzi pulls off a tailwhip into a 360 degree 
           turn -- nearly losing his balance and wiping out.  No 
           question he’s feeling the pressure, pushing his limits.

           Both begin an aquatic dogfight.  Each one trying to 
           outmaneuver the other.  Their rails touch at one point -- 
           almost throwing Bobby off, but he holds on -- just as they 
           begin cutting towards the pier on the closing wave.  

           Bobby sees there’s only room for one rider to shoot through 
           the pier, avoid the dangerous pylons and make the line.  He 
           grits his teeth -- no way he’s giving up -- the pylons are 
           closing in on them fast --

           ON THE BEACH

           Val, Carl and the crew literally hold their breath.  The 
           final horn sounds as Bobby and Algonzi race toward the pier.

                                 CARL
                        This is the last wave that counts --

           OUT IN THE WATER 

           Bobby and Algonzi hurtle toward the pylons knowing only one 
           is going to make it through.  Just as they head under --

           UP ON THE PIER

           Fans rush to the other side to see who’ll make it through.  
           Bob Sr. is right with them, barrelling through the crowd with 
           Joanie right behind -- neither wanting to miss this --

           UNDER THE PIER

           Bobby and Algonzi jettison into the dark shadows.  Both 
           somehow narrowly miss the first pylon.  But then, Algonzi 
           makes one last cut against Bobby’s board to throw him off --

           TIGHT ON - BOBBY

           That warrior’s stare is back -- he doesn’t flinch -- holds 
           his line hard.  The near miss sends Algonzi off course -- he 
           FACE PLANTS at full speed into the far pylon.  Crushed.   

           Just as -- 
           ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE

           A tense beat -- then Bobby shoots out from under the pier 
           alone into the bright sun!  The fans explode.  Bob Sr. raises 
           his arms in triumph, pridefully watching his son below.

           TIGHT ON - BOBBY

           Smiling.  Cuts back, slams into the top lip and goes 
           airborne.  Arms mirroring his father’s -- stretched high into 
           the air -- and again, time STANDS STILL.  His frozen image --

                                                           MORPHS INTO:
