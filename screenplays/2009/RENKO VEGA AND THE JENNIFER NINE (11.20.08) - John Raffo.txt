           EXT. A STREET - NIGHT

           An empty alleyway, dark, but modern, concrete and steel.  We 
           hear FOOTSTEPS approaching.  A man runs hard into the 
           foreground, carrying a heavy, reinforced, trunk-like case.  

           He PANTS, looks left and right.  He is handsome, in his late 
           thirties.  This is RENKO VEGA.

           Renko hears more FOOTSTEPS, VOICES.  A CROWD appears behind 
           him.  They have torches, weapons.   

                                 THE CROWD
                        There!  There he is!  Stop, thief!

           The crowd chases. Renko runs, weighed down by the case.

           EXT. VARIOUS STREETS AND ALLEYS

           Renko ducks through the shadows, PANTING, cutting corners, 
           barely managing to stay ahead of the mob, which seems intent 
           on catching him and tearing him limb from limb. 

           Renko puts a hand up to a tiny headset mounted on his ear. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jennifer, I’m near the edge of the 
                        colony.  You got a lo-kay on me?

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Still searching, Renko Vega.  

           Jennifer has a soft female voice, filtered through an 
           INTERCOM, but intimate, seductive...

           Renko turns, racing down another alley, finding himself at a 
           dead end.  But the alley doesn’t end in brickwork or chain- 
           link, there is instead a wall made of transparent material, a 
           thick Plexiglas. 

           There’s writing stenciled on the wall, NE47 - NO ACCESS.   

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jen, I’m at N.E. 47!  Northeast 47!   

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Very good, Renko.  Use the airlock 
                        there and I’ll pick you up.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        What airlock? There is no airlock! 

                                 JENNIFER 9
                        Of course there’s an airlock.  It’s 
                        clearly marked on the blueprints.
                                 RENKO VEGA
                        There’s nothing, Jen! 

                                 JENNIFER 9
                        I think perhaps, Renko, you are not 
                        looking hard enough.

           He turns, he hears VOICES, sees flashlight beams.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --I’m telling you there’s no 
                        airlock!  There’s no door! 

           Renko turns and the angry mob reappears behind him.  There’s 
           a SHOUT.  Renko Vega is trapped.  

           He looks around, then picks up the steel case and turns to 
           the crowd, hoisting it up over his head like King Kong... 

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Stop!  Stop right there!

           The mob stops dead, obviously fearful of Renko’s actions... 
           but, in the crowd, an arm moves in a throwing motion...

           A rock flies through the air and CLIPS Renko hard in the ear.  
           His earpiece goes flying and Renko GRUNTS....

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Jen!  Jennifer!

           A few members of the mob step forward, but people SHOUT...

                                 VOICES IN THE CROWD
                        No!  No!  He’s crazy! (etc.)

           Renko turns, steps like a shotputter.  The crowd SHOUTS as he 
           heaves the case at the Plexiglas....  

           CRACK!  The case bounces but leaves a HISSING fracture in the 
           wall.  Condensation sizzles frothily at the hole.  

           The mob rushes at Renko but Renko picks up the case again and 
           glares at the crowd, freezing them again in a desperate 
           version of red-light green-light.

           Renko turns and heaves the case again and BASH!!  The case 
           SMASHES into the Plexi and penetrates the wall!  There’s a 
           huge sucking sound and all hell breaks loose.  

           Everything is sucked toward the hole in the Plexiglas.  

           The Mob SCREAMS and people grab onto anything that is nailed 
           down because anything that isn’t nailed down gets pulled 
           toward the hole by a mighty sucking wind.
           Renko holds on for a moment then takes a deep breath, and 
           dives, allowing himself to be sucked through the hole. 

           EXT. A MOON - NIGHT

           Renko Vega tumbles into this strange enviromnent.  Behind him 
           is the wall of an enormous ACRYLIC DOME, planted on the 
           barren plain of a MOON.   

           Gray dunes and craters run off to the distance.  Stars fill 
           the black sky.  It is eerily, totally SILENT.  

           Detritus blows out the hole behind Renko until chunks of wood 
           and bits of clothing and people finally plug the hole.   

           Renko swims through the air in low gravity and grabs that  
           heavy case.  But his face is getting puffy, he won’t last 
           long in this airless pressure.  

           His face turns purple, he looks madly around.  Suddenly a 
           SHADOW swoops over Renko... it’s a spaceship, large, but 
           winged, sleek, and Lamborghini-meets-Bentley cool.  

           This is the JENNIFER 9.  

           It hovers and lowers itself toward Renko.  A hatch opens... 
           and Renko grabs a handhold and pulls himself through.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE JENNIFER 9 - ENGINE ROOM

           Renko Vega has that case open and lifts out a tall slim 
           cylinder about a foot high and a few inches across.  It’s a 
           “Fusion Rod”.   

           He slides it into a opening in a long, complex engine.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Now, tell me again why you couldn’t 
                        get out the way we planned?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Because there were people that way,  
                        people who weren’t exactly happy I 
                        was making off with a box of their 
                        precious fuel rods.  They don’t 
                        exactly grow on trees you know.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        I’ve never encountered a tree.  Not 
                        up close anyway.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Yeah, well, fusion rods don’t grow 
                        on them, let’s leave it at that.  
           He pulls blackened versions of the fusion rods out of the 
           engine and slides the spent numbers back in the case.  

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        So, how do you feel?

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Refreshed... but you’ve been 
                        neglecting me, Renko, my circuits 
                        haven’t been running at full power 
                        in I don’t know how long. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        That’s life in space, Jen.  
                        Sometimes we must go without.

           Renko pushes buttons, the engine covers slide home.  Renko 
           turns and heads out of the chamber.

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Now how’s our progress on the 
                        Revolver?

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        We’ve moved into position but we 
                        don’t have much time.  She’s 
                        already begun her jump.

           EXT. SPACE

           A blue-black sky is covered in a rich blanket of stars.  Off 
           to one side lays the burnished rim of TITAN, the largest moon 
           of Saturn...

           We MOVE SLOWLY toward that moon.  In the planetary shadow we 
           see the Jennifer 9 is hidden in the darkness. 

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.) 
                        Arrival in sixty-one seconds.  You 
                        should be seeing vapor shift in 
                        your glass any moment.

           INT. THE JENNIFER 9  / BRIDGE

           Renko Vega moves through this large, impressive control room.  
           There’s a big, sleek console in front of an observation port.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Coffee, please.

           A panel opens and a steaming cup and saucer slide out on a 
           tray.  Renko picks up the coffee and sips.

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Hmm... good.
           He puts the coffee back down on the console.  But the panel 
           opens and the coffee immediately disappears.  

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I wasn’t done with that.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Cup sensed your mood and thought an 
                        elevated caffeine level would be 
                        unwise at this time.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Cup thought it would be unwise? 
                        Jen, I don’t care what a cup
                        thinks!

                                 JENNIFER 9
                        --Cup is doing it’s job, Renko.  We 
                        should go over the arrival sequence 
                        again. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                             (grumpily, by rote)
                        Five fighter craft fly envoy with 
                        the Revolver.  Two arrive ten 
                        seconds before the mothership.  The 
                        others travel simultaneous slip.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Would you also confirm our own plan 
                        of action? 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Wait until the Revolver shows up 
                        then go like hell while they’re 
                        still instrument blind from latent 
                        radioactivity.  Then, we attach 
                        ourselves to the Revolver’s skin 
                        and render full camo.  That right?

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        I’ll set coordinates for approach 
                        when we confirm the Revolver’s 
                        position.  Fifteen seconds.   

           Renko studies his window and hits his intercom. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Bill, where the hell are you? 

                                 BILL.1 (V.O.)
                        I’m in maintenance locker seven, 
                        cleaning the portside dust traps.

           Bill.1 has a vaguely mechanical voice.
                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Dust traps?!  Bill get up on the 
                        bridge, right now!  We gotta go!

                                 BILL.1
                        If dust penetrates the intake 
                        valves, it may infiltrate vital 
                        circuitry-- 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --Get to the bridge and get ready 
                        for accel.  Jen, did you know Bill 
                        was dusting--? 

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        --Bill point one is not my 
                        responsibility, Captain Vega--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --Bill, get up here now!

                                 BILL.1
                        --I’m right here, Renko Vega.

           BILL.1 has appeared on the bridge.  He’s a slow-moving robot 
           with a rubbery face.  His servos HISS and grind.   

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Envoy craft arriving... 

           There’s a glow on the screen, then a second glow, morphing 
           into silent explosions, BURSTING in the black sky. 

           The explosions coagulate into two single-seat spacecraft 
           (arriving from “time skip”).  They are small but lethal-
           looking, the space version of F-18’s.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Sachs Six-Sixteens.  Very nice.   

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Beginning massive acceleration 
                        sequence.  Renko, arms out, please.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Bill get up on the grid.  We need 
                        to get rubberized.

           But Bill has turned and is moving back to the exit doors. 

                                 BILL.1
                        I forgot to shut the deck seals.  
                        Massive acceleration often leads to 
                        problems with the seals.  
                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Forget the deck seals!  Jen!  Take 
                        over his interface!

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Starlight Revolver arriving in five 
                        seconds.  

           Suddenly, out of housings in ceiling, floor, and sidewalls, 
           streams of rubber goop shoot out at Renko, WHACKING into his 
           arms, torso, legs, the back of his head. 

           He grimaces as the goop pull him up off his feet, stretching 
           him out like Leonardo’s Vitruvian Man.   

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Bill!

           Out on the screen, there’s a tremendous vibration.  The inky 
           black of space ripples like a tossed blanket.  

           An enormous but silent EXPLOSION fills the viewing screen.  
           The Jen 9 TREMBLES.  Renko shuts his eyes against the glare.  

           An enormous space-liner WHITES OUT and resolves.  It is wheel-
           like, a tube-like rim (the passenger section) rotates around 
           a central engine hub, connected together with four stout 
           “spokes”... 

           This is the STARLIGHT REVOLVER.  It’s huge, magnificent... 
           the Queen Mary of the stars.   

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        My god... she’s big...

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        The Starlight Revolver is the 
                        largest spacecraft ever equipped 
                        with a jump drive.  Starting ion 
                        synchronizer.  Massive accel in 
                        three... two-- 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --Jennifer, protect Bill!  Now!

           Those rubbery streams of goop shoot out at Bill, but only one 
           hits, tightening and pulling him back towards the grid...

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Ignition--

           --WHAM!  The Jen 9 jumps forward at awe-inspiring velocity.  
           The stars don’t move or anything, the Jen 9 simply goes from 
           zero to ten thousand in the blink of an eye.   

           Renko Vega is thrown backwards, but the rubber stretches, 
           keeping him safe.  
           Bill, on the other hand, is hurled through the air with only 
           that single inadequate rubber band protecting him.  He 
           SMASHES into a bank of hard drives on the rear wall.  

           EXT. THE STARLIGHT REVOLVER

           The Jennifer 9 is a glimmer shooting across a black field, 
           racing at one of those stout spokes.  

           Then, abruptly, the Jennifer STOPS only inches from the 
           surface of the big ship.  

           INT. THE JENNIFER 9

           Renko Vega hurtles the other way, stretching forward in his 
           rubber net. 

           Bill leaves the rear wall and FLIES across the room again, 
           right over the console, SPLASHING into the observation glass 
           with a mighty crash and sticking, splayed out, flattened.  

           EXT. THE STARLIGHT REVOLVER

           The Jen 9 hovers inches away from the skin of the larger 
           ship.  Little suction feet extend, THUNK, and fasten down.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Activating camo... 

           The skin of the Jennifer changes, assuming the color and 
           shape of the Revolver, achieving a perfect mimicry.

           INT. THE JENNIFER 9 / BRIDGE

           The rubbery goop drops Renko back on the grid and retreats.  
           Bill.1 slides down the glass and crashes to the floor.

           Bill.1 is a mess; his head is dangling off his torso; both 
           arms are broken off; a leg is turned backwards. 

           Renko walks over, picks up one of the errant arms and 
           disgustedly tosses it onto the stack of Bill’s other parts.  
           Bill’s eyes swivel up and look at Renko.

                                 BILL.1
                        I’m okay. 

           Renko peers cautiously up into the port.  He can see an envoy 
           fighter rolling slowly above, rockets HISSING. 
           EXT. THE JENNIFER 9 

           The fighter craft glides over the slowly rotating surface of 
           the Revolver.  The Jennifer 9 is right below him, but, in 
           full camo, almost invisible.

           After a moment the fighter fires its engines and moves back 
           with the other craft. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE JENNIFER 9  / TECH ROOM

           Renko Vega is laying on a gurney.  His head is strapped down 
           in an enormous and complex clamp.  Bill.1 is nearby, stuck 
           back together with bolts and bits of steel... 

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Stay still, Renko.  If you move 
                        even a millimeter the wrong way, 
                        the results could be disastrous.

           An enormous MECHANICAL ARM holds a complex probe in Renko’s 
           ear.  The probe is snake-like, twisting, moving.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                             (jaw clamped)
                        I can feel that!  Too deep!  
                        Jennifer!!

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        And... there.

           The arm pulls the writhing probe from Renko’s ear.  When it 
           emerges we see a tiny mechanism and light at the far end.  
           The head clamps unfasten. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                             (sitting up)
                        I thought you were just going in a 
                        few inches!

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        I told you I had to access the 
                        auditory nerve.  We don’t want 
                        anyone discovering the implant, nor 
                        do we want it dislodged like it was 
                        at that moon colony.  

           Those manipulator arms disappear into almost seamless panels 
           in the wall as Renko climbs off the table.

           He’s wearing a pleated tuxedo shirt, pants, and suspenders.  
           Bill.1 slips a black bow tie around Renko’s neck.   
                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Beginning earpiece test sequence.

           Suddenly there’s a WHISTLING sound, like a teakettle.  It 
           quickly RINGS up into a HOWLING FEEDBACK.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Owww!! Jennifer!

           The WHISTLING goes wobbly, then RESOLVES into a soft HUMM and 
           then, Jennifer’s voice returns, but richer, more “present”.   

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Sorry Renko, your head seems to 
                        have some peculiar amplitude 
                        anomalies.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        What’s that supposed to mean?  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Your skull is thick.  I’ve tweaked 
                        the frequency errors and repaired 
                        the deficiencies.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                             (shaking it off)
                        And when I talk back to you?

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        All you have to do is whisper.

           Bill.1 moves in front of Renko and begins tying the tie.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        How about video?

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        My sensors in your optic nerve are 
                        broadcasting AOK.  As long as your 
                        eyes are open, my eyes are open.   

           Renko looks up at an overhead video monitor:  

           The video follows Renko’s eyes.  When Renko blinks the video 
           goes black momentarily.   

           Bill.1 ties an overhand bowline, rejects that and ties a 
           three-pointed star, then reties it into a cloverleaf pattern.

           Renko watches Bill.1 in the video, but suddenly his face is 
           stricken with horror.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Bill, hold up your hands.

           Bill does, wonderingly.
                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, my god, what the-- his arms are 
                        on backwards!  Jennifer, you put 
                        his hands on backwards!

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        I did no such thing.  He did it 
                        himself. 

           Bill.1 looks at his palms confusedly.  His thumbs are on the 
           wrong side, elbows bent the wrong way.  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Renko, if you’d move a little to 
                        your left, I will tie your tie.

           Renko turns and lifts his chin.  Those manipulator slide out 
           of those panels and move, startlingly fast, for Renko’s neck.  
           The arms tie the bow tie, super-quick and perfect. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jennifer, Bill needs an upgrade.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        I would recommend a complete 
                        replacement.  Something built in 
                        the last hundred years perhaps. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Come on, Jen, Bill and I have been 
                        together since the Academy.  Don’t 
                        mind her, Bill, just... do 
                        something about those arms.

           The robot-manipulators produce a comb and attempt several 
           styles on Renko’s head, settling on a Pat Riley slick-back. 

           The manipulators rapidly stick several styles of moustache 
           and beard on Renko, settling on a thin, dashing Gable-stache. 

           Bill.1 holds up Renko’s tuxedo jacket.  It’s facing the wrong 
           way.  But Bill crosses his arms and the jacket is correct.  

           Renko pulls it on... it’s huge, like it was cut for a giant.   

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Tailor, please.

           The tuxedo shrinks and adjusts to Renko’s form.  It’s 
           perfect, a classic one button number.  Renko looks into the 
           mirror and smiles at himself.

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Not bad, huh?  Not bad at all.  

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. THE JENNIFER 9  / AIRLOCK

           The tuxedoed Renko Vega punches numbers in an airlock door.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Equalizing pressure.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Has the Revolver’s security system 
                        detected us?

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        I’ve made contact with the ship’s 
                        AI.  It’s one of the new twelve-
                        personality models.   

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Multiple personalities?  How’s that 
                        go?

           There’s a HISS.  Lights go green.  Renko pulls open a hatch. 

           INT. REVOLVER PASSAGEWAY

           Dark, narrow.  Renko Vega climbs through huge ribs, the 
           superstructure of the Starlight Revolver.  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Twelve separate AI modules run its 
                        various functions.  In this case, 
                        our arrival was sensed by the 
                        janitorial brain, but since that 
                        system isn’t getting along with 
                        security brain, it failed to 
                        register an alert.

           INT. REVOLVER SPOKE TUBE - CONTINUING

           Renko climbs out of the passageway and into the interior of 
           this enormous “spoke”... a shaft a hundred feet across and 
           three hundred yards long.   

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        How convenient for us. 

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        I did plant a small germ of 
                        misinformation in the root drive.

           Renko descends stairs which spiral down the giant shaft.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Misinformation?  Not you, Jen.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. THE STARLIGHT REVOLVER / BALLROOM 

           An old fashioned ballroom, enormous, like something you might 
           find at an elegant old hotel.  There’s a dance floor, an 
           orchestra playing semi-classical favorites.

           There are tables loaded with flowers, china, silver, platters 
           of delicacies.  There’s a roped off area where there are 
           card, roulette, and baccarat tables.  Finally, along one 
           wall, there’s a huge and elaborate curtain.

           There are a HUNDRED PASSENGERS dressed in black tie... women 
           in gowns, men in tuxes.  

           The SHIP’S CREW are outfitted in their finest dress uniforms.  
           The DINING STAFF are wearing trim blue waistcoats with 
           epaulets.  They hustle platters of champagne and canapes.   

           The Revolver CAPTAIN talks to a GROUP of well-heeled SWELLS. 

                                 CAPTAIN 
                        And did we all enjoy the time-skip?

                                 SWELL #1
                        It’s hard to believe we traveled so 
                        far so quickly.  One minute we’re 
                        on moon-base, ten minutes later 
                        we’re drinking Martini’s over 
                        Titan.  Incredible!

           We SWING AROUND to another group... a collection of BANKER-
           TYPES, sipping Martinis.

                                 BANKER #1
                        I’ll tell you what, if President 
                        Ardmore doesn’t watch it, the 
                        corporate colonies will be in full 
                        revolt and his regime won’t be 
                        worth a nickel.    

                                 BANKER #2
                        I wouldn’t want to be in his 
                        position; he has no support other 
                        than Earth and the Mars colony. 

           One of the other is a cheerful, portly woman, DARLA CAHILL.  
           She shakes her head...

                                 DARLA CAHILL 
                        Oh Charles, must politics follow us 
                        everywhere?  

                                 BANKER #1
                        Darla, we can’t ignore the fact 
                        that Venus is in rebellion.  
                        They’re pushing us closer and 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BANKER #1 (CONT'D)
                        closer to an interplanetary 
                        incident.   

                                 DARLA CAHILL
                        Enough for now.  But here’s to 
                        Earth and President Ardmore...

           She hoists her glass and the others follow her lead.

                                 THE OTHERS
                        To Ardmore... to Earth...

           INT. REVOLVER JUNGLE

           A simulated jungle, complete with HOOTING BIRDS, BUZZING 
           INSECTS.  Renko walks quickly along a rope bridge suspended 
           over a sun-dappled tennis court.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Are you sure this is the right way?

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Yeah, jungleland bridge will take 
                        you over the pool and tennis 
                        courts.  You should see a thatched 
                        roof and some--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --French doors....

           A thatched, overhanging roof appears, underneath are some 
           French Doors... brightly lit from beyond.

           INT. REVOLVER / BALLROOOM 

           Renko steps through the French doors and into an alcove near 
           a service bar.  He finds a mirror, dusts his shoulders, 
           tweaks his tie. 

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        You look beautiful, Renko.  Now go 
                        get me lots of pretty pictures. 

           Renko smiles.  We FOLLOW as he swings into the room. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Copy that.

           Renko SWIMS through the crowd, a dashing figure, like an old-
           time movie star.  

           He grins at anyone who looks his way, but when WOMEN near 
           him, he really turns it on, eyeballing their swelling bosoms 
           loaded with glittering jewels. 
           BACK IN THE JENNIFER 9 

           We focus on a VIDEO SCREEN:  Lines rasterize and HASH, 
           Jennifer ZOOMS in on the jewelry.  Dollar values TOT up on 
           the screen (thousands, hundreds of thousands). 

           (Bill is in background, trying to put his arms on correctly.)  

                                 RENKO VEGA (V.O.)
                        Whoa, this is good stuff, but is 
                        there anyone here under a hundred?  

           BACK IN THE BALLROOM

           Renko keeps smiling as he grabs a champagne glass off a 
           passing tray.  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Unh, unh, Renko, you’re working... 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        It’s a prop, Jen.  Here we go...

           He spots Darla Cahill wearing a chunky necklace of emeralds.  
           Renko smiles at her.  She smiles back... but her HUSBAND 
           appears, glowering at Renko.

           Renko grins and nods at the husband and we see Renko’s easy 
           charm even works on guys... the husband smiles at Renko... no 
           harm no foul.

           But the husband’s attention wanders, Renko nears Darla again.

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Pencil me in for a dance?

                                 DARLA CAHILL
                        Only pencil... not ink? 

           BACK IN THE JENNIFER 9 

           Those emeralds glow on the video screen.  Numbers reel, 
           dollar signs spin northward.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Easy, Jocko... we’re saving 
                        ourselves for the big number.  

           BACK IN THE BALLROOM

           Renko swings through the crowd as he tosses down his 
           champagne cocktail, ready to make another tour.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Wouldn’t be a bad consolation 
                        prize, would it?
                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Can’t give up that easy, can we?

           The band stops abruptly and a microphone briefly WHISTLES.

                                 EMCEE
                        Ladies and gentlemen, may I direct 
                        your attention to the curtain on 
                        the wall beyond the bandstand...

           There’s a drumroll... everyone stops and turns...

                                 EMCEE (CONT’D)
                        The Starlight Revolver would like 
                        you to meet our special guest...

           WHISPERS cut through the room.  The lights dim, the enormous 
           curtain sweeps back, revealing a huge observation window.  

                                 EMCEE (CONT’D)
                        ...the one, the only, the planet, 
                        Saturn.

           SATURN is gigantic, her glorious rings cut through a 
           brilliant starlit field. 

           The view is greeted with OOHS and AHHHS... 

           As all eyes stare up in wonder, Renko keeps MOVING, taking in 
           BOUNTIFUL WATCHES, JEWELRY, BRACELETS ETC... all of which are 
           reflected in the Jennifer 9 VIDEO MONITORS...

                                 RENKO VEGA
                             (quietly, to Jen)
                        Any sign of her... anywhere at all?  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        It’s nice stuff, Renko, but she’s 
                        just not out on the floor. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Oh well... onto Plan B. 

           Renko suddenly finds himself standing in front of a young 
           woman in a trim ship’s uniform.  She’s in her late twenties, 
           pert, professional, fetching.  She holds a clipboard and is 
           charmingly nodding at the guests.   This is KATHRYN DELRIO.

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Why, hello, there.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Now, she is way off limits, Renko. 

                                 DELRIO
                        May I help you find your table, 
                        sir?
           Renko sighs, shakes his head...

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        I’m quite alright, thank you.

           As Renko moves off we STAY momentarily on Kathryn DelRio.  
           She looks after Renko and touches a tiny wire in her ear. 

                                 DELRIO
                        Mister Woods, I need an I.D.

           INT. STARLIGHT/SECURITY OFFICE

           Chief Security Officer, WALTER WOODS is a small man with a 
           goatee.  He stares at multiple screens.

                                 WOODS
                        Number five, please.  

           The screen ZOOMS, finds Renko, ZEROES IN on his smiling face.  
           It jiggles, boxes.

           A uniformed TECHNICIAN works controls, taps at an interface.  
           Digits ripple down a column.

           A cursor blinks... an alarm goes off, words flash...

                                  “ACQUIRING IDENTITY”  

           BACK IN THE BALLROOM 

           Renko spots a pair of SECURITY GUYS in tuxes moving towards 
           him.  They are purposeful but focused on being unobtrusive.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Whoops.  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Everything okay?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Looks like I’ve been spotted.  

           Renko steps quickly past a line of velvet ropes, separating 
           the dining area from the gaming tables. 

           He moves through GAMBLERS at a plush roulette table as the 
           ivory ball BALL CLACKS on the wheel.  

                                 CROUPIER
                        Red, twenty-three.  Winner is red, 
                        twenty-three.  

           The FAT MAN in front of Renko CELEBRATES with his friends as 
           the croupier doubles the fat man’s stack.  
           Cool as can be, Renko reaches around the guy and lifts a gold 
           chip off the stack.  He slips away again, palming the chip 
           and trying to keep his eye on those security guys.  

           He ducks back towards the dance floor, where the ORCHESTRA is 
           playing a WALTZ and a handful of COUPLES are dancing in 
           classic box steps.  

           Renko nears the ORCHESTRA CONDUCTOR, surreptitiously slips 
           him the golden chip and WHISPERS in his ear.  

           The conductor waves his wand, cutting off the waltz abruptly, 
           taps on the podium and swings his stick.  

           The orchestra, horns, strings, and all, hurl into an unlikely 
           rendition of “Twist and Shout”...

           The crowd RESPONDS with enthusiasm and fills the dance floor.   

           The security goons spot Renko and chase him onto the floor as 
           Renko grabs the hand of Darla Cahill.  She grins and gyrates 
           with Renko in a Kennedy-era “twist”.  

           One of the security guys taps Renko on the shoulder.  Renko 
           slides one foot back and turns.  Renko’s elbow “accidentally” 
           SMACKS into the guy’s solar plexus.  

           The guard CRASHES to the ground.  Renko’s move is so slick 
           and effortless that it’s barely noticed by the gleeful crowd, 
           though there is a bit of amiable confusion.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                             (smiling at Darla)
                        Sorry, madam, but I must be off.

                                 DARLA CAHILL
                        Pity.

           Renko takes off, finds a service door...

           INT. A LARGE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           MANY ROBOTIC APPLIANCES are hard at work turning out gourmet  
           platters on a conveyor belt.  

           One of the robots, a single articulated arm with a “head” 
           mounted on it’s vertical elbow, turns and glares at Renko 
           with a giant LENS.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Oh, hello... wrong turn.

           Renko keeps moving, finds another door.
           INT. ANOTHER REVOLVER CORRIDOR

           Renko Vega slips through the door and makes his way down 
           another swanky corridor, but suddenly those two security guys 
           show up at the other end of the hall. 

           Renko turns back, suddenly coming face to face with Walter 
           Woods, Kathryn DelRio, and more, FRESH SECURITY GUYS.  

           Renko stops dead, smiles charmingly.  The two guys who were 
           chasing move behind Renko and pulls his arms back.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Easy guys, it’s a rental. 

           Woods steps up to Renko, reaches up to his face and strips 
           off Renko’s false moustache.

                                 WALTER WOODS
                        Renko Vega.  Take a good look 
                        everyone, it’s not often we see a 
                        notorious outlaw this far out in 
                        the solar system.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Oh, you know that whole “notorious” 
                        thing is over-rated.

                                 WALTER WOODS
                        How about con man, thief, traitor?

           Renko’s smile disappears (it was that word, “traitor”).

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Easy, Renko. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        I’ll own it all except the last.

                                 WALTER WOODS
                        But isn’t that exactly what you 
                        are, Captain Vega... a traitor?   

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        I was framed-- 

                                 WALTER WOODS
                        --you jumped bail and fled.  You 
                        stole a valuable, experimental 
                        iNASA spacecraft... the Jennifer 9, 
                        wasn’t that her name?  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        --Easy now, Renko. 
                                 RENKO VEGA
                             (to Jen)
                        --It’s okay.

                                 WALTER WOODS
                        It’s okay?  Is it?  Ms. DelRio, 
                        thank you for your assistance.  
                             (to the guards)
                        Take him to the brig.  

           DelRio stares at Renko... something is not adding up for her.  

           INT. THE BRIG - A MOMENT LATER

           Woods and his boys shove Renko Vega inside.  It’s an eight-by-
           ten cell.  A toilet, a thin cot, a chair.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        You know boys, I’d really prefer 
                        something with a window.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE STARLIGHT REVOLVER

           The envoy fighter-craft float gently around the big wheel.  

           INT. ENVOY FIGHTER ONE

           PILOT #1 is monitoring his gauges.  Despite the starry 
           spectacle and the magnificent Revolver rotating slowly in his 
           plexi, the pilot yawns.  Space is kinda boring.

           A blip shows up on one of his instruments.  He spots it, taps 
           the screen, then touches his radio.

                                 PILOT #1
                        I got a little shock near the jump 
                        point... anyone?

           There’s a pause.  HISSING radios.

                                 PILOT #2
                        I see that, Cap.  I can drop and  
                        take a look. 

                                 PILOT #1
                        Roger that.  Tighten the formation 
                        and lock radios down.

           INT. THE BRIG - CONTINUING

           The door shuts behind him with finality.  Renko moves to the 
           door and listens carefully.  VOICES and FOOTSTEPS fade. 
                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jen, you there? 

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Still here.   

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        You got a tight lo-kay on me?

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        I will in a second.  

           Renko wriggles out of his jacket, sits in the chair and puts 
           his left arm on the table.  

           He grabs the index finger of his left hand and twists.  This 
           looks painful but apparently isn’t.  Renko spins the finger 
           off like he’s twisting the cap off a water bottle. 

           Inside is a complicated bit of mechanics... a rod-like bundle 
           of tubes slides up into through the finger socket.  

           Renko twists the top of a small ring on his middle finger... 
           there’s a voice, mechanical, slightly echoic...

                                 HAND
                        Hand is aware...

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Hand, activate program alpha-one.   

                                 HAND
                        Hand is arming impulse lasers.  
                        Fifteen seconds to detonation.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jen, you got a mark?

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Mapping.  

                                 HAND 
                        Please establish zero point.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jennifer, the Hand and I would like 
                        to get going-- 

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        --Still searching.  

                                 HAND
                        Ten seconds to detonation.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jennifer?
                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        The plating is a little heavier 
                        than I anticipated... maybe if you 
                        move around a little?  

           Renko is annoyed.  He waves the Hand around.

                                 HAND
                        Five seconds... zero point, please.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jennifer--

                                 HAND
                        --Beginning heavy radiation laser 
                        sequence one--

           The finger is glowing, heating up.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        --Got it!  Renko, turn to the 
                        right, eighteen degrees, point the 
                        Hand at the spot where the wall and 
                        floor meet!

           Renko does it. 

                                 HAND
                        Program active.   

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        A little to the left... there...

           Suddenly a gaseous, brilliant, narrow beam of light bursts 
           out of the Hand and SLAMS into the steel wall.  

           Renko is shoved backward as the Hand burns a brilliant door-
           pattern in the wall in a deliberately robotic way. 

           After only a few seconds, the Hand has done its work.  The 
           laser shuts down, there’s a CREAK and a WHOOSH, and the heavy 
           metal “door” SLAPS DOWN on the floor.  

                                 HAND
                        Hand is cooling, program alpha one 
                        complete, readying program two.  
                        You have three minutes.  

           INT. ENVOY FIGHTER TWO

           PILOT TWO fires his rockets.  His craft moves away from the 
           Revolver.  He scans his bubble.  A swirling circle appears in 
           the inky darkness.  
                                 PILOT #2
                        Heat’s rising.  My carbon sensors 
                        are spiking.

                                 PILOT #1
                        Jeezus... someone chased us through 
                        the jump hole! 

           Suddenly dozens of black things EXPLODE out of the darkness 
           and swarm towards the fighters.  They are half-insect, half-
           buzz bomb, each about the size of a tennis ball.

                                 PILOT #2
                        Black Flies!  

           A dozen of these “Black Flies” CRACK into fighter #2, jamming 
           themselves up his rocket pipes and HAMMERING into the plexi 
           screen!  The bubble SHATTTERS... and the ship EXPLODES!  The 
           pilot’s SCREAM is lost in the vacuum of space...

           The #1 pilot watches this with horror as he rotates, firing 
           his rockets, trying to get away...

                                 PILOT #1
                        Mayday!  Drones!  Black Flies--!

           --but BLAAAMMMM!  The swarm HAMMERS at him and his ship 
           IMPLODES, blasted out of the sky.  

           INT. THE CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS

           Another one of those laser-cut doorways CRASHES down on the 
           floor and Renko Vega steps inside, holding his smoking finger 
           up like a gun, then screwing the tip back on.   

           The Captain’s cabin is a paneled, den-like room.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jen, I’m in the captain’s cabin... 

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        There’s a map chest on the interior 
                        wall... and a latch between the 
                        chest and the bulkhead.  

           Renko spots the chest and slides his Hand behind it.  He 
           feels around, runs it down the other side.  

           A latch CLICKS.  Renko pulls open the cabinet door.  (It’s a 
           phony, the tubes of charts are only a few inches long.)  
           Inside is a large steel safe, rivets, latch, a big dial.

           The fingers on the Hand rub themselves together. 
                                 HAND
                        Program one-nine is ready, 
                        placement please.  

           Renko puts the fingers on the tumbler.  They spin the big 
           dial back and forth lightning fast.

                                 HAND (CONT’D)
                        The safe is open.  

           Renko tries to turn the big latch, but it won’t go. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        It’s not open.

                                 HAND
                        Are you certain?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Yeah, it’s not open.

           He puts the Hand back on the tumbler.  The fingers spin back 
           and forth, then stop.

                                 HAND
                        The safe is open. 

           Renko grabs the latch again, leans on it, but it won’t turn.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        It’s not open.

           The Hand doesn’t respond.  Renko looks at the Hand.

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Hello?  It’s not open.

                                 HAND
                        Hand is thinking.  Sequence beta,  
                        option four.  Please remove any 
                        flammables from the area and make 
                        certain all organic material is at 
                        least three meters from detonation 
                        point.  You have two seconds--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --What... wait, I’m organic--!! I-- 

           --Suddenly there’s a concussive FLASH from Renko’s Hand.  
           Renko falls backward amidst smoke and dust.

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Owww!!

           The safe door THUNKS to the ground. 
                                 HAND
                        The safe is open. 

           INT. FIGHTER ENVOY #3

           The pilot twists at his instruments as his ship is POUNDED by 
           the Black Flies... but his ship EXPLODES in just seconds... 

           EXT. SPACE

           Those Black Flies swarm around the two remaining fighters 
           which desperately race away from the Revolver.  

           Silently, the fighters EXPLODE, one after the other.

           INT. STARLIGHT REVOLVER BRIDGE - SAME

           The FIRST MATE is standing on the Revolver’s large bridge.

           There are FOUR TECHNICIANS at a big console with multiple 
           video screens under a large observation window in front of 
           them, revealing Saturn’s rings and a star-lit sky.  

                                 TECH #1
                        Sir, I’ve got heavy activity from 
                        the envoy fighters.

                                 FIRST EXEC
                        What kind of activity?

                        They broke formation, two ships 
                        went on a look-see on the backside 
                        and didn’t come back.  We’re trying 
                        to raise them but their comms are 
                        locked up in battle mode.

           INT. THE CAPTAINS QUARTER’S

           Renko moves near the safe and peers inside. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        I can’t stand it, Jen.  I can’t 
                        stand my Hand.  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        It can hear you, you know.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        I know it can hear me, it’s on the 
                        end of my arm!  I just don’t 
                        understand why it has to be so 
                        bossy.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        It’s not bossy.  It’s purposeful. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        It’s didactic and inflexible.  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        It got you in here, and got the 
                        safe open as well.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Why can’t he be more like Bill--?

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        --Bill is an idiot.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Bill is one helluva robot.

           Inside the safe, there’s paperwork, bundles of money.  Renko 
           ignores this stuff, focusing instead on a BLACK VELVET BOX.  

           He lifts the box gently and opens the top, and his breath 
           catches in his throat. 

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Jesus...

           INSIDE THE BOX

           There is chain necklace with a pendant and an enormous black 
           jewel in a delicate filigree setting.  

           BACK IN THE JENNIFER 9 

           The necklace is on the video.  The stats streak upwards to  
           levels.  The grid zooms...  

           A label flashes: “Genuine, genuine, genuine...” 
                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                             (an impressed whisper)
                        Renko... it’s the Lady... the Lady 
                        of the Shadows...

           BACK TO RENKO

           as he stares at this magnificent thing, awestruck.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        She’s all they ever said she was--

           --Suddenly ALARMS go off!

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Renko!  There’s trouble!  You’ve 
                        got to out of there!  Get out now!

           INT. THE BALLROOM

           A UNIFORMED MAN moves up to the captain and WHISPERS quietly 
           into his ear.  

           The captain nods and smiles at the group he’s with, MUTTERS 
           his apologies, and heads off. 

           BACK ON THE BRIDGE

           The Tech’s are monitoring movement outside the ship, watching 
           their exterior screens.  

                                 TECH #1
                        I’ve got nothing.  No signal.  We 
                        lost the envoy!

                                 TECH #3
                        What the hell is going on!?  We’re 
                        a cruise ship, a pleasure ship!

           Suddenly there’s one of those enormous silent EXPLOSIONS in 
           the observation screen and a ship appears...  

                                 FIRST MATE
                        Shit!  Something followed us 
                        through the jump tunnel!! 

           The swarm of Black Flies dart around this new ship, a 
           “corsair” called the “BLOODY HENRY”.

           Although it is complex it is also crude... an amalgam of 
           space junk, bits of an space station, rockets, booster tanks, 
           with a long probiscis-like weapon sticking out the top.   

                                 TECH #3
                        That explains the Black Flies...
           Suddenly the bridge doors fly open, the Captain and his STAFF 
           move into the room.  

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Mister Jennings, report!

                                 FIRST MATE
                        Captain, we’ve lost our envoy and 
                        we’re under attack!

           --The Captain checks the screens and suddenly reacts--

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Shut the shields!  That’s a Boron 
                        cannon!  She’s turning on us!

           EXT. THE BLOODY HENRY

           ...that cannon nose jerks, a glowing ball of plasma streaks 
           across the sky and HAMMERS into the side of the revolver.

           INT. THE REVOLVER BRIDGE

           There are SCREAMS!  ALARMS are SHRIEKING!

           INT. THE BALLROOM

           The room jerks hard; people are KNOCKED right off their feet.  
           Everyone looks up as the big window shields begin rolling 
           across the skyport.

           DelRio moves quickly for one of the ship’s officers.

                                 DELRIO 
                        What is it?  What’s going on?

                                 OFFICER
                        Stay here!  Calm the passengers, 
                        I’ll see what I can find out. 

           DelRio frowns, turns, and cuts for the exit. 

           EXT. CORRIDOR - NEAR THE BALLROOM

           DelRio ditches the clipboard and races down the corridor. 

           EXT. THE STARLIGHT REVOLVER

           Cables FIRE off the side of the “Bloody Henry” and grapple 
           onto the wheel-side of the Revolver.  The cables tighten, 
           pulling the Henry to the larger ship. 
           INT. REVOLVER CORRIDOR

           There’s an EXPLOSION... a big exterior door BURSTS open.   
           DOZENS of nasty CREATURES BURST into the corridor... 

           They are AUGMENTICS, and they are colorful and frightening, 
           like Hell’s Angels, but more evolved.  They’re armed with 
           ZIGZAG LASERS and bulbous RAYGUNS.  

           A half-dozen Revolver CREWMEN form a blockade, pointing sleek 
           palm-lasers at the Augmentics.  

                                 HEAD CREWMAN
                        Stop and lay down your weapons!   
                        This is a lawfully registered-- 

           --But the Augmentics are quick and-- WHAP!  WHAP!  WHAP!  And 
           the Revolver crewmen fall down.   

           The Augmentics move purposefully past the bodies, flooding 
           the corridor as we get a better look at them; we realize they 
           are all weird, but they are humans who have been altered.    

           There are DOGHEADS, ZIPPER-LIPS, JIB-JABBERS, CHICKENTOPS, 
           LAUGHING JACKS, CRAB-EYES, WING-BACKS, and MANDO-GRUBS.  

           Some of them have multiple arms, multiple heads, or faces on 
           different sides of their heads.  Some have three or four 
           eyes, and some of those eyes are in their hands.  

           They seem to revel in their nonconformity and in the fear 
           they strike in the hearts of regular, non-augmented human 
           beings (like you and I).  

           INT. A STATEROOM - SIMULTANEOUSLY

           Kathryn DelRio bursts into this large and lavish stateroom.  
           She rips through a small PASSAGEWAY, and into...

           INT. A BEDROOM 

           There’s a big four-poster bed.  Someone’s asleep in the bed 
           under a downy comforter.  

           DelRio moves to the bed, shakes its occupant awake.  A GIRL 
           in a sleep mask drowsily rises.  She is thirteen.   

                                 GIRL
                        What?  What is it?

                                 DELRIO
                        Get up.  Put some clothes on.  

                                 GIRL
                        No.
                                 DELRIO
                        Now.  Jeans.  Tennis shoes, a 
                        sweater.   

           DelRio hurries back out the door.   

           INT. THE STATEROOM 

           DelRio pulls a suitcase out from a closet, flips it open.  
           There’s another case inside.  She pulls that out, opens it.  

           CLOSE

           A disassembled gun: labels tell us it’s a Mercedes carcass, 
           Matsushita electronics.  It’s lethal-looking and complex... 

           INT. THE BALLROOM

           The Orchestra is still playing, when suddenly the room is 
           flooded with SHOUTING Augmentics.  

           They move quickly inside, using their weapons and ugliness to 
           THREATEN and BULLY the passengers.  They grab at the women’s 
           jewelry and rip it from their wrists and necks.     

           At the edges of the room passengers flee out the side exits.  

           INT. THE SURROUNDING CORRIDORS

           PASSENGERS hurry, trying to get to their staterooms.  But 
           MORE AUGMENTICS appear, grabbing the passengers, shoving them 
           hard back towards the ballroom.   

           INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR

           Renko Vega is moving out of the Captain’s quarter’s, and into 
           a corridor disguised as a AUTUMN WOODS.  Maple trees done in 
           yellows and reds hover above, with blue sky peeking through.  
           Brown leaves skitter through cool autumn air.  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Cut down the lane, and take your 
                        second left, cut over to spoke 
                        three!  Quick, Renko!  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        What’s going on? 

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        The Starlight Revolver has been 
                        boarded by pirates.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Of course it’s been boarded by 
                        pirates!  We’re pirates!  
                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        We’re not pirates, we’re charming 
                        rogues, well, you’re a charming 
                        rogue, I’m your brainy and 
                        beautiful sidekick.  I’m talking 
                        about pirates.   Just get to the 
                        spoke.  We need to get out now.

           Renko turns a corner, and sees TWO YOUNG COUPLES in tuxedoes 
           and gowns hurrying down a corridor.  

           Renko ducks behind a protruding bulkhead, watches as a GROUP 
           OF AUGMENTICS MOVE aggressively after the couple.  The 
           biggest one has two complete faces, one next to the other... 
           a form known as a JIB-JABBER. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Augmentics.  Yuck.  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        I told you.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        You said pirates, not semi-human 
                        idiots with self-image problems.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        They’re off a corsair called the 
                        Bloody Henry. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        How the hell did they get out here?  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        A transcript I’ve intercepted 
                        indicates that they came through 
                        the tunnel created by the 
                        Revolver’s skip-drive. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        They snake-holed ‘em.  Only a 
                        pirate would even consider a 
                        maneuver like that.  You’re likely 
                        to leave half your spaceship on the 
                        other side of the solar system. 

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        They swamped the fighter envoy with 
                        Black Flies and took down the 
                        bridge with a half-charge from a 
                        Boron cannon.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Where’d these monkeys get a Boron 
                        gun?
           Renko watches the Augmentics drag the four passengers out of 
           the stateroom.  

           Another pirate appears.  He is SHIZ.  He has a magnifying 
           glass mounted over on his head, which he swings into place as 
           he analyzes the four passengers.  

                                 SHIZ
                        Steve Shiz, science officer off the 
                        Bloody Henry.  This is Jib-Jab, 
                        Dogface, and this is Mando.  All my 
                        work.  Mando has eyes in the back 
                        of his head.  Go on, let ‘em have a 
                        peak.

           MANDO turns so we can see that, indeed, he has a pair of 
           blinking eyes in the back of his cranium.  

                                 SHIZ (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, augmentation is my 
                        specialty.  Now, that little mole 
                        on your cheek there?  What if we 
                        were to make it talk?  Or, you...  
                        you’d look good with a tail...

           He hands out cards...  

                                 SHIZ (CONT’D)
                        Fifteen minutes in the nearest 
                        men’s room.  I can fit you in this 
                        afternoon. 

           Jib-Jabber grabs one of the female passengers and drags her 
           down to the ground.  Her companion SHOUTS and swings at them.  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Renko, come home and let’s get out 
                        of here--

           Suddenly there’s a voice from the other end of the hall-- 

                                 DOON (V.O.)
                        --That’s enough!  

           MALTHAZAR DOON is standing at the end of the hall, glowering 
           at his men.  He is thick-chested, with a pair of six inch 
           horns jutting out of his scalp.  

                                 DOON (CONT’D)
                        Bring them back to the ballroom 
                        with the others.

           The other Augmentics stare at Doon.  

                                 DOON (CONT’D)
                        Take anything you want, but only 
                        after we find her...  
           Renko considers this statement as the Augmentics drag the 
           passengers down the corridor and away.

           Renko hesitates, then takes off after them...

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Wrong way, Renko... Renko... Renko! 

           INT. THE BALLROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           The passengers and the ship’s staff are gathered in long 
           rough rows in the lush ballroom.  

           The Revolver Captain is there, wearing a bruise on his face 
           and a torn jacket. 

           Malthazar Doon looks over all the swells and their finery.  
           He smiles as his men move through them, separating them from 
           jewelry, watches, and billfolds. 

           The Augmentics leave the booty in a pile near Doon’s feet.  

                                 DOON
                        Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for 
                        your generous donations.  My name 
                        is Malthazar Doon.  I am Captain of 
                        the corsair “Bloody Henry”.  

                                 CAPTAIN
                        You’ve got what you want, Doon, now 
                        leave us alone. 

                                 DOON
                        Don’t assume, Captain, that you 
                        have any idea what we want... 

           Doon turns to a tall woman with cat’s ears that twitch 
           alertly in the air.  She is MRS. MCMINK.  She is lithe and 
           dangerously beautiful. 

                                 DOON (CONT’D)
                        McMink, has he boarded yet?  

           McMink’s ears twitch, listening.

                                 MCMINK
                        He’s here.

           Everyone turns.  A group of MEN stride through the main 
           doors.  They are in matching but unadorned flightsuits.  They 
           are not Augmentics, but “normal” men.    

           The man in the middle is a fifty-year old guy with bristling 
           grey hair.  He is trim and stern.  He is CREIGHTON BEVILAQUA.  
           UP ON THE MEZZANINE

           Renko Vega is peeking through the balustrade of a balcony.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Renko, who is that guy?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        I thought you knew everything, Jen. 

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        I can take the time to do a facial 
                        scan, crossmatch, and look up his 
                        identity in my database, or you can 
                        just tell me.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        His name is Creighton Bevilaqua.  I 
                        used to work for him at iNASA.  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        So, what’s he doing here?  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        I don’t know, but it explains the 
                        Boron gun.  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        How’s that?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        iNASA designed the thing.  
                        Bevilaqua had level one access. 

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        So, who’s he working for now?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        My guess is he’s branched out on 
                        his own.  

           BACK ON THE FLOOR

           Bevilaqua looks over the passengers, addresses Doon.    

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Did you find her, Mister Doon?  

                                 DOON
                        No, Admiral.  We’ll have to search 
                        the ship in more detail.  Mrs. 
                        McMink will coordinate-- 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        --No.  Split your men into six 
                        parties.  My team will run the 
                        search.  We’ll start in the 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BEVILAQUA (CONT'D)
                        staterooms and work our way around 
                        the wheel.  Make sure all radio 
                        communications are shut down.  

                                 MCMINK
                        The antenna have all been 
                        destroyed.

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        And blow the lifepods.  No one gets 
                        off this ship.  No one.  

           Doon nods at McMink.  McMink smiles coyly and saunters off. 

           BACK TO RENKO

           ...as he considers what he’s heard.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        They’re looking for the lady, Jen.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        And they won’t find her.  If you 
                        get out of there now.  

           Renko looks down at the crowded ballroom.  The Augmentics 
           mock and intimidate the passengers.  Renko hesitates.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Come back to me, Renko.  Come 
                        home... we’ll be ten thousand miles 
                        away from here in an hour.

           Renko nods, climbs to his feet...

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Sounds good.  Which way do I go?  

           INT. REVOLVER PASSAGEWAYS - A MOMENT LATER

           Renko works his way down increasingly utilitarian 
           passageways.  He slips around a corner and finds a door 
           marked:  SPOKE ACCESS 4 - NO ADMITTANCE.  

           He tries the door.  Locked. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jen, can you open the access door?

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        The Brains have issued a general 
                        lockdown.  Gimme a minute... 

           There’s a NOISE.  Renko looks down the hall.  A GROUP of 
           AUGMENTICS are moving near.  Renko turns and slips into...
           A SIDE ALCOVE

           There’s a service door on a back wall.  Renko moves to the 
           door, then hears a CLICK and feels something on his neck.  

           Kathryn DelRio holds her Merc-Matsu gun up to Renko’s head. 

                                 DELRIO
                        Well if it isn’t our stowaway.  
                        Remember me, Captain Vega?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        You know that’s a big gun for such 
                        a little lady. 

                                 DELRIO
                        It makes big holes too. 

           More NOISES from the hall--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --They’re coming.  

                                 DELRIO
                        Friends of yours?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Do I look like one of them?

           We hear MUTTERING, FOOTSTEPS, CHATTER from the hall.   

                                 DELRIO
                        Against the wall.  Keep your mouth 
                        shut. 

           They pin themselves flat against the wall behind the door. 

           BACK IN THE PASSAGEWAY

           AUGMENTICS, led by one of Bevilaqua’s uniformed men, DURANGO, 
           move through the corridor, kicking through side doors, poking 
           their heads and guns in every corner. 

           They reach the alcove and one of the Augmentics sticks his 
           weapon inside.  He is a DOGHEAD, with a long canine snout.  

           BACK IN THE ALCOVE

           Doghead moves slowly inside the alcove and steps beyond the 
           bulkhead where DelRio and Renko hide.  He focuses immediately 
           on that service door, SNIFFING with his dog-nose. 

           DelRio tracks Doghead with her gun, but Renko sends her a 
           tight warning, and a firm, pleading shake of the head...
           Doghead opens the service door.  It’s a janitorial closet, 
           filled with mops and cleaning supplies-- but Durango’s VOICE 
           CALLS from the hallway.  

           Doghead hesitates, turns, cautiously steps back out, and 
           rejoins the others in the corridor.  After a moment their 
           FOOTSTEPS and VOICES DIMINISH as they move out of earshot.  

                                 DELRIO (CONT’D)
                             (to Renko)
                        Now why don’t you tell me what 
                        you’re doing up here?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Same thing you’re doing.  Trying to 
                        get away from those freaks. 

           DelRio stares at Renko, adding this up...

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        I don’t like this one, Renko.  I 
                        don’t like her one bit. 

                                 DELRIO
                        You aren’t a stowaway at all, are 
                        you, Vega?  There’s no way you’d be 
                        able to get through security on 
                        Earth.  And if you didn’t come here 
                        on that corsair, and I don’t think 
                        you did, then you got on this ship 
                        some other way... and I gotta 
                        believe it’s parked out on the hull 
                        somewhere.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Interesting theory.

                                 DELRIO
                        How about you and I make a deal?  
                        How about I don’t kill you-- 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --That’s a start--

                                 DELRIO
                        --and you get us off this ship.

           Renko starts to protest, then it hits him...

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        ...us?

           DelRio turns and pulls the service closet open.

                                 DELRIO
                        It’s alright.  Come on out. 
           A locker opens.  That twelve-year-old girl we met earlier 
           steps out, walking through the door and into the alcove.

           Renko stares at her.  She stares back... a penetrating gaze.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Hey.

                                 GIRL
                        Hey.  Who are you?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        My name's Renko.  Renko Vega.

                                 GIRL
                        Weird name.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        People think it suits me.   

                                 GIRL
                        Because you’re weird? 

           BACK IN THE JENNIFER 9 

           Renko's video rasterizes, zeroing in on the girl's face.  
           Lines flicker, boxing out the girl's eyes, measuring...

           BACK TO RENKO

           Still in the corridor... Jennifer’s voice back in his head...

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Renko, there’s something about that 
                        girl.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                             (to the girl)
                        So, who are you?

                                 DELRIO
                        She’s my sister.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        You don’t look like sisters. 

                                 DELRIO
                        The light in here is bad.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        I’m gonna shoot her specs through 
                        the database.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Copy that.
                                 GIRL
                        Copy what?  Hey Kathryn, I think 
                        your friend is a Purple Zombie.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        I’m not a Purple Zombie.  What's a 
                        Purple Zombie?  

                                 GIRL
                        A freak so wired-up and jacked-in  
                        he no longer participates in 
                        reality. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        I’m not a zombie, okay?  I just 
                        don’t like people that much.

           DelRio waves her gun threateningly at Renko. 

                                 DELRIO
                        Let's get going, Vega.

           Renko exits and crosses over to that Spoke Four door.  The 
           one with the seals and the warnings.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                             (very quietly)
                        What’s the progress on the door, 
                        Jen?

           Renko glances and catches the girl’s expression of disgust.

                                 GIRL
                        All Zombie all the time.    

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.) 
                        The brains put up a firewall.   
                        You’ll have to use the Hand. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Oh, for Crissakes, not again.  

           He glances at the others, then twists the ring on his middle 
           finger and spools off his index finger.   

                                 HAND
                        Hand is aware.

                                 GIRL
                        What the hell are you doing?  
                        What’s he doing?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Program four, access and penetrate.

                                 DELRIO
                        What is that thing, Vega?
                                 RENKO VEGA
                        It’s my Hand, okay?  I lost my real 
                        hand in an airlock door four years 
                        ago, so I got a new one?  Believe 
                        me I liked the old one better.

                                 HAND
                        Hand is thinking.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Hand is talking.  Just blow the 
                        door, okay?   

                                 HAND
                        Arming detonation cycle and laser 
                        igniter, you have three seconds--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --Aww for cr--
                             (to DelRio and the girl)
                        --Get back!  Get back--!!

           --Renko points the Hand at the doorlatch mechanism, and turns 
           his head.  That laser BLASTS out and POUNDS the big door.  

           Renko flies back from the force.  A moment later, as the 
           smoke clears we see the door lock is blown.  The door swings 
           lightly on its hinges.   

                                 HAND
                        Door is open.  Will the Hand's 
                        services be required again?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        No.  Go take a nap or something.

                                 GIRL
                        He’s kind of an jackass isn’t he?  
                             (off Renko’s look)
                        I meant the Hand.  But you too. 

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Renko, they’re coming back--!    
                        Get out of there, now! 

           Renko turns and looks at the end of the hall. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Crap-- 

           --He grabs DelRio and the girl and shoves them through the 
           door just as those Augmentics appear and start SHOUTING.  

           Renko pulls the door shut but it’s damaged from the Hand’s 
           assault and the latch doesn’t close.  
           The Augmentics run down the corridor.  Durango stops at the 
           burned door, reaching to pull it open, motioning for the 
           others to get behind him. 

           BACK ON THE JENNIFER 9 

           That video monitor rapidly flashes through a variety of 
           photos, some old, some new, finally settling on one.  

           It’s a 3D image of a handsome man in his mid-forties posed at 
           a desk.  There's a bunch of flags on either side and an 
           elaborate Presidential seal on the wall behind him.

           A label on the photo identifies the man as: 

                                 "James Joplin Ardmore, 
                             Third President of United Earth"

           Those raster lines sizzle and fly.  Jennifer ZOOMS in close 
           on Ardmore’s eye... measuring...

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Son of a bitch.

           BACK IN THE PASSAGEWAY

           Durango slowly pushes open the door.  He pokes his gun in and 
           steps inside.  

           INT. SPOKE FOUR

           We’re in the spoke-shaft with that catwalk spiraling up.  
           Wind blows up through the shaft, an eerie WAILING SOUND.  

           For a moment it appears there’s no one here, then suddenly 
           WHAM!  Renko Vega KICKS UP hard into the guy’s face.   
           Durango’s eyes go blank and he drops to the floor.    

           Renko hurries back to the door and, along with the two women, 
           JAMS against it as the Augmentics push from the other side. 

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        --Renko, I gotta talk to you--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --Kinda busy now--

           The Augmentics are forcing the door, prying their way in.    

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Renko, it’s about that girl--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --Not now, Jen.
                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        She is not who you think--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --Quiet, Jennifer!

                                 DELRIO
                        --Jennifer?  The Jen 9!  You’re 
                        talking to your ship!  You do have 
                        a way out--

           DelRio backs off the door and futzes with keypad on her gun.

                                 DELRIO (CONT’D)
                        --Alright, let ‘em in!  I’ll take 
                        them all at once.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        What?!  

                                 DELRIO
                        Let it go and cover your ears!  

           The girl backs off and covers up.  DelRio’s got the gun up.

                                 DELRIO (CONT’D)
                        Cover your ears!  Cover your ears!  

           Finally Renko ducks back and the door flies open.  A half-
           dozen Augmentics burst through... and DelRio FIRES the gun.

           BOOOOMMMM!  WHIIIIINNNEE! ...a huge EXPLOSION and a wave of 
           INTENSE SOUND BLOWS the bad guys right off their feet.  

           Renko SCREAMS and covers his ears as a WHINING FEEDBACK fills 
           his head... then that WHISTLING SOUND, the wobbly tea kettle.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Renko!  Renko!   

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jennifer!  Jen!

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                             (diminishing)
                        Renko...!  Renko...!  Ren...

           And then Jennifer’s voice vanishes into the WHISTLE... and 
           the whistle RESOLVES into a soft HUMM... then nothing...

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jen, are you there?  Jennifer... 

           The girl is on her feet, looking at the ugly Augmentics 
           laying around on the floor.
                                 GIRL
                        Are they dead?

                                 DELRIO
                        Maybe.  Some of them, anyway.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        What the hell was that?

                                 DELRIO
                        Sonic pulse generator, the only way 
                        to take them all at once--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        You almost killed us--

                                 DELRIO
                        --Relax, I calculated the risk--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        You knocked out my comm link!  I 
                        lost Jennifer.

                                 DELRIO
                        Look Vega, we gotta get outta here, 
                        I’m sure they heard that through 
                        the whole ship-- 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        We have to split up.  You’re not 
                        safe with me--

                                 DELRIO
                        --Why?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Because, I’ve got this.  

           He opens his collar and pulls out a crimson-colored ribbon.  
           On the end of it is the Lady of the Shadows. 

                                 DELRIO
                        The Lady of the Shadows.  We were 
                        carrying it to the Saturn Colony 
                        for safekeeping.  You stole it! 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Right.  Now, get moving--!  

                                 DELRIO
                        They’re not looking for you, Vega.  
                        I’m sure those jerks would be happy 
                        to find that rock but they probably 
                        don’t even know it’s on board. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        What are you talking about?  
                                 DELRIO
                        You’ve been out of touch.  
                        Creighton Bevilaqua is an enemy of 
                        the state, working against 
                        President Ardmore and United Earth.  
                        He’s after something far more 
                        valuable than that moonstone. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Like what?

                                 DELRIO
                        A passenger.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        What passenger?

                                 DELRIO
                             (shaking her head)
                        I thought you’d have figured it out 
                        by now... 

           DelRio turns and nods at the girl, who is standing at the 
           bottom of the stairs, backlit, face in shadow.

                                 DELRIO (CONT’D)
                        Captain Vega, may I present...

           DelRio bows her head in a formal way and extends her arm...

                                 DELRIO (CONT’D)
                        ...Miss Elizabeth Ardmore, Princess 
                        of Mars, daughter to James Joplin 
                        Ardmore, Commander in Chief and 
                        President of United Planet Earth...

           Renko stares as the girl steps up and sneers at Renko... 

                                 GIRL
                        You’re supposed to bow you know.
                             (to DelRio)
                        He’s supposed to bow.

                                 DELRIO
                        He doesn’t know.  Or he’s 
                        forgotten.

           Renko hesitates.  We move in CLOSER on him... 

                                 DELRIO (CONT’D)
                        ...or perhaps he’s exactly what 
                        they say he is... a traitor...

           Renko considers these words... feeling their weight... but he 
           does not move... he does not bow.  
                                 DELRIO (CONT’D)
                        Well, I guess we know where you 
                        stand.  Not that it matters, 
                        because you’re still taking us out 
                        of here. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE STARLIGHT REVOLVER

           She’s in full sun know, floating gently over the enormous 
           orange surface of Titan...

           INT. REVOLVER “POOLHOUSE” - MOVING

           Malthazar Doon and Creighton Bevilaqua stride along a curving 
           bridge above an swimming pool done in Venetian opulence.  
           They pass shuffleboard courts, a shimmering fountain.  

           They approach a large door set in marble.  McMink slouches 
           against the doorframe.  She counts off on her fingers.

                                 MCMINK
                        Oxygen, Gravity, Housekeeping, 
                        Social Services, Catering, 
                        Sanitation, Janitorial, Pest 
                        Control, Communication, Music and 
                        Entertainment, Skip-Jump, and 
                        Security.  That’s twelve.

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Are they cooperating?

                                 MCMINK
                        They’re worried about their own 
                        skins... well, if they had skins... 

           INT. REVOLVER CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS

           A dark room, but large and well-appointed room.  A 
           transformer HUM undermines the air.   There’s a big aquarium-
           like tank in the middle of the tile floor with all kinds of 
           tubes and wires running around, under, and over it.   

           In the tank are twelve large BRAINS suspended in viscous 
           electrolytic goop.  They look like human brains but bigger.  
           There are bundles of colorful wires dangling ganglia-like out 
           of each brain stem and running down into electronic raceways.  

           Eerie lights glow from the tanks, throwing the entire room 
           into a swimming lava-lamp glow.   

           There is also a small JANITOR ROBOT, wheeling a steaming 
           bucket around, mopping the floor. 
           As Bevilaqua, Doon, and McMink penetrate the gloom we hear  
           MUTTERING, ARGUING, then, more clearly:

                                 BRAINS (V.O.)
                        Quiet, here they come.  

           A battery of cameras with many lenses mounted behind the 
           brains track Doon, Bevilaqua, and McMink...

           The cameras are especially interested in the boom-chicka walk 
           of McMink.  She smiles, well-aware of her attributes. 

                                 MCMINK
                        Boys and Girls, these are the guys 
                        I was telling you about.  This is 
                        the powerful and crafty Admiral 
                        Creighton Bevilaqua and this is the 
                        mighty Mister Malthazar Doon...
                             (to Doon and Bevilaqua)
                        These impressive bundles of protein 
                        are the Starlight Revolver 
                        operating system... 

           TWELVE VOICES speak all at once--

                                 BRAINS (V.O.)
                        Nice to meet you-- 
                        --How’s it going-- 
                        --Hello-- 
                        --Pleasure-- etc. 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Let me be brief.  Have any of you 
                        knowledge of the whereabouts of 
                        Elizabeth Ardmore? 

           All the BRAINS talk in a variety of voices, male and female: 

                                 BRAINS (V.O.)
                        Who--?
                        --No-- 
                        --None--
                        --Didn’t even know she was aboard--

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        President Ardmore’s daughter is 
                        somewhere on this ship and I want 
                        to know where.  

                                 BRAINS
                        --No idea, sir-- 
                        --She’s not on the passenger list-- 

           Bevilaqua stares at the Brains.  He turns, glances at the 
           housekeeping robot, dutifully cleaning the floor.
                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Robot, what’s in that bucket?

                                 ROBOT
                        Sir.  Infection on a spacecraft is 
                        dangerous both for the passengers 
                        and the organic operating system--

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        --What is in the bucket?

                                 ROBOT
                        A compound of sodium hydrochloride, 
                        muriatic acid, and lye heated to 
                        boiling point.  Death to germs. 

           Bevilaqua looks at McMink, then nods at the tank. 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Choose one of them. 

                                 MCMINK
                        Security.  Number five there.

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Security.  Where is the Ardmore 
                        girl?  

                                 BRAIN
                        I’m sorry sir, I wonder if you’re 
                        familiar with the interplanetary 
                        agreement of 2079-- 

           --Bevilaqua moves quickly forward, grabs the number five 
           wiring harness that dangles down into the tank.  He pulls 
           furiously, jerking the brain up from its perch. 

                                 BRAIN (CONT’D)
                        No!  Please, no!  NO!!

           All the Brains SHOUT in terror as Bevilaqua walks the 
           wriggling brain over to the robot’s bucket.   

                                 BRAIN (CONT’D)
                        This is highly illegal--! 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        --Now, where is the girl?!

           The brains PLEAD and PROTEST... and without hesitation, 
           Bevilaqua drops the Security brain in the bucket.  

           There’s a brief SHOUT as the brain HITS the noxious 
           concoction.  Then boils and HISSES. 

           McMink leans over for a better look as Bevilaqua turns back 
           to the remaining brains. 
                                 BEVILAQUA (CONT’D)
                        Now... where is the Ardmore girl?

           The brains have gone quiet.  Finally, one speaks...

                                 BRAINS
                        While we are unaware of the girl’s 
                        identity or her current location, 
                        there are only three passengers 
                        under the age of sixteen on the 
                        ship’s manifesto.  The lone female 
                        is a thirteen-year-old assigned to 
                        stateroom twenty-four on “A” deck.

                                 DOON
                        We’ve cleaned out all the passenger 
                        decks.  There was no girl.

           There’s WHISPERINGS from the brains, a disagreement. 

                                 MCMINK
                        What is it, boys and girls?

                                 BRAINS (V.O.)
                        Well with all your personnel 
                        movements it’s hard to tell but 
                        there was an incident at spoke four 
                        a short time ago.  One of the 
                        access doors may have been forced.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SPOKE FOUR STAIRWAY

           Renko climbs up that enormous spiraling staircase.  The 
           interior of the spoke is huge, echoic, cathedral-like.  
           Kathryn DelRio and the girl follow.  

           As Renko ascends he glances behind him.  DelRio’s got that 
           gun and is watching him carefully. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        So, I guess you’re a member of the 
                        Secret Service, is that right? 

                                 GIRL
                        She’s Special Agent Kathryn DelRio.  
                        Her friends call her “Nails”.  
                        She’s single and an expert at hand-
                        guns, explosives, and needlepoint.  
                        In her spare time she likes long 
                        walks on the beach and puppydogs--   

                                 DELRIO
                        --Just keep moving, Vega.  Let’s 
                        get our little bundle home to bed 
                        and we can chit-chat all you like.  
                                 GIRL
                        Where the hell are we going anyway? 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        The Jennifer’s parked out a strut 
                        between the spokes.  We get to 
                        about halfway up then work our way 
                        out to the skin.    

                                 DELRIO
                        You better not be gaming us, Vega. 

                                 GIRL 
                        You know Agent DelRio, he is a 
                        zombie but, beyond that, he seems 
                        kind of okay... 
                             (to Renko)
                        I mean as assholes go.  

                                 DELRIO
                        You’re too young to remember.

                                 GIRL
                        Remember what?

           Renko keeps moving and doesn’t look back.

                                 DELRIO
                        Renko Vega was one of the first 
                        interplanetary astronauts.  When I 
                        was your age he was always on the 
                        newsfeeds, “Renko Vega Leads 
                        Scientists in Exploration of 
                        Mercury”, “Renko Vega Saves Sixteen 
                        off Ganymede.”  He singlehandedly 
                        flew into the heat of Tartarus and 
                        towed out a disabled lightship.  
                        “Renko Vega”, even his name was 
                        magical.  They wrote songs about 
                        him--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --One song... and the words were 
                        terrible.

                                 GIRL
                        So Renko Vega was a hero? 

           DelRio glances at Renko again.  We can tell by the look in 
           her eyes that Renko was a hero... perhaps even her hero.  

                                 DELRIO
                        He was.  Which made it all the more 
                        disappointing when he screwed it 
                        all up.
                                 GIRL
                        How did he screw it up?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Do we really have to do this?

                                 DELRIO
                        Things changed... the multi-
                        nationals started taking over the 
                        planet-colonies, the Venus 
                        corporation rebelled against Earth 
                        and acquired stolen plans for a 
                        skip-drive developed by iNASA.  All 
                        the evidence pointed to our Renko 
                        here.  He was arrested, court-
                        martialed, and stood a public 
                        trial. 

           Renko shakes his head as he continues to climb.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        I didn’t steal anything.  And 
                        certainly not for those jerks on 
                        Venus.

                                 DELRIO
                        That’s not what the jury thought.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        The jury was bought and paid for.  
                        The whole thing was rigged. 

                                 DELRIO
                        Then if you were so innocent why 
                        did you run?  

                                 GIRL
                        He ran?

                                 DELRIO
                        He stole the Jennifer 9 and 
                        vanished--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --She’s was mine, she was built for 
                        me-- and who else could I trust?  
                        Who else trusted me?

                                 GIRL
                        Whoa, You’re talking about your 
                        ship.  She’s a machine.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        You can trust machines.  They have 
                        integrity.  They have a list of 
                        instructions and they follow them.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT'D)
                        They can’t be bought.  Unlike 
                        humans.

                                 GIRL
                        You really are a zombie.  Maybe 
                        King of the Zombies.

           They reach a large hatchway

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Here we are--

           --But suddenly the lights go out all around.  ALARMS sound.

                                 DELRIO
                        What’s going on?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                             (looking around)
                        They cut the power. 

           There are NOISES.  Renko peeks.  Up the spoke there are 
           people MOVING, TALKING.  Secondary lighting glows up.

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Emergency batteries.  

           Suddenly, cables running down the center of the spoke start 
           moving.  Something glowing, lantern-like is sliding down the 
           center of the shaft from above.  

                                 DELRIO
                        What is that?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Elevator down from the engine 
                        rooms.  Get back and keep quiet.

           They watch as a platform appears, dropping down the cables... 
           it’s an open elevator, glowing like a lantern on a wire.  

           There are THREE AUGMENTICS riding on this platform.  One of 
           them is standing guard.  He has a big blower gun and is 
           staring out at the spiral stairwell.   

           Searchlights on the elevator sweep along the shaft.  The 
           Augmentic CALLS OUT and the elevator stops. 

           Renko, the girl, and DelRio watch from the shadows.  We can 
           see that the platform carries a series cylindrical rods on 
           wheeled dollies.  (We’ve seen these rods before.)

                                 GIRL
                             (a whisper)
                        What is that stuff?  
                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Fusion rods.  Power for the central 
                        thrusters.  They’re what keep us 
                        moving in ordinary space.

           The head Augmentic motions to the others and the elevator 
           begins to drop but at a slower, searching speed.

                                 GIRL 
                        So, I guess they’re valuable, huh?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Very.  But that’s not all.  Without 
                        them there’s no way to fire the 
                        thrusters and pull out of Titan’s 
                        orbit--  

                                 GIRL
                        --What happens if we can’t pull out 
                        of Titan’s orbit?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Eventually, this ship burns up in 
                        the atmosphere.  

                                 GIRL
                        Then we have to go up and restart 
                        those engines. 

                                 DELRIO
                        --No.  We’re getting off this ship--

                                 GIRL
                        --I order you to take me up to the 
                        engines. I’m the goddamn Princess 
                        of Mars, you know--

                                 DELRIO
                        --It’s a nice title, Elizabeth, but 
                        that’s all it is.  You’re my boss’s 
                        daughter that’s all--

                                 GIRL
                             (to Renko)
                        --then I order you--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --Oh, leave me out of this.  
                        Actually, I’m on big sister’s side.   
                        I don’t owe anyone anything and I’m 
                        gonna keep it that way. 

           DelRio motions Renko to get moving.  The girl sulks but 
           DelRio prods her.  She GRUMBLES but keeps moving.  

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. SPAR - A FEW MINUTES

           Renko climbs into this dark long space.  It’s a tunnel lit 
           only by sparse emergency lighting.  The girl and DelRio move 
           out behind him.   

           Suddenly dark shapes are moving at the far end of the tunnel.

                                 DELRIO
                        Down!

           They all duck below the spar, but they’ve been spotted.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Run!  Run!

                                 DELRIO
                        What are you going to do?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Keep climbing, I’ll double back 
                        around!

           Renko takes off down the tunnel.  DelRio and the girl hurry 
           through the shadows the other way.

           INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR

           Renko hurries down this passageway, he heaves open a hatch, 
           but there’s Augmentics on the other side.

           He slams it shut and cuts across the chamber.... but there’s 
           a BLAST at that door and it CRACKS OPEN. 

           Suddenly AUGMENTICS flood the room.  Renko is surrounded.  He 
           throws up his arms, smiles. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Hey, I was wondering where ever-- 

           --The Auggies grab him and shove him down on the floor, 
           pinning him there.  

           Malthazar Doon move through the crowd.  Doon levels his gun 
           at Renko.  But Renko smiles... and then, surprisingly, Doon 
           smiles as well... 

                                 DOON
                        Renko Vega!  Of all the... well who 
                        else!  Renko Vega!  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Hello Doon.
                                 DOON
                        Haven’t seen you since Harry 
                        Hondo’s funeral over on Jupiter.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Poor old Harry.  So, how’s the 
                        scumbag business, Doon?  

                                 DOON
                        It’s going well, Vega, very well.  
                        Now, where’s the Ardmore girl?  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Ardmore girl?  I really don’t know 
                        what you’re talking about--

           --Doon sneers, but suddenly there’s a NOISE.  McMink enters.  
           Behind her are DelRio, unarmed, and the girl, hostile, being 
           prodded by a couple of Augmentics. 

           Renko stares at them, disappointed.

                                 DOON
                        Good work, McMink.  Shiz, call the 
                        Admiral and tell we have some 
                        interesting fish to fry.  

           Doon looks down at Renko, still pinned to the floor.  

                                 DOON (CONT’D)
                        You know, I always liked you, Vega.  
                        I figured if you ever got that 
                        victim-hero, hero-victim crap out 
                        of your system, you could really be 
                        something special.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        You mean maybe I could be someone 
                        like you?  Another King of the 
                        Shitheads? 

           Doon’s smile disappears as he rears back and kicks Renko hard 
           right in the jaw, then KICKS AGAIN, as we...

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           INT. INNER CORE STOREROOM 

           Renko Vega wakes to find himself strapped to a chair.  The 
           lights are dim.  There’s no one’s around.  

           He’s got bruises on his face.  He moves experimentally, finds 
           that his bindings are metal straps of some sort.

           There’s a door to one side of the room and a surveillance 
           camera mounted in front of him. 
                                 RENKO VEGA
                             (softly)
                        Hand!  Hand, can you hear me?  
                        Hand!  Activate! 

           CLOSE ON HIS HAND

           We move CLOSE on Renko’s left hand.  It twitches...   

                                 HAND
                        Hand is aware.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Quietly, okay?  Quiet.

                                 HAND
                             (whispering)
                        Hand can be quiet.  Hand can be 
                        very quiet. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Listen, Hand, prepare to separate, 
                        and enter autonomous mode.  

                                 HAND
                        Separation is a radical maneuver, 
                        Renko Vega, one often accompanied 
                        by pain for the major partner. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        I’m aware of that Hand, now prepare 
                        to separate.  

                                 HAND
                        Hand will separate in two, one--

           --Renko CRIES OUT, stifling his SCREAM as the Hand POPS off 
           the end of his arm with a small EXPLOSIVE charge.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Oh, my god, that HURTS!  

           The Hand writhes on the floor for a moment and tries to stand 
           up on his fingers.  He wobbles around, falls, then like a 
           newborn colt, manages to stand.

                                 HAND
                        Hand is autonomous.  Hand is free. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Hand, listen, I want you to use 
                        your lasers on these bindings.  

                                 HAND
                        Hand is free.

           The Hand skitters out onto the floor, enjoying his freedom. 
                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Hand, stay away from that camera--!  

           --Suddenly there’s a sound.  Renko and the Hand turn-- 

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Quick, back on the end of my arm!

                                 HAND
                        No time!

           But the door swings open, the Hand dives out of view.  ONE of 
           Bevilaqua’s PERSONAL GUARDS steps inside, followed by the 
           steely Admiral himself. 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                             (to the guard)
                        That’ll be all. 

           The guard goes out.  Bevilaqua grabs a chair and sits.     

                                 BEVILAQUA (CONT’D)
                        It’s good to see you, Renko.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Oh, is that right?

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Of course I have to wonder what 
                        you’re doing out here on this 
                        “cruise” ship or whatever it is.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Maybe I should ask you the same 
                        thing, Admiral. 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        The Jennifer... is she here too?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        I lost her.  Eight months ago.  A 
                        meteorite off Icarus.   

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        You’re lying. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Am I the liar, Admiral?  You were 
                        the one who sold the plan to the 
                        Venus corp, weren’t you?  Then you 
                        framed me and bought off the jury. 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        I’m surprised it took you this long 
                        to figure it out, Renko.  President 
                        Ardmore and his cronies have a 
                        choke-hold on the planets.  The 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BEVILAQUA (CONT'D)
                        corporations just want their little 
                        piece of the pie--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --Oh, come one Admiral, you have no 
                        political allegiance.  You sold 
                        those plans for money... it’s the 
                        same reason you’re out here today.  

           Bevilaqua gives a tiny shrug, a small smile.

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Renko, if it means anything, I’m 
                        sorry you had to take the fall.  
                        The only way to mask my actions was 
                        to blame it on someone else.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        And now you’re off kidnapping a 
                        twelve-year-old girl-- 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        --She’s nothing, Renko!  She’s a 
                        pawn in a much bigger game.     

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        You’re the traitor.  Not me.    

           Bevilaqua smiles at Renko and stands. 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Unfortunately Renko, I can’t afford 
                        to have you knowing what you know.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        So you’re gonna have your goons 
                        come in here and shoot me?

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        They won’t have to shoot you 
                        because in less than an hour, this 
                        ship is going to come apart in 
                        Titan’s atmosphere.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        And what about the hundred and 
                        fifty people down in that ballroom?  

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Like you, they have the misfortune 
                        of being in the wrong place at the 
                        wrong time.  

           He goes out.  Renko stares at the door a moment.  Then the 
           Hand crawls out from his hiding place under the chair. 
                                 HAND
                        So, let me get something straight, 
                        Renko Vega.  Admiral Creighton 
                        Bevilaqua, the former head of iNASA 
                        was responsible for selling secret 
                        documents... and not Renko Vega.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Hand, stop talking, we only have an 
                        hour--  

                                 HAND
                        --But how could the Hand not know 
                        this?  The Hand has been at the end 
                        of Renko Vega’s arm for the past 
                        four years--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --Hand, please! 

           The Hand considers, “pacing” back and forth...

                                 HAND
                        Renko Vega is an interesting 
                        entity, filled with contradictions 
                        and unexpected surprises.  Even to 
                        his own Hand.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE BALLROOM

           Augmentics drag a writhing Elizabeth Ardmore and stand her 
           next to Kathryn DelRio, who has her hands bound behind her.  

           Bevilaqua stares at the girl and smiles.  She glowers at him.

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Miss Ardmore, you’ve no idea how

                        I shouldn’t expect anything less 
                        out of you given your parentage. 

                                 GIRL
                        I’m sorry, but did you wanna be 
                        friends?

                        Lock them up in the brig until 
                        we’ve loaded out.  
                             (to Doon)
                        Is your ship ready to board?

                        The Henry will be in shadow in a 
                        quarter hour, until then the 
                        radiation’s too high for the 
                        portalock.

                        The sooner we’re out of here the 
                        better.

                                 DOON
                        Admiral, the Bloody Henry has some 
                        extra room.  I thought we could 
                        take some of the Revolver 
                        passengers.  They don’t all need to 
                        die.

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        We can’t take that risk. 

                                 DOON
                        They don’t know about the girl,  
                        and we can keep it that way.  

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        You and I had an agreement, Doon.  
                        I get safe passage and the girl, 
                        you get the Boron cannon and 
                        everything you can carry.  Don’t 
                        make it any more complicated than 
                        it already is.

           INT. A REVOLVER CORRIDOR

           Bevilaqua’s guard is out in the hall at a little desk.  On 
           the desk is a monitor.  On the monitor is Renko Vega, 
           strapped to his chair.

           INT. STOREROOM - CONTINUING

           The Hand has climbed up Renko’s back, out of view of the 
           camera.  The Hand has the cap off his finger and, using the 
           probe as a torch, is cutting Renko’s metal bindings.

                                 HAND
                        Hold still, Renko Vega.
           Sparks stream, a TORCH HISSES.  In a moment the Hand cuts 
           through Renko’s bindings. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Good work, Hand.  

                                 HAND
                        My batteries are down, I believe I 
                        have power for just one more.

           The Hand carefully drops behind Renko’s leg again.   

           BACK AT THE GUARD STATION 

           The guard glances at the video.  He leans forward.  He sees 
           something move behind Renko’s legs.  

           BACK IN THE STOREROOM

           The guard busts in holding his gun.  Renko is in the chair, 
           hands behind him. 

                                 GUARD
                        What the hell is going on in here?  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Oh, hey... gotta question for you.
                             (he twists his jaw up)
                        Is there something on my neck here?  

           But Renko doesn’t wait, free of his bindings, he snaps up and 
           WHACKS the guard in the balls with his calf, then jerks up 
           hard and SLAMS the guy in the gut with his shoulder.  

           Renko puts his attention on the guy’s gun which BLASTS into 
           the ceiling and narrowly misses Renko’s braincase. 

           Down on the floor, the Hand scuttles out from a chair leg, 
           stands on his thumb, pinky, and ring finger, and points his 
           laser probe at the guard.  

           He fires, but only a weak electric charge sputters out of his 
           tubes.  Renko twists the guy’s hand.  It spasms open and the 
           gun drops, but the guard simultaneously twists and pulls 
           Renko down over his exposed leg.

           Both men CRASH to the ground and the gun gets kicked away.  
           Renko twists, tries to climb on top, but the guy manages to 
           flip Renko down.

           Renko sticks his lone hand out at the gun, but knocks it 
           further away.  He looks up to see the Hand madly screwing his 
           own index finger back on.  

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Hand... I could use a... hand...
           The Hand darts forward and tries to grab the gun.  This is 
           difficult, for the gun is bigger than the Hand.  It’s like a 
           man struggling with a cannon, only the cannon has no wheels.

           Renko and the guard flip over.  Renko jams his hand up under 
           the guard’s chin, then clocks him hard with his handless arm.  

           The guard frees one of his own hands and PASTES Renko hard in 
           the jaw.  Both men climb to their knees then slip down again.  

           The guard’s face is jammed down on the floor.  He looks up, 
           sees the Hand skittering, spinning the gun, finally getting 
           it pointed pretty much in the guard’s direction. 

           The Hand slips his index finger into the trigger guard and 
           WHHHACCCKKK!!!  The gun shrieks and a stream of hot plasma 
           cuts across the room, missing Renko and the guard... but the 
           recoil spits the Hand backwards across the floor.  

           The Hand YELPS and accidentally pulls the trigger again.  The 
           laser SPITS AGAIN and this time the Hand gets hammered back 
           into the wall.  

           The guard desperately tries to get away from the laser blast 
           and Renko grabs the opportunity and SWATS the guard hard in 
           the face, then gets a foot up and knees him in the belly, 
           TWO, three times.  

           The guard flops like a sack of carrots.  Renko climbs to his 
           feet, picks up the gun and the Hand, and runs from the room.

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Good work, Hand.

                                 HAND
                        Thank you, Renko Vega.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TENNIS COURTS

           Renko races across tennis courts, but the nets have fallen 
           down and, weirdly, it’s raining.  

           INT. JUNGLELAND

           Renko races across that bridge.  But something’s gone 
           wrong... it’s snowing.  

           Renko gets to the far end.  He tries a door.  It’s locked.  
           He turns around, looking madly, suddenly an INTERCOM starts 
           RINGING.  It’s a box on a wall, with a handset.  

           Renko stares at it.  Finally, impulsively, he picks up the 
           receiver and puts it to his ear.
                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O., FILTERED)
                        Renko.  It’s me. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jennifer!  Thank god!  How’d you 
                        find me?

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        I can still track you, I just can’t 
                        get back in your head... the 
                        implant needs a reset...

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Listen, the pirates stole the 
                        fusion rods and shut down the main 
                        engines.  The Revolver’s gonna burn 
                        up in Titan’s atmosphere.  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        The shields are burning.  Even if 
                        you had the fuel rods it’s too late 
                        to save the ship.  The Revolver is 
                        already beyond the point of no 
                        return.  Renko, please get up here

           INT. REVOLVER / OFFICER’S MESS

           Kathryn DelRio and Elizabeth Ardmore move reluctantly down a 
           hallway, led by an Augmentic and one of Bevilaqua’s guards.  

           DelRio has her head down, hands tethered.  She moves with 
           reluctance.  The guards stop her and the girl... but DelRio 
           spots something farther down the hall. 

           Renko Vega leans out from behind a bulkhead... just enough to 
           catch DelRio’s attention.  
           DelRio glances at the guards who are messing with unfamiliar 
           key cards. 

           DelRio elbows the girl, signals her to Vega’s presence.

           Renko points at the two guards, thumbs his chest, uses sign 
           language to inform DelRio of his plan:  He’ll work the guard 
           on the left, she’ll contend with the one on the right. 

           DelRio gives the tiniest of nods as the guard’s finally 
           manage to open the doors.  She turns, then goes into 
           action... snapping a leg up and grabbing the end of the 
           guards big plasma gun.  

           Renko Vega is there, jamming an elbow in the second guard’s 
           face.  The guard’s laser BLASTS.  A bright bolt of of zigzag 
           LIGHTNING kicks off the ceiling.  

           DelRio jams an elbow up hard into her guy’s face, desperately 
           tries to pry the gun from his arms.  

           Renko has his guy, an Augmentic, down on his back, but the 
           gun FLARES, plasma CUTTING into the hallway behind him.  

           Elizabeth Ardmore reaches in and tries to pull the gun away.

                                 RENKO VEGA 
                             (to the girl)
                        Go!!  Run!! Now!!  

           The girl hesitates, then bites down hard on the guard’s hand.  
           He SCREAMS and Renko pulls the gun from his arms. 

           Renko turns and sees that DelRio is still struggling with the 
           other guard.  He takes the butt end of the gun and WHACKS the 
           second guard in the head.  

           That guy goes back a moment and DelRio pries the gun away.

                        yet ready to leave--

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        --I said, prepare the Nebulon... 

           EXT. THE JENNIFER 9

           BOOM!  A fish-eye hatch blows open.  WHOOSH... Bill.1 floats 
           outside.  He isn’t wearing a space suit of any kind.  His 
           arms are on correctly.  He wears a tool belt and coveralls.  

           His rubber head blows up to the size of pumpkin, then begins 
           to contract...

                                 BILL.1
                        Pressure equalizing...

           The Revolver is enormous, a half-mile in diameter, slowly 
           turning.  Titan is orange and bright, below the Revolver.  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        The pirate ship, the Bloody Henry.  
                        Can you see it, Bill?  

           Bill turns.  When we hear him speak his lips don’t move.

                                 BILL.1 (V.O.)
                        There it is.  Across the core.  

           The Jennifer is mounted on the shaft of one of the “spars”.  
           The Bloody Henry, much larger, is mounted on the “wheel”.

           Bill fires mini-rockets mounted on his hands and arms and 
           begins traveling towards the Henry.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Hurry Bill, the pirates will be 
                        back soon.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE REVOLVER - CHAMBER

           Shiz and his three Augmentics, KARMAX, JEROBOAM, and MOTOROLA 
           move through a doorway marked, “Inner Core Access - Danger, 
           Unstable Environment Ahead”... 

           Shiz is carrying a chained up black metal case.  He looks 
           around, and drops the case carefully on the floor.  He slips 
           the chains off, fusses with some latches.  

                                 SHIZ
                        Karmax, the torch.
           Karmax gives Shiz a small welding torch.  Shiz fingers the 
           trigger and a hot blue flame POPS and HISSES.  He leans over 
           the case and begins cutting at the seals.

                                 MOTOROLA
                        What exactly is a Nebulon, Mister 
                        Shiz?

                                 SHIZ
                             (as he’s cutting)
                        The Nebulon was the brain-child of 
                        a black ops program on the moon 
                        about ten years ago.  Their mission 
                        was to develop the “ultimate 
                        individual combat module”.  But 
                        they abandoned the project.   

                                 MOTOROLA
                        Why did they abandon it?

                                 SHIZ
                        Oh, “abandon” is probably the wrong 
                        term.  They didn’t actually  
                        survive.  

           Shiz gets the top of the box open and turns it back.  Inside 
           is another box.  He slides some panels open and finds a ring-
           sized box.  He opens that: on a cushion of velvet is a tiny 
           bean-sized thing... a little dried-up WORM.  

                                 MOTOROLA
                        Is that it?

                                 SHIZ
                        That’s it.    

           Shiz steps back, accidentally bumping into his torch--

                                 SHIZ (CONT’D)
                        Oh, for crissake. 

           --Shiz has managed to light his sleeve on fire.  He waves it 
           around, still holding the little box.  

           Motorola turns quickly, sees a tank with a spigot on it, 
           marked “H20”.  He grabs the tank, turns it, and heaves it...   

           The water drenches Shiz, knocking out the fire but the ring-
           box is drenched.  

                                 SHIZ (CONT’D)
                        Hey!  What was that?!

                                 MOTOROLA
                        Just water.
                                 SHIZ
                        Water!?  Water?!

           Shiz puts the box on the floor and stares at it nervously. 

                                 SHIZ (CONT’D)
                        Okay.  Well.  Motorola, Jeroboam, 
                        give your guns to Karmax.  Okay?  
                        Hurry please.

           They hesitate, but hand their guns to Karmax.  Shiz leads 
           Karmax back to the door.  

                                 SHIZ (CONT’D)
                        Now, when the Nebulon wakes up 
                        he’ll be hungry.  He needs 
                        nutrition to reach his maximum 
                        potential.  

                                 JEROBOAM
                        You want us to feed him?

                                 SHIZ
                        Yeah.  Exactly.

           Motorola and Jeroboam blink.  Karmax points his own gun at 
           the two Auggies. 

           INT. REVOLVER CORE / CORRIDOR

           Karmax backs out, shuts the door and bolts it.

                                 SHIZ
                        We’d better weld that door shut.

                                 KARMAX
                        I don’t think those guys can get 
                        through that lock.

                                 SHIZ
                        I’m not worried about them. 

           INT. REVOLVER CORE / CHAMBER

           Jeroboam and Motorola are staring at the spot where the 
           little bean was, only it’s not little anymore.

           It’s swollen up and is a shivering bit of Jello about the 
           size of a CAT... now a DOG... now, suddenly, a large PONY...

           Its wormy architecture gets more complex, bones develop, 
           musculature becomes more pronounced.  The “Nebulon” evolves 
           before our eyes, like it’s in time lapse...  

           Its back legs extend, its front legs foreshorten.  A narrow, 
           segmented tail extends off its spine.  
           Suddenly it turns its head towards the Auggies.  It has dead, 
           blank eyes under a heavy brow... it opens its mouth and we 
           see a tangle of unorganized hook-like teeth.

           The men step back, staring, as the growing shadow of the 
           Nebulon falls over them.  They stare, wide-eyed, as WINGS 
           unfurl on the beast, not beautiful wings of an angel, but 
           leathery devil wings. 

           Jereboam and Motorola turn and try to run for the open door 
           deeper into the ship.  But suddenly the Nebulon ATTACKS...

           INT. INNER CORE / ANOTHER CORRIDOR

           Renko Vega leads DelRio and the girl down a passageway.

                                 DELRIO
                        You know where you’re going? 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Thanks to you I haven’t been able 
                        to get back in  touch with 
                        Jennifer... and we can’t risk going 
                        directly up the spokes through the 
                        main passageways.

           Renko stops by a hatch sunk in a wall.  He pulls on the 
           latch, but it’s securely sealed.  There’s a noise.

                                 DELRIO
                        What was that?

           They all go quiet, listening.  There is DISTANT, HORRIBLE 
           SCREAMING.  Then, nothing.  They look at one another.   

                                 GIRL
                        That was creepy with a capital “K”.

           Renko lifts the guard’s gun.  He drops down low, staring down 
           the slightly curving length of the hall.  

           He hesitates then cautiously MOVES down the passageway.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Stay behind me.

                                 GIRL
                        Why are we going toward the noise.  
                        Shouldn’t we be going the other--

                                 DELRIO
                        --Quiet Elizabeth. 

           Renko finds an open doorway to his right.  It’s dark inside.   
           He sees an emergency flashlight mounted on the wall.  He 
           pulls it down, switches it on, shines it inside.  
                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Stay here.  
                             (to DelRio)
                        Keep your gun ready.

           INT. CHAMBER

           Renko steps inside the same room we were in a moment ago with 
           Shiz and the boys.  There’s some brown-red mess on the floor.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        What the hell...

           Renko probes with the light, moving deeper.  He bends and 
           picks up a LEATHER SHOE that is almost completely torn in 
           half and covering in a gelatinous slime.  

           He drops the shoe, then sees something else... those cases 
           that Shiz opened just a few minutes ago.  

           He finds the biggest one, and shines his light on it.  There 
           is stenciled printing, white on black... 

                DANGER! - OPEN WITH EXTREME CAUTION IN SEALED AND REGULATED 
                 ENVIRONMENT - RADICALLY ALTERED GENETIC MATERIAL CONTAINED 
                       WITHIN - COPYRIGHT 2094 - THE NEBULON PROJECT 

           Renko reads half aloud, until he gets to that last part... 

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        The Nebulon project-- holy shit--

           --A huge shadow moves behind Renko, but he doesn’t see it.  

                                 DELRIO
                        Vega!  Behind you!

           Renko spins... and shines his light... 

           ...and we get our first clean look at a full-grown NEBULON!  
           It stands about seven-feet-tall and it is the the stuff of  
           nightmare... the most horrible thing you’ve never seen... 

           It’s muscular with smooth shark skin.  It’s vaguely humanoid, 
           but for two features: its long, segmented tail which slowly 
           whips along the floor, and it’s rising wings.

                                 GIRL
                        Oh.  My.  God.

           --The thing blinks its eyes and bares its teeth... all two 
           hundred of them, hooked and crowded into hyena-like jaws.  It 
           slowly lifts its wings... 
           DelRio shoves the girl back and pulls the trigger on her 
           ZigZag laser.  Lightning BOLTS ZAP out of the weapon and 
           batter at the beast. 

           The laser HACKS and SCALDS the Nebulon... but when the smoke 
           clears, the beast is still standing.  Renko let’s loose a 
           blast of Plasma that would stop an elephant...

           It holds the beast back only long enough for Renko to dive 
           for the door... but the monster charges Renko and grabs him  
           by the hand... the left hand.  

                                 GIRL (CONT’D)
                        NO!  Vega! 

           DelRio DUMPS her laser at the beast... but Renko is caught!  
           He scrambles and desperately tries to pull away....

           Renko SCREAMS as the Nebulon and the Hand BREAKS AWAY.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        No!!!  Hand!  No!

           The Nebulon falls back as it greedily swallows.  

           Renko and DelRio pull madly on their weapons as DelRio pulls 
           Renko out the door.

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Run!  Run!!  RUNNN!!!

           INT. INNER CORE CORRIDORS

           Renko, DelRio, and the girl race hand-in-hand-in-hand down 
           the narrowing, curving corridors of the Revolver.  

           Renko swings a hatch behind them, but the beast is close on 
           their tails, SLAMMING at the other side.  

           Renko flies backwards from the force... struggles, skittering 
           on his back as DelRio THROWS BURST of juice at the monster...

           The Nebulon roars, a SQUEALING BELLOW!  Renko gets back to 
           his feet and the trio explodes down the narrow passageways.  
           They cut left, cut right, no idea where they’re going!  

           DelRio finds another HATCH and rips inside, letting the 
           others through and SLAMMING it closed behind, BOLTING it.

           They get only a few yards farther, when the hatch BLOWS open, 
           SLAMMING off its hinges and CLANGING into the opposite wall.  

           They run as hard and fast as they can, only daring to turn 
           for a moment.  When they do, they see the beast only it’s not 
           running, it’s FLYING... wings up and gliding.  
           The three humans girl hurdle through another hatchway and 
           SLAM it shut, but the Nebulon BLOWS THROUGH, SCREAMING like a 
           Pterodactyl... 

           Renko sees an opening to the right.  He shoves DelRio and the 
           girl through a HATCH.  DelRio leads now, zig-zagging along, 
           chasing through hatch after hatch, with Renko SLAMMING the 
           hatches shut as he passes. 

           Finally they find themselves at a end passageway.  There are 
           stairs up through another hatch, and another thicker, 
           forbidding hatch in front of them.  It’s bigger, heavier than 
           the others.  It’s marked:

                   Interior Core: Weightless, Near-Space Environment     

           Renko thinks hard, panting desperately....

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Listen.  The Jennifer’s mounted on 
                        rebreather port 98.  Take these 
                        stairs up, work your way out to the 
                        skin and wait for me-- 

                                 DELRIO
                        --No--!

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --You have to!  I’ll lead that 
                        thing away from here--!

                                 GIRL
                        --No!  We stick together!

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Don’t be stupid!  DelRio, climb!  

           DelRio looks at Renko, catching her breath.  She grabs the 
           girl by the hand, turns and races up the stairs.

                                 GIRL
                        No!  Vega!  Renko!

           But DelRio pulls hard on her and, with a lingering look at 
           Renko, disappears up the stairs.  

           Renko desperately undogs the hatch as the Nebulon suddenly 
           appears behind him.  

           He hesitates a moment as Renko pulls his trigger-- but the 
           gun SPUTTERS.  Renko rears back and heaves it at the beast, 
           CRACKING into its head as Renko finally opens the hatch. 

           Inside we see the ROOM BEYOND spinning deliriously... and 
           Renko dives inside.
           INT. THE INNER CORE

           Renko desperately JAMS the hatch shut and spins the latch 
           with his good hand.  The beast BANGS at it, a BOOMING, 
           shuddering sound.  

           Renko turns.  We’ve reached the inner stationary “hub” of the 
           Revolver... a tangled and weightless environment... the walls 
           of the room are stationary but the center is spinning as 
           Renko floats and tries to get his bearings.  

           He studies the room, when he suddenly realizes there are four 
           men in SPACE SUITS, standing against the wall--  

           --Renko takes a breath, then realizes these are not men, but 
           empty, hanging space suits. 

           The Nebulon is desperately HAMMERING at the hatch... the door 
           is DISTORTING under his assault. 

           Renko floats to the suits, which are open in back.  He slides 
           his head up in the helmet and arms and legs inside.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Suit, automate!  Suit!  Seal and 
                        pressurize! 

                                 SUIT (V.O.)
                        Identify occupant, please.

                        Don’t gimme that, equalize now! 

                                 SUIT
                        Vega zero six is not authorized--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --If you don’t equalize right now, 
                        I’ll cut you into pieces and sell 
                        you for potholders!  

                                 SUIT
                             (beat)
                        Pressure equalizing.  My sensors 
                        indicate that you are missing your

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Tell me something I don’t know.  

                                 SUIT
                        I can do a temporary repair.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        So, you got a spare hand in here?   

                                 SUIT
                        Renko Vega is not serious.  I 
                        remember this about Renko Vega.  He 
                        had an ironical sense of humor. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        We’ve met before?

           Renko unhooks from the wall, turns and floats. This place is 
           filled with machinery and equipment, parts, etc.  

                                 SUIT
                        Not exactly.  But I am a SS Model 
                        450, version 4.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        A 450?  I think I test drove a 
                        prototype 450 out on the moon.  

                                 SUIT
                        You also wore a 450 on that rescue 
                        mission over Ganymede.  A version 
                        2, I believe.  It was the mission 
                        that made you famous, Captain Vega--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --Okay, look, right now, I gotta 
                        another little problem--   

                                 SUIT
                        --You mean the Nebulon.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        You saw it?

                                 SUIT
                        Only enough to know what it was.  
                        Once again, Renko Vega is indulging 
                        in irony.  The Nebulon is an 
                        enormous problem.   

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        What can you tell me about it?

                                 SUIT
                        The Nebulon construct is thought to 
                        be invincible in hand-to-hand 
                        combat, the ultimate soldier, 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SUIT (CONT'D)
                        lacking only in the critical areas 
                        of dedication and loyalty. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Suit, you got any weapons in here?

                                 SUIT
                        No, but I’m not sure what would be 
                        effective against a Nebulon anyway.  
                        It is only a matter of time before 
                        he penetrates that hatchway.

           The Nebulon continues to BANG and strain against the hatch.  
           The whole room vibrates at the sound.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Can you calculate that?

                                 SUIT
                        Judging by what I know about the 
                        beast and the metallurgy of the 
                        ship, I would say, twenty-eight and 
                        two-tenths of a second.  Twenty-
                        seven... twenty-six... 

           Renko stares at the stuff in the room.  He sees a series of 
           doors.  One door says:  “Rocket Room, Parts, and Spares”.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                             (muttering to himself)
                        Ship like this, you gotta have a 
                        rocket room. 

           Renko floats expertly to the rocket room.  He twists at the 
           latch and pulls the hatch open. 

           INSIDE 

           is a long room filled with complex machinery and shelves 
           filled with chemicals and parts. 

                                 SUIT
                        This is a high risk environment, 
                        Renko Vega... nineteen... 

           There is a rocket “motor” on a test bed table.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Activate positioning jets, help me 
                        push this up against that door...

                                 SUIT (CONTINUING)
                        Sixteen... fifteen...

           Renko and the suit drag the test bed up against the open 
           hatch, pointy end out. 
                                 SUIT (CONT’D)
                        Twelve... eleven...

           Renko takes down an electric pack and pulls it back to the 
           rocket trolley.  He hooks wires up to fat terminals in the 
           middle of the tube... 

                                 SUIT (CONTINUING) (CONT’D)
                        Captain Vega this is an egregious  
                        breach of safety regulations... 
                        eight... seven... six--

           Renko picks up a remote control connected to the test bed 
           with a cable.  He throws a switch, a “ready” light comes on.

                                 SUIT (CONT’D)
                        ...five... four...

           Suddenly, there’s an HUGE BANG from inside the core... the 
           hatch CRACKS open and SLAPS back against the wall. 

                                 SUIT (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I must have miscalculated.

           The hatch fills with the Nebulon’s darkness as he floats into 
           the core, wings folded, sleek in weightless space.  

           Renko watches him from behind the edge of the doorway, the 
           rocket next to him.

           The Nebulon peers into the machinery lining the core, 
           floating around, nearing Renko, turning, spotting the open 
           door of the rocket room. 

           Renko waits, still as a statue.  Finally the Nebulon glides 
           in front of the door and Renko throws the switch on the 
           box... FLAMES PLUME off the back of the rocket. 

           The ROCKET SHOOTS out of the opening, catching the SCREAMING 
           Nebulon in the chest and knocking a hole in one of his wings, 
           taking out a chunk of meat.  

           But the rocket is diverted from the collision... taking off 
           at a crazy angle and BLOWING into the wall and BOOOMMMM!!!!!

           A hole the size of a beachball is blown in the side of the 
           core.  And all hell breaks loose!  Everything that is not 
           thoroughly nailed down goes flying through that hole as air 
           is sucked out of the ship.  

           ELSEWHERE IN THE SHIP

           We cut through VARIOUS CORRIDORS... Emergency HORNS blow 
           insistently.  Hatchways SLAM shut repeatedly. 
           Mrs. McMink is standing amidst the fray.  She’s cool, looking 
           around amidst the wind and noise.  She keeps moving, leading 
           a team of Augmentics through the passageways.

           INT. THE BALLROOM

           The passengers are thrown off their feet.  A table slides to 
           one side and crashes to the floor.  

           Darla Cahill catches the hand of one of her friends, who is 
           overwhelmed and HYSTERICAL.  Darla looks around, WHISPERING 
           REASSURINGLY, but privately wondering how all this might end. 

           INT. THE REVOLVER BRIDGE

           Doon grabs onto a rail and looks at the men on the console...

                                 DOON
                        The Nebulon. 

           INT. THE CORE

           The Nebulon desperately grabs for the machinery at the center 
           of the core, but cannot get purchase in this violent storm.  
           He is pulled out the hole in the ship and into the void... 

           Renko Vega is pulled down through the rocket room hatch and 
           dangles, holding onto the frame of the door, then loses his 
           grip, managing to grab only on the end of a wire mounted on a 
           reel near the center of the room. 

           But the wire peels off the now-spinning reel as Renko is 
           sucked towards the opening! 

                                 SUIT
                        Pressure is unstable, equalizing--

           Renko CRACKS into the wall surrounding the hole... makes one 
           more grab, but can’t get purchase...

           EXT. THE REVOLVER

           Renko tumbles into the void, still hanging onto that wire.  
           He snaps it around his waist and tie it on the suit hardware.

           BACK IN THE CORE

           The reel spins, paying out until the wire runs out--

           RENKO VEGA 

           JERKS to a halt at the end of the wire... suddenly stopping, 
           then lightly bouncing...
           BACK IN THE CORE

           The end of the wire is anchored to the reel, but when Renko’s 
           weight reaches it, the reel SNAPS free from it’s mounting 
           point and SHOOTS down through the hole. 

           RENKO VEGA

           tries to pull himself up the wire but it has gone slack.  He 
           looks up towards the Revolver core, which is already a 
           hundred feet away.  He sees something moving through space, 
           headed straight at him.   

           The reel (still at the end of the wire) is hurtling through 
           space.  Renko tries to avoid but it CRACKS into his helmet, 
           SMASHING a spiderweb into the Plexi, punching a hole in it...

           Renko CRIES OUT in surprise and pain.  The reel drifts off 
           the other way, plummeting into the darkness.

           Renko is floating, his suit HISSING, leaking...

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Suit!  Equalize pressure!  Repair!

           But there is no response...  

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Suit!  Respond!

           The suit is dead.  Suddenly Renko feels something tug on his 
           waist.  The wire has gone taught again.  

           Renko grabs the wire and pulls.  The wire tugs back as though 
           there is a fish at the other end of the line.

           Renko looks down the line... and sees what he’s caught... the 
           Nebulon is on the other end of the line, pulling itself up 
           the wire toward Renko, hand over hand... 

           Renko tries to get the wire loose from the suit but it’s no 
           use, it’s stuck tight on the loop.  

           Renko’s suit keeps HISSING.  His face mask is fogging up.  He 
           struggles to stay consciousness.

           He can see the Nebulon clearly now... it’s closer and 
           closer... only 25 feet, now 20 feet, now ten feet away.  

           Renko GASPS.  His teeth chatter as his brain begins to swell.

           As the beast gets closer and closer, we see those dog-jaws 
           sneering... that chaotic mass of teeth...

           Then through the HISSING AIR, we hear something else.  
                                 HAND (V.O., FILTERED)
                        Renko Vega... Renko Vega... are you 
                        out there?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                             (softly, in pain)
                        Ha... Hand, is that you?

                                 HAND (V.O.)
                        Renko Vega, I am somewhere very 
                        dark and unpleasant.  I wish that I 
                        was again on the end of your arm.  
                        I think autonomy is not my style.  

           The Nebulon continues to climb, eyes shining, malice in mind. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Hand... your battery power-- 

                                 HAND (V.O.)
                        --I’m up to about thirty percent, 
                        Renko Vega.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                             (weakly)
                        Sequence beta, option four.  

           The Nebulon is closer still... five feet, four feet...

                                 HAND (V.O.)
                        Oh.  Please remove any flammables 
                        from the ar--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --Forget that Hand, now!  Go now--!

           The Nebulon’s jaws snap at Renko.  But suddenly the beast 
           gets a funny look in his eyes.  And suddenly there’s a 
           concussive BOOM! (silent in the vacuum of space) and BOOOSHH!  

           The Nebulon EXPLODES, silently SPREADING outward in a 
           gelatinous green mass!  

           Renko Vega is spattered with Nebulon goop as he is forced 
           outward by the blast.  

           Renko flies through space, rolling slightly.  The suit and

           INT. SPOKE THREE - HALFWAY DOWN

           DelRio and the girl race down this twisting catwalk.  There’s 
           VOICES, moving up and down the spoke, all around them.  

           They arrive at a door marked, “Level 40”.  More TALKING, 
           SHOUTS RING down from below and above.  

           Elizabeth tries a door. 

                                 GIRL
                        Locked!

                                 DELRIO
                        Back off!

           DelRio turns the gun on the door... WHACK!  BOOM!  The door 
           swings free.

                                 DELRIO (CONT’D)
                        Go! Go!

           INT. A SERVICE CORRIDOR

           Narrow and irregular, rivets and seams everywhere.  DelRio 
           grabs the girl and shoves her forward as they hurry down the 
           dark passageway. 

           DelRio swings around another corner, peers through the dim 
           light-- suddenly there’s a noise-- 

           DelRio shoves the girl down as FLASHLIGHT BEAMS WINK down the 
           corridor.  AUGMENTICS appear, just dark shapes at the end of 
           the corridor.  

           DelRio picks up her gun and watches them carefully!  Suddenly 
           someone pokes something hard into DelRio’s neck.

                                 MCMINK (V.O.)
                        Put the gun down now.  Put it down!  

           McMink is standing behind her with her own weapon.  The 
           Auggies grab DelRio and twists her hands behind her.

                                 DELRIO
                        Elizabeth!

           McMink turns, points her gun at the girl, who is cowering 
           inside an outer rib of the ship.  

                                 MCMINK
                        Come out of there.  Now.

           The girl rushes at McMink, punching at her, but an Augmentic 
           grabs her writhing form.
                                 MCMINK (CONT’D)
                        You know I’m getting a little tired 
                        of you two.  How about I just end 
                        this all here and now?

                                 DELRIO
                        You wouldn’t.

                                 MCMINK
                        Oh, but I would.  She doesn’t mean 
                        anything to me.  Now put the gun 
                        down.

           DelRio hesitates, then loosens her grip on the gun and lets 
           one of the guards take it. 

                                 MCMINK (CONT’D)
                        Take them both down to the wheel.

           The Augmentics grab DelRio and the girl and shove them back 
           down the passageway.  

           But McMink doesn’t follow.  She turns and considers the 
           narrow corridor, glances at DOGBREATH, her remaining guy. 

                                 MCMINK (CONT’D)
                        What were they doing out here?

                                 DOGBREATH
                        Nothing.  Trying to hide.

           McMink looks around.  Softly shakes her head.

                                 MCMINK
                        Not out this far.  Get the brains 
                        on the box.  I want to talk to them 
                        right now.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SPACE A FEW MINUTES - A MINUTE LATER

           Renko Vega is still floating, rotating in a black field.   
           His swollen white suit is spattered with green.  

           Suddenly an enormous shadow appears.  It’s a huge mass of 
           coagulated junk moving slowly.  It is the Bloody Henry... 

           What looks like a giant mouth drops open on the Henry... it’s 
           a yawning flight deck...   

           The “mouth” moves down over Renko Vega and eats him...

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Bill... there’s something wrong.  
                        I’m cold. 
                                 BILL.1 (V.O.)
                        Cold.  Like the cold of space or... 
                        the human feeling... the lack of 
                        warmth...

           There’s nothing...

                                 BILL.1 (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Jennifer?  Jennifer 9?

           INT. THE REVOLVER BRIDGE

           One of Bevilaqua’s men, HAWKINS, rushes into the room. 

                                 HAWKINS
                        Admiral!  We’ve got a problem!  The 
                        Bloody Henry has undocked and 
                        separated from the Revolver.

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Separated?  What are you talking 
                        about? 

                                 HAWKINS
                        She’s moving away, sir, four knots, 
                        staying in planetary shadow. 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Who’s on board, Captain Doon?  Who 
                        was left on the bridge of the 
                        Henry?

                                 DOON
                        Admiral, you specifically wanted 
                        all my people on board the 
                        Revolver.  “All hands in play... a  
                        show of force.”  

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Then who the hell is piloting your 
                        ship?

           Doon doesn’t like the only answer he has. 

                                 DOON
                        The Henry’s AI was left alone...
                             (to Hawkins)
                        Have you tried to link to the 
                        bridge?

                                 HAWKINS
                        There’s no response. 

           One of Bevilaqua’s other men, NEELEY interrupts.
                                 NEELEY
                        Mister Doon, I have your number two 
                        on the screen.  Panel one.

           Doon looks to the screens above the console.  McMink appears.

                                 DOON
                        Mrs. McMink.

                                 MCMINK (VID)
                        I’m sending.  3D please.

           Another one of the panels glows.  We see the exterior of the 
           revolver.  The POV SWINGS, focused in on one of the “struts”.   

                                 MCMINK (CONT’D)
                        Here.  On the strut, between three 
                        and four... by this breather vent.   
                        There’s an anomaly on the skin that 
                        doesn’t match the original launch 
                        silhouette.  It’s not far from 
                        where we found the girl. 

           Bevilaqua moves up next to Doon as they stare at the screen.

                                 DOON
                        That’s a ship.

                                 MCMINK
                        You know what ship?

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        The Jennifer 9 is my guess.  

                                 MCMINK
                        That’s exactly what I was thinking. 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Have the system isolate the spar 
                        and lock down the vent before she 
                        disengages. 

                                 MCMINK
                        Way ahead of you, Admiral.  We’ve 
                        flooded that vent with superfrozen 
                        nitrogen.

                                 DOON
                        You could brick her circuits.  
                        She’d be useless. 

                                 MCMINK
                        We don’t need her circuits.  We’ve 
                        got the Revolver system. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. REVOLVER PASSAGEWAY

           McMink is holding a huge blow gun and is standing outside the 
           Jen 9 airlock with some of her people and Shiz.   

                                 SHIZ 
                        We had her internal temperature 
                        down to a hundred below.  Her 
                        batteries are probably dead, but 
                        there might be some residual--

                                 MCMINK
                        --Doggie step back--

           McMink lines up her sights and WOOOMP BOOM!  WHAPPP!  The gun 
           KICKS and the door CRACKS open wide.  

           INT. THE AIRLOCK

           McMink steps in and aims that big weapon at the inner door. 

                                 SHIZ
                        You know, McMink, you might want to 
                        make sure the pressure--

           --WOOOMP BOOM!  The interior door CRACKS OPEN.

           INT. THE JENNIFER 9/FLIGHT DECK

           McMink steps inside.  It’s really cold in here.  Her breath 
           plumes out of her mouth.  She looks around. 

                                 MCMINK
                        Shiz, pull the server memory and 
                        unrack the drives.  Do it quick, in 
                        case she’s got anything left.   

           McMink looks around at the Jen’s environs.

                        I got it, Bill... now where the 
                        hell am I... I mean where are we? 

           Renko Vega is out of the spacesuit, laying on a gurney.  

                                 BILL.1
                        We’re in the sick bay of the

           Renko tries to climb to his feet, suddenly realizing...

                                 BILL.1
                        It’s alright, Renko Vega.  The 
                        pirates are gone.  When I got here 
                        the place was empty.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        What about the ship’s AI?

                                 BILL.1
                        Henry is quite rudimentary and 
                        somewhat frightened.  But basically 
                        he’s a nice guy.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Thanks, Bill, for saving my ass.

                                 BILL.1
                        Of course, Renko Vega, it’s what 
                        I’m programmed to do.  Saving Renko 
                        Vega’s ass is my mandate.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Is the Revolver still intact?

                                 BILL.1
                        She’s lost her shields and is 
                        heating up rapidly.  The pirates 
                        have jettisoned the life pods and 
                        destroyed the radio links. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Bill.  Everyone on that ship is 
                        going to die.
                                 BILL.1
                        Yes, Renko Vega, but I may have 
                        even more distressing news.  I 
                        cannot link to the Jennifer 9.  I 
                        think she has been stolen away...

           More guards and pirates escort Elizabeth Ardmore and Kathryn

           Bevilaqua boards, glances around the room, steps up on the 
           grid.  McMink glares at him. 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Have you figured out how many 
                        she’ll hold? 

                                 MCMINK
                        She’ll carry twenty-five... but 
                        she’d be faster with six or seven.

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Then we should take six.

           McMink stares at Bevilaqua.

                                 MCMINK
                        Then which six?

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        I might be willing to leave that 
                        choice to you, Mrs. McMink.  

                                 MCMINK
                        Who do you need in your group?

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Hawkins.  Maybe Neeley. 

                                 MCMINK
                        What about Doon?

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        I don’t need him.  Do you?

           McMink stares appraisingly at Bevilaqua.  
                                 MCMINK
                        What do I get out of this, Admiral?

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Do you like this ship?  Maybe 
                        you’re the new Renko Vega.

                                 MCMINK
                        Why would I want to be him?

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Then what about this?

           He opens his palm.  Inside is the Lady of the Shadows, still 
           dangling from Renko’s crimson ribbon. 

                                 MCMINK
                        So that’s what Vega was after...

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        It’s worth more than all Doon’s 
                        fuel rods and costume jewelry.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE BLOODY HENRY / MED BAY

           Renko and Bill move through a junk-filled passageway.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        So you’ve had no signal from the 
                        Jennifer... nothing at all?

                                 BILL.1
                        No, Renko Vega.  I’ve been scouring 
                        the Comm channels.  There is 
                        nothing.   

           INT. THE BLOODY HENRY / BRIDGE

           Renko and Bill step inside.  It’s filled with gear. 

                                 BILL.1
                        Renko Vega, I intercepted something 
                        just after I saved your ass.  

           Bill fetches what looks like a bell jar, only it’s got a high-
           tech base with gauges and readouts.   

           Inside the dome of glass is the Hand, mounted on its wrist, 
           fingers extending upward.  A lot of his synthetic flesh is 
           burned away, exposing circuits, robotics, laserworks, etc.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        He doesn’t look too good, Bill... 
                        is he alive?
                                 BILL.1
                        He was never alive, Renko Vega.  
                        He’s a robot of course.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Is he still functional?

           Bill lifts the glass and takes the Hand off the base.  Renko 
           holds out his arm and Bill twists the hand on Renko’s wrist. 

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Hand.  Activate.

                                 HAND 
                        Hand is aware.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        It’s good to see you, Hand.

                                 HAND
                        It is good to be at the end of 
                        Renko Vega’s arm again.  

           Renko allows himself a little smile, then his tenor changes.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Bill.  

                                 BILL.1
                        Yes, Renko Vega.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        We’ve got to board the Revolver as 
                        fast as we can and try and get 
                        those people out of there. 

           Bill.1 turns, slightly mechanically.  

                                 BILL.1
                        Renko Vega.  I would expect nothing 
                        less.    

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. REVOLVER WHEEL

           Renko Vega kicks open a portal doorway.  There’s a rush of 
           air... then the pressure stabilizes.  

           Bill follows him. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jeezus, it’s hot in here. 
                                 BILL.1
                        One hundred and seven degrees 
                        Fahrenheit.  One hundred and eight.  
                        One hundred and--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        The ballroom, Bill. 

           Renko and Bill race down this wide hall...

           INT. THE BALLROOM

           People are laying around out here.  Things are bad.  Ties are 
           askew, some of the swells are down to their skivvies.  

           Walter Woods and some of the others are desperately trying to 
           pry the doors open, but they’ve been welded shut.  

           Woods stops and swears to himself.  He turns and drops the 
           steel rod he’s been using on the door.  

           Suddenly, there’s a BOOM and the doors burst open.  Renko 
           Vega steps inside, a big zig-zag laser in his arms.  

                                 WALTER WOODS
                        What the hell, Vega--?  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --How many are you?!

                                 WALTER WOODS
                        What’s the difference--?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --How many?

           Woods stares at Renko with great hostility, but a calm voice 
           emerges from the crowd.  

                                 DARLA CAHILL
                        Forty-six from the ship’s staff and 
                        ninety-eight passengers. 

           Renko looks up and recognizes Darla Cahill.  Renko recognizes 
           her, nods. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Bill...

                                 BILL.1
                        It won’t be comfortable, but the 
                        Bloody Henry has a large--

                                 WALTER WOODS
                        --The Bloody Henry!  That’s the 
                        pirate ship--!
                                 DARLA CAHILL
                        --Mister Woods, please.  Mister 
                        Vega, if you have a way off this 
                        ship, we’ll do everything we can to 
                        help. 

                                 RENKO VEGA 
                        --Okay.  Look, we’ve only got a--  

           --Suddenly the ship BOOMS!  The wind starts WHIPPING through 
           the doors, the lights dim.  

           There’s another BLAST, half the passengers are knocked off 
           their feet.  The entire room TILTS sideways.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE POOL AREA

           Renko is helping the passengers move across the bridge over 
           the Venetian pool... it’s listing at 45 degrees, water tipped 
           out, flooding the walls. 

           There’s more sounds of BURSTING, GROANING... something 
           EXPLODES.  Suddenly-- 

                                 DOON (V.O.)
                        --Well, I’ll be damned.  

           Renko Vega turns and sees Malthazar Doon and a few of his 
           remaining Augmentics standing on the bridge in front of him.    

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        So lemme guess.  Even you couldn’t 
                        trust Bevilaqua.

                                 DOON
                        How the hell did you get away from 
                        the Nebulon, Vega?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        That was a Nebulon?  My  grandma’s 
                        got more fighting skills. 

           Suddenly a WALL CRASHES down at the far end of the corridor.  
           Dust and smoke fill that part of the passageway.  Bill.1 
           emerges from the smoke, gestures behind him.

                                 BILL.1
                        The 4th level is filling with 
                        smoke, Renko Vega.  We can’t get 
                        out that way.

                                 DOON
                        Get out to where?
                                 RENKO VEGA
                        An abandoned corsair known as “The 
                        Bloody Henry”.

                                 DOON
                        I guess I should’ve figured you had 
                        something to do with that.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Look, Doon.  I’ve got a hundred and 
                        fifty people to evacuate out of 
                        here.  I’m kinda busy. 
                             (to the others)
                        This way, let’s go!

           Doon hesitates, then...  

                                 DOON
                        No.  There’s a service stair 
                        through the kitchens, this way!

           Renko hesitates, then turns and follows Doon...

           INT. ANOTHER PASSAGEWAY

           BOOM WHACK!  Doon’s got a laser gun and blows through another 
           hatchway.  

           They’re not far from the Bloody Henry’s airlock.  The 
           corridors are dusty and filling with smoke.  

           Doon hurries people through.  Bill.1 is carrying a woman.  

                                 DOON
                        Robot!  Give her to me, go back 
                        down and help the others.  

           Bill nods and hands off the woman to Doon who turns and 
           hurries down the passageway, leading a stream of ragged, 
           COUGHING passengers.  

           EXT. THE REVOLVER

           The core and most of the spars are gone, broken away.  The 
           Henry is mounted to the wheel much of which is on fire...

           INT. THE BLOODY HENRY

           Doon is inside the door.  

                                 DOON
                        Henry, tighten that airlock!
                                 BLOODY HENRY (V.O.)
                        Pressure unstable, Oxygen limited, 
                        airlock integrity failing, heat 
                        beyond recommendations, and 
                        altitude to surface is declining.  
                        We need to disengage immediately.

           More people are streaming through the airlock.

                                 DOON
                        Get everyone in the hold!  Oxygen 
                        tanks are in the overheads!  Now 
                        where the hell is Vega?!  

           Bill moves through the door, carrying an older man.  He gives 
           the man to Walter Woods and Darla Cahill and turns and heads 
           back through the airlock.   

           INT. THE REVOLVER

           Renko Vega is leading the LAST of the PASSENGERS through the 
           corridor, which is filled with acrid, swirling smoke.  He 
           plunges into the burning maelstrom, pulling them forward. 

           Suddenly the shaft crumples in front of them, a chunk of 
           structural metal drops from the ceiling.  It’s hot and 
           burning and the passageway is blocked.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        We’ll have to go back and find 
                        another way...

           He turns but there’s a SHOUT.  Bill.1 is on the other side of 
           the fallen beam...

                                 BILL.1
                        Renko Vega!  Here!  Quickly!  

           Bill grabs the red-hot beam and lifts.  At first he can’t 
           raise it, then, with super robot-strength, he raises it high.  

           It’s so hot and there’s so much flame, Bill catches on fire.  
           Melting steel drips down on him, burning his rubber parts.

           Renko shoves the couple in front of him, then scurries under 
           the molten beam himself.   

           He pulls the passengers to the airlock and shoves them in. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Bill!  

           Bill drops the burning beam.  The passageway crumbles as Bill 
           turns and heads toward the airlock.  He is on fire. 
                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Bill!!  Hurry!

           INT. THE BLOODY HENRY

           Renko exhaustedly falls inside, turns out to help Bill.

                                 DOON
                        Shut the hatch!

           People are grabbing at the hatch, trying to swing it shut 
           against the superheated, sucking air.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        No!  Bill!

           Renko holds the door open against the onslaught--

                                 DOON
                        --The Revolver’s coming apart, 
                        Vega... we’ve got to disengage--!

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --Bill!  Hurry!  Now!

           INT. THE AIRLOCK

           Bill is on fire head to toe, but methodically swinging the 
           first hatch closed. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Bill, never mind that!  Get in now!

           There’s a horrible GROAN...

           EXT. THE REVOLVER

           The wheel is diminishing, dissolving in flames from the 
           bottom up.  It collapses, crumbling before our very eyes.  

           INT. THE AIRLOCK

           The airlock falls to pieces, stretching and burning.  Renko 
           grabs Bill by the hand and Doon grabs onto Renko’s back!

                                 DOON
                        Forget it, Vega!  He’s a robot!  
                        He’s a goddamn robot!

           But Renko stretches, bracing himself in the hatchway.  Wind 
           is sucking hard out the port.  Renko pulls Bill up as the 
           airlock breaks off the Henry and drops away.
           Now Bill is dangling from the side of the Henry hatch... 
           below him, the Revolver drops away, dissolving in the 
           atmosphere, an enormous ring of fire! 

           INT. THE BLOODY HENRY

           The ship’s air sucks violently.  Renko pulls desperately on 
           the dangling Bill and finally manages to lift him inside.  

           Renko and Bill sprawl on the floor as Doon swings shut the 
           hatch.  People are YELLING.  A fire extinguisher GASPS and a  
           blast of flame retardant cascades over Bill and Renko.   

                                 DOON
                             (shouting)
                        Henry, fire the primary rockets and 
                        get the hell out of here! 

           The Bloody Henry shakes as we hear the rockets EXPLODE!

           Renko, dirty, burned, looks at Bill who is a total mess, face 
           half-melted, bits and pieces of armature shining through.  

           Renko smiles at Bill.  Bill smiles back.  

                                 BILL.1
                        Now, it appears, Renko Vega, that 
                        you have saved my ass.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SPACE

           The Jennifer 9 cuts smoothly across the rim of Titan. 

           INT. THE JENNIFER 9 / TECH ROOM

           McMink and Bevilaqua stand over DelRio and the girl who are 
           sitting on the floor, their hands bound behind them.  

           One of Bevilaqua’s guards, NEELEY, is holding a ZigZag laser, 
           staring at them.  

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        After we clear Titan’s corona we’ll 
                        accelerate to the Venus Colony.  
                        From there we’ll send a message to 
                        your father.  You’ll be the 
                        featured player of course. 

                                 GIRL
                        You want me to give a propaganda 
                        speech for your stupid cause--?
                                 DELRIO
                        --Elizabeth--

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        --As a matter of fact, you don’t 
                        have to say anything.  As long as 
                        your father sees you’re alive.

                                 GIRL
                        He won’t negotiate with terrorists.  

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Until it’s one of his own... until 
                        his own daughter might be about to 
                        lose her life.

                                 MCMINK
                        And there are plenty of volunteers 
                        in line to do that job. 

                                 GIRL
                        Oh, you’re fun.  Hey, I thought you 
                        and the dude with the horns had a 
                        thing?  You drop him for General 
                        Geezer here? 

           McMink snaps and is about to swat the girl but DelRio, quick 
           and not nearly as contained as we thought, snaps forward with 
           her legs and strikes up high... into McMink’s solar plexus.  

           DelRio jumps up (with both hands tied behind her), JAMS a 
           foot into McMink’s chest, pinning her, staring...

                                 DELRIO
                        Say or do anything you want to me, 
                        but lay one hand on the girl and 
                        I’ll take you straight to hell.  
                        You got it--?

           Neeley jams his gun in DelRio’s back but Bevilaqua grabs him.  

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        --That’s enough.

           DelRio releases McMink, who stares with unbridled enmity.

                                 MCMINK
                        Why don’t we just toss this one in 
                        the void and watch her pop like a 
                        balloon?

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Because two hostages are better 
                        than one.  Especially if we have to 
                        sacrifice one to make our point. 
           That last bit was delivered directly to DelRio.  Suddenly 
           there’s a BOOM!  The ship is ROCKED hard and ALARMS start 
           going off!

           INT. JEN 9 BRIDGE

           Bevilaqua and McMink hurry inside... Shiz is at the console.  
           The brain’s tank is bubbling and glowing. 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Mister Shiz, what’s happening?!

                                 SHIZ 
                        Black Flies!  They hit the shields 
                        near the exhaust ports!  Fifty, 
                        sixty of them! 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        System, give us a three-sixty. 

           The panel’s flash with a 360 degree view.  

                                 SHIZ
                        Here they come again!  

           A black swarm of the jittery little constructs, HAMMERS into 
           the force field, CRACKING and BOUNCING off it’s mass.

                                 SHIZ (CONT’D)
                        There’s penetration!

           EXT. THE JENNIFER 9

           The little robot-flies jigger inside and around the Jen 9’s 
           outer environs.  One SMASHES into a Plexiglas screen.  

           The second finds one of her glowing rockets.  It hammers up 
           the rocket’s outlet and the entire rocket EXPLODES!

           INT. THE JENNIFER BRIDGE

           BOOOM!  The Jen tosses up, down, sideways, everyone hangs on. 

                                 BRAINS (V.O.)
                        Portside thrust rocket is down!  

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Adjust course and increase armor 
                        density by fifty percent.

                                 SHIZ
                        That’s gonna slow us down even 
                        more, Admiral. 
                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Refresh screens, please.

           The screens wipe and refresh.  McMink points...

                                 MCMINK
                        There.  What is that?

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Twenty power on number two screen.  

           The panel ZOOMS on the spot.  It’s fuzzy, then grows huge.

                        Resolving... 

           Bevilaqua stares sourly at what he sees.

                                 MCMINK
                        That’s the Bloody Henry.

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Who the hell is piloting that ship? 

                                 MCMINK
                        It doesn’t matter, she can’t keep 
                        up with us, can she? 

                                 SHIZ
                        She can at this speed. 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        What guns do we have available?  

                                 BRAINS
                        We have two double stage lasers in 
                        operational order.  30 ohms each. 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Fire portside rockets and get us 
                        nose on profile... we’re going to 
                        counter. 

                                 BRAINS
                        Admiral we’ve received a radio ping 
                        from the Bloody Henry, would you 
                        like to respond?

           The video flickers, then goes clear.  Renko Vega appears.

                        Renko Vega on the bridge of the 
                        Bloody Henry.  

           Bevilaqua reacts, covers.... 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Vega, how the hell did you get off 
                        that ship?

                                 RENKO VEGA (VID)
                        No, Admiral, this is the part where 
                        you say, “Renko Vega, I should have 
                        killed you when I had the chance!”

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        You’re a nuisance, Vega, but I 
                        don’t think you’re particularly 
                        dangerous.      

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Let me get to the point, Admiral... 
                        I want the Ardmore girl.  It’s as 
                        simple as that. 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        And what do you have to trade that 
                        might be valuable to me, Renko?  I 
                        have your ship, I have the girl, I 
                        even have the moonstone.  It seems 
                        I’ve got everything you want-- 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --Except a Boron cannon.  How about 
                        I knock you into a thousand pieces. 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        That’s interesting, Renko, but how 
                        does blowing up this ship help you 
                        get the Ardmore girl? 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        It doesn’t.  It might sound 
                        gruesome, Admiral, but I believe 
                        the girl is better off dead than 
                        she is in the hands of a terrorist.

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        I don’t think you have the nerve 
                        for the that, Renko.  I know you 
                        too well.    

           Bevilaqua nods at Shiz, and the video goes black.  
           INT. THE JENNIFER 9 - BRIDGE

           Renko is standing on the bridge.  The video screens in front 
           of him go black.  Doon is watching Renko. 

                                 DOON
                        He called your bluff.  He knows you 
                        won’t use that Boron gun as long as 
                        the girl’s on that ship.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        He can’t sit out here.  He’s got to 
                        get to safety on Venus.  Henry can 
                        you calculate a high speed vector 
                        to the Venus colony? 

                                 BLOODY HENRY (V.O.)
                        Right now, Titan’s rotation is 
                        blocking the Jennifer’s path, but 
                        line of sight will be clear in 
                        sixteen minutes.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        In sixteen minutes, Bevilaqua will 
                        fire Jen’s rockets and go into 
                        Massive acceleration and we can’t 
                        generate a quarter of the Jen 9’s 
                        speed.  No offense Henry.

                                 BLOODY HENRY (V.O.)
                        None taken, Renko Vega.

           BOOOM!  Both Doon and Renko are almost tossed off their feet.

                        The Jen 9 is coming around!  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        She’s countering!  Henry, quickly, 
                        random evade pattern!  Doon, do we 
                        have more Black Flies? 

                                 DOON
                        Our drone chambers are exhausted.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        What about munitions?  

                                 DOON
                        Besides the cannon, we’ve four 
                        twenty-meg plasma guns on port and 
                        four on starboard.  But we’ve no 
                        manpower.  We need at least two 
                        bodies on each gun.   
                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Joshua, go down to the hold, ask 
                        for volunteers and bring them up to 
                        gun level. 

           Joshua hurries off as the ship is hit by more GUNFIRE.  The 
           ship ROCKS HARD.  Renko looks appraisingly at Doon.

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Captain Doon, are you with me on 
                        this?

                                 DOON
                        By all rights I should be your 
                        prisoner, Vega.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        I don’t want your ship, Doon.  I 
                        want your help.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SPACE

           The two ships swoop around one another.  

           The Jen 9 is more agile but they are both more heavily 
           related to ocean-going craft than jet fighters. 

           The Jennifer lets loose a load of huge load of side mounted 
           lasers, BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!!  The Henry is CONCUSSED hard by 
           FLASHING PLASMA LASERS!

           INT. BLOODY HENRY - GUN DECK

           Renko and Bill.1 HURRY through this narrow room, with eight 
           gun consoles on two sides.  There are big windows above, 
           below are vid screens, keyboards, gunsticks.

           Passengers from the Revolver wear headsets and man the 
           consoles:  Walter Woods is there, with a couple of his aides, 
           some of those Banker-types, the band leader, all pitching in.  

           Renko and Bill.1 move quickly through the action as the 
           passengers get up to speed and the Bloody Henry ROCKS under 
           repeated BLASTS from the Jen 9. 

                                 BILL.1
                        Renko Vega, I’m afraid the Jennifer 
                        9 is much too strong for the Henry.   

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        I might agree with you, Bill, if I 
                        thought that was really Jen out 
                        there.
                                 BILL.1
                        Renko Vega means that Jennifer 9 
                        the spacecraft is not being 
                        operated by Jennifer 9, the  
                        software. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Bevilaqua’s probably substituted 
                        the Jen 9’s software with the 
                        Revolver’s twelve-head system.  
                        It’s good stuff, but they can’t do 
                        what Jennifer can.  I’m thinking 
                        maybe we can revive Jen, and she 
                        can help us stop Bevilaqua.    

                                 BILL.1
                        I’ve tried all her radio links.  
                        There no data moving in or out.  
                        I’m afraid the Jennifer that you 
                        and I know no longer exists.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        But there is one link you haven’t 
                        tried.

           INT. BLOODY HENRY / MED BAY

           Renko Vega is being held down on a gurney by Darla Cahill and 
           THREE OTHER REVOLVER SURVIVORS.  His head is immobilized by 
           large straps and his mouth is heavily gagged.  Darla smiles 
           at Renko.  

                                 DARLA CAHILL
                        Well, it’s been quite an adventure, 
                        hasn’t it Mister Vega?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Yes, ma’am.  Yes it has.  

           Darla looks up at Bill.1 sitting with his hands on the 
           wheeled controls of small console.  It’s got binocular specs, 
           boxes, relays, servos nearby. 

                                 DARLA CAHILL
                        He’s an old X-10 model isn’t he?  
                        I’ve got one at those at home in my 
                        basement somewhere.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        I’ve had him forever.

           She smiles at Renko, pats his hand reassuringly.
                                 DARLA CAHILL
                        Ah.  They really don’t make them 
                        like they used to.

           A tiny probe slides out of the machinery and moves towards 
           Renko’s ear.  Renko’s eyes twist, glaring at the probe as 
           Bill stares down into a binocular viewer.  

                                 BILL.1
                        Lights please.  Stay absolutely 
                        still, Renko Vega.

           The room lights go out.  Everyone, including Renko looks up 
           at a big video screen mounted up high.  

           Renko’s ear canal is a hairy cave that swallows us.

                                 BILL.1 (CONT’D)
                        I’m traveling down the auditory 
                        canal to the ear drum, where I will 
                        make a small incision. 

           Renko’s inner ear narrows as we approach the ear drum--  

           --Suddenly the ship BOOMS and tips, JERKING.  Then it settles 
           into VIBRATIONS.  Bill is focused, leaning over his controls.  

                                 BILL.1 (CONT’D)
                        I’m about to enter the cochlea.  
                        Another small incision.  

           On the video the light and video camera slide through an ever 
           constrictive tunnel... moist and pink.

                                 BILL.1 (CONT’D)
                        The Organ of Cortii.  Beautiful.  
                        Now, we should see... yes, the 
                        auditory nerve, right there.  
                        Jennifer’s chip should be around 
                        here... ah... there it is...

           A tiny, complex chip is nestled in the tight constricture of 
           the auditory canal... an odd bit of technology in this 
           otherwise organic environment.    

                                 BILL.1 (CONT’D)
                        Looks to be intact.  There should 
                        be a reset switch.  Yes.

           Little probe pliers moves out below the camera and poke at a 
           tiny spot on the chip... suddenly a LED starts flashing. 

           We hear what Renko hears... a WHOOSHING SOUND... then that 
           WHISTLING sound, like a teakettle.  It quickly RINGS up into 
           a HOWLING FEEDBACK.  
                                 BILL.1 (CONT’D)
                        Hang on, Renko Vega, while I remove 
                        the probe.

           In only a moment, the probe POPS out of Renko’s ear.  The 
           passengers unstrap Renko as the noise in Renko’s head begins 
           to dissipate.  Renko sits up, shaking off the pain.  

           He looks up, Bill is looking at him earnestly.  Renko shakes 
           his head... there’s nothing.  No signal.

                                 BILL.1 (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps you should try to talk to 
                        her. 

           Renko looks at the others, turns and looks at nothing... 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jennifer... Jen... it’s me, Renko.  

           There’s no noise, a little bit of HISS....

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Jennifer... can you hear me?  I’m 
                        on the Bloody Henry.  Bill is with 
                        me along with the survivors of the 
                        Revolver.  Jennifer... please... we 
                        need your help...  

           Renko hesitates... there are MORE EXPLOSIONS and BOOMS... the 
           room ROCKS and JERKS violently.  

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Jennifer, Bevilaqua has kidnapped 
                        the Ardmore girl... and he’s stolen 
                        you away.

           More BOOMS, the ship rocks even harder.  The furniture slides 
           around the room.  Renko is almost knocked off his feet.

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Jen... please wake up... Jen... I 
                        need you...

           Renko steps out on the bridge.  The ship is twisting through 
           space... plasma shocks flare on the screens.

           Everyone is strapped into seats or hanging on bars suspended 
           from the ceilings and the floors.  Renko joins Doon and 
           Bill.1 behind the console.    
                                 DOON

                        No... nothing at all. 
                             (to Bill)
                        How much time?

                        In seven minutes Venus rises over 
                        Titan and Bevilaqua will be free to 
                        engage his primary rockets.   

                                 DOON
                        Vega, I know you want the girl and 
                        your ship back, but if we take out 
                        the Jennifer now, this will be over 
                        and done.  

           Renko stares, refusing to respond. 

                                 DOON (CONT’D)
                        You said it yourself, that girl’s 
                        better off dead than she is as 
                        Bevilaqua’s hostage.  I know him.  
                        I know that’s true.

           Across the room, on the console, an LED glows.  Shiz turns,

           Opposite them sits that guard, Neeley, also on the floor... 
           holding his gun in his lap.  

           DelRio notices something.  Up on the ceiling, a tiny little 
           panel slides open.  A lens twists, an tiny LED flickers.  

           DelRio elbows the girl lightly and flicks her eyes at the

                        cannon fire.
           INT. THE BLOODY HENRY - BRIDGE

           Doon looks at Renko.  Renko nods.

                                 BLOODY HENRY (V.O.)
                        Target acquired.  

                                 DOON
                        Cannon, fire away...

           BACK IN THE GUNROOM

           Bill and Walter Woods are at the console.  They hit their 
           levers... dials spin... but there’s nothing.

                                 RENKO VEGA (V.O.)
                        Bill...

           Bill is looking over the gear.   

                                 BILL.1
                        We have compression but no 
                        ignition.  I’m running diagnostics.   

           BACK IN THE BRIDGE

           Renko climbs out of his seat, glances at Doon.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Bring her back around.  I’m gonna 
                        go up and check the tube.  Bill, 
                        come to the bridge and call the 
                        guns from here.   

           INT. JENNIFER 9 / TECH ROOM

           DelRio and the girl are watching Neeley.  Something moves 
           behind Neeley.  A wall panel slides open.  A long, slender 
           robotic arm extends out of the panel...

           The girl glances at DelRio... they look at one another, then 
           both look back at Neeley.

                                 DELRIO 
                             (to Neeley)
                        So... what’s your name?

                                 NEELEY
                        Rule number one, don’t make friends 
                        with the hostages.  

                                 GIRL
                        Oh I don’t think there’s much 
                        danger of that.
           On Neeley’s other side, another panel opens, another robotic 
           arm extends.  DelRio swallows, looks at Neeley.

                                 DELRIO
                        So, what’s your girlfriend think of 
                        your job? 

           Neeley glares at Delrio.

                                 GIRL
                        You don’t have a girlfriend?  Or 
                        you don’t like girls--

                                 NEELEY
                        --Shuttup-- 

           --Suddenly, the manipulator arms SNAP out and grab Neeley, 

           DelRio thrusts forward with her legs and knocks the gun out 
           of his hands as the arms pin Neeley to the floor.  

           The manipulator arms move incredibly fast, while one keeps 
           Neeley pinned to the ground the other reaches around DelRio 
           and twists at her bindings, cutting her free.  

           The arm quickly goes to work on the girl and suddenly she is 
           free as well.  

           Across the room, a low panel opens in one of the walls.  
           DelRio looks around the room, speaks to the air...

                                 DELRIO
                        Who are you?

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Hurry!

                                 DELRIO
                        Who are you!?

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        I... am Jennifer 9...

           DelRio shoves the girl in front of her and the two of them 
           crawl through the hatch.

           INT. THE BLOODY HENRY - CANNON WORKS

           Renko Vega throws back a hatch and finds himself in a narrow 
           attic-like room, windows above, machinery all around.  

           Renko, wearing a headset, stands at the base of the Boron 
           cannon.  It’s a long steel-reinforced tube jutting up through 
           the roof, two and-a-half feet in diameter and 100 feet long.    
           There are HISSING valves, pipes, pneumatics everywhere.  
           There’s a primitive console, dusty, little used.  

                                 BILL.1 (V.O., RADIO)
                        Can you hear me, Renko Vega?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Copy, Bill.  I’m at the cannon 
                        base.  I’m gonna depressurize the 
                        main barrel.    

           Renko twists some valves at the base of the enormous shaft.  
           A BLAST of steam-like air HISSES out of the port.  

           There’s electrical SNAP... the CRACKLE of electricity.  Renko 
           jacks open the breech, a locking hatch on the side of the 
           base of the tube.  He peeks inside the darkness.  

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        I think there’s something jammed in 
                        the loading mechanism.  Bill, 
                        what’s the tube compression? 

                                 BILL.1
                        According to the main processor, 
                        the charge is null.  

           Renko peers inside the base of the cannon.

           INT. THE TECH ROOM

           McMink BURSTS through the door, BLASTING her laser at the 
           arms still pinning Neeley down on the floor.  WHACK!  WHACK!  
           The arms retreat as though stung.  

                                 MCMINK
                        Where!?

                                 NEELEY
                        A panel in the wall, down there!  
                        It’s the Jen 9.  She’s alive!

           McMink SWEARS and heads back out the door.

           INT. JEN 9 BRIDGE

           Lasers BLAST on the screens.  The bridge rocks.  Bevilaqua 
           stands at the helm with Shiz and Hawkins at the console.  

                                 BRAINS
                        Three minutes to main thrust.

                        All personnel prepare for massive 
                        acceleration...
           An intercom BEEPS...

                                 MCMINK (V.O.)
                        Admiral, your hostages are loose.  
                        They’re headed for the podbay--

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Stop them!  Blow the lifepods!   
                        Quickly! 

                                 SHIZ
                             (banging at his keyboards)
                        I can’t get access... the software 
                        won’t respond!  I’ve lost the 
                        starboard lasers as well!

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        System!  What’s happening?!  

                                 BRAINS
                        There is apparently an intruder in 
                        the ship’s control hardware.  We’re 
                        repatching! 

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Idiots!

           Bevilaqua turns and hurries from the bridge.

           INT. PASSAGEWAY

           DelRio and the girl race through alleys of circuits and wires 
           and gear.  They cut around a corner and down another alley.

           A hatch BURST OPEN with another FLASH of laser light.  McMink 
           pounds through... but DelRio reappears with Neeley’s gun and 
           shoots a jagged blast, HASHING down the corridor. 

           McMink just manages to duck back as DelRio hurtles back, 
           running, disappearing again.  McMink throws herself after 
           them, Neeley close behind. 

           INT. THE BLOODY HENRY / CANNON WORKS

           Renko peers into the breach of the cannon.  Something is 
           moving in the darkness up the shaft, something fidgeting as 
           though searching for an exit.

           Renko twists his head to get a better look and we realize the 
           fidgeting thing is one of those Black Flies!  The thing 
           BUZZES, flies back, and HITS Renko hard in the face. 

           Renko falls back in pain as the Black Fly escapes and BUZZES 
           up into the room, rocketing around... then SMASHES uselessly 
           into the upper glass.  
           Suddenly the cannon tube begins to WHISTLE.  An enormous 
           BLAST of HOT AIR FLASHES OUT of the breech.  

           Renko tries to shut the hatch, but an BLAST backfires out of 
           the tube.  Renko is slammed back by the door and is thrown 
           through the cannon chamber.  His headset is blown right off 
           his ears as he CRASHES down on the floor.  

           WE MOVE CLOSER as his head lolls to the side.  Renko is 
           unconscious... blood is dripping out of his ear... 

           INT. JEN 9 - EMERGENCY AREA

           A room with a couple of complex hatches lining one wall, 
           there are stencils... LIFEPOD#s - JEN 9 etc.

           DelRio swings one of the hatches open and grabs Elizabeth.

                                 DELRIO
                        Inside, quick.

           Elizabeth climbs inside... DelRio starts to close the hatch-- 

                                 GIRL
                        --No, not without you!

                                 DELRIO
                        Get in, now!  

           But suddenly there’s a SMASH at the door behind them.  DelRio 
           turns and squeezes off a BLAST of laser.

           McMink is first one in, but she ducks and the spasm of 
           electrical charge hits Hawkins and KNOCKS him down hard. 

           DelRio swings her own gun at McMink and FIRES AGAIN but 
           McMink jams forward and knocks DelRio’s gun up in the air.

           Both guns BLAST and HASH, scorching the ceiling, CRACKING 
           OPEN a pipe filled with FROZEN GAS.  The gas HISSES out of 
           the pipe and billows, filling the room with an acrid FOG.

           DelRio swings the butt of her gun up and KNOCKS into McMink’s 
           hand.  Lasers SWEEP hard across the room, the beams CUTTING 
           THROUGH the fog.  

           Finally DelRio’s gun SPUTTERS weakly.  She ditches her gun 
           and JAMS under McMink’s arms, grabs her and pulls hard.  

           McMink hangs on to the gun, but the muzzle is outside 
           DelRio’s sphere.  DelRio swings her knees up and, using her 
           leg skills, JAMS McMink’s shoulder, then pulls McMink’s hand 
           off the gun.

           The gun CLATTERS to the floor.  
           Elizabeth tries to get at it, but McMink dives and KNOCKS it 
           away.  DelRio kicks up but McMink twists avoids and kicks at 
           DelRio with a sweet leg move of her own. 

           DelRio flies back through the fog and smashes through the 
           junk on the floor, cut, bleeding.  

           She staggers back to her feet and faces off with McMink.  
           Even though the room is completely enveloped in a blinding 
           mist, they PARRY at one another with powerful leg kicks... 

           Finally DelRio gets superior position and KICKS McMink back 
           hard into the wall.  McMink SLAMS back, CRACKS her skull, and 
           loses consciousness.   

           DelRio turns and tries to get her bearings in the fog.  ALARM 
           HORNS are SCREAMING.  A computer VOICE is counting down... 

                                 DELRIO (CONT’D)
                        Elizabeth!

           But the fog is too thick and DelRio’s badly wounded.  She 
           drops to one knee.   

           Finally Elizabeth scrambles out of the blinding whiteness.  

                                 GIRL
                        Kathryn!  Here!

                                 DELRIO
                        Get in the pod!  Jennifer!  Jen 9!  
                        Get ready to launch!

           ANOTHER ANGLE

           The main door suddenly BURSTS open and Bevilaqua EXPLODES 
           inside.  He is backlit in the fog, BLASTING his gun.  A BOLT 
           of plasma HACKS through the swirling, freezing whiteness...

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        No!  No!!

           He chases over to the pod door as Elizabeth SLAMS it shut.

           Suddenly there’s a HUGE NOISE, BOOMING ROCKETS... as the pod 
           pulls off the side of the Jen... 

           The vacuum sucks hard, and ROCKET FIRE fills the room!

           Bevilaqua heaves himself back across the room, grabs the 
           hatch and pulls himself through... 

           INT. JEN 9 BRIDGE

           Bevilaqua scrambles back inside. 
                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Shiz!  System Twelve, take over the 
                        interface!  I want the Jen 9 
                        software shut down!  Choke her out!   

           INT. THE BLOODY HENRY / BRIDGE

           Doon is watching his screens.

           INT. THE BLOODY HENRY - CANNON WORKS

           Renko is unconscious on the floor beneath the Boron tube.

           There’s a sound we’ve heard before... a WHISTLING SOUND, like 
           a tea kettle, wobbly, imperfect... the WHISTLE RESOLVES into 
           a soft HUMM and then, that familiar VOICE...

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Renko... Renko Vega... Renko can 
                        you hear me?

           Renko looks up, groggily, coming to... 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jennifer.  Jennifer, is that really 
                        you?

                        It’s so good to hear you... Jen--

                        I have only enough strength to keep 
                        the armor shields down for a short 
                        time.  You have a clean shot-- 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --No.  No.  Jen.  

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.) 
                        You have to end this--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --Not like this--!

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.) 
                        --Listen to me, Renko Vega, and 
                        remember who you are--

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        --Who we are, Jen... a charming 
                        rogue and his beautiful sidekick-- 

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.) 
                        --No.  I’m not beautiful.  I’m 
                        electrical pulses filtered through 
                        traces of wire and plates of 
                        silicon... 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Renko Vega is nothing without the 
                        Jen 9.  Nothing.

                                 JENNIFER 9
                        Renko Vega is the man who saved 
                        sixteen stranded miners off 
                        Ganymede.  He flew into the fires 
                        of Tartarus and towed out a 
                        disabled lightship.  Now, he’s 
                        rescued the Princess of Mars and a 
                        hundred and fifty people from a 
                        space liner about to crash into 
                        Titan.  He is Renko Vega... and I 
                        am proud to have been his ship.  

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jen--

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.) 
                        --There’s no more time... the 
                        shields are down, Renko.  The 
                        shields are down...

           And we hear that WHISTLING sound... the fading of Jennifer’s 
           signal as it descends into HASH...
                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Jennifer!  Jennifer!!

           But Jennifer is gone.  And now all the air has gone from 
           Renko’s spirit.  For a moment he does not move.  

           Finally, he stands and heaves at the breach of the Boron 
           cannon.  He levers down the load from its magazine.  His 
           actions are stiff, like an automaton.  

           He stares stony and bereft.  He powers up the “local” 
           console.  He finds a headset and pulls it over his ears.

                                 RENKO VEGA (CONT’D)
                        Master Doon, order all engines stop 
                        and prepare for cannon fire.

           INT. THE BLOODY HENRY BRIDGE

           Bill turns to Doon.  They both seem immediately aware of what 
           is happening.

                                 DOON
                        Henry, all engines stop.  Stabilize 
                        and prep for cannon fire.

           BACK TO THE CANNON-WORKS

           Renko’s at the Boron console, entering numbers on a keypad.  

           On his screen we can see the Jennifer 9 moving steadily 
           through space.  A target lines up, tracking on the Jennifer.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Henry, check my calculations, 
                        please.

                                 BLOODY HENRY (V.O.)
                        Verifying, Renko Vega, target 
                        acquired and locked. 

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Stand by...

           Renko throws switches, fingers a pair of levers and 
           resignedly throws the levers.  The big cannon HISSES.  

           EXT. SPACE

           The Bloody Henry jerks as the Boron cannon silently winces.  
           A brilliant glowing thing spools across the sky.
           INT. THE JENNIFER 9 / BRIDGE

           Creighton Bevilaqua is standing on the grid, watching his 
           screens.  Shiz is at the console, suddenly showing concern...

                                 SHIZ
                        Admiral, my board’s not responding.  
                        Jeezus, we dropped our shields!  
                        Shields are down!

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        System!  Respond!  What’s 
                        happening!  System!

           There’s nothing for a moment, finally we hear a sultry, 
           familiar voice.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Admiral Bevilaqua, this is the 
                        Jennifer 9, reporting to the 
                        bridge.

                                 SHIZ
                        Admiral, the Henry’s launched a 
                        missile!  A boron load!

           Bevilaqua turns to his screen and watches as the glowing 
           Boron missile creases the sky.  

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Jennifer, as master of this ship I 
                        order you to replace the shields  
                        And put the Revolver AI back in 
                        control.  Now! 

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        I’m afraid those Revolver guys 
                        aren’t around right now, Admiral.

           Bevilaqua looks at the panels and screens one by one... he 
           sees the repeating image of the Boron missile heading towards 
           the Jennifer.  

           Bevilaqua calms... finally accepting the inevitable.

                                 BEVILAQUA
                        Jennifer... you’ve ended us.

                                 JENNIFER 9 (V.O.)
                        Yes, Admiral.  I have ended us.

           And suddenly the Jennifer 9 EXPLODES in an awesome, 
           shattering BLAST...  

           She comes apart from the inside out, a deep and MASSIVE 
           SPLASH of HEAT and LIGHT... the LOUDEST NOISE you ever heard. 
           The void SUCKS and HISSES at Jennifer’s pieces... pulling it 
           apart in her massive vacuum.

           EXT. SPACE - VERY WIDE

           An enormous explosion, silent and dazzling, as bright as 
           fireworks in a black velvet sky...

           INT. THE BLOODY HENRY / VARIOUS

           ON THE BRIDGE - Doon and Bill.1 hang onto the rail as the 
           EXPLOSION roars through the interior of the Henry.  

           IN THE GUN ROOM - The surviving passengers watch through the 
           portals and on their screens.  The blast fills our ears with 
           its lingering DEATH-HOWL...

           IN THE CANNON WORKS - Renko Vega watches the sky through the 
           windows above as light rips through the room.   

           Then the Jennifer is gone.  Renko sits at the base of the 
           console and puts his head in his hands.  

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. SPACE

           There’s BLACKNESS, then STARS... speckling the sky.  Then we 
           see a light, red, not a star at all, BLINKING. 

           We MOVE CLOSER and see a white tube, burned snd scorched, 
           covered in pipes and markings, beacon FLASHING...

           Suddenly an enormous shadow appears.  It’s a huge mass of 
           coagulated junk floating slowly:  The Bloody Henry.

           Henry’s giant mouth drops open... his yawning flight deck... 

           The mouth moves over the Jen 9 lifepod and swallows, like a 
           whale eating a goldfish.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE BLOODY HENRY - FLIGHT DECK

           The Lifepod is slung up in a rubber net, turned rightside up.  
           Passengers from the Revolver help Bill.1 as he takes a wrench 
           and undogs the hatch.  

           The door is removed and pulled away.  Inside, Kathryn DelRio 
           is dirty, only vaguely conscious, covered in blood.  
           Elizabeth Ardmore, awake and in tears, caresses her head.   
           Hands reach for the two women and gently remove them from the 
           capsule interior.  Darla Cahill helps put DelRio on a 
           stretcher and cover her in blankets.  

           The girl refuses Darla’s help, insisting on standing on her 
           own.  Then something catches her eye.  

           She pulls away from the others.  Renko Vega is standing just 
           a little off, his face filled with lingering sorrow.   

                                 GIRL
                        Renko Vega.  

           Renko stares at the girl softly as people step back and give 
           the two figures room.  

           Renko hesitates, then, finally, he drops to one knee and bows 
           his head... his voice is urgent, a committed whisper...

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        To the family Ardmore, to the 
                        Princess of Mars, to United Planet 
                        Earth... I pledge my loyalty and my 
                        devotion... you are my liege...

           The girl stops and swallows, for the first time caught 
           unaware, sensing Vega’s emotion and feeling her own... but 
           she shakes it off.  

                                 GIRL
                        Okay, Vega.  Get up.  You look 
                        stupid down there--

           Renko stands and looks at the girl.  She looks away, then 
           looks back.

           Renko smiles in spite of himself.  The girl allows a tiny 
           smile in return.  Finally, she takes his hand and pulls him 
           into the crowd.  

           Renko looks down at DelRio.  She smiles softly, tries to 
           speak but falters, then regathers herself...  

                                 DELRIO
                        Renko Vega... you’re a hero all 
                        over again.  

           Renko smiles softly, shakes his head in refusal.

                                 DELRIO (CONT’D)
                        You’ll watch the girl for me... for 
                        a little while anyway...

           Renko nods... it’s a commitment he’s already made.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        I got you covered, DelRio.
           DelRio smiles again as her lids fall.  Darla Cahill and the 
           others wheel DelRio away.  Renko and the girl watch them go.

                                 GIRL
                        So, Vega.  How’s your hand?

           Renko holds up his Hand, which is a bit of a disaster.

                                 HAND
                        Hand is aware.  Hand is fine.  
                        Thank you for asking.  

           Renko turns to one side.  Bill.1 is there, looking somewhat 
           unsure of himself, still half-melted.

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        Bill point one, this is Miss 
                        Elizabeth Ardmore, Princess of 
                        Mars, daughter of James Joplin 
                        Ardmore.

           Bill awkwardly drops down to one knee.  He CREAKS.

                                 BILL.1
                        I am honored.

                                 GIRL
                        Yeah, that’s fine, but you guys are 
                        embarrassing me.  Hey, you’re a 
                        robot, aren’t you?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        He is a robot... actually he’s one 
                        helluva robot.  

                                 GIRL
                        You got some crazy friends, Vega. 

           Renko hesitates, about to respond, then just nods.

                                 GIRL (CONT’D)
                        So you got any food on this jalopy?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        I think we can find you something.

           They turn and walk away from us, across the deck... they move 
           into darkness, FOOTSTEPS RINGING.

                                 GIRL
                        Lemme ask you something, Vega... 
                        what do you think of Agent DelRio?

                                 RENKO VEGA
                        What do I think of her?  She tried 
                        to shoot me, didn’t she?
                                 GIRL
                        No, that was, look, the two of you 
                        have the same go-for-broke vibe and 
                        you’re not bad-looking and I know 
                        you got lots of amigos and they’re 
                        perfectly nice but I think you 
                        oughta start hanging out with human 
                        beings every now and then... 

           She keeps TALKING as they drift out of earshot and we...

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           EXT. SPACE

           Stars again, in that same old black sky.  We hear someone 
           HUMMING to himself as the junk-filled roof of the Bloody 
           Henry ascends into the lower part of the frame.

           We hear CLUMPING, awkward FOOTSTEPS.  Bill.1 appears.  He’s 
           wearing big MAGNETIC SHOES and walking across the steel hull.

                                 BILL.1 (V.O.)
                        How my doin’, Henry?  

                                 BLOODY HENRY (V.O.)
                        Over to your right a bit...  
                        Right... there.  

           Bill is standing on the edge of a big pile of welded-together 
           junk, nothing below or around him but the void.  He stops.  

           He’s got something in his hands... it looks like a long-
           handled butterfly net.

                                 BLOODY HENRY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Should be about seventy degrees off 
                        the surface, about three meters up.

           Bill leans out, dangling off the edge.  Something FLUTTERS 
           by, a bit of red, and Bill snags it in his net. 

                                 BILL.1 (V.O.)
                        Got it. 

           He turns and reaches into the net and pulls something out.  
           He opens his palm...

           The jewel, the “Lady of the Shadows” rests in Bill’s palm.  
           The crimson ribbon, burned and tattered, floats gently above.

           Bill HUMMS as he grasps the rock, turns, and CLANKS BACK 
           across the surface of the Henry.  

           To the rhythm of his footsteps, Bill begins to sing... 
                                 BILL.1 (CONT’D)
                        Wo ho!  And they’ll never know... 
                        where I hide or where I go!  Wo ho 
                        and they can’t catch me...!

                                 BLOODY HENRY (V.O.)
                        ...for they call me Renko Vega! 

                                 BILL.1
                        In the Jennifer 9 I spend my 
                        time... 

                                 BLOODY HENRY (V.O.)
                        Renko, Renko Vega!

                                 BILL.1 (V.O.)
                        She’s a damn good ship and friend 
                        of mine!

                                 BLOODY HENRY (V.O.)
                        Renko, Renko Vega!

                                 BILL.1 (V.O.)
                        Wo ho!  And you’ll never know, 
                        where I sleep or where I go.  Wo 
                        ho... and they catch me... 

                                 BLOODY HENRY (V.O.)
                        For they call me Renko Vega!

           We PULL AWAY from the Henry, further and further... until 
           it’s tiny glowing dot... 

                                 BILL.1 (V.O.)
                        Wo ho!  And you’ll never know, 
                        where I sleep or where I go.  Wo 
                        ho... and you won’t catch me... 

           The Bloody Henry becomes a tiny star, MOVING among a thousand 
           other stars... 

                                 BILL AND HENRY (V.O.)
                        ...for they call me Renko Vega!  

           The stars are WINKING... it’s like they’re LAUGHING... but  
           they’re not laughing at all... they’re SINGING...

                                 BILL, HENRY, AND THE STARS (V.O.)
                        For they call... me... Ren-ko Vega! 

                                      THE END
