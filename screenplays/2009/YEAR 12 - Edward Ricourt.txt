           FADE IN:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Two bodies spoon under the covers of a pull-out bed.

           TIGHT ON

           An alarm clock, droning on.  It’s silenced by a karate chop 
           to the stop button.  In bed is...

           TYLER KIRKLAND (35).  This is the face of a man that was once 
           happy.  Even blessed.  That was a long time ago.  

           Tyler takes in the naked back of the WOMAN beside him.  He 
           runs his fingers over a long deep burn on her back.  He looks 
           up to find the woman staring back at him. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Hey.

                                 TYLER
                        Hey.

           They soak each other in.  Two strangers seeing each other for 
           the first time in the grey morning light.

                                 WOMAN
                        Do you cook?

                                 TYLER
                        I stick to the basics.  Mainly 
                        cereal.

                                 WOMAN
                        I never liked cereal.

                                 TYLER
                        You never tried my Captain Crunch.

                                 WOMAN
                        I bet you were a great cook.

                                 TYLER
                        I never got a complaint.  

                                 WOMAN
                        I bet you didn’t.

                                 TYLER
                        Are we still talking about food?
                                 WOMAN
                             (smiles)
                        No.

           The woman takes in the room.  A definite bachelor pad.  Free 
           weights scattered on the stained rug, along with their 
           discarded clothes. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        A real bed would have been nice.

                                 TYLER
                        I don’t sleep in the bedroom 
                        anymore.

                                 WOMAN
                        Why not?

           Tyler smiles at her.  It’s more polite than saying “none of 
           your business.”

                                 TYLER
                        Did we exchange names?

                                 WOMAN
                        No.

           Tyler eyes her scars.  She takes in the scars on Tyler’s 
           chest.  It’s a moment of quiet understanding.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        I should go.

           The woman gets out of bed.  Grabs her shirt.  Tyler watches 
           her dress.  God, she’s beautiful.  The woman moves towards 
           the window.  It’s raining-- pouring down in dark drops, 
           leaving ashy streaks on the window.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        You’d think the skies would finally 
                        clear.

                                 TYLER
                        No.  Not for another 40 years.

                                 WOMAN
                        This is my favorite part of the 
                        day.  Before it starts.

           Tyler joins her at the window.  It’s then that we see the 
           scene... 

           HIGH ATOP OF NEW YORK CITY
           A view of Central Park.  The trees are scorched.  So are many 
           of the crumbling skyscrapers.  An island once filled with 
           beautiful, towering buildings, now in ruin.

           The woman looks to Tyler, now in her personal space.  But 
           somehow, it’s okay. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Kristen.

                                 TYLER
                             (smiles)
                        Tyler.

           INT. TYLER’S KITCHEN - LATER

           Tyler makes himself a bowl of cereal.  He’s dressed in a grey 
           shirt, jacket and pants.  

           INT. KEVIN’S ROOM - SAME

           A boys room unchanged by time.  Baseball posters.  Trophies 
           sit side by side on top of the dresser along with favorite 
           superheroes.  

           There’s a painted galaxy covering the entire ceiling.  Tyler 
           enters with his bowl of cereal.  He stops in front of a DVD 
           cabinet.

                                 TYLER
                        What do you think?  Should we go 
                        with Jimmy Neutron, or Spongebob?  
                             (a beat)
                        Yeah, it feels like a Spongebob 
                        kinda day.

           Tyler squats down on the floor in front of the TV.  He slides 
           in the DVD, and eats his cereal.  This is Tyler’s morning 
           routine.   

           INT. TYLER’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY

           Tyler moves to the front door, stopping in front of an 
           intercom.

                                 TYLER
                        Tyler Kirkland.  Number 178342.  
                        Leaving for work.
           Tyler pulls out his work papers and presses them against a 
           glass screen beside the door.  Green light scans the paper. 
           Tyler turns to the door, and waits.

           The door lock clicks open.

           EXT. 76TH & LEXINGTON - DAY

           Tyler keeps step with the other COMMUTERS.  Everyone wears 
           the same clothes-- grey shirt and pants.  We now know these 
           clothes are in fact, a uniform.

           By Tyler’s side is DEXTER CARTER, (34).  His best friend 
           whether Tyler likes it or not.  Dexter is a little too loud.  
           A little too obnoxious.  A little too everything. 

                                 DEXTER
                        I put in 70 hours last week.  Guess 
                        how much I made?  Throw out a 
                        number.

           Before Tyler can answer:

                                 DEXTER (CONT’D)
                        Four meal cards, seven drink cards, 
                        and a day pass.  I’m going to dine 
                        like a fucking king.

           Tyler smiles.  Dexter is a constant source of entertainment.

                                 DEXTER (CONT’D)
                             (wistful)
                        God, I miss the way it was.  Know 
                        what I would do on a Friday night 
                        with a paycheck burning in my 
                        wallet?

                                 TYLER
                        I can only imagine.

                                 DEXTER
                        The town would be painted.  The 
                        women, wooed.  Have you ever tried 
                        wooing a woman with a meal card?  
                        That takes skill my friend.

           Tyler and Dexter stop at the corner along with other 
           COMMUTERS.  Everyone looks up to the STREET LIGHT.  It 
           changes to RED.  The streets are empty, but no one dares step 
           foot off the curb.  
           A commuter accidentally nudges a WOMAN forward.  She tries to 
           steady herself, but her foot comes off the curb and touches 
           the street.  The STOP LIGHT becomes active, tilting down 
           towards the woman.

           The light reconfigures itself into an AUTOCANNON, and FIRES.  
           The woman is hit with multiple shots.  She’s dead on her 
           feet, falling face first onto the street.  

           The autocannon transforms back into a street light.

           Tyler stares down at the fallen body helpless.  He looks 
           around to the commuters, spotting a man, staring straight 
           ahead as if a dead body wasn’t laying in front of him.  But 
           that doesn’t stop a tear from making its way down his cheek. 
           THIS is routine.  Murder.  Complacency.  

           The light changes to green.  Dexter joins the commuters as 
           they cross the street, but not Tyler.  He’s still staring 
           down at the woman’s body.  

           Tyler snaps out of his haze -- continuing on -- heading 
           toward a street lined with school buses, Greyhound buses, 
           city buses -- any form of above ground mass transit that’s in 
           working order.

           INT. BUS - LATER

           Tyler and Dexter sit together.  Neither have probably said a 
           word since the incident on the sidewalk.  Tyler watches the 
           people on the bus.  Their sadness and fear are on display.

           The moment is broken by an EXPLOSION that blasts out a second 
           floor window across the street.  Dust and bits of debris pelt 
           the bus window.  From their seat on the bus, Dexter and Tyler 
           watch commuters scrambling for cover.

                                 DEXTER
                             (on a rant)
                        They never learn.  All they do is 
                        stir shit up, and who pays for it?  
                        We do.  War’s over.  Everyone needs 
                        to grow the fuck up and deal with 
                        it.

           Tyler stares at Dexter, ready to respond.  He knows words are 
           wasted on a man like Dexter.  Instead, he turns back to the 
           chaos on the street.
           EXT. SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - LATER

           Tyler and Dexter follow the crowd of WORKERS off the bus, 
           moving towards a waiting FERRY.   They have to make their way 
           past...

           THE INSPECTOR

           Wearing a hooded trench -- face obscured.  

           A WORKER in line stops in front of the inspector.  The 
           inspector holds out a gloved hand expectantly.  The worker is 
           sweaty.  Visibly nervous.

                                 WORKER
                        You want my work order, you ask me 
                        for it.

           The inspector does not speak.  It just continues to hold its 
           hand out.

                                 WORKER (CONT’D)
                        You can ask me in any language you 
                        want.  English.  Spanish.  Chinese.  
                        Just... tell me what you want!

           ON TYLER

           Watching the worker unravel.  

           ON THE INSPECTOR

           Silent.  Hand still extended out for the work order.  The 
           worker is at the very edge of his sanity. 

                                 WORKER (CONT’D)
                        You want my work order.

           The worker backs away, pulls out a gun, and FIRES into the 
           inspector’s stomach who doubles over.  The inspector raises 
           back up.  Its hood sliding down.  We now see the face of our 
           enemy--

           Fleshy, milky white inhuman skin.  Dark eyes.  Muscular 
           frame.  Its skin is discolored, and wet.  The veins visibly 
           pulsate.  A deformed version of humans.  As if the difference 
           between us and them was a single genetic defect.  The 
           inspector lets out a SCREAM that is half human, half warning 
           siren.

           Another siren cries out in response from the sky.  The ground 
           begins to shake as the man’s face, Tyler, and soon, the 
           entire seaport is covered in shadow.  
           Everyone looks up to an...

           ALIEN MOTHERSHIP

           A dark, massive, hive shaped structure floating in the sky.  
           Hell floats over the city.  This is their universe, and it’s 
           parked right above our heads.  

           An armada of WARSHIPS race out from portals along the side of 
           the mothership.  These warships look much like the 
           mothership.  Hive shaped.  Jet-black.  Small enough to fly 
           through a narrow street at low altitude.     

           BACK TO THE WORKER

           He knows death is moments away.  He’s going out his way.

                                 WORKER
                             (softly)
                        My country tis of thee.  Sweet land 
                        of Liberty.  Of thee I sing.

           The worker turns to the crowd, eyeing each and every person, 
           making sure the lyrics penetrate.  

                                 WORKER (CONT’D)
                             (stronger)
                        Land where my fathers died.  Land 
                        of the pilgrims’ pride.  From every 
                        mountainside--

           The inspector RIPS into the worker, tearing into his flesh.  
           No ray gun.  No disintegration.  This is savage and brutal. 

           ON TYLER

           Watching on as the dead stranger is pushed into the river by 
           other humanoids.  The body drifts away, bumping into another 
           floating carcass, then another.  A gridlock of bodies in the 
           river.

           INT. FERRY - LATER

           Tyler and Dexter sit towards the back of the ferry, buckled 
           in.  Their thoughts are still on the horrific scene at the 
           pier.

                                 DEXTER
                        Why do you think they stopped 
                        talking to us?
                                 TYLER
                        Because they don’t have to anymore.

           Tyler’s attention turns to a COUPLE across the aisle.  He 
           watches the way they kiss -- the deep gaze into one another -- 
           a couple in love.  This gets Tyler thinking.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        I met a woman.

                                 DEXTER
                             (disinterested)
                        On yeah?

                                 TYLER
                        I met her on the food line.  I took 
                        her home.

           Dexter’s interested now.  He looks at Tyler like a proud 
           papa.

                                 DEXTER
                        You took her home?  She stayed 
                        through the curfew?

                                 TYLER
                        Yeah.

                                 DEXTER
                        How was it? 

           Tyler looks back at the couple in love.  Thinks about it.

                                 TYLER
                        It was like that.

           Dexter looks at the couple, sits back in his chair, and 
           remembers.  

           The horn goes off as the smoke stack spews black smoke.  
           Something else is happening.  Clear glass begins to cover the 
           entire ferry.  

           EXT. FERRY - SAME

           Water begins to swirl around the boat.  

           The bow of the ferry begins to rise, then dive into the water 
           like a submarine, fully submerging itself in the water.
           INT. FERRY - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler watches the view from under the east river.

           The bottom of the sea is littered with reminders of a brutal 
           war.  Crumbled U.S. aircraft carriers, submarines, and Black 
           Hawk helicopters.  Tyler fixes on a sight that turns his 
           stomach each time he sees it.

           THE STATUTE OF LIBERTY

           Laying on her side in the muddy bottom.  Her torch still 
           raised up high.  The ferry moves past Lady Liberty, towards a 
           field full of a dozen...

           SUBMERGED DRILL RIGS  

           Much like our modern day above ground drilling rigs.  Except 
           these are mobile -- each having the power to get up on its 
           four pillars and move to a new drill site.  

           Submerged TRANSPORT SPACE CRAFTS dock to the side of the rig, 
           load up, detach, then float up to the surface.

           INT. DRILL RIG - LATER

           Tyler sits behind the console, dirty and sweaty from the 
           intense heat -- directing a stream of white hot light towards 
           the earth -- churning up sandstone -- funneling it to a 
           waiting TRANSPORT SPACE CRAFT.  

           Tyler spots something churning with the rocks.  Silvery.  
           Gray.  Metallic.  Tyler looks up to Dexter in his rig.  
           Dexter’s eyes light up.  He sees what Tyler sees.  He moves 
           his rig over to Tyler’s.

           Tyler guides the robotic arm down to the chunk of rock.  So 
           does Dexter.  Tyler beats him to it, snatching up the rock, 
           then depositing it into an INCUBATOR below the rig. 

           Neither man likes to lose, even if it’s in the service of 
           those bastards up above.

                                 TYLER
                        Ten pounds of uranium.  Looks like 
                        my day is done.

           Yes, Tyler is rubbing it in.  That’s why Dexter is giving 
           Tyler the finger.  Dexter swings his rig around, and 
           continues to search the field.  Tyler talks into a console 
           receiver.
                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Set the melting point to 2070 
                        degrees Fahrenheit. 

           Tyler watches as the uranium changes from solid to liquid.  

           A TRANSPORT SPACE CRAFT piloted by an alien humanoid moves 
           in.  A funnel connects from the craft to Tyler’s rig, 
           siphoning the uranium from Tyler.  

           And that’s how it is every damn day.  Tyler drills, and they 
           take.  Tyler watches the craft float up to the surface.  
           There’s bitterness in his eyes.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        You’re welcome.

           INT. DECONTAMINATION CENTER - LATER

           Tyler and Dexter walk through the long hall.  They stop at a 
           checkpoint, taking off their shirts.

                                 DEXTER
                        Guess who I heard is still alive?

                                 TYLER
                        Who?

                                 DEXTER
                        Leonardo DiCaprio.  They got him 
                        working the Hudson River Basin.  

                                 TYLER
                        No shit.

                                 DEXTER
                        Heard he looks like ass.  Walks 
                        around with a limp, mumbling all 
                        kinds of shit.  Guy lived in 
                        mansions.  Had sex with the hottest 
                        girls.  Now he’s just like the rest 
                        of us.

           Tyler walks through a plastic encased shower complex single 
           file with the rest of the workers.  We see the blurry 
           silhouette of ALIEN INSPECTORS watching from the other side 
           of the plastic as Tyler is scanned.  

           The monitor reads: CLEAR  

           Tyler moves on, gathering his clothes from a bin that passes 
           through a separate washing system alongside the showers. 
           INT. TYLER’S APARTMENT - KEVIN’S BEDROOM - DAY

           The usual morning ritual.  Tyler moves to a DVD cabinet.  He 
           reads over the DVD’s labeled “Little League Debut.”  
           “Hawaii.”  “Honeymoon.”  Tyler pulls a case labeled: “1st Day 
           of School. 2nd Grade.”  He pops in the disc.

           ON SCREEN: KEVIN, (7).  Tyler’s son -- sitting at the 
           breakfast table.  We watch the video with Tyler. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Why’s dad acting so strange?

           Tyler’s wife, SAMANTHA, (25) sticks her head in the shot, 
           planting a kiss on Kevin’s forehead.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Because it’s your first day of 
                        school, and your father’s extremely 
                        corny and cheesy.

                                 TYLER
                        I bet you’re looking forward to 
                        seeing your friends.

                                 KEVIN
                        Well, there’s this girl on my 
                        soccer team.  I think I’m going to 
                        marry her.

                                 TYLER
                             (laughing it off)
                        Marriage?  No.  You don’t want 
                        marriage.

                                 KEVIN
                        Why not?  You and mom got married.

                                 TYLER
                        That’s -- well -- yes, we did get 
                        married.

                                 KEVIN
                        Did you want to be married?

           Kevin stares back at his father, waiting for an answer.

                                 TYLER
                        Okay.  I’ll answer that.
                             (looks to Samantha)
                        Sam, a little teamwork here with 
                        the critical life forming question.  

           Samantha’s ready to be entertained by Tyler’s answer.
                                 SAMANTHA
                        Your son’s asking you a question.

                                 TYLER
                        Okay, with me and your mother-- 
                             (starts over)
                        --with me and your mother.  I 
                        thought I should be single, and do 
                        a bunch of stupid things that 
                        single people do.  And then 
                        something happened.  Something 
                        beautiful, and unexpected.  A 
                        miracle.  And when I got this 
                        beautiful and unexpected -- very 
                        unexpected news -- after several 
                        shots of... “Hawaiian Punch,” I got 
                        up the nerve, dropped down on one 
                        knee, and I asked her to spend the 
                        rest of her life doing a bunch of 
                        stupid things with me.  So I guess 
                        the answer is yes, I did want 
                        marriage.  I just didn’t know it 
                        until--

           Tyler looks to Samantha.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        --One day, it just all made sense.

           Samantha takes Tyler’s hand.  Moved beyond words.  They 
           couldn’t love each other any more than they do right now.  

           CLICK.

           Tyler turns the video off.  He looks up to the painted galaxy 
           covering the ceiling.  He stands, holding his cereal.  Tyler 
           throws his bowl against the Universe, splattering the Milky 
           Way with Shredded Wheat.

           INT. TYLER’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - LATER

           Tyler walks out of his apartment.  He turns to find MR. LUTZ, 
           65, coming out of his apartment down the hall.  Mr. Lutz 
           always has a smile on his face.  A good man.  Tyler looks 
           down to see Mr. Lutz has luggage with him.  

                                 MR. LUTZ
                        I have to report.  It’s my 
                        birthday.  I’m 65.

           Tyler stands there -- numb -- searching for words.  
                                 TYLER
                        I’m no good at this.  I don’t know 
                        what to say.

                                 MR. LUTZ
                        Then shake my hand, and let that be 
                        enough.

           Tyler shakes Mr. Lutz’s hand.  This is probably not the first 
           good-bye Tyler’s had to make, but this one’s hard.

                                 MR. LUTZ (CONT’D)
                        They say you can’t take it with 
                        you.  But what do they know?
                             (with a wink)
                        They’re not from around here.  

                                 TYLER
                        You don’t have to go.  You can run.

                                 MR. LUTZ
                        You could be arrested for saying 
                        such things.  I could turn you in.  
                        Maybe they would add a few more 
                        years to my life.  But what’s the 
                        use?  They have no use for the old.  
                        The law says we must report when we 
                        turn 65, and the law’s the law.  

                                 TYLER
                             (again)
                        You can run.

                                 MR. LUTZ
                        Run where?  Leave the city?  Do you 
                        know what’s out there?  And with 
                        these legs?  I don’t want to be 
                        here anymore.  Not in this world.  

           Mr. Lutz manages one more smile for Tyler’s sake.  He turns 
           and walks down the hall, pulling his luggage on wheels 
           without another word.

           EXT. CON EDISON WATERSIDE POWERPLANT - DAY

           A line of people stretch around the block.  All the people on 
           line are around Mr. Lutz’s age.  

           Mr. Lutz takes the slow walk to the end of the line.  He’s 
           approached by an ALIEN GUARD.  Mr. Lutz hands in his papers.  
           His bags are taken away and loaded up into a TRUCK filled 
           with luggage.  
           Mr. Lutz looks up to the sky.  He takes it in for the last 
           time before walking into the plant.  

           PAN UP along the chest of the powerplant to the--

           BLACK SMOKE

           Spewing out from three smoke stacks.  The rising smoke 
           spreads out over the city.

           INT. DECONTAMINATION CENTER 

           Tyler stands alone in the plastic encased shower complex.  
           His eyes shut -- tired and exhausted as the hot chemicals 
           blast away at his body.  Tyler opens his eyes, coming out of 
           his haze.  He steps forward.

           The monitor reads: CLEAR.

           INT. TYLER’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 

           Tyler lays on the pull-out bed.  

           On TV, a video of Tyler’s son, Kevin, starring in the school 
           play as the Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz.  Tyler watches on 
           until his eyes get heavy, and all goes BLACK.

           INT. TYLER’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           An alarm clock drones on.

           Tyler’s face is buried in the pillow.  He reaches up to slap 
           the alarm shut.  A hand reaches it first.  Tyler lifts his 
           head to find a stranger in his house.

           ANDREAS MIKRA

           In his 30’s, greek.  Half of his face is seared almost to the 
           bone.  You can still see the handsome man under the charred 
           flesh.  

                                 ANDREAS
                        This is a really nice place.  
                        Toilet’s backed up.  Wasn’t me.

           Tyler stares at Andreas, quickly trying to grasp what’s going 
           on in his living room.

                                 TYLER
                        Who are you?  Are you terrorists?
                                 ANDREAS
                        You hear that?  

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I did.

                                 ANDREAS
                        Terrorists?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Ain’t that some backwards shit.

           Andreas gets in Tyler’s face.  Tyler tries not to look at his 
           scorched face, but it’s impossible.

                                 ANDREAS
                        Now...
                             (leaning in even closer)
                        ...do I look like a terrorist to 
                        you?

           Tyler looks behind Andreas to:

           MALIK EVANS

           Black, mid 30’s.  If anyone can combine viciousness with a 
           light hearted charm, it’s this guy.

                                 MALIK
                             (to Tyler)
                        You don’t recognize me?  That 
                        assassination two years back.  I 
                        wiped out 14 of those dark-eyed 
                        motherfuckas.  That was all me.

                                 ANDREAS
                        You see this guy?  He’s still 
                        talking about two years ago. 

                                 TYLER
                        What do you want with me?  There’s 
                        nothing here worth stealing.

           Malik’s digging in the cabinet.

                                 MALIK
                        He’s not lying.  Ain’t got but a 
                        box of cereal in here.  And no 
                        powdered milk!

                                 TYLER
                             (explodes)
                        What do you want with me!?
                                 ANDREAS
                        I would be eternally grateful if 
                        you never raise your voice to me 
                        again.

                                 TYLER
                        I’ll raise my voice-- I’ll raise my 
                        voice because it’s my house!  So if 
                        you’re here to rob me, then rob me.  
                        Take the cereal.  Take all of it! 
                             (moving forward)
                        But if you break into a man’s 
                        house, and wave a gun, you better 
                        be ready to shoot somebody.

                                 ANDREAS
                             (thinks about it)
                        You’re absolutely right.

           Andreas draws his GUN and SHOOTS Tyler in the chest.  Tyler 
           looks down at his chest and sees the back end of TRANQUILIZER 
           sticking out.  He slumps to the floor.  Tyler’s stunned, 
           dazed, and struggling for air.

                                 ANDREAS (CONT’D)
                        We’ve got five hours before he’s 
                        useless.  Let’s not waste time.  

           Andreas and Malik work quickly -- well rehearsed -- ignoring 
           Tyler for the most part.  

           Malik pulls out a body bag and zips it open, laying it beside 
           Tyler.  Andreas moves to the scanner by the front door.  
           Andreas talks into the intercom.

                                 ANDREAS (CONT’D)
                        Tyler Kirkland.  Number 178342.  
                        I’m using my 24 hour leave pass.

           Andreas pulls out papers from inside his jacket, presses it 
           against the scanner, and waits.

                                 ANDREAS (CONT’D)
                             (to Malik)
                        Is he dead yet?

           Malik looks Tyler over.

                                 MALIK
                        Almost.

           Andreas turns back to the scanner.  It’s taking too long.
                                 ANDREAS
                        Come on, come on.

           CLICK.  The door unlocks.  Andreas and Malik lift Tyler into 
           the body bag.

           TYLER’S P.O.V.

           Andreas leans in close.

                                 ANDREAS (CONT’D)
                        You go to a better place my friend.

           Andreas zips the body bag shut.

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Andreas and Malik haul the body bag stuffed with Tyler.  
           Turning the corner is...

           A PATROL TRUCK,

           Heavily armored -- slowing down in front of Andreas and 
           Malik.  Autocannons slide out from the side of the truck.  
           Andreas hands over the proper forms through an open window.

                                 ANDREAS
                        I have papers.  For body disposal.

           Inside the truck, a low growl can be heard, then a SLAM 
           against the truck door.  Whatever’s inside is big, and pissed 
           off.

           The autocannons are still trained on Malik and Andreas.  If 
           there’s a thought to run, now would be the time.  The 
           autocannons slide back inside, and the patrol truck speeds 
           off.

                                 MALIK
                        Yeah.  That wasn’t stressful.

           INT. SPANISH BODEGA - LATER

           Andreas and Malik walk inside, hauling Tyler’s body bag.  
           They approach a SPANISH WOMAN, early 60’s, standing behind 
           the register.  

                                 ANDREAS
                        Senorita, I was wondering if you 
                        could offer a weary traveler a bit 
                        of direction.
           The woman checks the video monitor.  The last customer has 
           left.

                                 SPANISH WOMAN
                        Depends on where you want to go.

                                 ANDREAS
                        Second avenue.

                                 SPANISH WOMAN
                        Aisle three.  By the pineapple 
                        chunks.

           Andreas and Malik carry the body bag down aisle three and 
           stop midway.  Malik looks up to the video camera and nods.  
           Andreas backs away as the floor sides back, revealing a 
           stairwell leading down to a tunnel.  

           Malik grabs two bottles of water from the refrigerator and 
           tosses one to Andreas.

                                 MALIK
                        Stay hydrated.  We got a three hour 
                        walk ahead of us.

           They climb down the stairs, heading into the darkness of the 
           tunnel below.

                                                                CUT TO:

           TYLER’S BODY BAG,

           SLAMMING down on a cold steel table.  The bag is unzipped, 
           exposing Tyler’s corpse.  PULL BACK to find ourselves in a...

           RED BRICK ROOM

           Algae clings to the walls from years of unreported leaks.  
           Water seeps through cracks in the mortar.  A seemingly 
           perfect place to stash a corpse. 

           A DOCTOR stands over Tyler.  He holds a SYRINGE filled with 
           thick bile like fluid.  He SLAMS the syringe into Tyler’s 
           chest, then squeezes down on the plunger.  The doctor backs 
           away from the table, and waits.

           Nothing.  Tyler is motionless.  The doctor leans in to take 
           his pulse when--

           TYLER SPRINGS UP.  Coughing.  Gasping for breath. 
                                 FEMALE VOICE
                        I know.  It feels like you’re 
                        drowning.  But it will pass.  Take 
                        in the air.  Deep breaths.   
                        Oxygenate your body.

           Tyler takes in the oxygen.  Finally, he’s able to regulate 
           his breathing.  The doctor is gone.  In his place is...

           KRISTEN,

           The woman he slept with -- standing there. 

                                 KRISTEN
                        You have questions.

           Tyler just stares at her.  Where do you even begin?

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        The hardware in your apartment.  
                        It’s a stand alone.  In order to 
                        hack in and create a fake 24 hour 
                        pass, I had to physically be there.

                                 TYLER
                        You slept with me to get into my 
                        apartment?

                                 KRISTEN
                        I didn’t have to sleep with you.

                                 TYLER
                        So you had a little extra time to 
                        kill.  Guess it was my lucky day.

           That stung Kristen more than she expected.  Kristen turns, 
           walking out the rusted over steel door.  Tyler stays seated, 
           not sure what to do.  Kristen sticks her head back in the 
           room.

                                 KRISTEN
                        You might want to stay close.

           Tyler gets up.  His body’s still sore from the ordeal.  But 
           he’s on his feet, following Kristen out to...

           THE TUNNEL,

           In a state of collapse.  RATS gather by pools of stagnate 
           water.  Tyler and Kristen stand in the middle of twisted 
           train tracks that lead to nowhere.
                                 TYLER
                        What is this place?

                                 KRISTEN
                        You’re standing in the most famous 
                        thing that's never been built in 
                        New York City.  The 2nd Avenue 
                        subway system.  The city started 
                        construction, but ran out of money 
                        leaving eight and a half miles of 
                        unfinished tunnel and track.  

           Kristen opens a steel door off to the side of the tunnel.  

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        And then there are a few of our 
                        added touches.

           Tyler follows Kristen through the door to...

           INT. OPERATIONS CENTER - TUNNEL - LATER

           A monitor covers a large portion of the wall.  Men and woman 
           scramble around from workstation to workstation.  There’s a 
           busy, but positive energy here.  

           Kristen watches Tyler wander about, soaking it all in.  Tyler 
           stops at a workstation, staring into the monitors capturing 
           video of an abandoned store.

                                 KRISTEN
                        That’s a Duane Reade on 57th and 
                        Broadway.  We’re piped into 
                        security cameras from the seaport, 
                        to as far as 145th street.  Some 
                        parts of Queens, Brooklyn--

           Tyler looks up at the two-way glass overlooking the command 
           center from above.

                                 TYLER
                        Who’s behind the glass?

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - OPERATIONS CENTER 

           Tyler and Kristen walk in to find MEN and WOMEN seated at the 
           conference room table.  Kristen takes a seat beside Malik and 
           Andreas.  You get the sense that anyone important in this 
           tunnel is seated at this table.
                                 TYLER
                             (points at Andreas)
                        That’s the man who shot me.

                                 ANDREAS
                             (pointing to Malik)
                        He stole your cereal.

                                 MALIK
                             (shrugs; not giving a 
                              shit)
                        What can I say?  I go cuckoo for 
                        Coco Puffs. 

           On the table is an old SLIDE PROJECTOR.  We haven’t seen one 
           of these since the 6th grade.  There’s also a screen set up 
           at the far end of the room.  At the head of the table sits...

           MAYOR GADDEN

           In his 50’s.  There’s something acutely parental about him.  
           His voice is powerful and conveys a presence to be respected.

                                 TYLER
                        Mayor Gadden? 

                                 MAYOR GADDEN
                        I can see the questions swirling 
                        around in your head.  What I can 
                        tell you is that everyone in this 
                        room is a friend, despite our 
                        methods of bringing you down here.

                                 TYLER
                        Why am I here?

                                 MAYOR GADDEN
                        We have an opportunity that I would 
                        like to share with you.

           Mayor Gadden fires up the old projector.  CLICK.  The slide 
           shuffles.  An image appears.  It’s a bird’s eye view of the 
           alien mothership. 

                                 MAYOR GADDEN (CONT’D)
                        These came from Quickbird and 
                        IKONOS commercial satellites before 
                        they went dark.  It’s their command 
                        and communication center.  Their 
                        entire arsenal, all their warships 
                        are housed in this one location.  
                        This is the head of the snake.  A 
                        successful strike against the 
                        mothership changes everything.  
                                 TYLER
                        I fought in the war.  We hit them 
                        with everything we had, and we 
                        didn’t make a dent.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        That’s because you didn’t know how 
                        to throw a punch.

           Everyone turns to the oldest man in the room.  ERWIN KANDEL, 
           Austrian, 60’s.  

           The slide changes again, and again.  It’s an extreme close-up 
           of the mothership’s surface.  Tyler focuses on the dark, 
           grainy oval shaped section of the ship.  Erwin stares up at 
           the photo of the crack as if this was the most beautiful 
           thing in existence.

                                 TYLER
                        What is that?

                                 MAYOR GADDEN
                        That, is a crack.

                                 TYLER
                        A crack.

                                 ERWIN
                        Twelve years ago, we didn’t know 
                        its weak spot.  Now we do.  The 
                        crack on that ship is alive.  It 
                        breathes.  It wants to grow, spread 
                        out.  How it grows is called crack 
                        propagation.  In this, I am an 
                        expert.

                                 TYLER
                        Crack propagation.

           Erwin picks up an empty glass from the table. 

                                 ERWIN
                        There are two forces at work.  
                        Energy that wants to protect the 
                        glass, and energy that longs to 
                        destroy it.  When the stress 
                        intensity factor reaches the 
                        fracture toughness of the 
                        material...

           Erwin slams the glass on the table just enough to cause a 
           small sliver of a crack.
                                 ERWIN (CONT’D)
                        This is their ship.    

           Erwin grabs a pitcher of water-- pours it into the glass.  
           The water holds.

                                 ERWIN (CONT’D)
                        See there?  It’s just enough energy 
                        to keep hold.  But the crack, it 
                        wants to spread.  It needs more 
                        energy and force to create new 
                        crack surfaces.  If not, it will 
                        arrest, seemingly dead unless...

           Erwin slams the glass down on the table.  Glass and water 
           spill everywhere.

                                 ERWIN (CONT’D)
                        We need more force.

                                 MAYOR GADDEN
                        You drill in an area rich with 
                        U235.

                                 TYLER
                        U235.  Jesus.  You’re after the 
                        uranium?  Is that what’s happening 
                        here?  You’re making a nuclear 
                        weapon.

                                 ERWIN
                        Make one?  We already have one.  
                        All we need is the uranium.

                                 TYLER
                        Steal the uranium -- from them?

                                 ERWIN
                        Technically, it’s our uranium.

                                 TYLER
                        It’s a suicide mission.

                                 ERWIN
                        They use the uranium to fortify 
                        their ships.  We can use that same 
                        uranium to blow them out of the 
                        sky.  

                                 TYLER
                        You’re not listening to me--
                                 ERWIN
                        --You work in the mines.  You have 
                        access.  You were also a solider.  
                        There’s no one more suited to carry 
                        out this mission.

                                 TYLER
                        Do you have any idea how much 
                        uranium you’re talking about?  It 
                        took 141 pounds of uranium to arm 
                        Little Boy in Hiroshima. 

                                 ERWIN
                        Our science has gotten that number 
                        down to eleven ounces.  A much more 
                        manageable amount, wouldn’t you 
                        agree?

                                 TYLER
                        I’m just supposed to breeze through 
                        the decom center with uranium in my 
                        pocket.

                                 MAYOR GADDEN
                        No.  That would be impossible.  
                        You’re going to have to swallow it. 

                                 TYLER
                        Swallow uranium?  You know what 
                        will happen if--

                                 MAYOR GADDEN
                        You’ll be dead by morning.

           Tyler looks around at the faces in the room.

                                 TYLER
                        You’re crazy.  All of you.

                                 ERWIN
                        There’s an extraction process 
                        you’ll have to go through.  The 
                        uranium is removed from your blood 
                        supply.  Think of it like dialysis.  
                        The blood is cleansed.  The 
                        pollutants are removed.  Same thing 
                        here.

                                 MAYOR GADDEN
                        You’ll go to work just like any 
                        other day.  You will take the 
                        uranium only at the end of your 
                        shift.  The decom center will not 
                        detect the uranium in your blood.

                                 MAYOR GADDEN (CONT'D)
                        Our people will meet you and 
                        immediately bring you back for 
                        extraction.  From there, we’ll take 
                        it the rest of the way.

                                 TYLER
                        Where are you taking it?

                                 MALIK
                        None of your business.  You just 
                        bring us the shit.

                                 MAYOR GADDEN
                        We have to be realistic.  Do you 
                        think we’re the first planet to be 
                        pillaged by them?  Judging by their 
                        attack methods and organization, 
                        most likely not.  And then comes 
                        the question that must be asked.  
                        The question that keeps us all 
                        awake at night.  What will they do 
                        when they’re done robbing us of our 
                        natural resources?  Do you really 
                        think they’ll let us live?

           Mayor Gadden gets up and walks over to Tyler.  He sits in the 
           empty seat beside him.

                                 MAYOR GADDEN (CONT’D)
                        I know how you fought for your 
                        country in the war.  I know what 
                        happened to your wife and child.  
                        If you remember me, then you 
                        remember my family, yes?  

           Tyler nods.

                                 MAYOR GADDEN (CONT’D)
                        They took my world, and then they 
                        took my world.  I know how living 
                        can feel like a curse.  The fire 
                        that must be burning inside of you.  
                        The anger.  The deep, insufferable 
                        pain.  I’ve felt it all.  It’s what 
                        keeps me alive.  What’s keeping you 
                        alive?  

           Mayor Gadden has Tyler thinking.

                                 MAYOR GADDEN (CONT’D)
                        You do this, and we have a real 
                        chance at taking our world back.

                                 MAYOR GADDEN (CONT’D)
                        You once took an oath -- to defend 
                        the constitution of the United 
                        States against all enemies, foreign 
                        and domestic.  I’m asking you to be 
                        a solider once again.

                                 TYLER
                             (a beat)
                        I do this -- I do this, and you’ll 
                        get the uranium out of me?

                                 MAYOR GADDEN
                        You have my word.

           Tyler nods his yes.  Mayor Gadden gives a look to Kristen.  
           She walks over to Tyler.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        I’m sorry.

           In one quick motion, Kristen jabs a syringe into Tyler’s arm.  
           She leans down to a weakening Tyler and whispers:

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                             (sincere)
                        Thank you.

           Tyler’s eyes roll up as he blacks out.

           DARKNESS

           Lights begin to dot the dark, forming into a fuzzy image of a 
           galaxy.  

           PULL BACK to see we’re in...

           INT. TYLER’S APARTMENT - SON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Tyler opens his eyes.  He’s face up on the carpet, staring up 
           at the painted universe on the ceiling.  On TV, Tyler’s son 
           resumes his role in the school production of The Wizard of 
           Oz.

           INT. FERRY - DAY

           Tyler sits in back of the submerged ferry.  His mind’s 
           racing.  
           INT. DRILLERS STATION - DAY

           Tyler mans the controls as he drills into the rock.  He spots 
           something churning with the sandstone.  He studies it 
           closely.  Yes, it’s URANIUM.  Tyler scans the lighted field 
           filled with manned rigs.  Everyone’s working.  No one’s 
           watching.

           Tyler guides the robotic arm to the chunk of uranium.  He 
           picks it up, guiding it towards him.  He presses a button, 
           opening an INCUBATOR below the rig.  

           The rock scrapes against the chest of the rig.  The 
           SCREECHING sound of rock against metal reverberates.  

           Tyler does a quick check to the other drill workers in their 
           rigs across the field.  No one heard.

           Tyler continues on.  He guides the robotic arm, depositing 
           the uranium into the incubator.  Tyler talks into a console 
           receiver.

                                 TYLER
                        Set the melting point to 2070 
                        degrees Fahrenheit. 

           Tyler watches as the uranium changes from solid to liquid.  
           He looks up at a passing SPACE CRAFT.  No one’s noticing.  

           Tyler slides his hands into a pair of gloves attached to the 
           incubator.  He takes a vial, filling it with liquid uranium. 

           INT. DRILL STATION - HALLWAY - LATER

           Tyler speed walks down the hall, keeping his head down.  

           He dips into the...

           INT. BATHROOM

           Tyler checks out the bathroom, making sure all the stalls are 
           empty.  He stands in front of the mirror.  He’s deep in it 
           now.  

           Tyler pulls out the vial of uranium and holds it out over the 
           sink of running water.  His hand tilts the vial, in the 
           process of pouring the uranium down the drain when he shuts 
           off the water.  

           He finds himself in the mirror again.  Tyler summons up every 
           bit of courage he has, then downs the vial of uranium.
           Tyler splashes water on his face.  He raises back up to the 
           mirror to find Dexter standing behind him.  Tyler swings 
           around, concealing the empty vial in his hand.

                                 TYLER
                        Dexter--

                                 DEXTER
                        Thought you might want to ride back 
                        together.  

           If Dexter saw something, you won’t read it in his eyes.  

                                 TYLER
                        No.  You go ahead.

                                 DEXTER
                        Okay.  See you tomorrow?

           Tyler gives Dexter a tight nod.  

           Dexter exits.  Tyler takes a moment and gets his shit 
           together.

           INT. DECONTAMINATION CENTER - LATER

           Tyler stands in line, calmly tossing his clothes into a bin 
           as he goes through the showers.  Sensors flash, scanning his 
           body while powerful water jets burn his skin with chemicals.  

           Tyler looks up to the...

           MONITOR

           Scanning Tyler’s body.  The monitor stops as if it picking up 
           a bad reading.  Tyler stands there -- helpless and unarmed.  
           It feels like forever until the scan resumes its course up 
           his body and posts the results:

           CLEAR.

           INT. FERRY - LATER

           Tyler is a ball of nervous energy as the ferry docks at the 
           pier.  He notices the PASSENGERS are all whispering, looking 
           out the window.  

           Tyler moves to a window seat and looks out to find an army of 
           ALIEN HUMANOIDS gathered at the pier. 
           EXT. DOCK - PIER  

           Tyler stands in line.  Everyone keeps their heads down.  
           That’s the routine.  PAN ACROSS the row of frightened men.  A 
           shadow crosses their faces, stopping at Tyler.

           Tyler looks up to find...

           DEXTER

           A Judas.  Eyes filled with tears.  Standing with an alien 
           humanoid.

                                 TYLER
                        What did you do?

                                 DEXTER
                        The war’s over.  We have to stay on 
                        the winning side.

           The alien humanoid pulls Tyler off the line, taking him away. 

                                 DEXTER (CONT’D)
                        Where are you taking him?  I asked 
                        that he not be hurt!

           Dexter reaches out and grabs the shoulder of the alien 
           officer.  Wrong move.  

           The alien turns around.  Its dark eyes locked on Dexter.  
           Then in one motion, a sickening THUD.  The churning of flesh.

                                 TYLER
                        Dexter!!!

           Dexter’s body is tossed off the pier and into the water.  
           Tyler watches his friend float away as he’s dragged off.

           INT. BUS

           A human DRIVER behind the wheel.  Exhausted and dirty.  His 
           hands and feet are chained, keeping him behind the wheel.  
           The BUS is packed with DETAINEES.  Everyone has a similar 
           look of fear and despair in their eyes.

           Sitting at the back of the bus is Tyler.  He watches a MAN 
           administer last rites to two ELDERLY WOMEN.  He signs the 
           cross, then moves up the row.  Tyler looks out the window to 
           the...
           EXT. UNITED NATIONS - DAY

           Half of the dome is gone, like a bitten off apple.  The rest 
           of the structure is torched and coated with ash, but still 
           standing.  A caravan of buses pulls up.  Tyler exits the bus 
           with the rest of the DETAINEES. 

           Tyler looks up to the blown out windows of the UN Secretariat 
           Building.  He spots a side door to the complex.  PRISONERS 
           form a line, tossing bodies into an old SANITATION TRUCK.

           INT. UNITED NATIONS - GENERAL ASSEMBLY HALL 

           Insanity.   

           Tyler moves through the assembly hall which once held the 
           delegates of the 192 member states, now a massive holding pen 
           that stinks of piss and death.  Tyler takes in the images: 
           Men and women crammed together.  Crying.  Praying.

                                 TYLER
                        Christ.

           Doors open.  Humans cower and scream as alien guards push 
           through the crowd, pulling humans out of the hall.  One of 
           them is heading straight towards Tyler.  

           They drag Tyler out -- up the stairs and into the...

           INT. HALLWAY - UNITED NATIONS

           Tyler walks down the long hallway, prodded along by the alien 
           humanoid.

           Up ahead, down this long hallway are the gut wrenching sounds 
           of SCREAMING -- voices begging for their lives.  Tyler know’s 
           he’s walking the mile -- each foot closer to certain death.  

           A LOW RUMBLE stops everyone in their tracks.  Before anyone 
           has a chance to process what happened-- 

           BOOM.  

           The hallway walls are blown out by an EXPLOSION.  The force 
           knocks Tyler to the floor.  The hall is filled with smoke and 
           flame.  An alien humanoid runs down the hallway on FIRE.  

           Hell breaks loose as DETAINEES burst out into the hallway 
           from the General Assembly Hall.  Some are tackled by the 
           alien humanoids.  Others are escaping through the gaping hole 
           in the wall.
           Tyler gets to his feet and follows the crowd out.  He’s 
           tackled from behind by an alien.  It SMASHES Tyler’s face 
           into the ground.  The beast flashes its teeth, ready to 
           devour.  Tyler whips his leg around, connecting to the 
           alien’s jaw, knocking it to the ground.  

           The alien tries to rise up.  Tyler punts it in the face.  
           Tyler makes a run for it when another explosion goes off, 
           knocking him against the wall, then down to the floor. 

           Up ahead, alien humanoids are running across the top of the 
           rotunda dome, chasing down escaped detainees.  Several more 
           aliens are coming down the stairs in Tyler’s direction.  
           Tyler gets to his feet.  He runs out of the exit and into...

           EXT. CONCOURSE - UNITED NATIONS - SAME

           A mine field of human bodies on the ground.  

           Tyler looks up across the street to the roof of a building.  
           There’s a human on the roof -- armed with a ROCKET LAUNCHER.  
           He FIRES at the building.

           Tyler hits the ground.  A PATROL TRUCK, similar to the 
           heavily armored vehicle that stopped Malik and Andreas 
           earlier races down the street.  The truck pulls up beside 
           Tyler.  The side door opens.  It’s Malik.  

                                 MALIK
                        Get on your feet!

           Tyler looks up at Malik, dazed and stunned.  Malik has no 
           time for this shit.  He gets out and yanks Tyler into the 
           truck.

           INT. PATROL TRUCK

           Malik gets behind the wheel.  Floors it.  Kristen’s riding 
           shotgun.  Tyler’s in the back of the patrol truck.  His hands 
           are shaking.

                                 KRISTEN
                        My God.  You drank it.

                                 TYLER
                        Get this poison out of me.

                                 KRISTEN
                        I’m going to give you a shot of 
                        sodium citrate.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KRISTEN (CONT'D)
                        It will help stabilize the uranium 
                        in your bloodstream until we get 
                        back underground.  Okay?

           Kristen reaches into her black MEDICAL BAG -- the kind with 
           the white cross etched on the side.  She pulls out a needle -- 
           flicks it -- then jabs it into Tyler. 

           EXT. 72ND & CENTRAL PARK WEST - DAY

           The patrol truck pulls over at the 72nd street entryway to 
           the park.  Tyler and Kristen climb out.  The trees are dead, 
           and draped with grey ash.  

           Across the street is THE DAKOTA.  A chunk of the building has 
           been blasted away.  

           Malik is busy covering the patrol truck in shrubs and 
           camouflage tarp.  Tyler’s attention turns to a clearing thick 
           with dead leaves.  

           Tyler walks the few feet to the clearing.  He kneels down and 
           brushes away the leaves, revealing a single word...

           IMAGINE.

           Malik pulls back a STEEL GRATE, exposing an entrance to the 
           subway system below.  

                                 MALIK
                        Time to go.

           Tyler looks around at the remains of Strawberry Fields, 
           putting it all to memory, then turns to join Malik and 
           Kristen.  One by one, they climb down through the steel 
           grate.

           INT. SUBWAY TRACKS 

           Tyler, Kristen, and Malik walk the tunnel waist deep in 
           water.  Tyler trudges through the water, ahead of the pack, 
           isolating himself.  Kristen catches up to him.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Hey.

           Tyler doesn’t respond.

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        Are you giving me the bubble?
                                 TYLER
                        I’m “giving you the bubble?”

                                 KRISTEN
                        You remember.  Grade school -- you 
                        put the bubble on someone and it’s 
                        like, I’m trying to talk, but no 
                        one can hear me, because I’m in the 
                        bubble.

                                 TYLER
                        The bubble.  I like that.  Yeah.  
                        I’m giving you the bubble.

           Tyler picks up the pace.  Kristen’s keeping up.

                                 KRISTEN
                        You know it’s a bad idea shutting 
                        out the woman whose job is to keep 
                        you alive.

                                 TYLER
                        No, sleeping with you was a bad 
                        idea!  I wouldn’t be here if I 
                        didn’t sleep with you. 

                                 MALIK
                        You might want to ease up on the 
                        girl.

                                 TYLER
                        Fuck the both of you.

           Tyler speeds up, leaving Malik and Kristen behind.

           INT. TUNNEL - LATER

           Andreas stands watch, shotgun at the ready in front of a 
           steel door.  Something’s moving in the darkness of the 
           tunnel.  Andreas points his shotgun and flashlight to find 
           Tyler and the group approaching

                                 ANDREAS
                             (to Malik)
                        What took you so long?

                                 MALIK
                        You don’t want to know. 

           They all enter...
           INT. RED BRICK ROOM

           Along with Tyler and the group are TWO DOCTORS and Mayor 
           Gadden.  Hanging overhead are FOUR METALLIC COILS strapped to 
           an intimidating apparatus.  In the center of the machinery is 
           an oversized centrifuge.

                                 MAYOR GADDEN
                             (to Tyler)
                        You remember how the extraction 
                        works.  Blood goes in.  The uranium 
                        is separated--

                                 TYLER
                             (cutting him off)
                        --Just get this shit out of me.

           Mayor Gadden gives a nod to the doctors.  Tyler lays down, 
           positioning himself under the four metallic coils dangling 
           from the rack above Tyler.  

           The coils begin to slink down, ready to plunge into his chest 
           when...

           BOOM.

           The walls shake.  Everyone trades concerned looks.

                                 ANDREAS
                             (to Malik)
                        Were you followed?

                                 MALIK
                        No.
                             (unsure)
                        No.

           Another explosion rocks the tunnel.  Then comes the 
           SCREAMING.

                                 MAYOR GADDEN
                        Everyone get--

           BOOM.

           The explosion brings down the ceiling, covering everyone in 
           falling debris.  Even the camera is buried under the rubble.

           In the darkness, the whistling sound of ALARMS can be heard.

           A FLASHLIGHT comes on.  It’s held by Malik, covered in soot.  
           He scans the ground with the light, searching for life, 
           stumbling in the dark.
                                 MALIK
                        Tyler!

           The flashlight scans across the flipped over operating table, 
           then to the twisted metal and coil, popping with sparks -- 
           hardly recognizable as the extraction machine.  

           Malik flashes his light on the two doctors, now dead.  He 
           finds Andreas and Kristen wobbling to their feet.  Malik 
           takes a step forward, then trips.  He angles his flashlight 
           down on Mayor Gadden’s lifeless body -- eyes open and empty -- 
           buried under rock.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        Oh my God!

           Kristen rushes to Gadden, trying desperately to revive him.

                                 MALIK
                        He’s gone.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        We have to help him.

                                 MALIK
                        He’s gone!

                                 ANDREAS
                        Over here!

           Malik turns his flashlight, finding Tyler on the ground. 

                                 KRISTEN
                        Tyler!

           Kristen and Andreas get Tyler up on his feet.  Tyler gets his 
           bearings, taking in the devastation around him.

                                 TYLER
                        No.

           The group steps over the bodies, stumbling out to...

           INT. TUNNEL

           From the far end of the tunnel come SURVIVORS.  A man, 
           clothes filled with soot -- bleeding from his ears.  A woman, 
           blood soaked and dazed.

                                 ANDREAS
                             (to Kristen)
                        You have your medical bag?
           Kristen’s too shaken up to answer.

                                 ANDREAS (CONT’D)
                        Kristen!  Your medical bag!

                                 KRISTEN
                             (getting it together)
                        Yes.  I have it.

                                 MALIK
                        We have supplies waiting for us at 
                        the ride.

                                 TYLER
                        Wait.  What’s happening?

                                 ANDREAS
                        What do you think is happening?  
                        They’re here.  We have to move.  
                        And you’re coming with us.

           Malik offers his shotgun to Tyler, but he doesn’t take it.

                                 MALIK
                        Take the fucking shotgun!

           BOOM.  Another explosion at the far end of the tunnel.  Tyler 
           takes the shotgun from Malik.

                                 ANDREAS
                        Let’s move!

           Malik and Andreas lead the way.

           INT. TRAIN TRACKS - TUNNEL - LATER

           Tyler walks with Malik, Kristen, and Andreas.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        I don’t hear the screaming anymore.

           Everyone is quiet.  They know what the silence means.  
           Andreas flashes his light upwards, illuminating a STEEL GRATE 
           above them.

                                 MALIK
                        We’re here.

           Tyler moves to the ladder.  Andreas cuts him off as he moves 
           up the ladder, climbing up to...
           INT. PENN STATION - WAITING AREA

           Abandoned.  It’s raining indoors.  That’s because the roof is 
           partially gone.  

           Surrounding the area are stairs leading to different tracks.  
           Andreas focuses on the stairs at the far corner.  Kristen, 
           Malik and Tyler climb up through the grate.

                                 ANDREAS
                             (points)
                        Track nine.  That’s us.

           Andreas moves towards the gate when Kristen grabs him by the 
           arm.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Wait.  I heard something. 

           Andreas looks up to the rain pouring in from the hole in the 
           roof.

                                 ANDREAS
                        It’s just the rain.

                                 MALIK
                        Right.

           Malik lights up a FLARE, tossing it down the steps of track 
           9.  Everyone waits and listens.  Along with the drops of rain 
           comes another sound.  Breathing.  The sick whining of an 
           animal not from our world.  There’s sound and movement all 
           around them.

           Kristen angles her flashlight towards...

           TRACK 9

           Rising up the stairs is the wet, hairless, muscular frame of 
           an ALIEN DOG -- pissed off.  Kristen pulls out her shotgun, 
           aiming a shaky hand at the alien dog.  

                                 ANDREAS
                        Shoot it!

           The dog starts running towards the group, slipping and 
           sliding across the wet floor in an all out charge.

                                 ANDREAS (CONT’D)
                        Kristen!!!
           Malik aims his gun and SHOOTS, sending the alien dog flying 
           back down the stairs.  The echo reverberates throughout the 
           station.

           A low growl can be heard from all corners of the terminal as 
           more grotesque hounds climb up the stairs From TRACK 7... 
           TRACK 8... TRACK 11... 12... 13.  Moving in from all sides-- 
           flanking the group.  

           Tyler pulls out a shotgun.  

                                 TYLER
                        Let’s go!

           The group makes a break towards track 9.  Tyler aims at a 
           rushing dog from track 4, BOOM.  Tyler spins around, not 
           wasting a single bullet.

           BOOM.... BOOM... BOOM.

           Blowing away dogs at track 11, then 12.  We see just how good 
           a solider Tyler is.  

           Malik joins in, taking out the dogs in tracks 7 and 8.  An 
           alien dog is sneaking up on Kristen from behind when Andreas 
           fires.  

           BOOM.  The now dead dog slides across the floor, stopping at 
           Kristen’s feet minus a jaw.  

           Tyler and the group descend down the steps of...

           TRACK NINE

           Malik, Kristen, Andreas and Tyler proceed with caution.  Guns 
           ready.  Tyler stops, staring ahead in disbelief.

                                 MALIK
                        Nice ride, ain’t it?

           Sitting on the tracks, just waiting for them is...

           A DIESEL LOCOMOTIVE

           No electricity needed for this train.

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                        And me without my choo choo hat.
           INT. CONDUCTOR’S CAR

           Tyler, Malik, Andreas and Kristen are all aboard.  Andreas 
           has a MAP out.

                                 TYLER
                        Where are we going?

                                 ANDREAS
                        I’ll tell you after you put down 
                        the shotgun.

                                 TYLER
                        How about you tell me where I’m 
                        going, and then I’ll decide what to 
                        do with the shotgun.

           Malik and Andreas trade looks.  It’s better that Tyler knows.

                                 MALIK
                        Before the war, there were nine 
                        bases armed with nuclear weapons.  
                        After the war, we have confirmation 
                        that all but one base was taken 
                        out.  The Westmoreland Air Force 
                        Base in Pennsylvania.  That’s where 
                        we’re going.

                                 TYLER
                        Pennsylvania.

                                 MALIK
                        Once we get to the base,  
                        STRATCOM's Task Force will extract 
                        the uranium from your body, process 
                        it into enriched uranium, then load 
                        it into a W-78 thermonuclear 
                        warhead.  We’ll blow those bastards 
                        out of the sky with the force 
                        equivalent to 500,000 tons of TNT. 

                                 TYLER
                        Do you have any idea what’s between 
                        us and Pennsylvania?  Do you know 
                        what’s out there?

           Andreas gets in Tyler’s face.  He wants Tyler staring at the 
           burned flesh on his cheek.

                                 ANDREAS
                        I know exactly what’s out there. 

                                 MALIK
                        Guys--
                                 ANDREAS
                        Let me make it clear -- you’re 
                        dying.  Not in 50 years, or six 
                        months.  You’re down to hours.  A 
                        day -- maybe two.  The injections 
                        Kristen gave you are only 
                        prolonging what will be a painful 
                        death.  Once the medicine runs out, 
                        you will begin to feel ill.  
                        Feverish.  You’ll lose kidney 
                        function.  Your organs will begin 
                        to shut down.  You’ll lose 
                        consciousness, and then you’ll be 
                        dead.  So if you want to live 
                        through this, you better lose that 
                        fucking attitude of yours and pray 
                        that we make the 350 miles to the 
                        base.

           Tyler glares at Andreas.  Blinks.  Something in his 
           expression shifts.

                                 TYLER
                        Is that right?

           Tyler lifts his gun, pointing it in Andreas’ direction.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                             (calmly)
                        Get down on the floor.  Slowly.  Do 
                        it.

           Andreas drops down to the floor, revealing an alien behind 
           him in the window.  Tyler FIRES, blowing out the window,  
           missing the alien as it scampers up to the roof of the train.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Floor this thing now!!!

           There’s POUNDING on the roof.  The force crushes the train 
           ceiling inward.  More beasts appear at the window.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                             (to Kristen)
                        Cover your ears.

           Kristen covers her ears -- a stationary target as the fire 
           fight goes on around her.  Tyler SHOOTS, taking out an alien.  
           Andreas takes out the other one.  How they don’t end up 
           shooting Kristen in the crossfire is a small miracle.   

                                 MALIK
                             (looking up ahead)
                        Oh damn.
           There’s at least a DOZEN ALIENS standing in the middle of the 
           tracks.

                                 TYLER
                        Keep going!!!

           THE TRAIN

           Moving faster... 

           ...faster -- SMASHING into the pack of aliens.  The one alien 
           not crushed flies through the windshield and into the cramped 
           conductor’s booth with the group.  

           Malik wrestles with the alien, trying to level the gun at its 
           head for a kill shot.  The hell with it.  Malik grabs the 
           alien and snaps its neck.

           An alien on the roof reaches in through the window, grabbing 
           Andreas.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Andreas!

           Tyler reaches for Andreas’ leg.  Too late.  The beast pulls 
           Andreas out the window and up to the roof of the train.

           Tyler grabs his SHOTGUN and climbs out of the window.  Malik 
           yanks him back in.

                                 MALIK
                        What are you doing!?

                                 TYLER
                        Saving your friend.

                                 MALIK
                        He’s expendable!  You’re not.

           An ugly thing to say, but true.

                                 TYLER
                        You want your friend to die, then 
                        stop me.

           Malik stands there in a moment of human frailty and weakness.  
           He shouldn’t let this happen, but he does.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Malik?

           Tyler climbs out the window.
                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        Tyler, no!

           EXT. TRAIN

           Andreas is being dragged across the roof by the alien.  Tyler 
           SHOOTS the alien, but it’s not a kill shot.  Strike one.  

           The alien charges at Tyler, still dragging Andreas along like 
           an animal hanging onto its food.  Tyler fires, but looses his 
           balance and misses.  Strike two.  

           Time for one last shot.  Tyler FIRES, but jerks the shot, 
           missing badly.  The alien throws a shoulder block into Tyler, 
           knocking him down.  The alien flashes its teeth, ready to dig 
           in.  

           Andreas knocks the alien off Tyler.  The train takes a sharp 
           turn sending Andreas and the alien off the side of the train.  

           Tyler grabs Andreas with one hand while letting go of his 
           shotgun -- grabbing a steel bar running across the train 
           roof.

           It gets worse.  They missed the last alien hiding on the side 
           of the train.  The alien moves in.  Tyler’s losing his grip 
           on Andreas.  The alien humanoid is about to pounce when...

           BOOM... BOOM.  The alien is blown across the roof, falling 
           over the side of the train.  

           Tyler looks up to find...

           KRISTEN,

           Standing over Tyler.  Angry.  Scared.  The shotgun shaking in 
           her hand.

           EXT. TRAIN - LATER

           The train races towards the light at the end of the tunnel, 
           and into...

           EXT. NEW JERSEY - DAY

           Burned down houses.  The surrounding trees are scorched.  
           Smoke hovers in the sky from fires in the distance.  And on 
           the ground, the rigid remains of HUMANS in various states of 
           decay -- their narrow frames too small for their clothes.  
           Hair grey with ash.  
           Other bodies are burrowed in the rubble.  A hand extends up 
           to the heavens.

           INT. TRAIN

           Tyler and the group stare out the window.  The landscape is 
           an above-ground cemetery now.  

           Tyler’s seen enough.  He moves to the back of the conductor’s 
           car and sits against the wall.  Malik turns to Andreas.

                                 MALIK
                        I said you were expendable.

                                 ANDREAS
                        I am, and so are you.

                                 MALIK
                        That man risked his ass for you up 
                        there.

                                 ANDREAS
                        We were lucky.  He almost died up 
                        there.   

           Andreas looks over at Tyler on the floor.  There’s a hint of 
           newfound respect in his eyes, and yet...

                                 ANDREAS (CONT’D)
                        Don’t let it happen again.

           EXT. TRAIN - LATER

           The train picks up speed, moving past the power plants and 
           power lines that dot the landscape.  Kristen sits out on the 
           caboose, away from the men inside.

           INT. TRAIN

           Andreas is running the train.  Malik sits against the wall 
           across from Tyler.  

                                 MALIK
                        You know, they’re gonna write up 
                        all new history books about this.  
                        Kids gonna open it up.  Page one, 
                        chapter one’s gonna have my smiling 
                        mug.  A hero.  Go out on a date-- 
                        girl asks me what I do.  I’m 
                        tellin’ her I saved the world.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Tell me I’m not getting laid after 
                        that. 

           Tyler smiles.  His guard coming down just a little.

                                 TYLER
                        What’s in the case?

                                 MALIK
                        A friend of mine.  Don’t worry 
                        about it.  

           Malik notices Tyler looking out the window to Kristen 
           standing outside.  

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                        She likes you, you know -- the 
                        doctor.  She’s good people.  You 
                        should give her a break.

           Tyler heard him, and now he’s moving on.

                                 TYLER
                        What’s your deal?

                                 MALIK
                        My deal?  Like, “who am I?”  My 
                        inner soul -- that kinda thing?
                             (to Andreas)
                        You know who he sound like?  Who 
                        that girl, used to have her own 
                        show?

                                 ANDREAS
                        Barbara Walters.

                                 MALIK
                        Nah, that other one.  Oprah.
                             (back to Tyler)
                        So what, you Oprah Winfrey now? 

                                 TYLER
                        It’s just a question.

           Malik sizes Tyler up-- trying to figure out if he’s worth 
           opening up to.

                                 MALIK
                        I boxed.

                                 TYLER
                        A boxer.  Really?
                                 ANDREAS
                             (chiming in)
                        23 and 0.  19 knockouts.

                                 MALIK
                        Ranked 8th in the world.  So says 
                        the World Boxing Commission.  

                                 TYLER
                        So the war happened-- ended your 
                        career.

                                 MALIK
                        Hardly.  See that would have been 
                        easy to handle.  My brother.  He 
                        drank -- a lot.  I mean forget 
                        about givin’ the brother a glass.  
                        Just give him the bottle and move 
                        out the way.  We was coming back 
                        from a fight in Atlantic City.  He 
                        was drivin’.  I’m all punchy from 
                        the 12 rounds, sleeping shotgun.  
                        Next thing I know, BAM, we’re 
                        spinning out.  Then the fear set 
                        in.  See my brother got two strikes 
                        on him and here come the police 
                        lights down the road.  My brother 
                        tells me to jump in his spot behind 
                        the wheel.  I’ll take a DUI for my 
                        man.  Hell, I’m a boxer.  Might 
                        even be good for my rep.  Plus, 
                        he’d do it for me no questions, no 
                        hesitation. 

                                 TYLER
                        And you got behind the wheel.

                                 MALIK
                             (nods)
                        Problem was, he’d hit a car a 
                        hundred yards back.  Two girls.  
                        Freshmen.  Dead on the scene.  So 
                        now that DUI ain’t a DUI no more.  
                        The look on my mother’s face, 
                        seeing her son in handcuffs.  I was 
                        ten years into a double life bid 
                        when the war started.  They opened 
                        up the jails.  Army or whoever said 
                        they needed everyone to fight.  
                        Shit, you were there.  

                                 TYLER
                        I was there.
                                 MALIK
                        Now I’m here, answering your stupid 
                        ass questions.

           Tyler looks up at Andreas.  Before he has to chance to utter 
           one word:

                                 ANDREAS
                        Don’t even think about it.  You 
                        don’t get to know about my family.  
                        You don’t get to know about me. 

           Malik gives Tyler a “let it go” look.  And he does.  Tyler 
           walks out of the conductor’s car.

                                 MALIK
                             (to Andreas)
                        What’s your beef with the man?

           Andreas watches Tyler walking towards the back of the train.

                                 ANDREAS
                        He still thinks at the end of all 
                        this, we’re going home.

           THE TRAIN

           Slinking past the snow capped mountains, crossing the bridge 
           over the Susquehanna River.

           EXT. CABOOSE - TRAIN - LATER

           Kristen has a shotgun in her hands, standing watch on the 
           back end of the train.  She turns to find Tyler standing 
           behind her. 

                                 TYLER
                        How long do I have?

                                 KRISTEN
                        We’re making good time.

                                 TYLER
                        How long?

                                 KRISTEN
                        By the end of the day, it’s going 
                        to be a struggle for you.  You’re 
                        not showing any symptoms yet, but 
                        that will change.

           Tyler takes it in quietly.
                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        Why did you say yes?  You could 
                        have walked away -- after what I 
                        did -- after being dragged out of 
                        your home.

                                 TYLER
                        I’m here.  Why does it matter?

                                 KRISTEN
                        Because it does.  This isn’t just 
                        some mission.  This is about 
                        getting our lives back.  I want an 
                        ice cream cone.  I want to watch 
                        bad TV.  I’m done crying.  I’m done 
                        being scared.  Twelve years is 
                        enough, don’t you think?

                                 TYLER
                             (thinks about it)
                        What flavor ice cream?

                                 KRISTEN
                        Butter pecan.  Soften it up in the 
                        microwave for 10 seconds.  God, is 
                        there anything better?

                                 TYLER
                        Keep me alive.

                                 KRISTEN
                        I’ll try.
                             (revises)
                        I will.

           Before they have a chance to let this moment build...

                                 TYLER
                        We’re slowing down.

           EXT. FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

           Tyler walks in front of the train as he rips stray corn 
           stocks from the tracks.  Tyler stops in front of an--

           F-18 FIGHTER JET

           Its nose buried in the ground.  Tyler looks inside the 
           cockpit.  He doubles over, on the verge of vomiting.
           PULL BACK to find Tyler is standing in the middle of a 
           massive graveyard.  Bodies in various states of rot.  JETS, 
           and HELICOPTERS sprayed all the over the field.

           In the distance is a train station.  A sign dangles from its 
           perch.  It reads: LANCASTER, PA.

           A SUPERSONIC BOOM stops Tyler. 

           Malik hops off the train and joins Tyler.

                                 TYLER
                        They’re close.  We need to take 
                        cover.

                                 MALIK
                        Maybe you didn’t check your ticket.  
                        This train is going non-stop. 
                        Losing time can cost you your life.

           Tyler looks up to the empty blue sky.  No threat hovering in 
           the air, but still...

                                 TYLER
                        We’re five hours away.  We’ve got 
                        time.  We’re taking cover.

           Tyler walks in the direction of the train station.

           INT. TRAIN STATION - WAITING AREA

           A no frills station.  A waiting area.  Vending machines.  

           Tyler and the group comb the area with flashlights.  Tyler’s 
           flashlight angles up to the fractured ceiling, painted with 
           stars and constellations -- painfully similar to his son’s 
           bedroom. 

           Tyler pans his flashlight around the station, stopping at a 
           half open JANITOR’S CLOSET.  

           Tyler uses his flashlight to open it the rest of the way.  
           Inside are the skeletal remains of three bodies.  TWO ADULTS.  
           ONE CHILD.  A family, holding onto each other in an eternal 
           embrace.  

                                 TYLER
                        We should move them.

                                 ANDREAS
                        To where?  Over by the vending 
                        machine?  
           Andreas slams the closet door shut and walks off.  Malik 
           stakes out a spot -- puts down his long steel case.  Tyler 
           stands at the closet door.  His thoughts take him somewhere 
           far away.  Kristen stays with him.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        It’ll all be beautiful again one 
                        day.  

                                 TYLER
                        You really believe that?

                                 KRISTEN
                             (thinks about it)
                        Yeah.  I do.

           Tyler looks at Kristen, then CLICKS his flashlight off.

                                 TYLER
                        I have to keep watch.

           Tyler turns and walks away.

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Andreas walks outside.  He looks up to the empty sky and 
           listens.  All is peaceful.

           INT. WAITING AREA - TRAIN STATION

           Malik is sprawled out on the bench, eyes closed.  One hand on 
           the long steel case.  Tyler sits across from him. 

                                 MALIK
                        Either ask your question, or stop 
                        staring at me.

                                 TYLER
                        Westmoreland Air Force Base -- when 
                        was the last time you made contact?

           Malik opens his eyes, staring back at Tyler -- not answering.  
           He’s wondering how much truth Tyler can handle.

                                 MALIK
                        Seven years. 

                                 TYLER
                        Seven years?

                                 MALIK
                        Calm down--
                                 TYLER
                        Seven years?  You haven’t made 
                        contact with the base in seven 
                        years?

                                 MALIK
                        There’s a million reasons for why 
                        they went dark.  It could be a 
                        technical problem.  Fear of being 
                        monitored--

                                 TYLER
                        --Or they could be dead!  They 
                        could all be dead!

           Malik sits up, studies Tyler for a moment.

                                 MALIK
                        You get that all out of your 
                        system?

           Malik reaches into his backpack and pulls out a bottle of 
           wine.

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                        If all this shit didn’t go down, 
                        2009 would have been an excellent 
                        year.

           Tyler takes the wine. 

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                        I wouldn’t save that if I were you.  
                        You ain’t got the time.

           Tyler reads the label on the bottle.

                                 TYLER
                        Two-Buck-Chuck?

                                 MALIK
                        A classic.

           Tyler lifts the bottle in thanks.  As Tyler walks away--

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                        And I don’t give a shit what’s out 
                        there, we move out in an hour.

           Tyler turns, stares back at Malik for a beat, then continues 
           on.
           EXT. STATION 

           Tyler sits outside on a bench.  With a knife, he pulls out 
           the cork and takes a swig of the wine.  

           In the distance, something catches Tyler’s attention.  He 
           picks up his shotgun -- aims it -- searching for a target.  
           Moving into the clearing is...

           A BISON

           The bison and Tyler stare each other down. 

                                 TYLER
                        Unbelievable.  We’re a long way 
                        from home, aren’t we?

           The bison keeps its focus on Tyler.  It’s probably just as 
           surprised at seeing a human.  

           From behind the bison, another bison appears with a CALF -- a 
           family.  All three are staring back at Tyler.

           Tyler sets his shotgun down.  He raises his bottle of wine up 
           in a toast as the bison family moves on.  

           It’s then that Tyler notices that his hand is SHAKING.

           EXT. TRAIN TRACKS 

           Andreas sits out in the middle of the tracks.  Keeping watch 
           when... The rail begins to VIBRATE, then shake.  

           Andreas stands in the middle of the tracks, searching for an 
           incoming train.  There is no train.  No sign of anything, yet 
           the rails shake harder.

           INT. TRAIN STATION - WAITING AREA - SAME

           Kristen looks out the window at Andreas.  He turns to the 
           station, yelling out something she can’t hear.

           PAN UP to the gaping hole in the ceiling.  Three aliens peer 
           down through the hole at Kristen.  

           An alien jumps from a hole in the roof, landing just behind 
           Kristen. 

           EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - SAME

           Andreas stands on the rattling train tracks.  
           He tilts his head to the sky, spotting an--

           ALIEN WARSHIP

           Moving into position over the train station.  Aliens dive out 
           of the hatch from the belly of the ship, landing on the 
           station rooftop.  Andreas runs into the train.

           INT. CONDUCTOR’S CAR - SAME

           Andreas yanks on the train WHISTLE.

           INT. TRAIN STATION - WAITING AREA - SAME

           Kristen spins around.  The alien humanoid is standing right 
           behind her, ready to strike when...

           BOOM.  The alien falls face first revealing Tyler pointing a 
           smoky shotgun.  Tyler does a 360.  The room is infested with 
           aliens scampering down the walls, across the ceiling.   More 
           are on their way through the hole in the roof.  

           ON MALIK

           Reaching for his steel case.  Flips it over.  

           The side of the case reads “THE SHREDDER.”  And for good 
           reason.

           Malik pulls out the biggest MACHINE GUN we’ve ever seen.  It 
           takes a man built like Malik to handle this monster.  

           He hoists it in the direction of two aliens and FIRES.  

           The bullets rip the skin, flesh, and bone right off, leaving 
           nothing recognizable.  

           Tyler stares at Malik, taking in the size of the gun he’s 
           hoisting.

                                 MALIK
                        Now you know.

           More aliens drop down through the hole in the roof.  The 
           train whistle blows once more.

           EXT. TRAIN 

           Tyler, Malik and Kristen run out and find Andreas busy 
           SHOOTING aliens on the train station roof.  
           They join Andreas inside the...

           INT. TRAIN - CONDUCTOR’S CAR

           The hovering warship opens its hatch.  

                                 ANDREAS
                        Oh my Jesus--

           A 15 X 15 FOOT CAGE drops down from the ship and lands smack 
           in the middle of the train tracks-- directly in their path.  

           Inside the cage can only be described as an alien version of 
           a LION.  Hairless, muscular -- on its haunches.  

           Another cage drops from the ship... and another... right in 
           front of them.  The cage doors detach, falling to the ground, 
           freeing the beasts.  But they don’t move.  They just watch.

                                 MALIK
                        They’re definitely breaking out the 
                        new shit.

                                 KRISTEN
                        What do we do?

                                 MALIK
                        We got somewhere to be.  They in 
                        our way.  So...

           Malik starts the train.  The train gains speed... moving in 
           fast... 

           ...IMPACT.  The cage is knocked off the rails.  The lion 
           beast leaps up to the conductor’s window.

           TWO MORE LIONS

           Running alongside the train.  These things are fast.  They 
           ram against the side of the train, almost tipping it right 
           off the tracks.

           ON THE ROOF OF THE TRAIN

           Two alien lions have joined forces, tearing into the steel. 

           INT. CONDUCTOR’S CAR - SAME

           Tyler takes control of the train.  The train begins to 
           accelerate.
                                 MALIK
                        What are you doing?!

           Malik looks up ahead.  There’s a turn coming.  The train’s 
           moving faster... too fast.  The lions have ripped the roof 
           off.  They flash their teeth, ready to jump inside when...

           THE TRAIN

           Going way too fast around the sharp turn, JUMPS THE TRACKS, 
           plowing into the snow drift, hugging the side of the cliff, 
           precariously close to tipping off the side of the mountain.  

           The lions tumble off the train, disappearing into the 
           snowbank.  

           INT. INSIDE THE TRAIN

           Tyler and Malik -- battered but conscious -- dangling half 
           way out of the overturned train.  Kristen crawls up to the 
           console, looking out of the blood speckled, smashed in 
           window.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        Oh my God.

           Kristen’s looking out to the--

           SNOWBANK

           A trail of blood on the icy patch of snow leads us to...

           ANDREAS

           Digging himself out of the snowbank.  There’s a desperate 
           sense of urgency.  From under the snow, in three different 
           directions, something’s burrowing towards him.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Andreas!!!

           One of the alien lions jets out of the snow, standing on its 
           hind legs, letting out a roar never heard of on earth.  
           Andreas digs his gun out and FIRES.  A direct hit, but the 
           lion doesn’t go down.

           An object flies out of its mouth, hitting Andreas in the 
           chest. 
           Andreas sways in the snowdrift, waist deep, keeping him a 
           sitting duck.  The lions flank Andreas, ready to finish him 
           off when all three of the beasts are obliterated.   

           ON MALIK

           Angling his trusty SHREDDER out the window of the conductor’s 
           car.

                                 MALIK
                        Dre, talk to me man.

           ON ANDREAS

           Now surrounded by the carcasses of dead alien lions.

           Andreas breathes in.  He’s alive, and he shouldn’t be.  He 
           pulls up his shirt up to find...

           A SLUG

           A slimy looking thousand-legger lodged half way into his 
           chest.  

           Andreas tries to remove the slug but it burrows, disappearing 
           into his chest.  The look on Andreas’ face is one we haven’t 
           seen before -- fear.

           Malik tries to get out of the train when Andreas waves him 
           off.

                                 ANDREAS
                        No!

           Andreas cocks his gun.

                                 ANDREAS (CONT’D)
                        We-are-expendable.  

           The slug moves up Andreas’ throat and into his brain.  
           Andreas puts the gun to his head.

                                 MALIK
                        Andreas, no!!!

           Andreas begins to squeeze the trigger, but the slug inside of 
           him begins to fry the inside of Andreas’ head.  The skin on 
           his face begins to sizzle, crackle, and peel.  His now 
           lifeless body slumps forward in the snow.
           EXT. CONDUCTOR’S CAR

           Tyler, Malik, and Kristen stare out at Andreas’ dead body.

                                 KRISTEN
                             (sobbing)
                        Oh my God.  Oh my God!

           A humming can be heard overhead.

           AN ALIEN WARSHIP

           Gliding over the toppled train.  The bottom of the ship 
           begins to glow red hot -- charging up.

                                 TYLER
                        Malik... Malik!

           Malik’s too busy staring out at his best friend to respond.  
           Tyler takes action, grabbing Malik’s shredder, and aims it 
           out the window.

                                 KRISTEN
                        What are you doing?

                                 TYLER
                        Moving a mountain.

           Tyler fires, hitting the snow covered mountain alongside the 
           cliff.  

           The snow cracks, then slides -- building momentum -- turning 
           into an...

           AVALANCHE

           Tons of snow and ice plow into the side of the train.  The 
           train tumbles end over end down the snow covered mountain, 
           plunging into the...

           SUSQUEHANNA RIVER

           The train is pulled down river by the fierce tide.

           INT. CONDUCTOR’S CAR

           It’s one massive spin cycle as Tyler, Malik and Kristen are 
           tossed around as snow and river water smash through the 
           windows.  The train begins to settle.  Tyler looks out the 
           window.  They’re sinking.  
                                 TYLER
                        How long can we be in the water  
                        before hypothermia sets in?

                                 KRISTEN
                             (already shivering)
                        Stage one can take-- I don’t know-- 
                        a minute.  Your arms and legs stop 
                        working.  We’ll be dead in less 
                        than ten minutes.

           Tyler sets a STOPWATCH on his watch.  He hands Kristen her 
           medical bag.

                                 TYLER
                        I’ll be right behind you.  Go.

           Kristen climbs through the window, pushing against the 
           incoming water.  Tyler and Malik brace themselves as the 
           train shifts, sinking deeper.  They both take a deep breath 
           as water completely fills up inside of the conductor’s car.   

           Tyler swims out the window.  Malik tries to follow, but he 
           can’t.  His shirt is caught on a jagged piece of steel from 
           the train.  

           Tyler looks back, now aware of Malik’s dilemma.  He checks 
           his watch.  34... 35... 36 seconds.

           Tyler makes a decision and swims back inside the conductor’s 
           car.  

           He tries to free Malik.  Their lung’s burning for air.  He 
           can’t get Malik free.  The more they struggle, the more 
           impossible it becomes.  

           Tyler checks his watch. 1:07...1:08... 1:09.  

           Malik and Tyler share a knowing look.  Malik lets the air 
           escape from his nostrils.  He pushes Tyler away.

           Tyler’s not giving up.  He tries to untangle Malik’s shirt 
           from the jagged piece of debris, but his hands aren’t working 
           anymore.  Stage one.  Hypothermia is setting in.  

           Tyler checks his watch.  1:21... 1:22... 1:23.  Tyler has no 
           choice.  He swims out of the exit door, leaving Malik behind.

           EXT. RIVER 

           Tyler surfaces, gasping for air.  He refills his lungs just 
           enough before a hand covers his mouth.  
           It’s Kristen.  Shivering.  Scared, but focused.  She points 
           up to...

           THE WARSHIP 

           Hovering above, scanning the river with a multitude of red 
           lights projected from the bottom of the ship.

           Tyler and Kristen are caught in the middle of a triangulation 
           of lights.  The freezing water is taking its toll.  

           They’re on the verge of passing out when... the warship’s 
           lights turn off.  The ship hums, then jets off, rippling the 
           water in the wake of a SUPERSONIC BOOM.

           Tyler and Kristen struggle to stay afloat as they make their 
           way towards the muddy embankment.  Now, out of the water, 
           they hold each other, shivering, using their bodies to warm 
           each other.  

           Kristen looks out to the calm waters.  No sign of Malik.  Her 
           shivering turns to crying.  Tyler holds Kristen, comforting 
           and warming her all at once. 

           INT. RIVERBANK - LATER

           Kristen sits by the water -- soggy -- curled up in a ball, 
           staring at a blank screen on a portable monitoring device.  

           Tyler works a few feet away.  He tosses a shotgun ruined by 
           the water into the river.  He checks another gun.  This one 
           he’ll keep, setting it aside.  He looks up at Kristen.

                                 TYLER
                        What is that?

                                 KRISTEN
                        It’s a monitoring system.  We were 
                        all injected with a microworm.  

                                 TYLER
                        Microworm.

                                 KRISTEN
                        It’s a tracking device.  Moves 
                        through the bloodstream.  Mayor 
                        Gadden had us all injected.  I 
                        injected you with one.

                                 TYLER
                        You did?
                                 KRISTEN
                        That’s how we were able to track 
                        you after you were captured.  If 
                        Malik’s alive, he’ll show up on the 
                        monitor.    

           Kristen stays glued to the empty screen, waiting for that one 
           lone blip to let her know that Malik’s alive.  Tyler watches 
           Kristen for a moment.  He’ll let her hold onto hope for just 
           a little longer.  

           Tyler opens up a map.  He struggles to hold a pen in his 
           shaking hand as he circles Lakewood, PA on the map. 

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        How long has your hand been 
                        shaking?

                                 TYLER
                        It’s just the cold.

                                 KRISTEN
                        It’s not the cold.  You know it’s 
                        not the cold.

           Kristen reaches into her black medical bag, pulling out a 
           syringe filled with sodium citrate.  

                                 TYLER
                        This is how it starts?

                                 KRISTEN
                        Yeah.  This is how it starts.

           Kristen sticks the needle deep into his arm.  Kristen checks 
           her watch.  She’s worried.

                                 TYLER
                        What?

                                 KRISTEN
                        The symptoms don’t usually start 
                        this early.  The stress -- your 
                        elevated heart rate -- it’s 
                        accelerating the effects of the 
                        uranium.

                                 TYLER
                        Not good news.

                                 KRISTEN
                        No.  It’s not.
           Kristen turns away, putting her kit back into the medical 
           bag.  She’s trying hard not to cry, and Tyler knows it.  

                                 TYLER
                        I used to be good at this.  Being 
                        comforting.  I used to know how to 
                        say the right thing.  You’re a 
                        strong woman.  Brave.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Brave?  No.  If you knew what was 
                        racing through my head... I’m not 
                        brave.  

           Tyler smiles.  Yeah she is.  He picks up the working weapons 
           and a soggy backpack.  Kristen grabs her medical bag.  This 
           is what remains of their supplies.  They look around to the 
           endless landscape.

                                 TYLER
                        I hope you miss long walks.

                                 KRISTEN
                        As a matter-of-fact... I do.

           And they walk, moving up the riverbank towards a silent 
           highway.

           EXT. ROUTE 119 - DAY

           We’re in the last hour of sunlight.  The golden hour.  Pink 
           sky.  Fires in the distance.  An image both beautiful and 
           tragic all at once.  Tyler and Kristen walk the long stretch 
           of highway coated with ash.  The sound of an EXPLOSION can be 
           heard. 

                                 KRISTEN
                        What is that? 

                                 TYLER
                        It’s a sonic boom.  That’s the 
                        sound the ships make when they re-
                        enter the atmosphere.  They’re 
                        close.

           Tyler and Kristen stop.  Off the side of the road they 
           spot...

           A FIREPIT

           Still smoldering.  Tyler leans down, checking out the shoe 
           prints in the dirt.  Signs of human life are not comforting 
           to Tyler -- not out here.   
           EXT.  ROUTE 119 - DUSK

           Tyler and Kristen walk down the winding highway exit.

           EXT.  PARKING LOT - MALL - DUSK

           Kristen and Tyler cross the lot filled with toppled over 
           shopping carts and torched cars.  

           They stop in front of the supermarket.  Some of the daily 
           specials still hang on the cracked windows.  Tyler pulls his 
           gun.  He studies the supermarket.  Weighing the danger.

                                 KRISTEN
                        We’re not going to find anything in 
                        here.

                                 TYLER
                        We have to try.

           INT. SUPERMARKET 

           Tyler and Kristen walk inside.  The sensors at the front 
           entrance chime, alerting the empty store of their arrival.  
           The smell of rotting food is nauseating.

           They walk the rows of empty aisles.  Food containers have 
           been pried open.  Its contents spilled on the floor along 
           with dried streaks of blood.

           Tyler takes the lead around the corner.  He raises his hand, 
           waving Kristen back.  Up ahead, a PACK OF WOLVES are tearing 
           into the putrid remains of unrecognizable food spilling out 
           from bags and crushed cans.  They continue on...

           Tyler spots something on the ground.  He reaches down, under 
           the toppled shelves, pulling out three mushy, melted, 
           POWERBARS that survived unnoticed.

                                 TYLER
                        We’ve got food.

           EXT. ROUTE 119 - NIGHT

           Tyler and Kristen walk the highway, flashlights out.  The 
           road is littered with the burned remains of cars that now 
           double as coffins.  Tyler’s sweating.  Trembling. 

                                 TYLER
                        I need a shot.
                                 KRISTEN
                        You just had a shot.

                                 TYLER
                             (agitated)
                        I need another one. 

                                 KRISTEN
                        I’m sorry.  The injections are 
                        going to become less effective.  We 
                        can’t keep walking like this.

                                 TYLER
                        I know.

                                 KRISTEN
                        What’s in Lakewood?
                             (off of Tyler’s look)
                        I saw it circled on the map.  Is 
                        that where we’re going because I 
                        know we’re not heading towards the 
                        base.

                                 TYLER
                        I’m sick, and we’re 150 miles away 
                        from the base without any 
                        transportation.  Down this road is 
                        a chance and we have to take it.  
                        You need to trust me.

           The conversation is interrupted by a CHILD’S COUGH.  Tyler 
           straightens up, purposely masking any sign of his illness.  
           He angles his flashlight at the brush off the side of the 
           road.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Come on out.  You’re not in any 
                        danger.

           Standing up behind the brush is a male REFUGEE (43).  Dirty. 
           Grim.  He wears an old coat over layers of frayed sweaters.  
           There’s a tint of a southern accent in his voice.

                                 REFUGEE
                        Please.  Don’t hurt us.

           Tyler blinks.  Us?  Standing up beside the man is his SON 
           (9), wearing a Lebron James jersey under his oversized parka.  
           He’s coughing -- sickly.

                                 TYLER
                        You traveling alone?
                                 REFUGEE
                        Yes sir.  We got denied entrance 
                        into the Cleveland settlement on 
                        account of my sick boy.  We just 
                        been walking -- praying for God to 
                        send some good news our way, then 
                        you come walking down the road.  
                        Where you folks headin’?

                                 TYLER
                        Nowhere.

                                 REFUGEE
                        Nowhere?  Hell, this is nowhere.  
                        Maybe you can be a little more 
                        specific.

           The refugee looks over at Kristen.  He looks down at the 
           WHITE CROSS on Kristen’s medical bag.

                                 REFUGEE (CONT’D)
                             (eyes on fire)
                        You got medicine.

                                 KRISTEN
                        No.  

           The refugee pulls a KNIFE.

                                 REFUGEE
                        There’s medicine in that bag.  I 
                        know it.

                                 SON
                        Dad, please!

           Tyler looks over at the man’s son, coughing up his lungs.

                                 TYLER
                        You need to let us walk away.

                                 REFUGEE
                        You sure can.  Both you and your 
                        girlfriend -- but the bag stays 
                        with me.

           The boy coughs again, drawing Tyler’s attention.  It’s sad, 
           but still...

                                 TYLER
                        I can’t do that.
                                 REFUGEE
                        That boy is all I have!  You need 
                        to leave the bag with me!  Leave it 
                        or I will use this knife.

           Tyler survey’s the area.  Calculating.  Planning.  There’s a 
           change in Tyler now.  A coldness.  

                                 TYLER
                        Are you alone? 

           Tyler’s already asked that question, but the tone is 
           different this time -- as if Tyler already knows the answer.  
           The refugee stands his ground.  He’s not answering the 
           question.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        I’ll ask you again.  Are you alone?  

           The refugee twirls the knife in his hand.  Waiting for that 
           right time.  

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do it.

           Now!  The refugee charges at Tyler.  Tyler sideswipes the 
           refugee, breaking his wrist -- forcing him to drop the knife.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        Tyler!

           TWO MORE REFUGEES run out of the bushes.  Tyler spins around, 
           draws his gun.  BOOM.  BOOM.  Two perfect shots that drop 
           them to the ground.  The boy runs over to his father and 
           holds him.  

                                 BOY
                        Please don’t hurt him.  He was just 
                        tryin’ to help me.

           Tyler leans down.  Puts a hand on the boy’s head.  He surveys 
           the damage:  Two dead bodies.  A father and son that will 
           most likely die on this highway.

                                 TYLER
                             (a million miles away)
                        I’m sorry.  I’m so sorry.

           Kristen watches Tyler -- she’s gentle with him.

                                 KRISTEN
                             (softly)
                        We have to go.
           Tyler rises up, turns his back, and joins Kristen as they 
           continue on down the road. 

           EXT. LAKEWOOD GATED COMMUNITY - NIGHT

           Tyler and Kristen walk through the abandoned guard gate to a 
           private, gated community lined with McMansions.  

           One home has the words “HELP ME” spray painted on the roof.  
           Other homes have their doors spray painted to alert the Red 
           Cross of bodies.  But that was years ago -- when there was 
           still a Red Cross.  

           They stop in front of one house.  A mansion bigger than the 
           rest.  High walls.  Fortified.  

           A big wheel sits in the driveway.  A stray basketball in need 
           of air.  Tyler’s fixated on it.  There was a boy here.  
           Probably the same age as Tyler’s own child.

           INT. GARAGE 

           Tyler pulls up the garage door.  Tyler and Kristen enter.  
           The garage is filled with LUXURY CARS: A PORCHE, LAMBORGHINI, 
           HUMMER, PHANTOM.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        Oh my God.  Look at this.

           Tyler’s focus is elsewhere.  He moves past all the six figure 
           cars, stopping at the PRIUS.

                                 TYLER
                        This is us.

           Tyler moves to the tool rack -- removes it.  There’s a safe 
           built into the wall.  Tyler stares at the safe and thinks.  
           He turns the tumbler left, right, then left.  CLICK.  The 
           safe opens.  

           Inside the safe are sets of keys.  Tyler grabs a set and 
           pockets it.

                                 KRISTEN
                             (confused)
                        Okay.  Wanna explain that?

           Tyler’s still on the move -- focused -- never hearing the 
           question.  He grabs a crowbar, and walks five paces, stopping 
           at a dead spot on the floor.  Tyler pries the floorboard 
           open, revealing jugs of gasoline.  Tyler hoists the barrels 
           out.
                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        Tyler, who lived here?

           EXT. HOUSE

           Tyler exits the garage with Kristen and wraps around to the 
           front entrance.  The door leans against the house, ripped off 
           its hinges.  The number “1” is spray painted on the side of 
           the house.  Tyler pulls his gun.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE

           Tyler and Kristen enter, stepping over broken glass and 
           family photos.  Kristen picks up one photo from the ground.  
           It’s a wedding picture.  In the picture is a young Tyler and 
           his wife, Samantha.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Is this you? 

           Tyler looks at the picture without taking it from Kristen.

                                 TYLER
                        I’m going upstairs.  Stay down 
                        here.

                                 KRISTEN
                        We can’t stay--

                                 TYLER
                             (not asking)
                        --Wait here.

           Tyler heads upstairs.

           INT. HALLWAY 

           Tyler moves down the hall -- stopping at the cracked open 
           bathroom door.  A moving shadow draws his attention. 

           Tyler steps through the open door.  Standing in front of the 
           swaying shadow, moving across the floor like a pendulum.

           REVERSE to a pair of dangling feet -- still in morning 
           slippers.  The years have made the skin leathery.  A note 
           still clutched in a brittle hand.

           Under the corpse’s feet is the aged carcass of a GOLDEN 
           RETRIEVER -- staying close -- always faithful.
           Kristen stands at the doorway.  Keeping a respectful 
           distance.  Tyler feels her presence.

                                 TYLER
                        She’s my sister.

           Tyler takes the note and reads.  We don’t know what the 
           letter says.  We never will, but the words break through the 
           years of walls Tyler has built to protect himself.  The tears 
           come as Tyler breaks down, crying at his sister’s feet.

                                 KRISTEN
                        I saw what used to be a flower 
                        garden.  It’s got a nice view of 
                        the mountains.  I’m sure the 
                        sunsets are beautiful.  I think 
                        she’d like it back there.

           EXT. BACK YARD 

           Under the backdrop of the setting sun, Tyler works feverishly 
           with a shovel, covering up his sister’s grave.  

           PAN ACROSS to find three other graves:  A photo of Tyler’s 
           sister -- young and beautiful with her husband.  In another 
           grave, a photo of a child riding his big wheel.  And in the 
           last grave, the carcass of the Golden Retriever.

           Tyler digs and digs.  He wobbles, getting dizzy, then regains 
           his balance.

           INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE

           Kristen looks around the kitchen.  Roaches crawl over a 
           child’s artwork on the subzero fridge.  Kristen opens the 
           door to the food pantry.  It’s empty.  

           Kristen looks through the window at Tyler digging in the back 
           yard.  She kicks around the garbage on the floor and collects  
           CANDLES, two PAPER PLATES and a JUICE BOX.  A huge find.

                                 KRISTEN
                             (calls out)
                        We’ve got juice!

           Silence.

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        Tyler!?

           Kristen moves to the window.  Tyler’s face down on the 
           ground.
           INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM

           LIGHTS COME UP on a cobweb covered chandelier.  This is from 
           Tyler’s P.O.V. as he looks around the living room flat on his 
           back on the sofa.  

           Candles are lit around the living room.  This huge house and 
           all its dust and mold seems peaceful in the glow of the 
           candles.  

           Kristen’s sitting beside Tyler on the sofa, packing up her 
           medical kit.

                                 KRISTEN
                        You just got three times your 
                        regular injection of sodium 
                        citrate.  I’ve tried doses of 
                        tiron, gallic acid, DTPA, and 
                        still... 

           Kristen lifts up Tyler’s shaking hand.  

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        We’re running out of time.

           There’s a sadness in Tyler.  Kristen’s sees it.  A weakening 
           of spirit and heart that is scary to see in our hero.

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        I made us dinner. 

                                 TYLER
                        Dinner.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Yes.  Dinner.  A normal dinner, on 
                        a normal night -- where the stars 
                        are still mysterious, and the world 
                        is still ours. 

                                 TYLER
                        We don’t have the time.

                                 KRISTEN
                        We’re making time.  You need food.  
                        Dinner’s served.

           Kristen walks into the dining room.  Tyler follows.

           INT. DINING ROOM

           Kristen has already set the table.  Candles.  Two paper 
           plates. One juice box.
                                 KRISTEN
                        I gave the maid the night off. 

           Tyler sees Kristen has already launched into role playing.  
           He plays along. 

                                 TYLER
                        Well, that’s good.  She deserves a 
                        night off.

           Tyler takes a sip of the juice box.  Passes it to Kristen.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Thank you.

                                 TYLER
                        You’re welcome. 

                                 KRISTEN
                        I made your favorite.

           Kristen lays down half of a melted PowerBar on Tyler’s plate.  
           She keeps the other half for herself.

                                 TYLER
                        Oh honey.  You shouldn’t have.

           They bite into their dinners.  This is cute and sad all at 
           once. 

                                 KRISTEN
                        Have you ever heard of Lake 
                        Winnipesaukee?  It’s in New 
                        Hampshire.   

                                 TYLER
                        Lake Winnip... no. 

                                 KRISTEN
                        My parents used to take me there in 
                        the summer.  I used to dream of 
                        buying a cabin up there.  Live my 
                        life sitting out on a porch, 
                        reading gossip magazines with a 
                        ripe, off the tree Granny Smith 
                        apple.

                                 TYLER
                        You liked being a doctor?

                                 KRISTEN
                        I was the top of my class at 
                        Stanford.  Top intern at Bellevue.  
                        I was good.  I was real good.  
                                 TYLER
                        Family?

           Kristen swallows hard at this question.  The tough subject.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Husband.  A daughter.  Ella.  She 
                        was seven.  First thing she tried 
                        to read was all the medical 
                        journals around the house.  Always 
                        wanted to know what I was working 
                        on.  She wanted to connect with me.  
                        She had a mother that was never 
                        home.  I was too busy taking care 
                        of everyone else. 

                                 TYLER
                        I’m sure Ella knew she was loved.  
                        You just have to believe that.

                                 KRISTEN
                        My family was put in a shelter 
                        while I volunteered at a triage.  
                        We got a call that the shelter was 
                        hit.  An ambulance went to the 
                        scene.  It never came back.  Then 
                        the police went in.  Then the 
                        soldiers.  None of them came back.
                             (a beat)
                        So -- your family... were you with 
                        them when it started?

                                 TYLER
                        I was fighting.  I don’t know if 
                        they made it to the shelters or... 
                        I don’t know.  Last time I saw my 
                        son, it was lights out-- snug under 
                        the blankets in his room.  I kissed 
                        him.  Kissed my wife, and... 
                        yeah... that was it. 

           As if drawing weapons, Tyler and Kristen each take out a 
           photo, sliding it to the other.  They smile, glimpsing into 
           each other’s worlds.  They look up at each other.  Two of the 
           loneliest people in the world.

                                 KRISTEN
                        He’s got--

                                 TYLER
                        --Your eyes.  
           They trade back the photos.  Tyler’s looking at her 
           differently now.  A look she hasn’t seen in a man in some 
           time.  

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        That first night-- the night we 
                        were together--

                                 KRISTEN
                             (getting up)
                        --No.  I can’t.  I’m sorry.

           Tyler gets up and cuts her off at the door.  Kristen’s 
           vulnerable, and a little angry.

                                 TYLER
                        I need to know--

                                 KRISTEN
                        I can’t do this.

                                 TYLER
                        Why not?

                                 KRISTEN
                        Because I’m not helping you.  I’m a 
                        doctor, and I’m not helping you!

           Tyler stands there, absorbing it.

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        I promised to keep you alive, but I 
                        can’t.  I’m not a doctor anymore.  
                        I’m just a bystander.

                                 TYLER
                        I’m still alive.

           Tyler kisses Kristen.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                             (again)
                        I’m still alive.

           He kisses her again.  Kristen kisses him back as they fumble, 
           and stumble into the...

           LIVING ROOM

           Tyler lays Kristen down on the sofa.  He takes Kristen’s 
           shirt off.  He kisses the burns and bruises on her body.  
           They have had sex before, but this time will be different.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Kristen’s on the floor.  Postcoital.  Wrapped in a blanket.   
           She opens her eyes.  Tyler’s gone.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Tyler?

           Instincts get her dressed and on her feet.  She surveys the 
           area, moving into the...

           HALLWAY

           There’s the sound of a low hum.  A motor perhaps?  Kristen 
           moves down the hall, deeper into the darkness and comes 
           upon...

           A TRAP DOOR.  An OPEN trap door.  And in that split second of 
           realization, a hand covers her mouth, muffling her screams as 
           she’s dragged down the stairs and into the...

           INT. BASEMENT - SAME

           Kristen is quickly gagged and hog tied.  We can’t see who’s 
           doing it.  Not yet.  

           But we hear the whispers.  Human whispers.  Kristen scans her 
           surroundings.  

           The room is dimly lit with the help of a small generator 
           sputtering in the corner.  Bunk beds in the opposite corner.  
           A filthy bucket doubles for an outhouse that needs dumping 
           out.

           Hanging from the basement pipes by chicken wire are half 
           eaten bodies of skinned cats, one dog, and body parts... 
           human body parts.  

           Muffled screams turn Kristen towards the far corner of the 
           room where we find...

           TYLER

           Bound by wire.  Gagged, and bloodied.  Stepping into frame 
           is...

           BEATRICE HEWITT

           Late 40’s.  Beyond the dirt and grime, you see a once 
           prideful and wealthy woman.  Pearls still draped around her 
           neck.  The dress she’s wearing is expensive, but now 
           tattered.
                                 BEATRICE
                        You’re not hurt, are you 
                        sweetheart?

           Kristen just stares at her, wide-eyed with fear.  Beatrice 
           moves to Tyler, checking his eyes -- his teeth.  Much the way 
           a rancher tends to his precious cattle.

           At the other corner of the room sits...

           TWO EMACIATED GIRLS

           Their clothes are Abercrombie-ish, now frayed, doing nothing 
           to hide the ruin of their bodies.  They sit quiet, no doubt 
           scarred from this life.  We hear the trap door shut.  
           Footsteps clunk down the steps leading to the basement.  

           We meet WARREN HEWITT (48).  If you met him 12 years ago, 
           you’d say he was a conservative, mild mannered family man.  
           Probably the head of a some corporation.  

           But that was 12 years ago.  His haunted eyes narrow at the 
           sight of Kristen.  He removes the gag from her mouth.

                                 WARREN
                        No one can hear you.  Do you 
                        understand me?  No one.  I’m 
                        keeping the gag on your friend over 
                        there.  I don’t want any 
                        communicating between you two.  So 
                        speak softly -- eyes on me.  What’s 
                        your name?

                                 KRISTEN
                        Kristen.

                                 WARREN
                        Kristen.  Are you alone?

                                 KRISTEN
                        Yes.

                                 WARREN
                        Do you have any diseases?

                                 KRISTEN
                        No.

                                 WARREN
                             (relieved)
                        Good.  Thank you.  

           Warren turns to his wife.
                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        If we’re smart, they’ll last us 
                        through the winter.  If we’re 
                        smart.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Please.  You don’t have to do this. 

           Warren SMACKS her hard across the face.  Tyler yells out, but 
           his words are muffled by the gag in his mouth.

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m a human being.

                                 WARREN
                        So-are-we.

           Warren spins around, snatching Tyler by the feet, yanking him 
           past the daughters who register little emotion on their dirty 
           faces.  The mother unfurls a BLOOD CAKED PLASTIC TARP across 
           the floor.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        No!  Please!

           Warren is weak from years of starvation.  It takes all he has 
           to pull Tyler onto the plastic.  He reaches into a hanging 
           TOOL CASE and pulls out a HACKSAW.  

                                 WARREN
                             (circling around Tyler)
                        Here’s what’s going to happen.  
                        We’re going to start here--

           Warren angles the saw just below Tyler’s knee.  He talks to 
           Tyler as if his words should comfort, which makes it all the 
           more perverse.

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        We have no refrigeration.  You’d 
                        spoil in a couple days.  But if we 
                        keep you alive.  Feed you.  We’ll 
                        make your days as comfortable and 
                        painless as possible.  You’ll last 
                        us quite a while.  I promise you.  
                        Your life will not be in vain.  You 
                        will be put to good use.

           Warren pulls up Tyler’s pant leg above the knee.  He presses 
           the hacksaw down on his leg, ready to saw into Tyler’s thigh 
           when:

                                 BEATRICE (O.S.)
                        Warren!!!
           Warren turns to his wife and children, holding hands.

                                 BEATRICE (CONT’D)
                        In this house, God always come 
                        first.

           Even in this hell, there’s still a sick sense of morality. 

                                 WARREN
                        You’re right.

           Warren lays down his saw and joins the circle-- holding his 
           wife’s hands.

                                 FAMILY
                        Our father, who art in Heaven, 
                        hallowed be thy name.

           While the family prays, Tyler squeezes his bloody hand 
           through the wire.

                                 FAMILY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Thy kingdom come.  Thy will be 
                        done, on earth as it is in Heaven. 
                        Give us this day our daily bread. 
                        And forgive us our trespasses, as 
                        we forgive those who trespass 
                        against us.  And lead us not into 
                        temptation, but deliver us from 
                        evil.

           Warren picks up the hacksaw and moves in on Tyler.

                                 WARREN
                        For thine is the kingdom, the 
                        power, and the glory.  For ever and 
                        ever.

           Warren presses the hacksaw against Tyler’s leg, ready to 
           start cutting.

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        Amen.

           Tyler slips his bloody hand through the wire and grabs Warren 
           by the neck.  Tyler slams Warren’s head against the wall, 
           knocking him out.  Tyler gets a half second to catch his 
           breath when:

                                 KRISTEN
                        Tyler!!!
           Tyler whips around to see Beatrice, with her dress, and 
           pearls -- an axe held high, charging at him.  An odd sight, 
           but it’s happening.  

           As Beatrice swings the axe, it’s caught above her head by...

           MALIK

           Battered, but alive.  He slings Beatrice onto the ground. 
           Tyler moves to Kristen and unties her.  

           Tyler, Malik, and Kristen turn to the family huddled 
           together, scared for their lives.  A sorry sight.  

                                 MALIK
                        God.

                                 KRISTEN
                        No.  Not God.

           Tyler reaches into his pocket, pulling the remainder of his 
           dinner -- a PowerBar.  He lays it on the ground.  And without 
           a word, Tyler, Kristen and Malik head up the basement steps.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           The rain comes down in dark ashy pools, wiped away poorly by 
           the windshield wipers.  Malik drives as Tyler and Kristen sit 
           in the back.

                                 TYLER
                        I thought you were dead.

                                 MALIK
                        I found an air pocket.  Bought me 
                        some time.  From there, it was just 
                        a game of catch up.  Got my mini 
                        receiver out, followed the beeps.  
                        Did she tell you about the 
                        micoworm?  It’s a tracking device.  
                        You got one in you.

                                 TYLER
                        I heard.

                                 MALIK
                        Strangest thing.  At one point, 
                        both your beeps became one for 
                        like, a looong time.  It was almost 
                        as if you two were on top of each 
                        other.  Must be a glitch.
                                 KRISTEN
                             (blushing like hell)
                        Must be.

                                 MALIK
                        Now I’m here, saving your sorry 
                        asses -- and you know why?  Chapter 
                        one, paragraph one of the history 
                        books.  I told you I was gonna help 
                        save the world, and ain’t noooobody 
                        cheatin’ me outta that.  You feel 
                        me playa?

                                 TYLER
                             (smiles)
                        Yeah.  I think I do.

           EXT. CAR - ROAD - NIGHT

           TITLE: PENNSYLVANIA ROUTE 66.  46 MILES TO WESTMORELAND AIR 
           FORCE BASE.

           A car skids and slides across the two lane road.

           INT. CAR

           Tyler drives.  He’s struggling -- clenching and unclenching 
           his shaking hand.  He grips the wheel tightly.  It’s the only 
           time Tyler can get his hand to be steady now.  He’s sweating.  
           Shaking.  A mess.

           Malik’s in the back seat -- shotgun in hand -- eyes searching 
           for movement.  Kristen is asleep, resting her head on Tyler’s 
           arm. 

           Tyler looks out the window to the cars in the emergency lane.  
           Frozen bodies of a HUSBAND and WIFE, forever wrapped in an 
           embrace.  

           In another car sits an OLD MAN.  Alone.  Frozen.

                                 MALIK
                        You look like shit.  I mean, not as 
                        bad as that couple in the car, but 
                        bad.

                                 TYLER
                        Thank you.

                                 MALIK
                        Why don’t you pull over and let me 
                        drive awhile?
           Tyler points up ahead.

                                 TYLER
                        There.

                                 MALIK
                        --I see it.

           Tyler stops the car.  Kristen wakes.  She sees what Tyler and 
           Malik are looking at...

           AN 18-WHEELER

           Belly up in the middle of the icy road.  Its cargo is splayed 
           all across the road.   A humanitarian shipment.  Pallets of 
           rice, flour and water.  

           Tyler checks the rear view window to the miles of empty 
           highway behind him.  It’s way too quiet.

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                        Look at that.  All that food.  
                        Wasted. 

                                 TYLER
                             (unsure)
                        Maybe. 

                                 MALIK
                        What do you think?  Go check it 
                        out.  Bring back a couple of Big 
                        Macs.

           Tyler’s thinking.  None of this feels right.  

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                        We have no food.  We have to go out 
                        there.

           Tyler nods his okay.  Malik gets out of the car.  Tyler pulls 
           his gun.  It trembles uncontrollably in his hands. 

                                 KRISTEN
                        What’s wrong?

                                 TYLER
                        Everything.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME

           Malik takes cautious steps towards the truck, stepping over 
           bottles of water and broken open bags of grain. 
           INT. CAR

           Tyler and Kristen watch on.  

                                 TYLER
                        Come on.  Come on.

           BACK TO MALIK

           Standing beside the truck.  Picks up a bottle of water and 
           drinks.  He raises his bottle to the car.

                                 MALIK
                        We’re good!

           Malik opens his knapsack and begins to toss in bottles of 
           water and food bars.  

           He reaches for a bottle and it rolls out of reach.  Beneath 
           Malik’s feet, the ice begins to crack as the earth shakes.

           The car horn sounds.  

           Malik turns back to see Tyler and Kristen yelling out a 
           warning.  

           Behind the truck, a reddish glow that reaches up to the sky.  
           Rising up from the road’s horizon is--

           A WARSHIP

           Patrolling the highway, casting a harsh light down on the 18-
           wheeler.  Tyler’s car is still a good fifty feet back, 
           shielded by the dark, but it won’t be long.  

           Malik hides behind an abandoned car.  He steals a look back 
           at Tyler and Kristen in the car -- sitting ducks.  

           Malik makes a decision.  He jumps out to the middle of the 
           highway.

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                             (yelling out)
                        Hey!  Down here assholes!  

           The warship’s lights move to Malik.

           ON TYLER

           Watching Malik sacrifice himself.  This is his chance.  

           He starts the car -- puts it in reverse -- goes ten feet -- 
           then stops.
           ON MALIK

           Waving them off.

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                        Go!  Get out of here!

           The ship begins to hum -- charging up.  The light on Malik 
           intensifies.

           INT. CAR

           Tyler sits behind the wheel, staring out to Malik.  He puts 
           the car in neutral.  Tyler’s doing all the wrong things.  
           Going against years of training and instinct.  He pops the 
           trunk.

                                 TYLER
                        Wait here.

           INT. HIGHWAY

           Tyler steps out of the car, opens the trunk, and pulls out a 
           jug of GASOLINE.  Tyler bowls the jug of gasoline down the 
           icy road, coming to a stop under an ABANDONED SCHOOL BUS.  

           The ship’s hum reaches its apex, ready to blast away at 
           Malik.  

           Tyler raises his SHOTGUN.  Tyler struggles to keep a steady 
           aim as he fires, missing the jug.  He sets himself again.  
           Concentrates.  FIRES.

           The bullet ignites the jug of gas and BOOM, the school bus is 
           lifted off the ground from the explosion.  

           The lights from the warship turn their focus away from Malik 
           to the bus, opening fire, obliterating the fiery bus into 
           useless auto parts.  

           Tyler opens the passenger side door and extends a hand to 
           Kristen.  

                                 TYLER
                        Let’s go!

           Tyler pulls Kristen out of the passenger seat just as the 
           ships’s lights hit the car.  A tremendous amount of heat is 
           focused on the car.  

           The TIRES BLOW, the paint peels, and the metal melts.  
           Finally, the gas tank explodes.
           Tyler grips Kristen’s arm as they run, joining Malik behind 
           the brush.  

           The warship surveys the damage, then takes off, creating a 
           SONIC BOOM in its wake.  Kristen tries to stand.  Tyler pulls 
           her back down.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Wait.

           Behind them, in the dark, the sounds of scampering -- quick 
           breaths -- something not human -- racing all around them.  
           Snow kicks up in the distance.  Tyler aims his shotgun, 
           searching for a target.  A beastly howl pierces the night.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Do you see anything?

                                 MALIK
                        No.

           Everything goes quiet.  Just the night and the cold wind.  
           Then, busting through the snow are...

           TWO ALIEN LIONS

           Like the ones we’ve seen earlier.  Hairless.  Muscular.  
           White.  Tyler and Malik blast away at the lions.  One down.  
           Two down.  And the night is quiet once again.  

           Tyler and the group turn their attention back to their car on 
           fire.

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                        Shit.  There’s goes my mix tape.

           From behind the group, one of the lions raises up.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Tyler!

           Tyler spins around -- pushing Kristen down -- raising his 
           shotgun.   A SLUG FIRES out of the lion’s mouth, striking 
           Tyler in the chest.

                                 MALIK
                        No!!!

           Tyler drops to the ground.  Malik fires on the wounded beast, 
           finishing it off.

           Kristen leans down to Tyler, ripping his shirt open.  The 
           slug has dug into Tyler’s chest, moving up his body.
                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                        Can you get to it?

                                 KRISTEN
                        I don’t know.

           Tyler pulls out his knife, handing it to Kristen.

                                 TYLER
                        You know what to do.  

           Kristen holds the knife, seemingly lost.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        Tyler--

                                 MALIK
                        I’ll do it.  Move.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Give me a second!

                                 MALIK
                        He doesn’t have seconds.  That 
                        thing is going to blow him inside 
                        out.  Cut him open!

           Kristen holds the knife to the slug swollen under Tyler’s 
           skin.  

                                 TYLER
                             (weakening)
                        You can do this.  You were at the 
                        top of your class at Stanford.  Top 
                        intern at Bellevue.

                                 KRISTEN
                        If I hit the jugular vein--

                                 TYLER
                        Do it now!

           Kristen STABS Tyler in the shoulder with the knife.  The SLUG 
           runs out through the stab wound.  It sizzles and crackles, 
           burrowing into the snow.

           Kristen looks down at Tyler.  There’s two wounds in Tyler.  
           The slug’s entrance at his chest, and the stab wound.  Both 
           injuries are severe.  He’s losing blood fast.  Kristen works 
           on Tyler.
                                 KRISTEN
                        You’re not going to die.  You can’t 
                        die.  Tyler!  Don’t close your 
                        eyes.  Stay with me.  Stay with me.

           Tyler’s trying, but he can’t.  His eyes roll up. 

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        Tyler!

                                                              BLACKOUT.

           The following is in Tyler’s P.O.V. as we...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. PHARMACY

           Doors kick open.  Everything’s quick as we move down an aisle 
           of ransacked shelves.

           Everything is upside down and sidewalks as we’re dragged 
           along the floor.  Kristen and Malik race past Tyler  -- 
           scrambling around the pharmacy, knocking over shelves.

                                 MALIK
                        I can’t find anything. 

                                 KRISTEN
                        Keep looking.  I need gauze!  
                        Peroxide.  Anything to stop the 
                        bleeding.

           The store window SHATTERS.  An inhuman cry from outside.

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        Malik!

           Malik runs to the front door, firing his SHOTGUN at God knows 
           what.  Tyler drifts off into unconsciousness and everything 
           goes black.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Tyler’s P.O.V. from the ground.  He’s surrounded by 
           overturned CARS.  One car is still standing upright.  Malik 
           breaks the window.
           A SONIC BOOM can be heard.  In the sky, two WARSHIPS buzz the 
           parking lot.  Tyler loses consciousness again.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Tyler’s P.O.V. from the backseat.  Malik’s hanging out the 
           passenger side window, firing his shotgun as Kristen drives.  

           From out the window, a WARSHIP comes into view.  The warship 
           FIRES, hitting the road just in front of the car.  The blast 
           sends the car tumbling end over end, coming to a stop upside 
           down in middle of the road.

           Kristen and Malik dangle upside down in the flipped over car. 
           They unbuckle from their seats, crawling towards the broken 
           window.

           Outside, we hear the hum of energy and power.  

                                 MALIK
                        Get out of the car!

           Another BLAST of light and energy hits the side of the road, 
           kicking up concrete and dirt.  The car is rocked on its side.

           Kristen climbs out of the car.  Malik enters the frame.  He 
           pulls Tyler out of the car and onto the...

           HIGHWAY

           Tyler’s P.O.V as he’s dragged by Malik.  A view of the stars 
           in the sky, then, a WARSHIP, circling back.   Tyler’s view 
           tilts to Kristen, firing a shotgun at the low flying warship.  

           Another BLAST from the warship hits the car.  Kristen’s hit 
           by a shard of metal debris.  She’s down.

                                 MALIK
                        Kristen!

           Malik fires away at the warship swirling overhead.  Tyler 
           blacks out once again.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. ROAD - NIGHT

           Miles of nothing in all directions.  A strong wind brings the 
           sting of the dust.
           Tyler’s P.O.V. as Malik heats up the barrel of his gun.  
           Kristen’s sitting on the road beside Tyler.  Her arm’s a 
           bloody mess.  

           Malik leans down to Kristen.  She takes a few quick power 
           breaths, readying herself.  

           Kristen nods to Malik.  She’s ready.  Malik lays the red hot 
           barrel of his gun against her wound.  Kristen screams out.

                                                              BLACKOUT.

           IN THE DARKNESS

           Another voice speaks to Tyler.

                                 FEMALE VOICE
                        Tyler...

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - CENTRAL PARK

           A beautiful summer day.  Softball fields in the background.  
           Kids playing in the sandbox.  

           Tyler sits on a park bench.  His son, Kevin, at the top of a 
           slide, flashes a bright smile.  

           There’s a woman, sitting back to back with Tyler on a park 
           bench.  It is his wife, Samantha.  

           A break from reality?  A fever induced dream?  Whatever it 
           is, for Tyler, it’s real.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Kevin made his first snow angel.  
                        And he knows how to ride a bike 
                        now.  He was so embarrassed using 
                        those training wheels.   

                                 TYLER
                        I remember that.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        We talk about you all the time.

           Tyler watches Kevin playing in the sandbox.  Kevin gives a 
           heartbreaking wave and a smile to Tyler.

                                 TYLER
                        He’s still seven.  My God.  He’s 
                        still seven. 
           From a place beyond the park, a voice calls out:

                                 KRISTEN (V.O.)
                        Tyler!

                                 SAMANTHA
                        She sounds nice.  Kristen.  She 
                        likes you, and you like her.  

                                 TYLER
                        We’re still married.  We never got 
                        divorced.  We never fell out of 
                        love, or had a fight.  

           Tyler turns around to Samantha who is still as beautiful as 
           the day he said good-bye.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        We’re still married.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        If you need to hear me say it, then 
                        I’ll say it... it’s okay.  I want 
                        you to be happy. 

           Tyler turns back around.  The sandbox is empty.  Kevin’s 
           gone.  The trees are dying.  Tyler’s hands are beginning to 
           shake.  Tyler turns back around.  Samantha’s gone.  He gets 
           up and runs through the park-- across the barren softball 
           field, through a gathering of trees as we...

                                                              BLACKOUT.

           FADE IN:

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAWN 

           ON TYLER

           His eyes flutter open.  He squints into the rising sun 
           shining through the window.  

           Things come into focus.  A blackboard.  Crayon drawings hung 
           up around the room.  The letters of the alphabet taped above 
           the blackboard.

           Tyler’s laid out over the teacher’s desk.  And every so often 
           there’s a LOUD BANGING coming from outside.  

           Malik is over by the window across the room.  Kristen sits 
           beside Tyler.  Her arm is bandaged.  She looks like hell.  
                                 KRISTEN
                             (with a brave face)
                        Hey.

                                 TYLER
                        Hey.

           BOOM.  BOOM.  

           The force is enough to rattle the room.  Tyler feels the red, 
           wet gauze over his shoulder wound.  He pulls it back to see 
           it’s raw and infected. 

           BOOM.  BOOM.  BOOM.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Where are we? 

                                 KRISTEN
                        We’re in a high school, just east 
                        of the base. 

                                 TYLER
                        The base?  We’re here?

                                 KRISTEN
                        We’re less than a half mile away 
                        from the facility.  

           BOOM.  BOOM.

                                 TYLER
                        What’s that sound?

                                 MALIK
                        That, is them.

           Tyler gets up.  He’s even weaker now.  Frail in body.  His 
           legs are rubbery, but he’s on his feet.  He moves to the 
           window with a full view of the dilapidated school yard.  
           Beyond that, a rotting football field thick with weeds. 

           Tyler presses against the window, searching for movement in 
           the darkness.

                                 TYLER
                        I can’t see a--

           WHOOM.  An alien dog throws its body against the window, 

                                 MALIK
                             (calls out)
                        Board.
           Kristen tosses a board.  Malik catches it.  They’ve become a 
           good team as Malik hammers the board against the window. 
           Tyler stares out through another section of unboarded window.  
           Out in the yard, an ALIEN DOG circles around the abandoned 
           swings.

           Tyler goes into a coughing fit.  Spits up blood.  It’s 
           painful -- watching someone die.  But that’s all Kristen and 
           Malik can do.  Tyler knows they’re watching him.

                                 TYLER
                        How are we on ammo?

                                 MALIK
                        Ain’t no more ammo, or food, or 
                        water. 

           That silence is the wind being knocked out of Tyler.

                                 TYLER 
                        Are all the exits secure?  Every 
                        door.  Every window.

                                 MALIK
                        Yeah.

                                 TYLER 
                        We’ll walk the halls in shifts -- 
                        checking and rechecking every lock 
                        and window latch.

                                 MALIK
                        And then what?

                                 TYLER
                        Let’s just sit for a while -- see 
                        what it does.

           Tyler reads the look on Malik and Kristen’s face.  Confidence 
           is at an all-time low.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Let’s see what happens.

           EXT. SCHOOLYARD - LATER

           The dog slams its body against the door -- hungry for a way 
           in.  

           INT. HALLWAY 

           Malik walks the halls, checking the exit door.
           INT. CLASSROOM

           Tyler’s sitting in small chair at a small desk built for a 
           5th grader.  He’s writing in a journal.  The banging from 
           outside is jarring.  BOOM.  BOOM. BOOM.  

           Kristen walks in and spots Tyler writing at the desk.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Is that my journal?

           Tyler stands up.  Busted.  He holds up the journal, checking 
           out the cover and inside binder.

                                 TYLER
                        Yes.  Yes it is.

                                 KRISTEN 
                        You were reading my journal?

                                 TYLER
                        Me?  No.  But if I was, I’d ask who 
                        Robbie is.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Robbie?  Robbie was my fifth grade 
                        crush, and you’re an ass.

           BOOM.  BOOM.  BOOM.

           Kristen snatches the journal back.  She flips to the back 
           page and reads silently.

                                 TYLER
                        You weren’t suppose to read that 
                        now.

           Kristen looks up.  Her eyes are filled with tears.  She shuts 
           the book.  They share a look of mutual understanding that’s 
           broken by the teeth rattling sound of an EXPLOSION. 

                                 KRISTEN 
                        Was that a sonic boom?  

                                 TYLER
                        Yes.

           Tyler moves to the window.  Malik rushes in.  

           Outside, in the pitch black night, standing beside the alien 
           dog is the silhouette of a human looking shape marching out 
           from the dark.
                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        We have to go.

           A crash can be heard from down the hall.

                                 MALIK 
                        They’re in the building!

           Tyler rips off the boards from the window.  

           An alien dog spots Tyler and charges. 

           Tyler bails on the escape route and runs out into...

           INT. HALLWAY

           Tyler and the group are frozen.  Down the hall, the alien 
           humanoid is blocking their path.  It charges at the group in 
           a full out sprint.  

           Tyler and the group take off running.  Tyler’s moving slowly, 
           bringing up the rear.  He collapses to the ground.

                                 MALIK
                        Come on!!!

           Malik and Kristen get Tyler up and running again -- racing 
           through an exit door.

           EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

           Kristen and Malik keep Tyler on his feet.  The sky begins to 
           crackle.  A low sound of thunder.  An audible surge of energy 
           and power.

                                 TYLER
                        Get down!

           A concentrated surge of blue energy and fire hits the school, 
           blowing up the entire building, obliterating the dogs inside.

           Rising up from behind the dust and flames is not one, but TWO 
           ALIEN WARSHIPS.  Tyler, Kristen and Malik take off towards 
           the...

           HIGHWAY

           There’s a fence across the road.  The sign reads WESTMORELAND 
           AIR FORCE BASE.  Malik helps Kristen over the fence.  Tyler 
           grabs onto the links of the fence, unable to pull himself up.
                                 MALIK
                        Come on solider!  Get up that 
                        fence!  Get up!

           Tyler tries, then falls to the ground.  The warship begins to 
           power up again.  Malik gets Tyler up on his feet.

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                        Come on.  You can do this.  Pull 
                        yourself up. 

           Tyler grabs the fence.  It’s a struggle, but Tyler climbs 
           over, crashing down to the grounds of the Air Force Base on 
           the other side.

           The warship sends a burst of energy, tearing up the road 
           alongside the fence.  Malik starts to scale the fence, but 
           stops.  Behind him is an alien humanoid.  

           Malik climbs off the fence.

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                        I’ll catch up.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Malik--

                                 MALIK
                        Go!

           Kristen helps Tyler up to his feet as they make a run for it.  
           Malik turns back to the alien.

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)

                        8th in the world.

           The alien charges.  Malik puts his hands up.  He dips, then 
           throws a right hand that misses.  

           The alien SLAMS Malik against the fence.  It throws a right 
           hand of its own, knocking Malik to the ground.  

           Malik gets to his feet.  Blinks off the pain.  Malik swings 
           and misses again.  The rust is evident.  His timing’s shit.  

           The alien humanoid connects with a right hand to Malik’s 
           face, dropping him to the ground.  Malik looks up, spotting 
           Tyler and Kristen a safe distance away.  

           The alien stands over Malik and begins to pound on his face.  
           In seconds, Malik is a bloody mess.  Never has he had an ass 
           whooping like this.  Malik gets up on his feet.  He’s wobbly, 
           spitting out blood.  
           Malik cocks his hand back but catches another punch to the 
           face, knocking him to the ground.    

           The alien flashes its teeth -- ready to kill when in one 
           motion, Malik springs up and connects with a vicious right 
           hand to the alien’s head, snapping its head back.  Knockout.

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                        24 and 0.

           EXT. WESTMORELAND AIR FORCE BASE - DAY

           Kristen keeps Tyler on his feet.  

           They run through the main road of the base, coming up on 
           another section of gates.  These gates are busted open and 
           are marked WARNING: NATIONAL DEFENSE AREA. 

           ON THE TWO WARSHIPS

           Moving over the outer gates of the air base.

           BACK TO TYLER

           Barely on his feet. Struggling.  Fading.  They cross a row of 
           barracks, past the 319th Missile Squadron sign.

                                 KRISTEN
                        We’re almost there. 

           Tyler picks up the pace -- fueled by adrenaline.  Tyler 
           starts to run on his own, growing strength from hope.

                                 TYLER
                        We’re here.  We’re here!

           Tyler and Kristen slow to a walk, then to a full stop, 
           staring ahead.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        No.

                                 KRISTEN
                        That can’t be right.  This isn’t 
                        right.

           Malik has caught up with Tyler and Kristen.  They all stare 
           straight ahead -- numb.  No one can believe what they’re 
           seeing.  In front of them is their destination...
           EXT. MISSILE ALERT FACILITY 

           Destroyed.  Nothing left but twisted metal and rubble.  

           Tyler has nothing left.  His legs betray him as he falls to 
           the ground.  Kristen kneels down to Tyler.  They stare up at 
           the remains of the facility -- their hopes and dreams, now 
           twisted metal.

                                 TYLER
                        All this way.  All these miles.  
                        For this?

           THE WARSHIPS

           Moving over the barracks -- hovering over Tyler and Kristen.  
           The ships begin to hum... powering up.  This is what the end 
           looks like.  Before the warship has a chance to fire...

           A MISSILE sails over the missile facility and strikes the 
           warship.  

           Another missile flies overhead, racing across the sky, taking 
           out the second warship.    

           The ground begins slide back, revealing a massive rampway for 
           an UNDERGROUND TUNNEL.  Pouring out of the tunnel is the 90TH 
           MISSILE SECURITY FORCES SQUADRON.

           SOLDIERS run up the ramp on foot, flanking a caravan of 
           HUMVEES coming up from the underground tunnel, surrounding 
           Tyler, Malik and Kristen.  

           COMMANDER BILLETT, 50’s, steps out of the Humvee and 
           approaches Tyler’s fallen body.

                                 COMMANDER BILLETT
                        You the guy?

           Tyler nods.  It’s all he’s capable of right now.

           Thunder sounds.  A SONIC BOOM.  In the horizon, with the 
           rising sun, comes...

           THE MOTHERSHIP

           Moving over the base.  The force and turbulence it takes to 
           move this thing rumbles the earth.

                                 MALIK
                        The gang’s all here now.
                                 COMMANDER BILLETT
                        Everybody underground, now!!!

           The soldiers scramble, loading Tyler into the Humvee.  They 
           lay him down a little too hard.

                                 COMMANDER BILLETT (CONT’D)
                             (to the soldier)
                        Like your son!  Like he was one of 
                        your own!

           Billett gives Tyler a “hang in there” look.  

           Soldiers push away mounds of thick brush and weeds revealing 
           a...

           TWO LANE HIGHWAY LEADING STRAIGHT INTO THE GROUND.

           Kristen and Malik board Tyler’s transport Humvee.  The 
           caravan drives down the highway leading underground.  The 
           soldiers re-camouflage the entrance.

           INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL 

           The convoy comes to a stop as Tyler is hustled off.  This is 
           a well rehearsed drill as the soldiers do not miss a beat.  
           They carry Tyler into OPERATING ROOM 7.

                                 KRISTEN
                             (to Commander Billett)
                        All these years.  We were never 
                        sure if you were listening.

                                 COMMANDER BILLETT
                        In the first three years, six of 
                        our bases were compromised because 
                        of vulnerabilities in our COM.  We 
                        had to stay silent.  We listened,  
                        and we heard you.

           EXT. WESTMORELAND AIR FORCE BASE - ABOVE GROUND

           Even more warships depart from the Mothership.  But these are 
           different.  

           Shaped almost like mosquitos, and for a reason.  A long black 
           tube starts to slither out from the back of the ship, 
           attaching itself to the ground.  

           The ship powers up and sends repeated charges of concentrated 
           lightening down to the ground.  They’re digging.  
           The dirt and concrete churn, rising up the funnel, spewing 
           out from the top of the warship-- now pulverized in powder 
           form.

           INT. OPERATING ROOM 7 - SAME

           Kristen and Malik walk into a bare bones operating room.  
           Commander Billett enters and confers with the doctors.  
           Tyler’s shirtless on a stretcher in the middle of the room.

           An EIGHT PRONGED MACHINE hovers over Tyler’s chest, similar 
           to the one back in New York, but bigger.  Commander Billett 
           steps up to Tyler, prone on the table.  

                                 COMMANDER BILLETT
                        We’re going to extract the uranium 
                        from your blood now.  The lab work 
                        showed considerable damage.  We’ll 
                        do all we can.

                                 KRISTEN
                        That’s not enough.  He has to live.

                                 COMMANDER BILLETT
                        Believe me, I want to save him just 
                        as much as you do.

                                 KRISTEN
                        No, you don’t.

           And with those three words, Commander Billett understands.

                                 TYLER
                        Kristen, they got a job to do.  Let 
                        them do it.

                                 KRISTEN
                        You have to live.  I’m supposed to 
                        keep you alive.

                                 TYLER
                        And you did.  

           Kristen promised herself she wouldn’t cry.  She’s breaking 
           her promise.  Explosions come from above.

                                 COMMANDER BILLETT
                        The process won’t be comfortable.  
                        You understand what I’m saying?

           Tyler nods.
                                 COMMANDER BILLETT (CONT’D)
                        We’ll try to leave you with enough 
                        blood for a fighting chance of 
                        survival, but we can’t know how 
                        much--

                                 TYLER
                        --Give the order.  

           Commander Billett hesitates, feeling for the hero on the 
           table.  He gives the nod to two DOCTORS.  They strap Tyler 
           down to the table.

                                 COMMANDER BILLETT
                        This is for your benefit.  It hurts 
                        more when you move.

           Tyler looks up at Kristen and Malik who watch it all, their 
           throats tight with emotion.

           The eight pronged machine hums, powering up.  It lowers 
           inches from Tyler.  A needle extends out from the metallic 
           tentacles, PLUNGING into Tyler’s arms and chest.

           Tyler SCREAMS out.  With all the science and technology, it’s 
           still painful.  

           The blood drains from Tyler’s body, digested into the chest 
           of the machine hovering over him where a loud and powerful 
           centrifugation takes place.  

           One metallic tube fills with his blood.  But the real gold is 
           the metallic canister filling with uranium.

           Kristen looks up at Tyler’s vital signs.  They’re weakening.  
           Commander Billett turns to a member of the MISSILE SECURITY 
           FORCE sitting behind a monitor.

                                 COMMANDER BILLETT (CONT’D)
                        Do we have it?

           He shakes his head no.  The ceiling begins to crack.  Tyler 
           fights, holding onto life -- watching the blood draining from 
           his body.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        You’re killing him!

           Commander Billett is watching him die and it’s insufferable.

                                 COMMANDER BILLETT
                        Do we have it!?

           After an agonizing beat...
                                 SECURITY FORCE PERSONNEL
                        We got it!  Executing the transfer!

           The metallic canister is quickly relayed from the 90th 
           Missile Security Force Member to the 321ST MISSILE SQUADRON 
           LEADER.

                                 COMMANDER BILLETT
                        Go, go, go!!!

           The squadron leader bursts out the door, flanked by a 
           protective team of armed squadron members.

           ABOVE GROUND,

           Warships continues to burrow into the ground, expelling 
           concrete and dirt at an alarming speed.

           INT. AIR FORCE BASE - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL

           The squadron leader takes a hard left into a maze of...

           CATWALKS

           Multi-level walkways all zip zagging one another 100 feet off 
           the ground.  

           The squadron leader takes a hard right to the walkway leading 
           to the LAUNCH CONTROL CENTER.  

           The squadron leader is half way across when...

           BOOM

           The warship breaches the concrete support, weakening the 
           walls that hold the catwalk in place.  One by one, the 
           catwalks rip away -- slamming into the squadron’s catwalk.  

           Another walkway crashes on top of them as squadron members 
           are crushed under the weight.  Their catwalk is starting to 
           buckle.  

           ON THE SQUADRON LEADER

           Picking up speed.  The metallic cannister, wobbly in his 
           hand.  We hear the steel bending.  Bolts fly out of the wall.  
           The catwalk snaps away from the wall, crashing onto a walkway 
           below.  

           The armed guards protecting the squadron leader are unable to 
           hold on, falling one by one... 
           ...leaving us with the squadron leader... the one holding the 
           uranium -- dangling -- holding onto the steel mesh of the 
           catwalk with one hand while holding earth’s last hope in the 
           other.  

           The steel mesh is ripping into his hand.  He has to drop the 
           container to live.  

           He’s slipping... unable to hold on.

                                 SQUADRON LEADER
                        God!!!

           The squadron leader lets go... but is caught by another hand.  
           Strong.  Powerful.  A hand belonging to...

           MALIK

                                 MALIK
                        Gimme the cannister!

           The squadron leader reaches up and gives Malik the cannister.  
           Malik now finds himself in the same dilemma.  With the 
           uranium in one hand, and the dangling squadron leader in the 
           other.  Malik is out of options -- but he’s not ready to 
           choose.

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                        Hold on!

                                 SQUADRON LEADER
                        My name is Jeff Malley.  ICBM 
                        Squadron leader.

                                 MALIK
                        No.  Don’t you do it!

                                 SQUADRON LEADER
                        Son of Chuck and Janet Malley.  Mt. 
                        Holly Springs, Pennsylvania.

                                 MALIK
                        Don’t do it!

           Squadron Leader Jeff Malley lets go of Malik’s hand, smashing 
           into a pile of crumbled catwalk 100 feet below.  Malik gets 
           it together, and scales the steel mesh of the catwalk, making 
           it to the other side.

           INT. LAUNCH CONTROL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Malik hustles up to the door.  It’s locked.  Cameras watch 
           him from above.
                                 MALIK
                        You gotta be kidding me.  Look!
                             (holds up the canister)
                        I got the shit!

           Silence.  They’re not opening.  They’ve been trained not to.

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                        Look, forget the protocol, all the 
                        years of training and just... we’re 
                        running out of time!  Open the 
                        door!

           Exhausted, Malik leans against the door.  He has nothing 
           left.

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                        His name was Jeff Malley.  Son of 
                        Chuck and Janet Malley.  Mt. Holly 
                        Springs, Pennsylvania.  He gave his 
                        life for this.  A lot of good 
                        people gave their life for this.  
                        Don’t let them all die for nothing.

           Silence.  Then a whoosh as the doors open.  Malik’s met by 
           the...

           ICBM SQUADRON

           An ICBM TEAM LEADER steps up, grabs the container, and makes 
           a run for it.  

                                 MALIK (CONT’D)
                             (yells out)
                        A “thank you” would be nice!

           Malik walks through the door and into...

           INT. STRATCOM COMMAND CENTER

           Busy.  Chaotic.  

           The ICBM leader watches Malik taking it in.

                                 ICBM TEAM LEADER
                        Welcome to STRATCOM Task Force 214.

           Malik turns to a wall made of thick glass, looking down into 
           the...
           MISSILE SILO

           The ICBM CREW transfers the newly acquired uranium into a W-
           87 WARHEAD.  The crew backs away, giving the thumbs up. 

                                 ICBM CREW MEMBER
                        Take her up!

           A crane lifts the warhead up, and positions it above a 
           MINUTEMAN III MISSILE.  Malik watches it all from behind the 
           glass.  The room rattles.  Malik looks up to the monitors, 
           watching the warship dig into the earth.  

                                 MALIK
                        Is that all happening in real time?

                                 ICBM TEAM LEADER
                        On my mark.  60 seconds.

           INT. OPERATING ROOM 7

           Kristen and Tyler are the only two people in the room. No 
           need for doctors and nurses anymore.  No way does Kristen 
           leave Tyler’s bedside.

                                 ICBM TEAM LEADER (V.O.)

                                                                CUT TO:

           ABOVE GROUND,

           The alien warships continue to dig, spitting out rock.

                                 ICBM TEAM LEADER (V.O.)

           INT. UNDERGROUND CATWALK - SAME

           The warships have fully breached the catwalks as concrete 
           rains down, taking out the remaining catwalks.

                                 ICBM TEAM LEADER (V.O.)

           INT. HALLWAY - STRATCOM COMMAND CENTER

           Men and woman are on their knees.  Hands clasped together, 
           deep in prayer.
                                 ICBM TEAM LEADER (V.O.)

           INT. STRATCOM COMMAND CENTER

           All eyes are on the digital clock.  Three... two... one... 

                                 ICBM TEAM LEADER
                        Fire.

           EXT. MISSILE SILO - AIR FORCE BASE - SAME

           The Minuteman III jets out from the silo, flying over the 
           WARSHIP digging up rock -- on a direct path towards the 
           mothership.  

           The warship aborts its mission, ripping away from the black 
           funnel drill, and flies up in the direction of the missile.  
           The warship begins to pick up speed -- bearing down on its 
           target.  It begins to hum... charging up for a blast.

           The warship FIRES a charge of lightening that cracks through 
           the sky.  The missile evades the lightening bolt, but its 
           evasive action causes it to miss the mothership entirely.

           INT. STRATCOM COMMAND CENTER - SAME

           Malik watches it all from the monitor in horror.  

           He looks to the smiling ICBM leader standing beside him

                                 MALIK
                        What?

           THE MISSILE

           Continues upwards into the sky, and then begins to dip back 
           down towards earth.

           INT. STRATCOM COMMAND CENTER - SAME

           Everyone watches the overhead monitor capturing real time 
           video from the missile’s internal guidance system.  

           It zeros in on a small tiny crack on the mothership.  

                                 MALIK
                        Mo-ther f’er.  
           THE MISSILE

           Dives straight into the mothership’s crack and explodes with 
           the force of 500,000 tons of TNT.  Through the growing 
           mushroom cloud, we see the fire and explosions taking place 
           at the point of impact.

           What was once a crack is now a gaping hole going down the 
           middle of the ship.  Explosions break out all over face of 
           the mothership.  

           Gravity starts to take the mothership down, now a flaming 
           fireball as she falls from Heaven, hitting the ground.  The 
           force of impact sends dust and debris up to the sky.  

           INT. STRATCOM COMMAND CENTER - SAME

           The room cheers as Malik stands in the back. His face is a 
           cocktail of relief, joy, and pain.  The roar of the cheers 
           makes its way to...

           INT. OPERATING ROOM 7 - SAME

           Kristen sits beside a weakening Tyler.  She moves to the door 
           and opens it to find people hugging each other in 
           celebration.

                                 KRISTEN
                        They’re celebrating.  We’re 
                        celebrating!!!

           Kristen turns back.  Her smile fades away.  

           ON TYLER

           His eyes, glazed over in a death stare.  He’s gone.  We’ll 
           never really know if he lived to know the fate of the world.  
           Kristen kisses him one last time, shuts his eyes, and rests 
           her head on his chest.

                                 TYLER (V.O.)
                        I wonder how it will be.  

           EXT. FIELD

           Military vehicles surround the burning mothership.  

           The faces on the soldiers are ones of exhilaration and 
           exhaustion.  
           They hug and high-five each other.  It’s a moment of 
           celebration.

                                 TYLER (V.O.)
                        When the last fight is fought.

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           TANKS and JEEPS move towards a battle in the far distance.  
           Another convoy is heading in the opposite direction.  It’s 
           filled with aliens, now DETAINEES.

                                 TYLER (V.O.)
                        The day when normalcy finds its 
                        place in the world again.

           EXT. AIRPORT RUNWAY

           A crowd swarms a RED CROSS CARGO plane on the tarmac.  No 
           food on this plane.  Its shipment:

           FAMILIES

           Parents, grandparents-- people of every age running down the 
           steps of the plane.  

           Some jump into the arms of waiting husbands, children.  
           Others search for a familiar face, and find none.

                                 TYLER (V.O.)
                        Will we learn to love more?  Be 
                        better friends, husbands, parents?

           EXT. UNITED NATIONS - NIGHT

           Cranes work through the night, repairing the hole atop of the 
           United Nations Dome.  

           The cranes all bear different flags... Japan, England, Korea.  
           The flags of the United Nations rise up into the sky.

                                 TYLER (V.O.)
                        I want to believe we’ll be better 
                        this time around.  To ourselves.  
                        To each other.  To our planet.
           EXT. HUDSON RIVER - DAY

           Cranes fixed atop Navy ships hoist The Statue of Liberty up 
           from the river.  Cracked, and weathered, yet still beautiful 
           after all these years.

           EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY

           A massive crowd is gathered.  Malik stands at the podium, a 
           cord in his hands, looking out to a sea of people.  

           Malik pulls the cord.  The sheet behind him floats down to 
           the ground revealing...

           A STATUE

           A stone sculpture of Tyler, Kristen, and Malik standing 
           together on top of a hill.  

           The crowd cheers on.  Malik looks over to a ceremonial empty 
           chair on the platform.

                                 TYLER (V.O.)
                        Know that I am there with you.  

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           TITLE: LAKE WINNIPESAUKEE - NEW HAMPSHIRE 

           If there is a trace of Eden, it’s this place.  A beautiful 
           house set by the lake.  Kristen walks out to the porch and 
           sits on a swing.  

           Kristen pushes aside old gossip magazines and picks up her 
           journal-- flipping to the back page.  She’s reading Tyler’s 
           entry. 

                                 TYLER (V.O.)
                        Sitting on a swing.  Making plans 
                        for our future.  Beautiful plans.  
                        And you’ll remember our deal...

           PAN DOWN to see Kristen holding her pregnant belly. 

                                 TYLER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Keep me alive.  Always.

           Kristen closes her eyes and remembers.
                                 TYLER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        These are the better days.  We have 
                        our lives back.

           FLOAT UP from the house -- over the lake.  Far enough that we 
           see the whole of the United States.  

           Push back further until we see...

           EARTH

           Never has she been this beautiful.  

                                 TYLER (V.O.)
                        We have our lives back.

                                                              FADE OUT.
