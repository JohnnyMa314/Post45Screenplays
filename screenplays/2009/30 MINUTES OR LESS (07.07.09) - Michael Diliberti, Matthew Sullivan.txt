         (cid:13)           The following is very loosely based on some shit that actually
           happened...
           OVER BLACK

           We hear the roar of a V8 engine, piped out through some
           throaty, fucked up muffler, as 

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           An '89 Mustang bursts like a shot over a rise in the highway. 
           It's got a rusted two-tone paint job, Maryland plates, and
           bald tires that scream as it peels off an exit and into the  

           EXT. SUBURBS - DAY

           The car fast approaches a stop sign, dangerously blows through
           the intersection.  

           INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING

           We don't see the DRIVER, only the redlining RPMs, Vans slip-
           ons working the pedals, wristwatch being checked.  The wheel
           cranks right as the car turns onto a - 

           One way street.  A minivan flies right at us.  The Mustang
           hops up onto the curb to avoid it, clips a trash can and -

           Garbage explodes like confetti.  The wipers engage, brushing
           the trash aside.  The car whips another turn and  

           EXT. SUBURBS - DAY

           The Mustang fishtails around a corner and skids away. 

                                                             CUT TO:

           TIRES SCREECH  

           Brake pads smoke.  The Mustang stops outside

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           The Driver jumps out of the car.  As he rushes to the front
           door, we see the urgent package he is delivering. 

           TWO LARGE PIZZAS

           Before he can ring the bell, the door opens and two smug 12-
           YEAR-OLDS stare out.  

                                 12-YEAR-OLD
                        That's 34 minutes.  You're 4 minutes
                        late.  Pizza's free. 

           REVEAL our guy staring back at the kids.  This is WILL (25),
           probably good looking in another life.  
           Right now, he is tired and unamused, wearing a red "Giorgio's
           Trattoria" hat and a sweaty matching t-shirt.  

                                 WILL
                        Gimme a break.  You guys live two
                        towns away.  It's pretty much fucking
                        impossible to get here in 30 minutes. 

                                 OTHER 12-YEAR-OLD
                        Exactly.  That's why we ordered from
                        your shitty "trattoria."  

                                 WILL
                        This is gonna come out of my paycheck. 
                        You sure you don't want to take the
                        moral high ground?

                                 OTHER 12-YEAR-OLD
                        We'd rather take the pizzas.   

           Will takes a calming breath.  Hands over the pizzas. 

                                 WILL
                        Ok.  You guys are pretty smart.  You
                        figured out a way to beat the system.  
                          (peeks inside)
                        Got the house to yourselves?

                                 12-YEAR-OLD
                        That's right. 

                                 WILL
                        Not bad.  Any jailbait in there? 
                        Little pizza and a rainbow party?

           The kids shakes their heads.  Will looks shocked. 

                                 WILL
                        Seriously?  Well, two hustlers like
                        yourselves gotta have the place
                        stocked with beer and whippits and
                        shit, right?  Just call the girls up
                        and let them know the party's on. 

                                 12-YEAR-OLD
                        Man, we don't have any of that stuff.  

           Will makes a show of mulling this over. 

                                 WILL
                        I really shouldn't do this...but you
                        seem like a couple of good dudes. 
                        I'll tell you what, you give me the
                        money that your mom left you for the
                        pizzas, and I'll grab you some beers.

                          (beat)
                        But I get to keep the change as a
                        tip.  Deal?

           The kids look at each other.  One of them hesitantly reaches
           into their pocket and pulls out some crumpled bills, starts
           to count them.  Will snatches all of the bills and heads off.  

                                 WILL
                        I'll see you in like 20 minutes.

           The kids look uncertain.  As if sensing this, Will stops
           before getting into his ride.  

                                 WILL
                        You boys like Budweiser, right?

                                 12-YEAR-OLD
                        Uh, yeah, totally.

                        Love that shit!

           INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING

           The sun sets.  Will is at the end of his shift.  He cruises
           back into his own middle-class town in suburban Maryland. 

           A six pack of Budweiser rests in the passenger seat.

           He stops at a light.  A Jeep Wrangler packed with TEENAGERS
           pulls alongside him, top down, pop music thumping.  Will
           checks out a PRETTY YOUNG THING.  She catches him looking,
           rolls her eyes.  The light turns and the Jeep skids away.  

           Will self consciously removes his "Giorgio's" cap. 

           INT. GIORGIO'S TRATTORIA - NIGHT

           A small pizza joint.  Will enters and nods at CHRISTOPHER
           (40s), the short manager.  His balding head is nearly
           translucent from absorbing a day's worth of pizza grease. 

                                 WILL
                        Yo, Chris.  Let me cash the fuck out.  

           Will hands over some cash to Christopher.  

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        You have a pretty good shift?

                                 WILL
                        For sure.

                        I mean, the part where I had to drop
                        off all those pizzas kinda sucked,
                        but the rest was cool.   

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Oh, yeah?  'Cause, I got some kids
                        calling in saying you ripped them
                        off.  Promised to buy them beer or
                        something. 

                                 WILL
                        I actually did buy the beer, but it
                        would have been illegal to give it
                        to them, right?  So I'm gonna do the
                        responsible thing and drink it myself. 

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        That's real funny.  But I'm trying
                        to run a business here. 

                                 WILL
                        What kind of business promises to
                        deliver anywhere in 30 minutes? 
                        It's ridiculous. 

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        I don't wanna hear another one of
                        your bullshit excuses.  You're fired.    

                                 WILL
                        Come on.  If I didn't need this job,
                        I wouldn't be doing this shitty job. 

           Chris is unmoving. 

                                 WILL
                        Fuck!  Whatever!

           Will storms out.  As he gets to the door - 

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        You know, you were an okay driver
                        half the time.  And you're not a
                        Puerto Rican.  Which means something
                        to me. 

                                 WILL
                        That's poignant. 

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        I guess I could rehire you, on a
                        provisional basis.  Of course, this
                        would be at the slightly reduced
                        "new company rate." 
                                 WILL
                        Are you fucking serious?

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        I don't know.  Is there anyone else
                        left in town for you to work for? 

           Will shakes his head.  Swallows what's left of his pride. 

                                 WILL
                        When do I start?

           EXT. SMALL APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Will sits on the darkened front stoop.  He tosses an empty
           can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer. 

           He looks over at a parked Hyundai Elantra.  A YOUNG MAN sits
           in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face.  He
           makes a sudden, surprised gasp.  The homely YOUNG WOMAN who
           was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges
           herself in the driver seat.  She leans over and gives him a
           long goodbye kiss.     

           The Young Man gets out and the car pulls away.  This is CHET
           (25), a clean cut guy dressed in the Gap Premium Collection. 
           He heads toward the building, high off his BJ, humming
           Outkast's "Ms. Jackson."  He stops suddenly when he notices
           Will sitting in the shadows of his porch. 

                                 CHET
                        What the hell?  Have you just been
                        sitting there?

                                 WILL
                        Yep.  Caught the whole show.  Really
                        classy move at the end.  You know,
                        the kiss.  Putting your tongue in
                        her mouth right after you fucked it.

                                 CHET
                        I'm pretty sure she chewed some gum
                        in between.  You must have missed it. 

                                 WILL
                        Dude, you know you can't lie to me.

                                 CHET
                        Okay, fine.  I had to.  I mean, she
                        drove.  And it was our second date. 
                        I'm in no position to be turning
                        down a post blow job kiss. 
                                 WILL
                        I guess you can't get action on a
                        second date without a little
                        collateral damage.  Have one of these.

           Will hands over a beer.

                                 WILL
                        The alcohol should wash the taste of
                        yourself out of your mouth.  

           Chet takes a slug of beer, gurgles for effect. 

                                 CHET
                        By the way, she said she had a friend. 
                        Maybe we can go on our first double
                        date since you tried to talk Jackie
                        Fortunato and her cousin into having
                        a four-way with us. 

                                 WILL
                        I swear I saw her drop E like three
                        times that night. 

                                 CHET
                        That was Mydol.  She was on her period.   

                                 WILL
                        That girl was always on her period. 

                                 CHET
                        Yeah.  What a bitch. 

           Will picks up some rented movies sitting beside him. 

                                 WILL
                        Come on.  Let's go inside, drink
                        your beer and watch shit get crazy. 
                          (fans movies)
                        Old favorites.  You choose.  Man on
                        Fire, The Last Boy Scout...that third
                        one is a porn.  So it's really between
                        the two.  

                                 CHET
                        I choose sleep.  I gotta teach a
                        class at eight.

                                 WILL
                        You're a sub.  Just call in sick. 
                        Like the real teacher did. 

                                 CHET
                        Come on, man, you know I got promoted
                        to full-time last month.

           Will heaves a sigh. 

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, I know.  I guess I'm just having
                        a hard time accepting you as "the
                        man."  You know, flunking kids, giving
                        out spite detentions to girls you
                        wanna fuck, laser pointing at shit.

                                 CHET
                        I also get healthcare and my summers
                        off.  It's not perfect, but it's a
                        career.         

                                 WILL
                        It's cool.  I get it, man.  Gotta
                        pay the bills.  I'll take my flicks
                        and roll. 

           Will grudgingly gets up.  He gathers his stuff and heads
           off.  Chet watches him go.  After a beat, he calls after him - 

                                 CHET
                        Hey, this weekend, we'll hang out. 
                        We'll watch Lethal Weapon.  The whole
                        trilogy! 

                                 WILL
                          (without breaking stride)
                        There's four of them!  You better
                        clear your whole Saturday!

           INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY

           Will wakes up, legs dangling over the edge of a tiny couch. 
           His TV is still on, displaying the menu screen from a porn.  

           Will stretches, looks down at his coffee table.  He clears
           some magazines to reveal a file folder.  He touches it,
           carefully, like the contents are radioactive.  Flips the cover -  

           It's full of college applications, drafts of admissions essays,
           a junior college transcript.  Will thumbs through one of the
           glossy applications.  The kids look young.  Very young.  

           After a beat, Will glances over at a picture on his wall: he
           and Chet at high school graduation, looking just as young. 
           They have their arms around a pretty girl squeezed between
           them.  Will and the girl look very high and very happy. 

           Will shuts the folder, slides it back under the coffee table
           debris.  He looks over at a clock: it is already 2:00 PM.
                                 WILL
                        Fuck. 

           Will grabs his stuff and rushes out the door.  

           INT. MUSTANG - DAY

           Will hops in and starts the engine.  As he tucks his
           "Giorgio's" cap onto his head, he catches his reflection in
           the rear-view mirror.  He stares at himself in the dumb hat. 

                                 WILL
                        You asshole.  You titanic asshole. 
                        Come on down and get your prize.   

           He makes his fingers into a gun, puts it to his head...pulls
           the trigger and 

           BOOM!

           We're in

           EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY

           A watermelon explodes in a shower of red, juicy bits.  Loud,
           dumb laughter echoes.  

           Standing 20 yards away is DWAYNE (32), an intense, meaty guy
           in a sleeveless Baltimore Ravens t-shirt.  On his left bicep
           is a tattoo of the Tasmanian Devil flipping the bird. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Fruit motherfuckin' salad!

           Crouched beside him is JAY (27), tall and awkward, in thick
           glasses and a wool surplus cap.  He carefully rigs homemade
           explosives to another watermelon, then looks up at Dwayne,
           eager to please. 

                                 JAY
                        This one's gonna blow even bigger.

                                 DWAYNE
                        Boy, if you weren't such a skinny
                        little bitch you coulda been in the
                        military or something.   

                                 JAY
                        Whatever.  I don't need the military. 
                        I taught myself how to do this shit.

                                 DWAYNE
                        I hear that.  I taught myself how to
                        eat pussy.  And cut my own hair. 
           Jay jogs the watermelon a safe distance away.  He returns
           and pulls out a detonator.  Dwayne snatches it.  

                                 DWAYNE
                        This one's all me. 
                          (makes "radio" sounds)
                        Mr. President, we have enemies at
                        the gate.  Give me the order.
                          (more "radio" sounds)
                        Fuck that, sir.  I don't negotiate
                        with terrorists! 

           Dwayne presses a button and 

           BOOM!  

           The explosion is so powerful that it sprinkles our guys'
           smiling faces with fruit juice. 

           INT. KITCHEN, NICE HOUSE - DAY

           Large and late-80s chic.  Dwayne and Jay have the fridge
           open, fixing themselves a cold cut plate.  Dwayne is debating
           the amount of meat on the plate...adds some more. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Wanna make sure I get enough calories. 

                                 JAY
                        I thought you wanted to get diesel
                        for the summer.  Bang that towel
                        girl at the community pool. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        It's obvious you don't know shit-all
                        about physical fitness.  You gotta
                        bulk up first, then you slim down. 
                        I'm clearly in the bulk up phase.  I
                        told you to watch Pumping Iron like
                        a month ago.  If you'd listened to
                        me, maybe you'd know what the fuck
                        I'm talking about.
                          (beat)
                        Grab some RC Cola. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY

           The shades are drawn.  We hear a girl scream bloody murder!  

           The guys are watching FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3...in 3D.  They
           both wear cheap cardboard glasses.  

           Jay jumps back as Jason wields a 3D ax. 
                                 JAY
                        Shit, man!  It's so real! 

           Dwayne reaches out, "touching" the 3D images.  He stands up
           and starts humping the air. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Check it out.  I ain't afraid of
                        Jason.  I'm fucking him.
                          (thrusting harder)
                        You like that, Jason!?  In the mask!    

           Jay cracks up.  Suddenly, the lights flick on.  

                                 GRIZZLED VOICE (O.S.)
                        Who are you two fags fucking?

           Standing by the switch is Dwayne's dad, JERRY (70s).  Most
           people just call him "THE MAJOR."  The faded USMC tattoo on
           his thick forearm explains why.

                                 JAY
                        Afternoon, Major. 

           Dwayne flops back onto the couch. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Dad, we're watching a flick.  We got
                        45 minutes and a potential 3D sex
                        scene left.  You're sorta coming in
                        at the worst possible moment. 

                                 MAJOR
                        I bought that TV set so I could watch
                        my programs, not so you and your
                        friend could louse up my couch.  

                                 DWAYNE
                        You gotta learn how to share the
                        common space. 

                                 MAJOR
                        The only thing common in this house
                        is you.  You remind me of your damn
                        mother.  Fat, dumb, and in my way. 

           The Major grabs Dwayne and pulls him up off the couch with
           surprising ease.  He gets right in his face...scary, intense. 
           Dwayne suddenly looks like a wounded animal.  He turns to Jay. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Let's get outta here.  This movie
                        sucks anyway.    
           Jay gets up and files out the door.  Dwayne goes to take the
           cold cut plate.  The Major grabs his arm.  

                                 MAJOR
                        I paid for the damn cold cuts, too. 
                        Maybe if you had a job, or a fucking
                        prospect, or a clue how to find any
                        of the above, I'd let you eat 'em.  

                                 DWAYNE
                          (quietly)
                        You know, you can be a real
                        sonofabitch, dad. 

                                 MAJOR
                        That's what it takes, boy.  In the
                        Corps, men like you wore dresses to
                        keep us entertained. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        That's pretty fucking disturbing!

           Dwayne storms off.  

           EXT. NICE HOUSE - DAY

           Dwayne and Jay head out, passing a brand new pickup truck in
           the driveway.  Dwayne spits on it. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Fuck The Major!  

           The guys get in Dwayne's shitty Ford Aerostar minivan.  One
           side view mirror has been knocked off and hangs limply by a
           wire.  They peel out.  

           INT. DIVE STRIP CLUB - DAY

           R. Kelly's "Ignition (Remix)" pumps.  

           Large, fake breasts, sparkling with cheap body glitter and
           pierced at the nipples, shake before us.  Their owner, JUICY
           (27), a petite Latina, grinds her ass into Dwayne's crotch
           as he pours his heart out, mid lap dance.

           Somewhere in the background, Jay hangs at the bar all alone. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        - and he thinks he knows me.  He
                        don't know shit.  I got ideas he
                        could never dream of.  I got plans
                        bigger than his fucking house.  
                          (beat)
                        He didn't even raise me.  My mother
                        did.  That was a good woman. 
           Juicy looks back over her shoulder at Dwayne, speaks with a
           sexy lisp. 

                                 JUICY
                        What happened to her, baby?

           Dwayne shifts, uncomfortably, at the sore subject. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        She passed on.  Don't get me talking
                        about my mother.  

                                 JUICY
                        You want me to mother you? 

                                 DWAYNE
                        You can let me nurse on them titties,
                        mamacita. 

                                 JUICY
                        You so loco, Dwayne.  You my big-D. 
                        Relax and forget about your old man. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        I wish I could forget about him for
                        good.  I'm only waiting around for
                        the asshole to drop dead.  Don't
                        wanna mess with my inheritance.  

           This piques Juicy's interest. 

                                 JUICY
                        What kinda inheritance?

                                 DWAYNE
                        When my dad got outta the service, he
                        started buying lotto tickets.  He'd
                        play his dog tag numbers.  In '87,
                        the fucker won five million bucks.  

           INSERT PHOTO: The Major holding a giant cardboard check. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        He had some health problems a few
                        years back, and since then he's been
                        burning through the money like an
                        NBA draft pick.  Probably only got a
                        million or two left.  But it's mine
                        as soon as he kicks. 

           Behind inch-long fake eyelashes, Juicy's shrewd eyes narrow,
           mind working. 
                                 JUICY
                        With a million bucks, you could have
                        anything.  Be like a king.
                          (almost a moan)
                        King Dwayne. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        That's right.  And maybe I'll make
                        you my queen.  Let you polish my
                        royal scepter. 

                                 JUICY
                        That sounds real nice.  

           Juicy straddles Dwayne, tightly.

                                 JUICY
                        Let me ask you a question, baby...do
                        you really hate your daddy?

                                 DWAYNE
                        Hate him like the Steelers. 

                                 JUICY
                        Then maybe I can help you get that
                        money now.  Before he spends another
                        penny.   

           Dwayne looks confused.  Juicy puts his hands on her breasts,
           empowering him. 

                                 JUICY
                        I know a guy in Baltimore.  He could
                        help you out.  Probably do it for...
                          (sizing him up)
                        ...100Gs. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Do what?

           Juicy leans in, whispers softly in Dwayne's ear -

                                 JUICY
                        Kill your mean old dad. 

           Dwayne's face is troubled, but curious, as he lets this
           possibility sink in. 

           INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING

           Will has one pizza left in the back of his car.  He pulls
           over and parks outside an office building. 

           Will grabs a clean button down shirt from the back seat and
           puts it on over his uniform t-shirt.  
           INT. HALLWAY, OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

           Will carries the pizza down the empty hallway.  He gets to
           an open office and looks in, enjoying what he sees for a
           moment, before announcing his presence with a knock.   

           KATE (25) looks up from her cluttered desk.  She has short,
           messy hair and a sarcastic smile.  She's gorgeous, despite
           being tired and stressed out.  This is the girl from the
           picture in Will's apartment.  

                                 KATE
                        You're very reliable. 

           Will lays the pizza down on her desk. 

                                 WILL
                        Predictable.  I'm predictable.  So
                        are you.  Friday night I always know
                        where to find you.

                                 KATE
                        I live a life of danger and intrigue. 
                        I just uploaded my story about the
                        Mayor's VFW fund-raiser. 

           Will checks out Kate's laptop.  It is logged onto the online
           edition of the Emberton Dispatch.  Kate's article has an
           accompanying picture of the kindly old MAYOR. 

                                 WILL
                        I'm telling you, I've always felt
                        that man has a dark side.  At the
                        very least, he's a homosexual. 

                                 KATE
                        I'm pretty certain he's not...

           Kate opens the pizza box and grabs a slice.  

                                 KATE
                        ...but you know who is?  Tom Small. 
                        He came out to me today on Facebook. 

                                 WILL
                        That kid beat the hell out of me and
                        Chet in grammar school.  Wow. 

                                 KATE
                        Tell me about it.  He fingered me at
                        junior prom while they were playing
                        "No Scrubs." 
                                 WILL
                          (winces)
                        Really?  What a fucking scrub. 

           Kate shrugs.  Will grabs a slice.  They eat quietly for a beat. 

                                 KATE
                        So, I've got some news...  

                                 WILL
                          (perks up)
                        Wait...are you breaking up with Mark?

                                 KATE
                        Actually, yes. 

           Will smiles broadly. 

                                 WILL
                        Good call.  Great call.  'Cause I saw
                        it getting serious, and I was worried. 
                        But you're doing the right thing.  
                          (beat)
                        It's because he's a lawyer, right? 
                        Fucking lawyers.  Doesn't impress
                        me, either. 

                                 KATE
                        No...it's because he didn't want to
                        move to Atlanta. 

                                 WILL
                        Who'd want to move to Atlanta? 

                                 KATE
                        Me.  That's what I was trying to
                        tell you.  I got offered a job at a
                        paper there.  Bigger market, pay
                        increase.  I do it for a few years
                        and I can be working in New York. 

           Will is gut-punched. 

                                 WILL
                        When did this happen?  Did you tell
                        your brother?

                                 KATE
                        Not yet.  You know how overprotective
                        Chet is.  Besides, I wanted to tell
                        you first. 
                          (beat)
                        What do you think?
                                 WILL
                        About Hot-lanta?  I know a bit about
                        it from rap music, and it sounds
                        like a fucked up place. 

                                 KATE
                        My dad's from Atlanta.  So's MLK,
                        and Coca-Cola.  It's a cool city. 

                                 WILL
                        Whatever.  They call it the "Dirty
                        South" for a reason.  I think you
                        should stay. 

                                 KATE
                        You're joking, right?  I mean, this
                        is everything I've been working
                        toward.  You're my friend, I want
                        you to be happy for me. 

           Kate looks at him, expectantly.  Will forces a smile. 

                                 WILL
                        Yeah...I was just messing around. 
                        I'm actually...I'm totally happy for
                        you.  I'll buy you a krunk CD or
                        something. 

           Kate laughs.  Will looks quietly devastated.  He has a lot
           more to say, but shoves his face with pizza instead. 

           INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

           Most of the PATRONS are fixated on an Orioles game playing
           loudly on a large flat-screen TV.

           At a booth in back, Dwayne and Jay are in deep conversation. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        He just dropped 30K on that fucking
                        truck.  Bought it in cash.  And the
                        TV last month, the sauna, all that
                        shit from The Sharper Image catalog. 
                        He's spending more than ever. 

                                 JAY
                        You gotta get to that money while
                        there's still money to get. 

           Dwayne nods seriously. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        You know, Jay, there's a reason I
                        sleep 'til noon everyday.  And it
                        ain't 'cause I'm lazy.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DWAYNE (CONT'D)
                        It's on account of me having so many
                        goddamn dreams.  Big ones.  And once
                        that money's mine, they're all gonna
                        come true.

           Dwayne takes a long sip of beer, contemplative. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        I had this one dream last night.  I
                        was cruising through town in a
                        Lamborghini Diablo.  The wind was
                        blowing through my hair, ruffling my
                        open shirt.  There was a hot little
                        piece of ass sitting next to me...and
                        you were in the jump seat, Jay. 
                        Strapped.  Wearing a pair of Oakleys. 

                                 JAY
                        That sounds pretty awesome. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        It was.  Do you know what it means?

                                 JAY
                        I don't.   

                                 DWAYNE
                        I didn't either.  So I consulted my
                        dream book, and found out it means
                        this: you're my road dog.  You got
                        my back.  That's why I want to make
                        you my partner.

                                 JAY
                        In what?

                                 DWAYNE
                        In crime.  And business.  You see, it
                        ain't just about the inheritance money. 
                        It's about what I'm gonna do with it. 

           Dwayne leans across the table, lowers his voice. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        I'm about to clue you in on something. 
                        And then you'll understand the true
                        magnitude of what's at stake here. 
                        Are you ready? 

                                 JAY
                        Yes.  I'm totally ready. 
                                 DWAYNE
                        Then answer me this...what's this
                        town missing?  I'll give you a hint. 
                        It's a cash business, crawling with
                        sexy bitches.  

                                 JAY
                          (beat)
                        A Chinese food restaurant?

                                 DWAYNE
                        No.  A tanning salon.
                          (beat)
                        Think about it.  All that green. 
                        All that brown flesh. 

           Jay nods, thinking about.  He smiles. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        It's also the perfect front for a
                        prostitution ring.  

                                 JAY
                        Yeah, of course.  Because of the
                        booths. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Yes.  And because of the bitches. 
                          (beat)
                        If you help me out here, it can all
                        be ours.  30 percent for you, 70
                        percent for me.  

                                 JAY
                        Fuck it, let's just kill your dad
                        ourselves.  

           Dwayne chuckles.

                                 DWAYNE
                        Here's a fact: they don't build
                        prisons for criminals, they build
                        them for idiots.  Shit, they got
                        three different types of CSI on TV,
                        just laying out how the police do
                        their business...and still, idiots
                        like you think you can just go out
                        and do a murder. 
                          (beat)
                        If you wanna be a millionaire, you
                        gotta think like one.  And
                        millionaires don't kill people. 
                        They hire highly trained assassins. 
                                 JAY
                        Millionaires have money to pay
                        assassins.  We don't. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Now we're addressing the real problem:
                        how do we get that 100 grand?  'Cause
                        once we get the 100 grand, we get
                        the million.  And once we get the
                        million, we will literally own this
                        town and every single thing in it.  

                                 JAY
                        Let's just...rob a bank.  One of
                        these local banks with nothing but a
                        dipshit security guard.  

                                 DWAYNE
                        Again, not quite thinking like a
                        millionaire.

                                 JAY
                        Okay, then let's hire someone to rob
                        a bank.  

           Dwayne shakes his head.  Then he stops, thinks about this
           for a second. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Fuck hiring them, we could just force
                        someone to rob a bank for us.  Like
                        with blackmail, or death threats, or -  

                                 JAY
                        A bomb.  A fucking bomb.

                                 DWAYNE
                        I was gonna say hypnotism...but the
                        bomb works.  I like that.  It's out
                        of the fucking box.  We put one in
                        some guy's living room, be like "rob
                        this bank or your shit blows up."

                                 JAY
                        Or we could could just strap it to
                        their chest, the same way we did to
                        those watermelons.  Slap a timer on
                        it, a lock.  Bingo.

                                 DWAYNE
                          (beat)
                        Can you actually build something
                        like that? 
                                 JAY
                        Yeah, man.  Camel jockeys do it in
                        caves.  I got a garage workshop. 
                        It'll take a few days.  

                                 DWAYNE
                        I want you to look me in the eyes,
                        Jay, because I probably won't ever
                        say this to you again.  But that is
                        a fucking genius plan.  I'm pretty
                        sure it's exactly how a millionaire
                        would do it.  

           Jay beams. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        But there is one problem.  Where do
                        we get our guy?  'Cause if we do a
                        kidnapping, then we're right back
                        where we started...doing shit that's
                        gonna get us caught. 
                          (mind working)
                        What we need is someone to come to
                        us...to a place where we can control
                        the situation.  Someone without any
                        connection to us.  

           The guys stare at each other, stumped.  Until something
           catches Dwayne's attention...a local commercial playing on
           the flat-screen.  A PIZZA CHEF slides a pizza into a box -     

                                 PIZZA CHEF
                          (on TV)
                        We'll deliver anywhere in 30 minutes
                        or less!  Or your pizza is free! 
                        Giorgio's Trattoria, where the
                        customer gets what they want...pronto!  

           The guys look at each other.

                                 DWAYNE
                        Sometimes fate just takes out its
                        cock and slaps you in the face with
                        it. 

           INT. CHET'S APARTMENT - DAY

           A hand grabs a beer from the fridge. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You're not trying to draw a psycho
                        pension...you really are crazy!

           Will pops the top off the beer, heads back into the living
           room and flops down on the couch.  
           The voice belongs to Danny Glover.  The guys are watching
           Lethal Weapon.  Murtaugh (Danny Glover) has just stopped
           Riggs (Mel Gibson) from killing himself.  Riggs looks at
           him, crazily, before - 

                                 RIGGS 
                          (on TV)
                        I'm hungry.  I'm gonna get something
                        to eat. 

           Chet looks over at Will.  He is already pretty drunk, and in
           a dark mood.  

                                 CHET
                        Maybe you should pace yourself.  We
                        got like three and a half movies
                        left here.  

                                 WILL
                        Fridge is full, man.  We're all good. 

           Will drains his beer.  After a beat - 

                                 WILL
                        Let me ask you a question.  You
                        remember Tom Small? 

                                 CHET
                        Yeah, he used to kick our asses. 

                                 WILL
                        Turns out he was probably jerking
                        off to it afterwards.  He's gay.  

                                 CHET
                        I hope he chokes on a dick.  I never
                        liked him. 

                                 WILL
                        Your sister did.  She let him finger
                        blast her.  Big time. 

           Chet quickly pauses the movie, turns to Will. 

                                 CHET
                        What the fuck are you talking about? 
                        I don't want that shit in my head. 

                                 WILL
                        Sorry.  Kate told me about it last
                        night.  I thought you should know. 

                                 CHET
                        What's your problem?
                                 WILL
                        No problem. 

           Will stumbles to the fridge and grabs another beer.  He throws
           one to Chet, who awkwardly catches it. 

                                 CHET
                        Where'd you even see Kate?

                                 WILL
                        At her office.  Friday nights I
                        usually have an extra pie or two. 
                        She works late.  So I swing by and...

                                 CHET
                        You two swap stories about getting
                        fingered?  That's pretty cute.  

           Chet chuckles.  Will ignores him, sips his beer. 

                                 WILL
                        The point I'm trying to make is this:
                        Tom Small was an asshole.  He was
                        totally wrong for your sister.  Just
                        like every other guy she's ever dated. 
                        Right through to this Mark dude she
                        broke up with because he wouldn't
                        move to Atlanta with her.

                                 CHET
                        Wait...Kate's moving to Atlanta?

                                 WILL
                        Fuck, I might have ruined the
                        surprise.  She got a new job. 

                                 CHET
                        Good for her.  I mean, that's great
                        news and all, and I'm sorta pissed
                        she hasn't told me yet...but why the
                        fuck are we talking about who my
                        sister goes out with?  Who's she
                        supposed to go out with?

                                 WILL
                        I don't know. 
                          (sips beer, thinks for a beat)
                        A decent guy.  Not some career
                        obsessed pretty boy that doesn't
                        know how to have fun.  You know, the
                        type of guy who'd get her stoned at
                        high school graduation, then take
                        the heat for it when they got caught.  
                                 CHET
                          (beat)
                        You did that.  You just described
                        yourself.  

                                 WILL
                          (carefully)
                        That was just meant as, like, an
                        example. 

                                 CHET
                        So your example of the type of guy
                        Kate should be going out with is
                        yourself? 

           At a loss, Will shrugs.  Chet stares at him for a beat.

                                 CHET
                        Maybe I'm wrong, but this feels like
                        some roundabout way of telling me
                        you're into my sister.

                                 WILL
                        Chet, I really don't -  

                                 CHET
                        Just answer me, Will.  Are you, or
                        are you not, attracted to Kate? 

           Will swallows hard. 

                                 WILL
                        I'm gonna be honest with you.  Because
                        you're an adult and I think you can
                        handle it. 
                          (beat)
                        Yes, I am incredibly attracted to
                        Kate.  And I mean that in the most
                        respectful possible way. 

                                 CHET
                        So, respectfully, you want to fuck
                        my sister?  Is that it?

                                 WILL
                        Chet, let's not - 

                                 CHET
                        My twin sister!?  Which is basically
                        like fucking me!  Respectfully! 
                        With your dick!
                                 WILL
                        Hey, if you guys had that twin ESP
                        shit this would be a completely
                        different situation.  There'd be
                        logistical problems. 

                                 CHET
                        We look exactly alike!

                                 WILL
                        You look like a lot of people.  You're
                        a normal looking dude. 

                                 CHET
                        This is so fucked up I can't even
                        begin to process it.  How long has
                        this been going on?

                                 WILL
                        If I had to put my finger on
                        it...middle school-ish.

                                 CHET
                        12 years!?  And you never told me!? 
                        Your best friend.  Or was that all
                        just bullshit?  A way for you to
                        indulge some obsessive fixation with
                        my sister? 
                          (beat, fuming)
                        I treated you like a brother.  And
                        so did she, for the record, which
                        makes this all a bit creepy. 

                                 WILL
                        It's not like I was sleeping over
                        all those years just so I could peek
                        in her bedroom. 

                                 CHET
                        Are you sure?  Because you have a
                        habit of being an unprincipled,
                        idiotic douche bag. 

                                 WILL
                        Hey!  Let's not say shit we can't
                        take back. 

                                 CHET
                        Take back?  Will, you got kicked out
                        of junior college for punching a
                        professor that made fun of some poem
                        you wrote.  

                                 WILL
                        That poem was about your sister!
           Chet chuckles. 

                                 CHET
                        That is, literally, the saddest thing
                        I have ever heard.  Like retards
                        playing freeze tag sad.  No wonder
                        you deliver pizzas for a living.    

                                 WILL
                        Fuck you!  Maybe I was just hanging
                        out with you for your sister.  You
                        were always a whiny little bitch. 
                        And you stuttered.  All the kids
                        used to call you "Chutter."  

                                 CHET
                        Whatever.  I only started hanging
                        out with you because you had a
                        Nintendo. 

                                 WILL
                        Did you see my Nintendo naked? 
                        Because I saw your sister changing
                        into her swimsuit at your thirteenth
                        birthday pool party.  And it was the
                        highlight of the whole shitty event.     

           Chet bites his lip. 

                                 CHET
                        Okay.  You wanna do this? 

                                 WILL
                        I think we already are. 

                                 CHET
                        Well, you know who I saw naked? 
                        Jenny Rifkin.  While I was nailing
                        her.  The week after she dumped you. 
                        Why do you think every time you wanna
                        bet on whose cock's bigger I'm always
                        willing to go in?  'Cause I know
                        mine's bigger.  'Cause she told me!

                                 WILL
                        Wow...wow.  You pulled a Judas on
                        Jenny fucking Rifkin.  That is messed
                        up.  Almost as messed up as how I
                        sold your Cal Ripken signed ball for
                        200 bucks.

                                 CHET
                        My grandpa left me that ball in his
                        will!  You helped me look for it for
                        a month! 
                                 WILL
                        Now you know why we never found it. 

           Will bows.   

                                 WILL
                        We done here? 

           Chet's face is red with anger. 

                                 CHET
                        Not quite yet.  There's actually a
                        mystery I wanna solve for you.  
                          (beat)
                        I was the one who told John Tanner
                        about how your mom fucked that
                        lifeguard.  And I always felt awful
                        about it, because even though he
                        swore secrecy, he told everyone else
                        in town.  And then your parents wound
                        up getting divorced.  But now...I
                        don't give a shit.

           This news lands like an electric shock.  

                                 WILL
                        What!?  You ruined...my fucking life! 

           Will takes a swing at Chet.  Chet is surprisingly quick,
           dodges it and puts Will in some sort of choke hold. 

                                 CHET
                        Krav Maga, bitch.  I bet your poetry
                        professor didn't know this shit. 

                                 WILL
                        Get offa me!

                                 CHET
                        You threw the first punch!

                                 WILL
                        I'm gonna break this hold and then
                        kick your skinny ass!

                                 CHET
                        Try it!

           Will flexes and tries to break the choke hold...no luck. 
           Suddenly, he wrenches his back away from Chet and screams - 

                                 WILL
                        What the fuck is that!?
                                 CHET
                        My knuckle in your spine!  No holds
                        barred you backstabbing fuck! 

                                 WILL
                        I'm gonna pass out...  

                                 CHET
                        Good!

                                 WILL
                          (face bright red)
                        I love her, Chet...I love Kate...

           Chet keeps the choke hold for a moment longer, then lets
           Will go.  Will drops to the floor, panting. 

           Chet looks down at him, his face filled with hurt. 

                                 CHET
                        Let me tell you something.  And it's
                        the truest thing you'll ever hear,
                        from the person who knows you best
                        in the world...you're not good enough
                        for my sister.  And you never will
                        be.  You're the lowest common
                        denominator, Will.  You're the square
                        root of fucking zero. 

           Will gets to his feet. 

                                 WILL
                        Fuck you...Chutter! 
                          (grabs dick)
                        Square this!

                                 CHET
                        Get out of my house.  You're a shitty
                        friend. 

                                 WILL
                        Right back at you.

           Will storms out.  

           A beat later, he storms back in, ejects the DVD from the
           player, collects his Lethal Weapon box set and leaves. 

           EXT. CHET'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Will screeches away in his car. 
           INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A day or so has passed.  Will sits on his couch, an unshaven
           mess, watching Lethal Weapon 4.  Murtaugh and Riggs have
           just been promoted to captains.  They laugh and joke around
           with each other.  Best buds. 

           Will looks like he might cry.  He goes for his beer, knocks
           it over.  He stares at the growing puddle of beer for a
           moment, then grabs the folder with his college applications
           and uses them to sop it up.

           INT. GIORGIO'S TRATTORIA - NIGHT

           The place is dead.  Will sits at a table, staring off through
           the misty window. 

           In the background, Christopher takes a phone order.  He hangs
           up, boxes a pizza and drops it in front of Will.  

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Come on, wake up and get to work.  

           Christopher hands him the order slip.  Will checks the address.

                                 WILL
                        Where the fuck is this?

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        How should I know?  It's 30 minutes
                        away or the pizza comes out of your
                        paycheck.  Tick tock.  

           Will pulls himself up out of the chair. 

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Will's Mustang travels down a dark, empty stretch of highway. 
           The lone working tail light fades as the car disappears into
           the distance. 

           EXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           The Mustang stops at the mouth of a driveway.  There is a
           fence with an address on it.  Overgrown shrubbery blocks
           anything beyond it from view.  All that Will can see is a
           red and white radio tower jutting into the sky, beacon light
           flashing atop it.  

           Will checks the address, then drives through the open gate.    

           EXT. RADIO TOWER - NIGHT

           The Mustang parks at the end of the driveway.  Will gets out.  
           There is a large, corrugated storage shed to one end of the
           property, and, across a clearing, a radio tower built on top
           of a small office structure.

           The office door is ajar.  Florescent light glows from inside. 
           Will takes a step toward it, stops. 

                                 WILL
                        Hello?

                                 DWAYNE (O.S.)
                          (calling back from beyond door)
                        Hey, bud!  Sorry for the hike!  The
                        county's got us doing repairs at the
                        ass end of the night!  

           This puts Will at ease.  He heads toward the office.  As he
           gets close, a figure appears in the doorway.  It is Dwayne  

           WEARING A SCARY FUCKING GORILLA MASK

                                 WILL
                        What the - 

           Will hears something behind him and whirls around -  

           To find Jay, also in a gorilla mask, charging at him.  

                                 WILL
                        Holy fuck!

           Will makes a run for it.  But the guys are on top of him in
           no time.  He madly fights them off, somehow breaks loose and
           dashes for his car. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Stop!  We got a gun, you asshole! 

           At that, Will breaks toward the cover of the shrubbery. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Fuck!  Get him!

           Jay is right on Will's tail.  Without breaking stride, Jay
           picks up a large branch and wings it at him.  

           Will is hit in the legs and stumbles over himself, face first
           into the ground.  Jay leaps on top of him and locks his skinny
           legs around Will's body. 

                                 WILL
                        What the hell!? 
                          (at a loss)
                        Rape!  
           Jay wrestles something from his pocket.  A chloroform soaked
           rag.  He presses it hard against Will's mouth and nose. 
           Will soon goes limp. 

           Dwayne appears, looming above them.  He pulls his gorilla
           mask back and smiles.  

                                 DWAYNE
                        Step one.  

                                                             CUT TO:

           Blurry vision coming into focus.  Two gorillas.   

           EXT. RADIO TOWER - DAY

           Whereas the masks looked scary at night, they look ridiculous
           now.  Will is propped up on the hood of his car, staring at
           his captors.  His mouth is duct taped, hands bound behind his
           back.  He wears his "Giorgio's" cap and a buttoned up olive
           green military jacket.  He struggles to get his bearings. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        You thought we were gonna rape you. 
                          (chuckles)
                        Idiot.  

           Will mumbles something through the duct tape. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Just shut up.  The tape is there for
                        a reason.  'Cause this next part is
                        gonna take a measure of calm.  Are
                        you with me?  Can you be calm?  

           Will nods.  Dwayne holds up his driver license. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Will Dixon, of 112 North Whatever-
                        The-Fuck Street, right now you are
                        wearing an explosive vest. 

           Will looks down at the jacket he is wearing, tries to get
           his hands loose so he can tear it open. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Calm the fuck down!

           Will stiffens.  For emphasis, Dwayne reveals a gun tucked
           into his pants. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Now stay still and my associate will
                        show you.  
           Dwayne nods to Jay, who goes to Will and unbuttons the jacket. 
           Will is, in fact, wearing an explosive vest.  It is a cobbled
           together but intimidating looking contraption, crisscrossed
           by multicolored wires.  There is a lock at the hinge, with a
           digital display and a keypad. 

           Will begins to hyperventilate. 

                                 JAY
                        Take it easy.  You're fine.  This
                        thing is pretty stable. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        I wouldn't go getting it shot, or
                        slamming it into a wall. 

                                 JAY
                        Yeah, don't do any of that stuff. 
                        There's enough explosives here to
                        send you and anyone standing next to
                        you to hell.  

                                 DWAYNE
                        Or heaven.  But what the fuck does
                        that matter, 'cause you'll be dead. 
                          (beat)
                        Can I take that tape off, pizza boy?  

           Will nods.  Dwayne rips the duct tape off his mouth.  Will
           immediately screams at the top of his lungs - 

                                 WILL
                        Help!

           Dwayne and Jay chuckle. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        You know where you are?  You might
                        as well be in space, motherfucker. 
                        Nobody can hear you scream.  

                                 WILL
                        Why are you doing this to me?  I
                        don't have any money. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Not yet.  But you're gonna go get us
                        some. 

                                 WILL
                        Okay.  Sure, man.  Whatever you say. 
                        I'll go sell my car.  I'll get you
                        like a thousand bucks. 
                                 DWAYNE
                        I want 100 thousand.  

                                 WILL
                        Where the fuck am I supposed to get
                        that much money?

                                 DWAYNE
                        The Donner-Wells National Bank on
                        Charles Road. 

                                 JAY
                        Across the street from the Olive
                        Garden.

                                 DWAYNE
                        Yeah, the one across the street from
                        the Olive Garden.  

           Will tries to process this. 

                                 WILL
                        Do you guys have an account or
                        something?

           Dwayne turns to Jay, shakes his head to indicate Will is an
           idiot.  He turns back to Will and explodes -  

                                 DWAYNE
                        No, I don't have an account!  You're
                        gonna rob it!

                                 WILL
                        How the fuck am I supposed to rob a
                        bank? 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Figure it out.  You got a bomb strapped
                        to your chest.  That's a start.  It'll
                        scare the fuck outta people.  Maybe
                        use your brain and go get a gun. 
                        Borrow one from a friend for all I
                        care.  It ain't rocket science.   

                                 WILL
                        Then do it yourself. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        I would, but I'm already wearing
                        this gorilla mask and you're already
                        wearing that bomb.
                          (to Jay)
                        Tell him how it works.  
                                 JAY
                        The vest is booby trapped to shit, so
                        don't try to take it off.  Maybe you'll
                        get lucky and figure it out, but more
                        likely you'll blow yourself up.  
                          (pointing)
                        There's a timer and a keypad lock on
                        the side.  If you enter the six-digit
                        combination, the timer stops and the
                        lock opens.  There's also a transmitter
                        on back, which means we can remotely
                        detonate the vest just by dialing a
                        number.  And it's on speed dial. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        We'll be checking in on you.  Do
                        what you gotta do, but you go anywhere
                        near a police station, and we will
                        blow the vest. 

           Dwayne nods at the timer on the side of the vest. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        It's 9:00 AM.  You got 8 hours.  

           He hands Will a slip of paper. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Once you have the money, call this
                        number and you'll be given
                        instructions on where to drop it. 
                        You do good, we give you the lock
                        combination and this is all over. 
                        You can go back to delivering pizza,
                        the mail, whatever the fuck you want.
                          (beat)
                        Now let me demonstrate what happens
                        if you don't get us the money.      

           Dwayne looks over to where an oversized stuffed bear, rigged
           with its own bomb vest, sits on a tree stump 20 yards away. 
           Dwayne mimes answering a phone - 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Hey, Teddy Ruxpin...what's that? 
                        You don't have the money?  It was
                        too tough to rob the bank, so you
                        just went back to your bear cave and
                        cried like a bitch?  Well, guess
                        what my stuffed friend...time is up.    

           Dwayne nods at Jay, who pushes a button on a detonator.  Teddy
           Ruxpin explodes.  All that remains is a cloud of stuffing. 

           Will is frozen in fear.  
                                 DWAYNE
                        I liked that bear.  I don't even
                        know you. 

           Dwayne throws Will his car keys.  He fumbles to catch them. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Go on.  Get outta here.

                                 WILL
                        Guys, can we please just talk about
                        this?  

                                 DWAYNE
                        Yeah, of course we can.  

           Dwayne pulls the gun from his pants and fires two shots at
           Will's feet.  Will jumps back onto the hood of his car, slides
           across it and onto the ground by the driver side. 

           Dwayne and Jay jump back. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Be careful!  You got a bomb on your
                        chest!

           Will awkwardly gets to his feet and arranges himself in the
           car, adjusting to the weight of the bomb.  As he starts the
           engine and backs away -  

                                 DWAYNE
                        That's right!  Get the fuck out of
                        here!  You're wasting time!

           Once the car is gone, Jay looks to Dwayne, who takes off the
           gorilla mask to reveal his sweaty face. 

                                 JAY
                        That was pretty cool...with the gun.

                                 DWAYNE
                        It was totally fucking cool.  Just
                        thought it up on the spot. 

           The guys pound fists.  

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Will's car flies down the road.  It suddenly screeches to a
           stop, tires smoking.  Will jumps out of the car, stumbles to
           the shoulder and pukes.  He drops to his knees.  

                                 WILL
                        Oh, god!  Holy shit!  Fuck me! 
                        Someone please fucking help me!  
           Nothing but the wind.  

           Will fights back tears.  He gets to his feet, wipes his mouth. 
           He takes out his cell phone, scrolls through the contacts. 
           There are not many.  He pauses on Chet's name...presses send. 
           It rings, and rings -  

           The line goes to voicemail.  Will looks at the bomb's timer:
           7 hours, 47 minutes and counting.  He hurries to his car. 

           INT. CLASSROOM, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           A laser dot dances around the middle of a United States map.  

           Chet is teaching a history lesson to a bunch of SEVENTH
           GRADERS that look very mature and very bored.  As he indicates
           with his laser pointer - 

                                 CHET
                        This whole region here, about 830
                        thousand square miles, was part of
                        the initial Louisiana Purchase. 

                                 SEVENTH GRADER
                          (coughing)
                        Nice laser. 

           The class giggles.  Chet, embarrassed, puts away the pointer.     

           There is a knock at the door.  Chet turns to see Will's face
           in the door's window pane.  He looks back to his class.

                                 CHET
                        Take out your workbooks.  Chapter 3. 

           The kids lazily comply. 

           Chet opens the door, struggling to keep his classroom demeanor. 

                                 CHET
                        What do you want?

                                 WILL
                        We gotta talk. 

                                 CHET
                        I'm working here.  Do not mess with
                        me at work. 

                                 WILL
                        Chet, for the love of god, just talk
                        to me in private for one minute. 

           Chet sighs. 
           INT. HALLWAY, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Chet leads a jumpy Will into 

           INT. EMPTY CLASSROOM, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Chet shuts the door behind them.  Will paces.  Chet grins
           knowingly. 

                                 CHET
                        You wanna apologize, don't you?  You
                        look like shit.  You've probably
                        been up for days thinking about what
                        an asshole you were.  Well, it's
                        gonna take a lot more than some
                        pathetic groveling - 

                                 WILL
                          (suddenly)
                        Chet!  Shut up!  I don't wanna
                        apologize to you!

                                 CHET
                        Then what do you want?  Because we
                        don't have anything left to say to
                        each other. 

           Will swallows hard. 

                                 WILL
                        Here goes.  And this is gonna sound
                        crazy.  Because it is fucking crazy. 
                        But last night two guys in masks
                        jumped me and strapped a bomb to my
                        chest, and now I have less than eight
                        hours to rob a bank. 

           Chet just stares at Will, unimpressed. 

                                 CHET
                        You're hysterical.  Got me.  Great
                        joke.  I'm going back to work now. 

           Will steps in Chet's way.  He slowly unbuttons his jacket,
           opens it, revealing the bomb. 

                                 CHET
                        What the fuck?  Is that real?

           Will nods. 

           Chet suddenly jumps backward, stumbles over a desk, hits the
           ground and scurries on his ass to the other end of the
           classroom.  He presses himself flat against the wall. 
                                 CHET
                        Stay away from me!  What the fuck
                        are you involved in!?  Terrorism!?

                                 WILL
                        Chet, do you really think I'm a
                        terrorist?

                                 CHET
                        Yes!  One of the dumb ones!  The
                        ones they convince to wear the bombs! 

                                 WILL
                        I am not fucking around here.  Two
                        guys did this to me.  And if I don't
                        rob that bank in time this thing is
                        gonna blow.  

                                 CHET
                        Seriously?

                                 WILL
                        Seriously. 

                                 CHET
                        And your first idea was to come to a
                        school filled with young children? 

                                 WILL
                        I didn't - 

                                 CHET
                        Just back the fuck away from me with
                        that thing.

           Will backs all the way up, so that the guys are on opposite
           ends of the classroom. 

                                 WILL
                        Listen, I think the vest is safe for
                        now.  These guys don't want me to
                        blow myself up on accident before I
                        get their money.

                                 CHET
                        Oh, so you figure the two psychopaths
                        that rigged a bomb to your chest
                        made sure it was safe?  There's no
                        margin for error in their fucking
                        bomb vest design!? 

                                 WILL
                        I don't know!  All I do know is that
                        this is real.  This is happening.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILL (CONT'D)
                        And I'm sure you hate me as much as
                        I hate you right now, but I have
                        nowhere else to go.

                                 CHET
                        For what?

                                 WILL
                        For help, Chet.  I need your help. 
                        Please.  I can't do this alone. 

           Chet looks Will over.  His desperation is palpable.  Chet
           bites his lip, weighing the situation... 

                                 CHET
                        Damn it!
                          (takes a breath)
                        I'd like to tell you to get fucked,
                        but you know what the problem is...I'm
                        a better man than you.  And someday,
                        I might actually forgive you.  So if
                        I let you blow up, or whatever, that
                        shit might come back and eat at my
                        conscience, and totally affect my
                        relationships with other people. 
                        Like my wife and kids and shit. 

                                 WILL
                        That's a...very rational way to look
                        at the situation.
                          (genuinely)
                        And you're right, about being a better
                        guy than me.    

           Chet takes a step toward Will. 

                                 CHET
                        Are you sure that thing isn't gonna
                        blow at any second?

                                 WILL
                        I would love to say yes...but I guess
                        I have to be honest and ask you to
                        take a leap of faith with me. 

                                 CHET
                        That sounded incredibly gay. 

                                 WILL
                        I know it did.  I'm sorry.  This
                        shit is fucking with my emotions. 
                                 CHET
                        Let's just...we should get out of
                        the school first. 

                                 WILL
                        That's a good idea. 

           Will waits for Chet to move.  He doesn't.  After a beat - 

                                 CHET
                        Could you just walk a few feet in
                        front of me for a minute here? 

                                 WILL
                        Okay. 

           Will opens the door, stops, looks back at Chet. 

                                 WILL
                        Thank you. 

           Will heads out.  Chet looks at the open door, leading to god
           knows what.  He takes a breath, bracing himself, then follows
           after Will.

           INT. HALLWAY, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Will walks down the empty hallway.  He glances back over his
           shoulder, where Chet walks several feet behind him. 

                                 CHET
                        Yes, I'm still here.  I really am
                        this stupid.  Just pay attention to
                        where you're going.  

                                 WILL
                        I think I can handle it.  

                                 CHET
                        These floors get waxed once a week. 
                        On Monday, which today is.  You hit
                        a slick patch, trip and fall, and I
                        got a classroom full of kids wearing
                        their skin inside out. 

                                 WILL
                        Chet, I'm fucking nervous enough as
                        it is.  Please.  I don't need you
                        back seat driving me right now. 

                                 CHET
                        Obviously. 

           Will takes another step, stops.  He turns back toward Chet.  
                                 WILL
                        Just for the record, this isn't a
                        nuclear weapon strapped to my chest. 
                        And there are metal lockers on either
                        side of the hallway.  If I fall, and
                        if this thing goes off, I'm not taking
                        out the whole school. 

                                 CHET
                        Do you really want to debate this? 

           Will sighs, turns back around.  A second later, the school
           bell rings and kids flood the hallway, changing classes.  

           Will freezes.  Multiple kids shove past him.  Chet sweats
           bullets, gives Will a look of death.  

           After a beat, the hallway empties again.  Chet looks to Will. 

                                 CHET
                        You're an asshole. 

                                 WILL
                        Whatever.  It's over.  

           Will continues walking.  He tries to lighten the mood - 

                                 WILL
                        Who was the chick in the white jeans?

                                 CHET
                        Kristi Evans.  Why?

                                 WILL
                        You know why. 

                                 CHET
                        Oh, come on.  Just keep walking. 

           The guys' voices fade as they continue down the hallway... 

                                 WILL
                        Come on yourself.  You knew exactly
                        who I was talking about. 

                                 CHET
                        Fuck you.  She's in the eighth grade. 

                                 WILL
                        I bet you love it when she calls you
                        Mr. Chet. 

                                 CHET
                        She doesn't call me "Mr. Chet." 
                        She's not a foreigner.  
           EXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           From high above, we see the guys exit the school.  Chet
           gradually closes the gap between he and Will. 

           The guys get to Will's car.  Chet wraps up a call on his
           cell phone - 

                                 CHET
                        ...thanks so much, Mrs. Davis.  I'll
                        call you as soon as I get out of the
                        doctor's office. 

           Chet hangs up.  He is standing by the passenger door.  He
           looks over the roof of the car at Will. 

                                 CHET
                        So, this is it?  

                                 WILL
                        This is what?

                                 CHET
                        Once I step inside this car I'm
                        basically in a steel coffin with you
                        and...that thing.  And if it goes
                        off, all they're gonna find in there
                        are two charred bodies and pieces of
                        a bomb.  They'll assume we were
                        driving to a government building to
                        blow it up.  It'll be all over the
                        news.  Next thing you now, some
                        militia or Islam group is claiming
                        us as members.  My family will be
                        humiliated.

                                 WILL
                        We'll also be dead, in that particular
                        situation, so it won't really matter. 

                                 CHET
                        Exactly!

           Will sighs. 

                                 WILL
                        I get it.  Take your time, man.  

           Will gets in the car and shuts the door.  He looks out at
           Chet, who stands uncertainly by the passenger side.  Will
           taps his fingers on the steering wheel for a beat, then opens
           his coat and points at the timer.  Chet reluctantly hops in. 
           INT. MUSTANG - DAY

           Will fires up the engine. 

                                 CHET
                        Given the situation, I think you
                        should obey all traffic safety laws. 

                                 WILL
                        Fine. 

           Will pulls out of the school parking lot. 

                                 WILL
                        Okay, so where are we going? 

                                 CHET
                        I have no idea.  I just got in your
                        car.  I thought you had a plan.

                                 WILL
                        Well, I don't!  I've been sorta
                        preoccupied with this crushing fear
                        of death!  

                                 CHET
                        No plan.  I can't say I'm surprised.   

                                 WILL
                        Your plan is probably better.  Just
                        condescend me until I explode. 

           Will goes to turn on the radio.  Chet grabs his hand. 

                                 CHET
                        Maybe we should turn on the radio. 
                        See if the signal sets the bomb off. 
                        That would be an interesting
                        experiment.

           Will heaves a frustrated sigh.  Chet eases up. 

                                 CHET
                        Listen, let's just go back to my
                        place.  Figure out our options. 
                        Maybe you can get the vest off or
                        something.  I just don't want to do
                        anything stupid.   

                                 WILL
                        Unless we have to. 

           The car hits a rough pothole.  Chet's heart skips a beat - 
                                 CHET
                        Holy fucking shit!

           - and he throws himself against the passenger side window,
           as far from Will as the confines of the car will allow.  

           Will slams the brakes. 

                                 WILL
                        Stop it!  You're scaring the fuck
                        out of me!

                                 CHET
                        Okay.  Okay.  Fuck!

           Chet makes the sign of the cross.  

                                 CHET
                        I'm cool now. 

           Will continues driving.  Chet discreetly unlocks the passenger
           side door. 

                                 WILL
                        Why did you do that?

                                 CHET
                        Do what?

                                 WILL
                        I saw you. 

                                 CHET
                        It's in case I have to jump out.

                                 WILL
                        If I survive the day, and you don't
                        because you jumped out of a moving
                        car and broke your neck, I'm gonna
                        laugh my ass off. 

                                 CHET
                        And if abandoning ship saves my life,
                        then that laugh will be mine. 

           The guys continue driving in silence. 

           SUPER COUNTDOWN: 6 hours, 59 minutes...

                                                             CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM, CHET'S APARTMENT - DAY

           The door is shut.  Will sits on the toilet lid.  He has the
           jacket off and we get our first complete look at the vest.  
           The actual structure is composed of hollow metal tubes.  The
           wiring that runs throughout the vest is messy and complicated,
           purposely so, to scare anyone out of trying to fuck with it.  

           Will is in the process of squirting lotion onto his arm.  He
           rubs it in, then tries to maneuver his arm inside the vest
           so he can slide it off...no luck.

                                 WILL
                        It's too tight!  I can't do it! 

           Will is calling off toward the 

           KITCHEN

           Where Chet, in a batting helmet, is crouched in a corner, at
           the furthest point in the furthest room from the bathroom.   
           He uses his laptop to look for websites on disarming a bomb.

                                 CHET
                        What if we try to saw it off?

           BATHROOM

           Will inspects the metal tubes.  Wires run into them, as well.  

                                 WILL
                        I think they're booby trapped.

           KITCHEN

           Chet scrolls through websites.  He finds one with a complicated
           wiring diagram.

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        You got anything?

                                 CHET
                        This one site says you have to cut
                        the primer wire first, then the
                        reactor wire, then the wire that
                        feeds the ignition timer. 

           BATHROOM

           Will picks up a pair of nail scissors sitting on the counter.  

                                 WILL
                        What color are those wires supposed
                        to be?

                                 CHET (O.S.)
                        I don't know.  This other site says
                        all bombs are made differently. 
                                 WILL
                        What kind of teacher are you!?  You're
                        confusing the shit out of me! 

           Will tries to make sense of the jumbled wires. 

           KITCHEN

           Chet glances at the bathroom door. 

                                 CHET
                        What are you doing in there?

           Nothing. 

                                 CHET
                        Are you cutting wires?  Don't cut
                        anything with giving me a warning. 

           Chet takes a pan from the stove, bangs on it to test its
           effectiveness as a blast shield, then holds it up in front
           of his face. 

                                 CHET
                        Will?  What's going on in there?

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        I'm trying to take a piss.  And I'm
                        honestly so scared that I might piss
                        blood, so just shut up for a second.  

           The sound of Will peeing in stops and starts.  Then the toilet
           flushes and Will emerges from the bathroom, sliding the jacket
           back on. 

                                 WILL
                        This is pointless.  We can't get
                        this thing off. 

           Chet shuts his laptop and crosses the apartment toward Will,
           still keeping a good distance between them.  

                                 CHET
                        I agree.  There's no way we're
                        defusing that thing ourselves.  We
                        gotta call the cops, have them fly
                        in the bomb squad or something.

                                 WILL
                        We can't.  These guys said they'd be
                        following me.  And I don't have a
                        clue what they look like.  For all I
                        know, they're outside right now. 
                        They see the cops show up, they blow
                        the vest and cut their losses. 
           Will stares at Chet, hopelessly overwhelmed.  He pleads in a
           strangled voice -

                                 WILL
                        What do I do, man?  What do I do
                        now?

                                 CHET
                        I don't know, Will...I guess you
                        gotta rob the bank. 

                                 WILL
                        I haven't been inside a bank in three
                        years!  How the fuck am I supposed
                        to rob one!?  They wouldn't even
                        give me a savings account!

           Will drops onto the couch and puts his head in his hands,
           fighting hysterics.  Chet offers a stock reassurance -  

                                 CHET
                        It's gonna be okay. 

                                 WILL
                        No, it's not!  I'm gonna blow up! 
                        That's way worse than getting stabbed
                        or shot.  At least some people survive
                        that.  No one survives being blown
                        up.  No one is ever like, "Yeah, I
                        heard Steve got blown up, tough break,
                        but how's he doing now?  Is he still
                        in the Rec basketball league?"  No of
                        course he isn't, 'cause there's nothing
                        left of Steve except a stain on the
                        wall and a pair of fucking high tops! 

           Chet looks on as his friend begins to sob.  It's a crushing
           sight.  Suddenly, Chet strides across the room - 

                                 CHET
                        Pull yourself together!

           - and attempts to give him one of those "get a grip" slaps. 
           But Will flinches and Chet slaps him right on the ear. 

                                 WILL
                        Ow!  Fuck!  I think you popped my
                        eardrum.

                                 CHET
                        Sorry.  Shit.  I didn't mean to do
                        that.  But just listen to me now. 
                        You're not gonna die.  You wanna
                        know why?  Because you know exactly
                        how to rob a bank.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHET (CONT'D)
                        You've seen it done plenty of times.

                                 WILL
                        What are you talking about?

                                 CHET
                        Well, for example, Heat.

                                 WILL
                          (beat)
                        The movie?

                                 CHET
                        Yes, the movie.  They robbed a bank
                        and got away. 

                                 WILL
                        They mowed down liked a hundred cops
                        with automatic weapons.  And they
                        don't get away.  Everyone dies but
                        Val Kilmer.  And he gets shot in the
                        neck.
                          (getting into it)
                        But what about Inside Man?

                                 CHET
                        There's no time for that shit.  What
                        did they do in Dog Day Afternoon?

                                 WILL
                        I never saw that movie.  I think the
                        robbers are both gay or something.  

                                 CHET
                        What else is there?  Killing Zoe is
                        a blood bath.  

                                 WILL
                          (realizing)
                        Point Break.  That's the way to do
                        it.  Just bust in with guns.  Masks. 
                        Move fast.  Stick to the tellers and
                        don't bother with the vault.  

                                 CHET
                        There you go.  

                                 WILL
                        I mean, it is just a local bank. 
                        The Donner-Wells on Charles Road. 

                                 CHET
                        Really?  I applied for a job there
                        like a year ago.   
                                 WILL
                        You wanted to be a teller?

                                 CHET
                        Yeah, so what?  It's a good job. 
                        You get benefits. 

                                 WILL
                        Like what, a name tag?

                                 CHET
                        What kind of benefits do you get? 
                        Free toppings?

                                 WILL
                        That's really clever.  No one ever
                        said that shit to me before.  Anyway,
                        this is perfect.  You know the whole
                        layout of the bank. 

                                 CHET
                        Not exactly.  They didn't hand me
                        the security schematics with the
                        application.  But I sat in the waiting
                        area for like 20 minutes.  I know
                        what the place looks like.  

                                 WILL
                        How many guards? 

                                 CHET
                        One.  I think. 

                                 WILL
                        That's a start. 

                                 CHET
                        It's a great start.  You can do it.

           Will pauses.  

                                 WILL
                        You're gonna do it with me, right?

                                 CHET
                        Will, I mean...

                                 WILL
                        You said you'd help. 

                                 CHET
                        That's what I was just doing, with
                        all those ideas. 
                                 WILL
                        Jesus Christ, Chet.  Please.  I'm
                        begging you here.  I need you on
                        this.  If I do it alone, I'm dead.  

           Chet takes the deepest breath of his life... 

                                 CHET
                        Are you gonna cry again? 

                                 WILL
                        That was a moment of weakness.  
                          (beat)
                        Yes.  I'll fucking cry again if that's
                        what it takes. 

                                 CHET
                        I should make you blow me. 

                                 WILL
                        Sure.  Whip that shit out.  I'm
                        actually kinda curious.  I wanna see
                        if Jenny Rifkin lied to you.  She
                        obviously lied to me.  

           Chet cracks a smile.  After a beat, he shakes his head, sighs - 

                                 CHET
                        So we're gonna need some weapons,
                        right?  You don't happen to have a
                        firearm license do you? 

                                 WILL
                        No, I don't. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           The guys cross the lot.  A giant Walmart sign looms up ahead.  

           INT. WALMART - DAY

           The guys roam the aisles.  They turns into one labeled "Sports
           & Fitness," pass bikes, skateboards, ping pong paddles and
           basketballs, until they find - 

           Air pistols.  They are incredibly realistic looking, though
           clear and with orange nozzles.  The guys grab two of them. 

                                                             CUT TO:

           The guys grab black spray paint from another aisle. 

                                                             CUT TO:
           The guys try on various ski masks, weighing the respective
           intimidation factor of each. 

                                                             CUT TO:

           Air pistols, spray paint, ski masks, leather gloves, several
           5-Hour Energy drinks...the items glide past us on a checkout
           conveyor belt. 

           The tough REGISTER WOMAN looks at the guys with abject disgust. 

                                 REGISTER WOMAN
                        You sure you don't want to grab some
                        condoms?

                                 WILL
                        Uh, no.  Why?

                                 REGISTER WOMAN
                        Because this is usually what men buy
                        before they rape someone, and I want
                        to make sure you all use protection. 

                                 WILL
                        Lady, we're just...buying some stuff.

                                 REGISTER WOMAN
                        Is that cash or credit for your rape
                        kit?

           Will looks in his empty wallet, takes out a credit card. 
           Chet grabs his hand. 

                                 CHET
                        We'll pay cash.

           INT. MINIVAN - DAY

           The van is parked.  Dwayne sits behind the wheel.  Metallica's
           "Ride the Lightning" begins to play loudly.  Dwayne looks
           over at Jay in the passenger seat. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        You really fucked up this mix tape. 

           Dwayne stops the music, ejects the tape and tosses it at Jay. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        We're not speed freaks knocking off
                        a 7-Eleven.  We're masterminding a
                        heist here.  

                                 JAY
                        Sorry, man.  That song just means a
                        lot to me.
                                 DWAYNE
                        Typical. 

           Dwayne looks out the windshield and we now see that they are
           parked in the Walmart lot, watching the store entrance. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        I wish he would hurry his shit up.  

                                 JAY
                        You worried about that other guy
                        he's with?

                                 DWAYNE
                        No, man.  He picked him up at a
                        school.  So long as there ain't any
                        cops, he can take the whole town
                        with him.  I just want my money. 

           Dwayne surveys the area.  Something catches his attention:
           the bland strip mall across the street.  There's a
           Blockbuster, Subway, and an empty space in between.  Dwayne
           smiles.  Jay notices.  

                                 JAY
                        What?  You want me to run over to
                        Subway, get us a couple sandwiches?

                                 DWAYNE
                        If you had any vision, Jay, you'd
                        know exactly what I'm thinking about
                        right now.  And it's not a sandwich. 
                          (beat)
                        Look how well trafficked that shopping
                        mall is.  It's the perfect place for
                        the tanning salon.  

           Jay checks it out, nods. 

                                 JAY
                        Oh, you're totally right. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        I've been thinking about it, and I
                        want you to start off working the
                        counter.  It's an important position. 
                        Because we're gonna be using code
                        words and shit.  For example, if a
                        customer walks in and says he wants a
                        tan, that just means he wants a tan. 
                        But if he says he wants a "deluxe
                        tan," that means a blow job and you
                        gotta get one of the girls in there
                        to suck him off.  You with me? 
                                 JAY
                        So far.  But what if he wants a fuck?

                                 DWAYNE
                        There's gonna be codes for everything:
                        missionary, anal, black chicks.  I
                        got it all written down back home in
                        in my files.  I'm not gonna bother
                        getting into it with you right now,
                        because you're supposed to be on
                        lookout and you're no good at
                        multitasking.  I mean, if I was to
                        go ahead and tell you that a "grande
                        tan" meant giving a Mexican a facial,
                        do you really think you'd be able to
                        commit it to memory?

                                 JAY
                        Probably not. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        That's a surprise. 

           Jay suddenly spots something through the windshield. 

                                 JAY
                        Hey, there they are!  They just got
                        in the car!  They're getting away! 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Fuck.  

           Dwayne throws the van into gear and follows the Mustang.

           INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING

           Will navigates the streets.  Chet is in the back seat, where
           he has newspaper spread out and is spray painting the air
           pistols, and much of the car, black.  Will glances back. 

                                 WILL
                        Be careful, you're getting paint
                        everywhere.

                                 CHET
                        Are you really worried about your
                        upholstery right now? 

                                 WILL
                        Yes, because if I survive this shit
                        I'm quitting my job.  That means
                        I'll probably have to give up my
                        place and I'll be sleeping in the
                        back of my car, which you're covering
                        in toxic paint. 
           Chet touches up one of the guns with a few careful sprays,
           goes to flip it over. 

                                 WILL
                        That side isn't dry yet.  You're
                        about to ruin it.

                                 CHET
                        It says it's fast drying. 

                                 WILL
                        Fast isn't the same as instant.  You
                        gotta let it sit for like 20 minutes. 

                                 CHET
                        How would you know?  You do a lot of
                        graffiti?

                                 WILL
                        No, but I spray painted my bike last
                        year after I got my license suspended. 
                        I didn't let it dry properly and I
                        fucked it up. 

                                 CHET
                        We don't have time to sit around and
                        literally watch paint dry.  Aren't
                        we going straight to the bank?  

                                 WILL
                        I was actually thinking we need to
                        stop and steal a car first. 

           Chet drops the spray paint can, whirls on Will.  

                                 CHET
                        What?  No way!  We've got a car. 

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, my car.  I'm not gonna use it
                        as a getaway vehicle.  They can trace
                        the plates.  Even if we do get away,
                        we'll be arrested.  

                                 CHET
                        Well, I can't hotwire a fucking
                        automobile, and neither can you. 

                                 WILL
                        That's why I was thinking we'd steal
                        one from your parents' friends.  The
                        Fishers.  Remember how they used to
                        pay us to clean their garage?  They
                        leave the keys in there.  And they
                        have a Datsun.  That's a fast car. 
                                 CHET
                        I'm not stealing the Fishers' Datsun. 
                        Let's steal a car from your parents'
                        friends. 

           Will seethes.  Suddenly, he whips the car over to the side
           of the road and gets in Chet's face. 

                                 WILL
                        What friends?  My parents don't have
                        any.  My dad moved away after your
                        big mouth ruined his marriage and
                        humiliated him, and no one wanted to
                        hang out with the mom who everyone
                        knew fucked a lifeguard.  

                                 CHET
                        You never should have told me!  I
                        was 13 years old.  I couldn't process
                        that kind of information.  I had to
                        tell someone else.
                          (shakes his head)
                        Fuck.  I really am sorry about it. 
                        Okay?  Despite what I said before. 
                        I was just a kid, but I messed up.

                                 WILL
                        Okay. 

           Chet looks at Will, expectantly.  

                                 CHET
                        That's it?  You're not gonna apologize
                        for selling my Cal Ripken ball?

                                 WILL
                        Sure.  I'm sorry...I'm sorry that my
                        family was going through a rough
                        patch and I was smoking a ton of
                        weed and listening to the Wu Tang
                        Clan all the time.  And that I needed
                        some extra dough to indulge my habit. 
                        Which, in hindsight, was probably
                        just a cry for help.  But you never
                        even noticed.  

                                 CHET
                        Thanks.  Now I feel even worse.  

           Will sits there, stewing for a moment.  Then he softens,
           shakes his head. 

                                 WILL
                        I shouldn't have stolen the ball.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILL (CONT'D)
                        I knew it was wrong and I regretted
                        it like the next day.  I actually
                        tried to buy it back but the guy
                        wanted twice as much.  I had to smoke
                        even more weed just to get past the
                        whole shitty incident.  I guess that's
                        why they call it a downward spiral. 

                                 CHET
                        I appreciate that you tried to buy
                        it back.  So, thanks.    

           Will nods at him.  An awkward moment passes. 

                                 CHET
                        We should probably get going. 

           Will turns back around, goes to pull out without looking and -

           A horn blares as a speeding delivery truck barrels right at
           them.  Will slams on the brakes, barely avoiding a collision. 
           Chet nearly jumps out of his skin.  

                                 CHET
                        Fuck!  Fuck!  I just want this goddamn
                        day to be over!

           As Chet continues to freak -

           SUPER COUNTDOWN: 5 hours, 15 minutes...

                                                             CUT TO:

           EXT. THE FISHERS' GARAGE - DAY

           Will keeps watch of the house.  It looks like no one's home. 
           He glances back at Chet, who squeezes himself through a tiny
           garage window he has pried open.   

           INT. THE FISHERS' GARAGE - DAY

           Chet drops ungracefully to the floor, right beside a well
           maintained 1977 Datsun 240Z.  Not the coolest car in the
           world but it's pretty quick.   

           Chet hurries over and unlocks the side door.  Will enters,
           hauling the Walmart bag full of supplies.  He goes right for
           a set of hooks on the wall.  

                                 WILL
                        The keys aren't here.  They always
                        used to leave the keys out.  
                                 CHET
                        Yeah.  When we were teenagers.  This
                        is fucked. 

                                 WILL
                        Let's just find them.

           The guys ransack the garage.  Chet knocks over a shelf full
           of clutter, manages to grab half the stuff but the rest falls
           loudly to the floor. 

                                 CHET
                        Sorry. 

           Will goes to the car and tries the handle.  It's open.  He
           scours the interior.

                                 CHET
                        You hear that?

                                 WILL
                        What?

           Chet peeks through the glass pane in the door. 

                                 CHET
                        Mr. Fisher is coming!  

           As he looks for an escape - 

                                 CHET
                        Oh shit, oh shit.  Are the keys in
                        there? 

                                 WILL
                        No!

                                 CHET
                        We're dead. 

           Will hops out of the car.  He rifles through the Walmart bag. 

                                 CHET
                        What are you doing?

           Will pulls the ski masks out of the bag, along with one of
           the freshly painted air pistols. 

                                 WILL
                        I'm doing what I have to. 

           Will puts a ski mask on, then throws one to Chet.  Before
           Chet can argue, the door opens and MR. FISHER (60s) enters. 
           Chet quickly pulls down his mask.  It's backwards.  
           Will points the pistol - 

                                 MR. FISHER
                        Oh, Jesus!

           Mr. Fisher braces himself against a wall.  Chet fumbles to
           turn his mask around.  Will affects a deep voice - 

                                 WILL
                        Where are the car keys? 

                                 MR. FISHER
                        They're in my pocket!  I'm just
                        reaching in my pocket for the keys!

                                 WILL
                        Quiet down and do it already. 

           Mr. Fisher reaches into his pocket and produces the keys. 
           They jingle as he holds them out in his trembling hand. 
           Will snatches them.   

                                 WILL
                        Now listen, I don't want you to report
                        this car stolen or anything until
                        later tonight.  Let's say 5 o'clock. 
                        6 to be safe. 

                                 MR. FISHER
                        Sure.  Anything you say.

           Will seems unconvinced.  He looks to Chet, who shrugs.  Will
           turns back to Mr. Fisher and gestures violently with the gun -  

                                 WILL
                        If you fuck with us, I swear, I
                        will...I will shoot your son.  Taylor. 
                        I know where he works.  At the fucking
                        travel agency.  He's the douchebag
                        with the bangs. 

                                 MR. FISHER
                          (stunned)
                        Please no.  I won't do anything.  I
                        won't.  Just leave Taylor alone. 

                                 WILL
                        I'm gonna trust you.  But if you
                        call the police, there's gonna be an
                        undertaker styling his stupid fucking
                        bangs! 
                          (beat)
                        Now open the garage door. 
           Mr. Fisher hits a switch that raises the garage door.  Chet
           grabs their stuff and gets in the passenger side.  Will backs
           toward the driver side, keeping the gun trained on Mr. Fisher.  

                                 WILL
                        The car's insured, right?

           Mr. Fisher nods.

                                 WILL
                        Okay.  I feel better.  Worse comes
                        to worst, something happens to it,
                        you can get a Honda.  This thing
                        doesn't even have airbags. 

                                 MR. FISHER
                        Please just go. 

           Will slides into the car and starts it up.  

           EXT. THE FISHERS' GARAGE - DAY

           The car peels away. 

           INT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING 

           The guys yank off their ski masks. 

                                 CHET
                        That old man's got a heart condition. 
                        You could have killed him!  

                                 WILL
                        My hand was forced!

           Chet tries to get comfortable in the seat.

                                 CHET
                        Awesome.  I'm stuck inside an even
                        smaller car with you and a bomb. 

           Will works the manual transmission.  He steps on the gas. 

                                 WILL
                        This thing's got some pick up. 

                                 CHET
                        Could you just take it easy, we're
                        doing fine on time.  

                                 WILL
                        I know...but there's one more stop
                        we have to make.  
                                 CHET
                        Do you have take a shit first? 
                        Because I do. 

           Will nervously drums his fingers on the steering wheel, trying
           to figure out how to say -

                                 WILL
                        I need to see your sister. 

                                 CHET
                        Are you for real?  Did you really
                        just ask me that?  You salt-in-an-
                        open-wound motherfucker!

                                 WILL
                        Chet, as if it isn't apparent, I may
                        die today.  I'll probably die today. 
                        And if there's one small thing that's
                        clear to me now, it's that I've wasted
                        two and a half decades as a pussy,
                        watching everything I want pass me
                        by.  I don't wanna peace out of this
                        world as a pussy.  I need to tell
                        her how I feel. 

                                 CHET
                        You're really gonna turn this into
                        some sort of dying wish bullshit?

                                 WILL
                        Yes, I really am.  It means that much
                        to me.  I am not fucking around here. 

                                 CHET
                        I don't think you are.  I mean,
                        apparently, you love my sister so
                        much that you're willing to put her
                        life in danger by going to see her
                        with a bomb strapped to your chest. 

           Will's eyes are fixed dead ahead.   

                                 WILL
                        She won't be in danger.  I promise. 
                        I got it all worked out.  And you
                        can even take a shit while I'm inside.

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           The Datsun pulls around and parks in back.  

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL the minivan parking across the street. 
           INT. MINIVAN - DAY

           Dwayne watches Will hurry out of the Datsun.  

                                 DWAYNE
                        Where the fuck is he going?  What's
                        in there?  Some sort of FBI
                        headquarters, maybe?

                                 JAY
                        I don't know, I've never been in
                        that building. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Well, follow him, you idiot.  

           Jay reaches for the door handle. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Don't even tell me you're about to
                        do a reconnaissance without a cover. 
                        What's you cover?

                                 JAY
                        I don't know...I'm from the telephone
                        company?

                                 DWAYNE
                        Yeah, nice fucking uniform. 

           Dwayne rummages in the back of the car, produces a shopping
           bag and starts filling it with random clothes strewn across
           the car.  He shoves the bag at Jay. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        You're a personal shopper.  You're
                        delivering the latest fashions to
                        Mr. Quilby on the twelfth floor. 
                        Got it?

           Jay looks over at the building. 

                                 JAY
                        I only count like six floors. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Improvise!

           Jay nods, takes off with the bag. 

           INT. STAIRWELL, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           Will jogs up the stairs.  He has a cell phone pressed to his
           ear, mid-conversation - 
                                 WILL
                        ...no, I'm here right now.

                                 KATE (O.S.)
                          (over phone)
                        Why are you acting so strange? 

                                 WILL
                        Because strange shit is going on. 
                        I'll explain everything.  Just meet
                        me where I texted you.   

                                 KATE (O.S.)
                        Will - 

                                 WILL
                        Please.  Just do it. 

           EXT. ROOF, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           You can see the entire shitty town from up here.  The access
           door opens and Kate emerges, wind tousling her short hair. 

                                 KATE
                          (calling out)
                        Will?

           Will waves at her from where he is standing, way across on
           the other side of the roof.  Kate starts toward him. 

                                 WILL
                          (calling out)
                        Stop!

           Will takes out his cell phone, holds it up to show her, then
           hits a button.  Kate's phone rings.  She answers it, confused. 

                                 KATE
                        What are you doing? 

           We STAY on Will.  We can see Kate, standing 30 feet away,
           but her voice comes over Will's cell phone, with a delay
           that is slightly jarring.   

                                 WILL
                        Just don't come any closer. 

                                 KATE
                        Why not?  What's going on?  

                                 WILL
                        I'm gonna give you the short version
                        of an incredibly complicated and
                        fucked up situation, so please be
                        cool.

                          (beat)
                        Some very bad guys strapped a bomb
                        to my chest and they are forcing me
                        to commit a crime. 

                                 KATE
                        Will, I swear, if this is - 

                                 WILL
                        I wish I was joking, but I'm not.  I
                        know it's a lot to swallow, but you
                        gotta take it on face value, because
                        there's a timer attached to this
                        thing and it's counting down. 

           Kate's voice falters -

                                 KATE
                        Oh my god, Will...we'll get help.
                        I'll get you help. 

                                 WILL
                        I didn't come here for help.  I'm
                        taking care of it.  I came here
                        because, should things not work out
                        today as I would like them to, I
                        want you to know why I was doing the
                        things I did.

                                 KATE
                        Please just let me call someone. 
                        Let me do something.  This is crazy! 

                                 WILL
                        I don't disagree with you.  It's
                        fucking nuts.  But that's not even
                        what this is about.  
                          (beat)
                        Do you remember when you found that
                        picture in my car of you, me and
                        Chet, with Chet cut out of it?  

                                 KATE
                        Will, I can't remember about some
                        stupid picture while you're - 

                                 WILL
                        I need you to remember about the
                        picture, and about how I stop by
                        your office every Friday, and how
                        I've always hated all your boyfriends,
                        and how the two girls I've ever
                        seriously dated have looked like
                        less attractive versions of you.

                        Do you see where I'm going with this? 
                        I love you Kate.  I have for a very
                        long time. 

           Kate is barely holding it together. 

                                 KATE
                        Will, this is a lot you're putting
                        on me!  You just told me people are
                        trying to kill you or something, and
                        now you say you love me.  What the
                        fuck is going on? 

                                 WILL
                        A whole lot of shit.  I'm sorry to
                        do this to you, but I was afraid I'd
                        never get the chance to tell you. 
                        And I know you have feelings for me,
                        too.  Maybe you feel for me the way
                        you feel for a good friend, or - if
                        the world fucking hates me - a
                        brother.  But what I hope is that
                        you don't really know how you feel
                        for me, and that maybe when you figure
                        it out you'll realize it's the same
                        way I feel for you.  Does that make
                        any sense?  

                                 KATE
                        Yes.  I mean, I've known you forever. 
                        It's not an easy thing to figure out. 

                                 WILL
                        I don't need an answer now.  Just
                        think about it. 

                                 KATE
                        Okay.  I will.  It's just, the bomb -   

                                 WILL
                        It's distracting.  I know.  Anyway,
                        I'd love to stay and talk some more,
                        but I can't.  I gotta ask you to
                        leave now, because I'm running out
                        of time. 

           Kate nods.  Will hangs up the phone.  She turns back toward
           the access door, stops.  She yells across the roof at Will -

                                 KATE
                        If I had time to think about it...I'd
                        probably tell you that I've always
                        felt very strongly for you.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        And I've never thought of you as a
                        brother. 

           Will smiles, yells back - 

                                 WILL
                        That's a huge relief.  Don't say
                        anything else.  I just really don't
                        want to die now.  

                                 KATE
                        Try not to.  Please. 

           Kate turns and continues to the access door.   

           INT. STAIRWELL, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           Jay paces about the landing that leads up to the roof.  He
           hears the door opening and hurries down the steps to the
           entrance for the nearest floor.  He tries to open the door,
           but it's locked.

           Kate enters the stairwell from the roof access door and spots
           Jay trying to force the door open.  She is holding back tears. 
           He just looks incredibly confused.

                                 JAY
                        I'm, uh...I'm a personal shopper. 
                        I'm looking for Mr. Quilby. 

                                 KATE
                        I'm sorry, I don't know who that is.  

           Kate continues down the stairs, tears coming now.  Jay waits
           a beat, then hurries down and tries the door on the next
           level, which is open. 

           INT. MINIVAN - DAY

           Jay jumps in the van, huffing and puffing. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        So?

                                 JAY
                        I think it was his girlfriend or
                        something.  

                                 DWAYNE
                        Getting one last blow job in case he
                        don't make it.  I kinda like this
                        guy. 
           INT. DATSUN - DAY 

           Will, galvanized by the exchange, hops inside.  

                                 CHET
                        Did you tell her how you saw her
                        naked when she was 13?  That always
                        works. 

                                 WILL
                        I said my piece.  She's gonna think
                        about it. 

                                 CHET
                        Shut up.  She was freaked out. 

                                 WILL
                        Yes.  By the bomb. 

                                 CHET
                        By you. 

                                 WILL
                        Would it be so bad if we ended up
                        together?  You and I would be family.  

                                 CHET
                        I don't want you in the family.  You
                        bring very little to the table.  I
                        want her to be with someone awesome. 
                        A pro quarterback.  A war hero.  At
                        the very least, someone I've never
                        watched porn with.

                                 WILL
                        Well, now it's up to her. 

                                 CHET
                        Not if I set that bomb off myself. 

                                 WILL
                        Then you'd probably never get to rob
                        a bank.  

           Will throws the car into gear and pulls away.  

           SUPER COUNTDOWN: 4 hours, 10 minutes...

                                                             CUT TO:

           EXT. PARKING LOT, DONNER-WELLS NATIONAL BANK - DAY

           The Datsun is parked in the half-full lot.  The guys lean
           against the driver side, with their backs to the bank and
           the car providing cover.  
                                 WILL
                        You go for the money.  I'll cover
                        the crowd.  In and out. 

           Chet clasps his hands around his stomach. 

                                 CHET
                        I'm not feeling so good.  I drank
                        like three of those 5-Hour Energy
                        drinks. 

                                 WILL
                        It's just nerves.  You'll be fine. 

           Chet pulls himself together.  Will slips him one of the
           pistols and he tucks it into his pants.  Will tucks the other
           into his own pants.  He spots something at his feet -

                                 WILL
                        Fuck.  Should we have changed our
                        shoes?  Can they trace the prints? 

                                 CHET
                        I doubt you're the only guy in town
                        with cheap Nikes. 

                                 WILL
                        These are cross trainers.  65 dollars. 
                        Maybe you should have changed yours. 
                        You're the only person alive who
                        still wears Hush Puppies. 

                                 CHET
                        Hush Puppies are back in.  Read the
                        November issue of Men's Health then
                        suck a dick. 

                                 WILL
                        If I was reading Men's Health, chances
                        are I sucked a dick earlier in the
                        day. 

                                 CHET
                        You're thinking of Details. 

                                 WILL
                        Whatever.  The Hush Puppies are a
                        liability, but we don't have time to
                        do anything about it. 
                          (beat)
                        Let's pull our shit together and do
                        this thing. 

           The guys turn and -  
           SLO-MO: we see them stride toward the bank.  They each pull
           on a pair of leather gloves, put the rolled up ski masks on. 

           The guys stop as they get to the door.  They pull the ski
           masks down and take out their spray painted air pistols. 

                                 CHET
                        What should I call you in there,
                        like if I need to ask you to do
                        something?

                                 WILL
                        Call me Tivon.  You'll be Darius. 

                                 CHET
                        I can tell you're not a black guy
                        through the ski mask.

                                 WILL
                        Fine.  Then you'll be Luis and I'm
                        Cruz.  We're two loco motherfuckers
                        and that's the way we gotta roll
                        when we get in there.  

           INT. DONNER-WELLS NATIONAL BANK - DAY

           It's business as usual for a dozen CUSTOMERS and about as
           many EMPLOYEES.  They all just want to get done with their
           shit and go home when -

           Will and Chet burst through the bank doors, guns in hand. 

                                 WILL
                        Everybody put your hands in the air! 

                                 CHET
                        No, get on the ground!

                                 WILL
                        Actually, listen to him and get on
                        the fucking ground!

           Will and Chet are on an adrenaline high, waving their guns
           everywhere.  People scream.

                                 WILL
                        Shut up!  Please!  

           Will frantically scans the panicked crowd for - 

           The SECURITY GUARD (40s), rail thin and jumpy.  Will points
           his gun right at him. 
                                 WILL
                        You, just stand right there and don't
                        do shit!  The rest of you get the
                        fuck down!  Spread your arms and legs! 
                        Why is no one listening to me!?

                                 SECURITY GAURD
                        Just take it easy, man!

                                 WILL
                        Don't be a hero, cowboy!

                                 SECURITY GAURD
                        What the fuck does that mean?  I'm
                        not a hero!  Or a cowboy!

           As people drop to the ground, whispering nervously to one
           another -

           Chet rushes the TELLERS standing behind the bulletproof glass
           partition. 

                                 CHET
                        All of you, back away from the counter
                        and get out here!  Anyone pushes a
                        button and one of these people gets
                        totally shot!  

           The Tellers hurry into the main area of the bank and get
           onto their stomachs. 

           Will looks to the Guard.

                                 WILL
                        Very slowly, take out your gun and
                        toss it away. 

           The Guard takes out his gun, lays it on the ground and shoves
           it away.  The gun slides across the waxed floor and - 

           Right into the outstretched hand of a sobbing MOM (40s),
           whose DAUGHTER (11) lies beside her in a soccer uniform. 
           The Mom loses it - 

                                 MOM
                        Oh, god!  I don't want the gun!  

                                 WILL
                          (to Guard)
                        What the fuck!?  Did you do that on
                        purpose!? 

                                 SECURITY GAURD
                        It was an accident!
                                 CHET
                        Are you guys working together?

                                 MOM
                        No!  Please take this gun away!

                                 WILL
                        Just toss it, lady!

           The Mom slides the gun away like it were on fire.  It skids
           all the way across the floor, slams hard against a wall and 

           BLAM!

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Ah!

           A FAT MAN has been shot.  He clutches his thigh. 

                                 FAT MAN
                        I think she got the femoral artery!  

                                 MOM
                        I'm sorry!  It was an accident!  

                                 FAT MAN
                        Fuck you!  Who slides a gun like that!?

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Mommy, what's happening!?

                                 MOM
                        Christi, be quiet.  These men are
                        dangerous.

           Chet turns ashen.  He moves close to Will, whispers urgently -

                                 CHET
                        This is fucked.  That dude is gonna
                        bleed to death and we're gonna go to
                        prison.  I don't wanna be a white
                        boy on the inside. 

                                 WILL
                        Just calm down.

                                 FAT MAN
                        Why is no one getting me help!?  

                                 WILL
                        Is anyone here a doctor?  

           Nothing.  Just the heavy breathing of many frightened people.
           Will hurries over to the Fat Man, who is bent over, hugging
           his leg.  Will drops to his knees. 

                                 WILL
                        Sir, let me see where you're hit. 

                                 FAT MAN
                        Just call me an ambulance!

                                 WILL
                        Calm down, sir. 

           The Fat Man sits up, removes his hand from his leg.  Will
           nervously takes a look.  There is only a small amount of
           blood.  Will heaves a huge sigh, relieved. 

                                 WILL
                        It's just a flesh wound.  You're
                        gonna be okay. 

                                 FAT MAN
                        But it hurts so bad.  

                                 WILL
                        You got shot, man.  It's not supposed
                        to feel good.  But you're gonna be
                        fine.  And you'll have a great story
                        to tell everyone. 

                                 FAT MAN
                        This is an awful story!  This isn't a
                        bank error in my favor!  I got shot!   

           Some BLOND GUY in gym clothes pipes up - 

                                 BLOND GUY
                        Why don't you just get out of here
                        so we can get the man some help?

                                 WILL
                        You wanna get shot in the leg too,
                        or do you wanna shut fuck up?

                                 BLOND GUY
                        I'm gonna shut the fuck up.

                                 WILL
                        Luis, how we doing on the money?

           Chet snaps back to attention -

                                 CHET
                        Oh, shit.  Sorry, Cruz. 
           Chet picks out the most harmless looking teller, a mousy 20-
           something girl, and helps her up off the ground.  He checks
           her name tag: SANDRA. 

                                 CHET
                        Hey, Sandra.  I know you're probably
                        scared right now, but if you go grab
                        us 100 grand in a bag, we'll get out
                        of here.  This will all be over and
                        you'll be fine.  You trust me?  

           Sandra nods.  Chet smiles reassuringly.  She hurries behind
           the counter, starts filling a bank bag with cash as - 

                                 FAT MAN
                        My leg really hurts!

                                 WILL
                        Can you please hurry up, Sandra!?

           Sandra emerges from behind the partition with the bank bag. 
           Will runs over and grabs it.  He takes a last look at the
           shell-shocked people spread across the floor.

                                 WILL
                        I'm really sorry, everyone.  I know
                        we probably fucked up your day. 
                        We're both really sorry.  Thank you
                        for cooperating, for the most part. 

           The guys head for the door.  A thought occurs to Will -  

                                 WILL
                        Wait. 

           Will looks down at the bag in his hand, then back at Sandra. 

                                 WILL
                        Sandra, you didn't put one of those
                        dye packs in here, did you?  

           Sandra shakes her head, but her eyes tell a different story. 
           Will and Chet look at each other. 

                                 WILL
                        I don't believe her. 

                                 CHET
                        Me, either.  

           Will tosses the bag to a RANDOM GUY. 

                                 WILL
                        Open that.
           The Random Guy opens the bag.  Red dye explodes all over
           him.  He shrieks. 

                                 CHET
                        What the fuck, Sandra?  I thought we
                        had something going back there! 
                        What happened to trust?

                                 SANDRA
                        I'm sorry!  They make us do it!

                                 WILL
                        Could you kindly fill another bag? 
                        Not a bank bag.  A fucking garbage
                        bag.  And Luis, will you watch her
                        this time?  

           Sandra hurries back behind the partition with Chet.  He dumps
           out the contents of a trash can, grabs the bag and watches
           closely as Sandra stuffs it with cash.  He roughly keeps count.

                                 CHET
                        Okay.  That should be enough. 

           Chet grabs the bag and hustles out toward Will.  They are
           home free, until - 

           They hear the wail of approaching sirens outside.  Will loses
           his shit on the Tellers.

                                 WILL
                        Fuck!  One of you assholes tripped
                        the alarm!  I'm a regular guy!  Just
                        like you!  I'm a regular guy and you
                        fucked me!  Thank you for fucking a
                        regular guy!  You in particular,
                        Sandra!  

           People are freaked out.  Sandra is crying, thinking she will
           probably get shot now.

           Chet grabs Will and pulls him toward the door. 

                                 CHET
                        Let's just get the fuck out of here. 

           The guys slam through the doors, out into 

           EXT. PARKING LOT, DONNER-WELLS NATIONAL BANK - DAY

           Just as a lone police cruiser screeches into the lot, siren
           blaring.  Will and Chet try to make a run for it, but the
           cruiser pulls in front of them, cutting them off. 
           OFFICER ZURMAN (21), a jittery rookie, jumps out of the
           cruiser and levels his gun.  The guys reflexively level
           theirs.  They are only about eight feet apart. 

                                 OFFICER ZURMAN
                        Drop your weapons! 

                                 CHET
                        Don't shoot us!

                                 OFFICER ZURMAN
                        Drop the guns or I'll have to!

           Chet looks at Will with utter desperation.  In the distance,
           they can hear the sirens of more cops approaching.  Defeated,
           Chet lays his gun down on the floor.  Will stands his ground. 

                                 WILL
                        Officer, I'm gonna open my jacket. 

                                 OFFICER ZURMAN
                        Do not move a muscle except to drop
                        that goddamn gun!

                                 WILL
                        I'm gonna open my jacket.  And if
                        you want to shoot me, it'll be the
                        dumbest thing you ever did, because
                        I'm wearing a bomb and we will all
                        die. 

           This panics Zurman, but he tries to reel it in.

                                 OFFICER ZURMAN
                        Just stay where you are and don't do
                        a thing! 

                                 WILL
                        You stay where you are, asshole. 
                        I'm the one with the bomb. 

           Will keeps his gun levelled, while unbuttoning the jacket
           with his free hand.  Zurman soon sees that he is not lying
           about the bomb.  Will puts his hand around a cluster of wires. 

                                 WILL
                        If I pull these out, this whole thing
                        goes off.  I have a bomb and a gun
                        and very few options.  So you're the
                        one that's gonna listen to me.  Throw
                        your gun away and handcuff yourself
                        around that pole.  You have ten
                        seconds, and then we all find out
                        who goes to heaven and who goes to
                        hell.  One! 
           Zurman is torn, sweating bullets.  The sirens get closer. 

                                 WILL
                        Fuck it, I'm going straight to seven. 
                        Eight!  Nine!  Goddamn it!

           Will suddenly tightens his grip around the the wires -

                                 OFFICER ZURMAN
                        Don't do it!

           Zurman drops the gun, hurries over to the pole and handcuffs
           himself around it.  

                                 WILL
                        Throw me the keys. 

           Zurman tosses Will the keys.  Will chucks them across the
           lot and the guys sprint for the car. 

                                 CHET
                        That was over the line. 

                                 WILL
                        It kept me alive and you out of jail. 

           In the background, Zurman looks over at Chet's abandoned air
           pistol. 

                                 OFFICER ZURMAN
                        Hey!  Is that a fake gun?  Hey!

           The guys jump in the Datsun and fire it up as two more police
           cruisers race toward the bank.  

           The Datsun peels out of the lot.  The cruisers change course
           and give chase.  The Datsun picks up speed, blowing right by
           the parked 

           INT. MINIVAN - DAY

           Dwayne and Jay excitedly watch as the cars speed off into
           the distance. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Holy shit.  Our boy is causing some
                        serious mayhem. 

                                 JAY
                        He's gonna get caught or killed.

                                 DWAYNE
                        Shut the fuck up and don't jinx it. 
           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Whiplash blur as the three cars race by, one after the other. 
           Airborne leaves flutter in their wake. 

           INT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING

           Chet freaks out as they hurtle toward lunchtime traffic. 
           Will starts weaving in and out of cars. 

                                 CHET
                        Shit!  This is not cool!

           Will is wild eyed, punching the gas.  Chet's head is on a
           swivel.  Behind them: police cruisers in hot pursuit.  Up
           ahead: the world rushing at them at 80 mph, populated by
           nothing but potential collisions that will result in a fiery
           death.

                                 CHET
                        Maybe we should pull over and
                        surrender. 

                                 WILL
                        I can outrun these guys.  They're
                        not the FBI, they're local cops. 
                        Just shut up and let me concentrate. 
                        I do this for a living.  

           As they clip the side-view mirror off a Kia - 

                                 CHET
                        You don't do anything like this for
                        a living!  I am not a pizza, I am a
                        man!

           The cruisers are gaining ground, throttles wide open, engines
           as loud their sirens.  

           Will suddenly downshifts, spiking the RPMs into the red, as
           he banks a hard right and  

           EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

           The Datsun explodes onto a crowded street.  PEDESTRIANS
           crossing an intersection jump out of its way. 

           The cruisers take the turn into town.  One makes it.  The
           other doesn't fare as well and slams into parked cars. 

           INT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING

           Traffic is stopped at a red light.  Will jumps the curb to
           avoid it, slams into a newspaper dispenser.  
           It flips up onto the hood and crashes into the windshield,
           where it stays lodged.

                                 WILL
                        Holy fuck!

           Will blindly barrels through the intersection.  Horns blare
           as cars he cannot see swerve to avoid him.  Will finally
           slams the brakes, the momentum knocking the dispenser loose
           and launching it onto the sidewalk, scattering Pedestrians.  

           Chet whirls around to see the cruiser flying right at them. 

                                 CHET
                        Go!  Go!  Go!

           Will steps on the gas, but he has no shot of getting up to
           speed fast enough to outrun the approaching cruiser.  He
           whips the wheel left and guns it for the mouth of an alley.  

           The cruiser skids into a turn and follows.  It catches up to
           the Datsun and slams into it as the two cars squeeze into 

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY

           Sparks fly as the cruiser rams the Datsun, trying to trap it
           in the tight space.  

           INT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING

           Glass rains in on Chet as his side of the car is smashed
           against the alley wall. 

                                 CHET
                        Why aren't you hitting him back!?

                                 WILL
                        I'm trying!  But we have a very light
                        car!  It's built for speed! 

           Will attempts to the ram the cruiser back and jockey for
           position, but the other car is just too heavy.  

           Up ahead, a dumpster narrows the path.  The guys are on a
           collision course right for it.  Will jams the gas. 

                                 CHET
                        Why are you speeding up!? 

                                 WILL
                        I can make it.

                                 CHET
                        You can what?
           Will upshifts and leaps ahead of the cruiser just in time to
           edge it out and squeeze through the gap between the dumpster
           and the wall.  They fly toward the exit of the alley and 

           EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

           The Datsun catapults out of the alley, skids through a turn,
           over a median, and winds up facing off with oncoming traffic. 

           The cruiser flies out of the alley a moment later and is
           immediately - 

           T-boned by traffic in a brutal, crunching collision. 

           INT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING

           Will jumps back over the median, moving with traffic now. 
           The cruiser wreckage disappears in his rear-view mirror as
           he floors it toward an intersection. 

                                 WILL
                        That guy got fucked up. 

           In the rushing moment as they cross intersection, Chet
           glimpses the other cruiser barreling toward his side of the
           car from the perpendicular street.  He has a millisecond,
           maybe, to process their impending doom, and then - 

           The cruiser smashes into the back passenger side of the car. 

           EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

           The Datsun is sent spinning like a fucking top.  Its ruined
           back wheel catches, sending the car tumbling onto its roof.

           INT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING

           Madness.  The guys scream as the car continues to slide,
           upside down, out of control.  As it slams into a row of
           parking meters, the world goes  

           BLACK

           Will blinks back to reality.  He's hanging, inverted, by his
           seat belt.  The car is a pool of shattered glass.  It twinkles
           up at him.  Hours could have been passed, but it's only been
           seconds.  He sucks in air.  Satisfied that he is, in fact,
           still alive, he looks over at -

           A battered and bruised Chet, head drooping straight back.  

                                 WILL
                        Chet?  Are you okay?  Chet!? 
                                 CHET
                          (rousing)
                        Oh my god...

                                 WILL
                        Talk to me. 

                                 CHET
                        I thought you were gonna blow up.

           Will's hands go to the bomb...still intact. 

                                 WILL
                        No.  Luckily your side took most of
                        the impact.  

                                 CHET
                        Awesome. 

                                 WILL
                        We gotta keep moving. 

           Will unclicks his seat belt and falls to the roof of the
           car.  He moves to Chet, unclicks his belt and helps him down.  

           EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

           Will emerges from the overturned car.  He drags Chet out
           behind him, followed by the bag of cash.  He glances up to
           see the OFFICER who crashed into them stumbling out of his
           own ruined car, which has turned a fire hydrant into a geyser. 
           Another cruiser races to the scene.    

                                 WILL
                        Oh, fuck, man.  Come on. 

           Will pulls Chet to his feet and they take off, rounding a
           corner on wobbly feet.

                                 WILL
                          (between huffs)
                        Chet...I don't know how to tell you
                        this...but you got a piece of the
                        car in you. 

                                 CHET
                        What!?

                                 WILL
                        In your back. 

           Chet glances back to see a jagged piece of metal sticking
           out of his shoulder blade.   
                                 CHET
                        Ah!  Get it out!

                                 WILL
                        I will. 

                                 CHET
                        Do it now!  

                                 WILL
                        All right. 

           Without breaking stride, Will yanks the piece of metal out
           of Chet's back.  He screams. 

                                 CHET
                        Is it rusty?  Am I gonna get tetanus? 

           Behind them, two Officers turn onto the street in full sprint. 
           They are way faster than the guys and soon gain on them. 
           Will can barely keep up with Chet. 

                                 WILL
                        How are you moving so fast in Hush
                        Puppies? 

                                 CHET
                        How are you moving so slowly?

                                 WILL
                        This bomb isn't exactly aerodynamic. 

           Will spots a bar up ahead and pulls Chet into it. 

           INT. BAR - DAY

           The guys book past scattered PATRONS. 

                                 WILL
                        This way!

           They head for the 

           INT. BATHROOM, BAR - DAY

           Will slams the door shut behind them, looks for a lock that
           isn't there.

                                 WILL
                        Out the window. 

           As Chet forces a window open - 

           Will drags a large condom machine and tips it over in front
           of the door. 
           Chet disappears through the window.  The door slams as the
           Officers fight to push the condom machine out of the way. 

           Will hurries out the window.

           EXT. BACK OF BAR - DAY

           The guys run and leap up onto a chain link fence, claw their
           way over as the Officers come out of the bar window, one
           after the other. 

           Chet and Will land in the back of some store and yank the
           service entrance open.

           INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY

           Will and Chet emerge from the back area and shove past
           SHOPPERS.  Will takes out an entire rack of clothing, stumbles
           back up to his feet, keeps going. 

           EXT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY

           The guys push out the door and frantically search for an
           escape.  They spot -

           A bus pulling up to a stop down the street. 

           They sprint for the bus, peeling off their ski masks and
           waving as it lazily rolls away from the stop.  

                                 WILL
                        Hey!  Over here!

           The bus slows and the guys trip over each other to board it. 
           It starts to pull away again as -

           The Officers emerge from the clothing store, looking around
           for our guys.  They head for an alley across the street as
           the bus inconspicuously continues on its route.

           INT. BUS - DAY - MOVING

           The guys fall into seats, huffing and puffing, a complete
           mess, Will clutching the trash bag.  He looks to the DRIVER. 

                                 WILL
                        This thing stop anywhere near Harring
                        Street?

                                 DRIVER
                        Nope. 

                                 WILL
                        Great.  Just let us off at the next
                        stop.  
           Will leans his head back against the window.  The town rolls
           by behind him. 

           EXT. BUS STOP - DAY

           Will and Chet get off the bus and it pulls away.  

           EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

           A crowd has grown around the crash sites, which have been
           roped off by law enforcement.  Fire trucks and ambulances
           are on the scene.  LOCALS gossip and try to get a peak. 

           Dwayne and Jay make their way through the crowd, trying to
           see what's what.  Dwayne approaches a RANDOM LOCAL.

                                 DWAYNE
                        You hear what happened to the guys
                        they were after?

                                 RANDOM LOCAL
                        Sounds like they got away. 

           Dwayne and Jay beam.   

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

           The guys are covered in sweat as they hike along, eyes
           constantly on the lookout.  They finally arrive at Will's
           parked Mustang.  Will hugs the car.

                                 WILL
                        I never thought I'd see you again. 

                                 CHET
                        I thought you hated this car. 

                                 WILL
                        It's actually not that bad.  You know,
                        as compared to that Datsun.  The
                        Mustang's got more comfortable seats. 
                        And it never would have flipped over. 

           INT. MUSTANG - DAY

           The guys get in, slam the doors.  They sit there for a moment,
           silent except for their heavy breathing.  Will's eyes go to
           the garbage bag sitting between them.  After a beat - 

                                 WILL
                        There's a 100 grand in there.  100
                        fucking grand.  Which we stole. 
                        From a bank. 
                                 CHET
                        I told a bunch of people I was gonna
                        shoot someone.  I was like "you
                        fucking move, and I will kill you
                        where you stand!"

                                 WILL
                        I threatened to blow a cop up.
                          (beat)
                        And you never said "I will kill you
                        where you stand."

                                 CHET
                        I know.  But shit did get pretty crazy.

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, it did.  

           Will looks to Chet, starts to get a little emotional. 

                                 WILL
                        You know, there's no one I would
                        have rather taken down a fucking
                        bank with.  I mean that.  

           Chet smiles.

                                 CHET
                        Me, neither. 

                                 WILL
                        And as for all that shit I said...and
                        all that shit I did...I hope you can
                        forgive me.  We've been friends for
                        so long, and I guess you hurt the
                        people you're closest to the most.  

                                 CHET
                        I messed up, too.  I'm a dude who
                        slept with his best friend's ex-
                        girlfriend, and destroyed his parents'
                        marriage, and sat on the sidelines
                        watching his downward spiral.  I'm a
                        shitty human being.  But I'm glad
                        you know that now, because you can
                        accept me for who I am. 

                                 WILL
                        I do.  I accept you.  Because you
                        accept me. 

           Will goes in for a hug.  Chet gets lost in the moment, before
           jumping backward. 
                                 CHET
                        Woah!  You still got a bomb on you. 

                                 WILL
                        You're right.  Let's take care of
                        that.  But you owe me a hug. 

           Will pulls the slip of paper Dwayne gave him from his pocket.  

                                 WILL
                        It's all gravy from here. 

           Will takes out his cell and dials the number.   

                                                       INTERCUT WITH:

           EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

           Dwayne answers his vibrating cell phone.  He and Jay move
           away from the crowd.

                                 DWAYNE
                        This who I think it is?

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        Can't you hear the ticking in the
                        background?

                                 DWAYNE
                        You know, you're a pretty funny guy.

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        Thanks.  I'm happy to entertain a
                        complete psychopath.

                                 DWAYNE
                        Now wait a second, you're the murderer. 

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        What's that supposed to mean?

                                 DWAYNE
                        One of those cops who wrecked his
                        car chasing you...he ain't breathing
                        no more. 

           Will goes white, covers the phone and whispers to Chet -

                                 WILL
                        We killed a cop. 

                                 CHET
                        You were driving!  I'm just an
                        accomplice. 
                                 DWAYNE (O.S.)
                        What's up now, cop killer?  That
                        motherfucker got decapitated.  Fuck
                        the po-lice, right? 

                                 WILL
                          (whispers to Chet)
                        He got decapitated. 

                                 CHET
                        We're going to hell.  We're literally
                        gonna burn. 

           Dwayne overhears this, starts to crack up.  

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        What's so fucking funny!?   

                                 DWAYNE
                        I'm just messin' with you.  No one
                        got decapitated.  How'd a moron like
                        you manage to rob a bank?

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        Jesus!  Can we just get this over
                        with?  Where do you want the money?

                                 DWAYNE
                        There's a boarded up gas station out
                        on Commerce Avenue, past the highway. 
                        Be there in 30 minutes.  

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        I'll be there in ten. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Then you'll be standing around with
                        your dick in one hand, and my money
                        in the other. 

           Dwayne hangs up.  He starts dialing another number. 

           INT. TACKY APARTMENT - DAY

           Juicy hangs up her phone and leaps off a white leather couch. 
           Her silk nightgown trails open as she runs into the 

           INT. BEDROOM, TACKY APARTMENT - DAY

           Where a glassy-eyed African-American man (30s) lounges on
           the bed in his underwear, watching some disturbing porn. 
           His hair is arranged into tight cornrows, and his muscled
           body is covered in calligraphic prison ink.  This is VAUGHN. 

           Juicy climbs onto the bed and straddles him. 
                                 JUICY
                        Money's on its way, baby.  

           Vaughn looks past her, at the porn, where some coked up doll
           does something involving several dicks. 

                                 VAUGHN
                        Shit doesn't even get me off anymore. 

                                 JUICY
                        I'll get you off, Vaughn.  After we
                        get that money, I'll make you so hot.  

                                 VAUGHN
                        After we get that money, I gotta
                        kill some old man.  You wanna suck a
                        killer's dick?

                                 JUICY
                        Oh, yeah.  And then I wanna go back
                        to Baltimore with you, papi.  You
                        know I can ride.   

           Vaughn turns back to her.  Squeezes one of her pierced
           nipples.  She moans. 

                                 VAUGHN
                        Yeah, I bet you can.  Let's just get
                        that cash first.  

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           The Mustang shrieks past us. 

           SUPER COUNTDOWN: 2 hours, 58 minutes...

                                                             CUT TO:

           INT. MCDONALD'S - DAY

           Dwayne and Jay sit at table with a fast food feast spread
           out.  Dwayne eats a Big Mac, a look of utter satisfaction on
           his face, a man whom the gods have finally smiled down upon.  

                                 DWAYNE
                        I'm not ashamed to say it, Jay, but
                        I've gone through some dark times
                        these past few years.  Depression. 
                        Addiction to a variety of shit, which
                        I won't go into.  I know you must
                        think that's pretty silly, especially
                        since you manage to get through the
                        day and you don't got shit going on
                        as compared to me.  But that's just
                        the way it is.  That's life.  
           Jay looks pretty affected that Dwayne is opening up to him. 

                                 JAY
                        You know, if you ever want to talk
                        about that kinda stuff - 

                                 DWAYNE
                        I don't.  My whole point I was trying
                        to make before you interrupted me
                        was that that shit is all in the
                        past.  'Cause I did it.  I pulled it
                        off.  And now my life is gonna be so
                        good I'm gonna have to hire someone
                        to help me enjoy it. 

           Dwayne takes another bite of his Big Mac, savors it. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        There is one thing that worries me. 

                                 JAY
                        What is it?

           Dwayne makes sure no one is listening, lowers his voice -

                                 DWAYNE
                        If I was willing to kill my own daddy
                        to get at that money, then how can I
                        ever trust anyone not to kill me for
                        the same fucking reason?  

                                 JAY
                        I'd never kill you.  Ever. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        I know you wouldn't.  But what about
                        the rest of our crew?  
                          (beat)
                        That's why the first thing I'm gonna
                        do is hire a fleet of personal
                        bodyguards.  And all of them are
                        gonna be retards. 

                                 JAY
                        Retards?

                                 DWAYNE
                        Yes, Jay, retards.  Water heads. 
                        The type of people you rode the bus
                        to school with. 

                                 JAY
                        Why the hell would you do that?
                                 DWAYNE
                        'Cause they ain't smart enough to
                        want my money.  And they can fuck up
                        anyone who does come at me with their
                        super strength.  You see, since their
                        minds don't work, their bodies
                        compensate.  I got attacked by one
                        in grammar school and he nearly split
                        my skull.  I get like five or six
                        retards, pay 'em in quarters and
                        dimes...I'll be untouchable.  
                          (seriously)
                        But listen to me, Jay...don't you
                        ever give one of the retards a
                        firearm, 'cause they're liable to
                        shoot themselves.  And then we gotta
                        find a new one.  

                                 JAY
                        Where are we gonna find six retards
                        in the first place? 

                                 DWAYNE
                          (matter of factly)
                        At the zoo.  They like to watch things
                        fuck. 

           Jay thinks this over for a beat. 

                                 JAY
                        I guess it's a pretty smart plan. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Of course it is.  It's just good
                        business.  Like hiring a Mexican to
                        paint your house. 

           Dwayne polishes off his Big Mac.  Leans back and loosens his
           belt. 

           EXT. BOARDED UP GAS STATION - DAY

           Weeds have overtaken the abandoned place.  There is nothing
           around for miles, except a few long forgotten industrial
           buildings, windows shattered, rotting. 

           Will leans against his parked car, waiting.  Chet is nowhere
           to be seen.  

           Down the road, Will spots a car approach.  It is a 1997 Nissan
           Sentra, murdered out, complete with a flat black paint job.  

           The Sentra pulls into the station and parks on the opposite
           end from the Mustang.  Vaughn steps out of the car.  He could
           not look more menacing.  
           Juicy hangs back in the passenger seat.  Will is a bit uneasy.  

                                 WILL
                        Where are the other guys?

                                 VAUGHN
                        I'm the only guy. 
                          (beat)
                        You got it?

           Will picks up the garbage bag at his feet.  He and Vaughn
           approach each other and meet between the two cars.  Vaughn
           stands nearly a foot taller than Will.  Will hands over the
           bag.  Vaughn opens it, looks in. 

                                 VAUGHN
                        What the fuck did you do...rob a
                        bank?

                                 WILL
                          (incredulous)
                        Yes.  

           Vaughn grins. 

                                 WILL
                        Now where's the code?

                                 VAUGHN
                        I don't have any code.   

           Vaughn turns to leave.  Will grabs his arm.  Vaughn stops,
           looks purposefully down at Will's hand.  Will draws back. 

                                 WILL
                        Listen, man, I just want the code. 

                                 VAUGHN
                        I don't know what the fuck you're
                        talking about. 

                                 WILL
                        The code for the fucking bomb!

           Will opens his jacket.  Vaughn takes a sudden step back.  

                                 VAUGHN
                        What kind of stupid motherfucker
                        wears a bomb to a drop? 

                                 WILL
                        Your boss put this on me. 

                                 VAUGHN
                        I am my boss. 
                                 WILL
                        Then give me the code! 

                                 VAUGHN
                        Motherfucker, I don't know no goddamn
                        code.  Whoever told you I did, lied
                        to you.  Now step the fuck off, or
                        I'll shoot you in the face so you
                        don't explode and mess up my boots. 

           Vaughn goes to leave again.  Will runs ahead of him and gets
           in his way. 

                                 WILL
                        If you don't have the code, I want
                        that money back. 

                                 VAUGHN
                        The only way you're getting this
                        money back is if you kill me. 

                                 WILL
                        You do not know what I've gone through
                        for that money!

                                 VAUGHN
                        I do not care.

                                 WILL
                        Gimme the fucking money!

           In an instant, Vaughn has a very large gun out, and it is
           aimed at Will's head. 

                                 VAUGHN
                        Step aside.   

           INT. SENTRA - DAY

           Hip-hop pounds.  Juicy looks on with interest as Vaughn holds
           Will at gunpoint.  She can't hear what they are saying over
           the music.  Suddenly, she spots  

           EXT. BOARDED UP GAS STATION - DAY

           Chet creeping up behind Vaughn, from wherever he was hiding,
           clutching a large metal pipe.  

           Juicy jumps out of the Sentra, screaming -

                                 JUICY
                        Vaughn, look out!

           Vaughn whirls around toward Chet, just in time to have his
           gun arm smashed by the pipe.  The weapon drops from his hand.  
           Chet takes another swing, cracking Vaughn across the face. 
           He howls, blood spraying, and topples over.  Chet goes for
           another swing, when - 

           Juicy jumps on him, wildly biting and clawing.   

           Will grabs the back of Juicy's track jacket for leverage and
           flings her away.  She hits the back of the Sentra and careens
           clear across the trunk 

                                 WILL
                        Let's go!

           Will grabs the money.  Chet kicks Vaughn's gun into the
           bushes.  The guys break for the Mustang and get in. 

           Juicy gets to her feet, runs right by a dazed Vaughn and
           after the car, which pulls out into the road and leaves her
           behind, screaming and cursing. 

           INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING

           Will's mind is racing. 

                                 WILL
                        What the fuck was that?  

                                 CHET
                        They tried to screw us.  You're a
                        liability.  They were just gonna let
                        you blow up.  

                                 WILL
                        Not with the money they won't. 

           INT. JAY'S GARAGE WORKSHOP - DAY

           A tidy space, filled with various half-finished devices,
           action figures and heavy metal posters. 

           Dwayne and Jay are hanging on an old couch.  Dwayne appears
           to be weeping. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        This is exactly how I'm gonna look
                        when I gotta go down to the morgue
                        and identify the body.  Pretty
                        convincing, right?

           Jay nods, impressed.  Dwayne turns off the waterworks.  

                                 DWAYNE
                        I can cry on command.  I just draw
                        on a painful memory.  Basically,
                        anything from my childhood. 
           Dwayne's cell phone vibrates.  He looks at the incoming
           number, slightly concerned.  He answers. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        You drop the money yet?

           Will yells into the phone - 

                                 WILL
                        No!  I've still got the money!  And
                        I cracked your friend's face open!

                                 DWAYNE (O.S.)
                        Why the fuck would you do that!?

                                 WILL
                        You lied!  You said I'd get the code!

           Dwayne is panicked, covers badly -

                                 DWAYNE
                        I gave him the code.  He told me he
                        committed it to memory.  Maybe he was
                        just embarrassed that he forgot it.  

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        You didn't give him shit.  I want
                        the code now or you'll never see
                        this money.

                                 DWAYNE
                        Hold on there, big man.  You got a
                        bomb on you.  I got a cell phone
                        that detonates it.  You're not exactly
                        negotiating from a position of
                        leverage. 

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        I'm holding the money.  I blow up,
                        and it blows up.  Who has the leverage
                        now?  Go ahead and push the button,
                        you idiot.  

           Chet freaks out -

                                 CHET
                        Don't tell him to push the button. 
                        Pull over.  Pull over. 

           Dwayne is getting pissed off. 
                                 DWAYNE
                        Why don't you watch what the fuck
                        you say?  I own you!  I tell you to
                        rob a bank, and you rob a bank.  I
                        tell you to give me the money, and
                        you give me the goddamn money and
                        hope I show you some mercy. 

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        I'm tired of this bullshit.  I'm
                        already dead, right?  So fuck you. 
                        At least I'll die rich.  I can't say
                        the same for you. 

           The line goes dead.  Dwayne looks to Jay, shocked. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        That piece of shit hung up on me. 

           INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING

           Chet grabs the wheel and forces Will to pull over. 

                                 CHET
                        Get me out of this car! 

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Chet jumps out while the Mustang is still slowing down.  He
           runs 20 yards away.  Will turns the car off and gets out. 

                                 CHET
                        That was colossally stupid!

                                 WILL
                        It was a negotiation tactic.  He'll
                        call back and I won't answer.  Then
                        he'll call back and I will answer,
                        and he'll realize the only way he
                        gets the money is if he gives me the
                        code. 

                                 CHET
                        Or he'll just let you die! 

           Will lets this sink in. 

                                 WILL
                        Fine.  But I didn't have a choice. 

           Will takes the garbage bag from the car and tosses it toward
           Chet. 

                                 CHET
                        What are you doing?
                                 WILL
                        I want you to have the money.  In
                        case I'm a bad negotiator.  But don't
                        save it.  Buy something cool with it. 

           Despite himself, Chet cracks a smile. 

                                 CHET
                        I'll be the only teacher at school
                        with a used Ferrari.  

                                 WILL
                        All the girls will want to fuck you. 

                                 CHET
                        They already do. 

           INT. JAY'S GARAGE WORKSHOP - DAY

           Dwayne fumes as Will's phone goes to voicemail.  He throws
           his cell across the room. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        I can't believe the nerve of that

                                 JAY
                        Maybe we should actually give him
                        the code. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        We're not amateurs.  He's a loose
                        end.  I'll be walking out of my
                        mansion someday and...bam!  FBI,
                        CIA, NSA, all converging on my front
                        lawn, 'cause a loose end turned
                        state's evidence and they got what
                        they need to put me away. 

           Dwayne's phone vibrates across the room.  He whirls on Jay.

                                 DWAYNE
                        Go get it!

           Jay scurries after the phone and retrieves it.  Dwayne answers - 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Glad you came to your fucking senses.

           Vaughn has a rag pressed to his swollen, bloody face.  Juicy
           is nearby, banged up and dirty.  Vaughn yells into his cell -  
                                 VAUGHN
                        Who the fuck do you think you're

                        I honestly don't know.

                        Let me give you a hint: your boy
                        just jumped me, tossed my bitch like
                        a rag doll and split with the cash.  

           Dwayne realizes who's on the other line, recovers -

                                 DWAYNE
                        That guy's not my boy.  He's a dick. 
                        I'm sorry for all the, uh, confusion. 

                                 VAUGHN (O.S.)
                        Confusion?  The only motherfucker
                        that's confused is you.  Apparently,
                        you think you can fuck me and survive
                        the day.

                        I wasn't fucking you, I was fucking
                        him.  You gotta understand, you're
                        like a pawn in a much larger game

                        I didn't mean it like that.  I'm
                        just juggling a whole lot of shit.

           Vaughn hangs up, tosses the bloody rag to the ground and
           screams in frustration.  Juicy looks over.

                        No.  I can't risk him fucking around. 
                        He's obviously got a death wish.  We
                        arrange another drop, he's liable to
                        pull some shit and get us all killed. 
                        We need to get the leverage back.

           Kate goes to the mirror, checks herself out.  She has
           obviously been crying.  She splashes water on her face, then
           enters a stall. 

           We hear the sound of her peeing.  The bathroom door opens
           and Dwayne and Jay enter.  Jay wedges his foot against the
           door so it cannot be opened from the outside.  Dwayne pulls
           something hairy from his pocket. 

           Inside the stall, Kate reaches for some toilet paper...from
           underneath the stall barriers, she notices two pairs of dirty,
           obviously masculine sneakers standing there.  Her breath goes
           shallow.  She takes out her cell phone, quietly opens it. 
           She presses the first 9 in "911," but her keypad volume is on
           and the phone makes a dull, electronic beep that echoes in
           the quiet bathroom.  She curses under her breath. 

                                 DWAYNE (O.S.)
                        Why don't you just slide the phone
                        under the door, so I don't have to
                        kick it open and see you with your
                        panties down. 

           From outside the stall, we see the phone slide out.  Dwayne
           crushes it with a sudden, violent stomp.  After a beat, the
           stall door opens and Kate emerges.  She gasps at -  

           The two ominous men standing there in gorilla masks.  Dwayne's
           gun is plainly visible, tucked into the front of his pants.  

                                 DWAYNE
                        What's the quietest way out of the
                        building?  'Cause I might get excited
                        in a confrontation, and you might
                        wind up shot. 

           EXT. LIVING ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY

           The Major is watching reruns of Three's Company.  He doesn't
           laugh or remotely smile at any of it.

           The subtle click of a door opening somewhere in the house
           does not escape his finely tuned senses. 

                                 MAJOR
                        Dwayne?

           Nothing. 

           The Major gets up and goes to a desk, rifles through a drawer
           and pulls something out.  A simple pen.  He clutches it like
           a weapon. 
           INT. HALLWAY, NICE HOUSE - DAY

           The Major creeps along. 

                                 VAUGHN (O.S.)
                        Just stay where you are, old man. 

           The Major turns to find Vaughn standing ten feet away,
           pointing a gun at him. 

                                 VAUGHN
                        I'm looking for your son. 

                                 MAJOR
                        Even if I knew where he was, I
                        wouldn't tell you nothing.  

                                 VAUGHN
                        Don't be stupid. 

                                 MAJOR
                        You know, I saved a black man's life
                        in the shit.  So if I took yours I'd
                        be even. 

                                 VAUGHN
                        I see where your son gets his common
                        sense.  But you might want to readjust
                        your attitude, because I ain't fucking
                        around.  I want Dwayne.  I don't know
                        why you'd want to protect him, the
                        motherfucker hired me to kill you. 

           If this news has any effect at all on The Major, he doesn't
           show it.  

                                 VAUGHN
                        Just tell me where he is!

           Vaughn pulls back the hammer of his gun.  The Major stares
           down the barrel.  

                                 MAJOR
                        You think I'm scared of death? 
                        There's a whole generation of gooks
                        that think I'm the grim reaper. 

           Vaughn shakes his head.  Almost imperceptibly, The Major
           repositions the hand with the pen in it.  Vaughn is about to
           squeeze the trigger -

           But The Major beats him to it, clicking the pen, which is
           actually a pen gun.  It fires a .22 caliber round into
           Vaughn's neck.  He drops the gun and clutches the geyser of
           blood. 
           The Major charges Vaughn, jumps on him and wrestles him to
           ground, trying to jam the pen into the wound in his neck.  

                                 MAJOR
                        I'll ride you all the way to hell,
                        you black bastard!

           Vaughn manages to get a hand free and reaches for his gun. 
           His fingers curl around it and he whips it across The Major's
           face, knocking him backwards. 

           Vaughn scrambles to his feet, gun pointed at the felled Major. 

                                 VAUGHN
                        What now, old man!?  You can't kill
                        me!  None of y'all can kill me! 

           The Major looks up at Vaughn, once again face to face with a
           loaded weapon. 

                                 MAJOR
                        Go on and - 

           BANG! 

           The life snaps out of The Major, one searing hole in his
           chest. 

           Vaughn clasps his hand to his neck to staunch the flow of
           blood.  He steps over the The Major's body and continues
           upstairs. 

           INT. BATHROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY

           Vaughn rifles through the cabinets, dumping all of the first
           aid supplies into the sink.  He gets to work on his wound. 

           INT. DWAYNE'S ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY

           The locked door is kicked open.  Vaughn, neck crudely
           bandaged, flicks on the lights.  He looks around the childish
           room.  Chinese Fighting Fish swim in a large tank, seem to
           stop and look out at him like guard dogs.

           Vaughn ransacks the place, flipping the bed, pulling drawers
           out.  He finds a desk drawer locked.  He searches for
           something to jimmy it open with, comes up with nothing.  He
           kicks it in frustration.  Then he takes out his gun and blows
           the drawer open. 

           Vaughn pulls a stuffed file folder out of the drawer.  Flips
           through it.  It's full of details about Dwayne's plan, the
           tanning salon, etc.  Vaughn shakes his head. 
                                 VAUGHN
                        Motherfucker has lost his mind...

           He finds a map of the town in the file.  Three locations are
           highlighted: the bank, the boarded up gas station, and the
           radio tower.  PUSH IN on the radio tower.

           Vaughn stuffs the map into his back pocket.  He stops before
           leaving the room, turns back and shatters the fish tank with
           the butt of his gun.  Water spills out and the Chinese
           Fighting Fish flop onto the floor.  As Vaughn lifts a boot
           to stomp them - 

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Will sits with a thousand yard stare.  Chet calls over -

                                 CHET
                        It's time.  We gotta call the cops.

           Chet gestures to the vast emptiness all around them. 

                                 CHET
                        These guys obviously aren't watching
                        you anymore. 

           Will nods, stands up and dusts his pants. 

                                 WILL
                        You know, even if they get the bomb
                        squad here in time, and they can
                        somehow get this thing off me, we
                        still gotta answer for the robbery.  

                                 CHET
                        I guess I don't get my Ferrari.

                                 WILL
                        I'll tell them I forced you into it. 
                        That you didn't have a choice. 

                                 CHET
                        Thanks, man. 

           Suddenly, Will stiffens.  His hand goes to his pocket.  It's
           vibrating.  He pulls out his cell. 

                                 WILL
                        It's them. 

           Will answers the phone -  
                                 WILL
                        You ready to talk now?

                                                       INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. MINIVAN - DAY - MOVING

           Dwayne drives with his cell pressed to his ear.  Jay keeps
           watch on Kate in back.  She is blindfolded, hands bound behind
           her back with duct tape. 

                                 DWAYNE
                          (into phone)
                        Yeah, I'm ready to talk.  I want my
                        money.  Meet me back at the radio
                        tower in 50 minutes.

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        I've barely got an hour left!

                                 DWAYNE
                        That's the point.  I want you on a
                        short leash. 

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        Fuck that.  Give me the code first. 
                        Then you can have your money.  You'll
                        just have to trust me when I say
                        that I don't want it.  

                                 DWAYNE
                        Yeah, I'm sure.  You just wanna go
                        back to your fantastic life.  Your
                        great job.  And that blonde bitch
                        with the sexy voice. 

           Will's mind jumps to the only logical conclusion.  Roller
           coaster stomach drop.  His voice cracks as he asks a useless
           question - 

                                 WILL
                        What the fuck is that supposed to
                        mean?

                                 DWAYNE (O.S.)
                        It means that girl you paid a visit
                        to today is sitting in the back of
                        my van right now.  And it ain't
                        exactly consensual.  

           Will explodes.  

                                 WILL
                        Fuck you!  You crossed a line!
           Dwayne just laughs, maniacally. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        There are no lines!  There's just me
                        and you and 100 thousand dollars. 
                        Once we get that shit in order, you
                        can have her back, and your life,
                        too.  So you're gonna show up where
                        I say, when I say.  Alone.  And if
                        you try anything stupid, the two of
                        you will be delivering pizzas to
                        Saint Peter.   

                                 WILL
                        Let me talk to her. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        You got ten seconds. 

           Dwayne hands the phone back to Jay, who puts it up to Kate's
           ear.  She is trembling.  

                                 KATE
                        Will...?

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        Kate, I'm so sorry. 

                                 KATE
                        It's okay...I'm fine...I'm just really - 

           Dwayne reaches back and snatches the cell phone.

                                 DWAYNE
                        She's just really gonna die if you
                        fuck this up. 

           Will absorbs this like a blow to the chest.  The line
           disconnects.  Will suddenly shouts skyward - 

                                 WILL
                        Fuck!

           Chet looks over, confused, agitated. 

                                 CHET
                        What happened? 

                                 WILL
                        They have Kate.

                                 CHET
                        What the fuck does that mean!? 
                                 WILL
                        They took her, man.  They must have
                        followed us to her office. 

                                 CHET
                        Damn it!  You had to go her to see!

                                 WILL
                        I'm sorry.  I messed up...I finally
                        messed up worse than I could have
                        possibly imagined.  

                                 CHET
                        We gotta get her back, Will.  These
                        guys are crazy. 

                                 WILL
                        We still got the money.  As long as
                        we have that, she's alive.  
                          (beat)
                        Come on. 

           Chet grabs the bag of cash, their only hope.  They hustle
           into the car and it peels out, leaving behind a swirling
           cloud of dust.  As the sun begins to set - 

           SUPER COUNTDOWN: 58 minutes...

                                                             CUT TO:

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Two menacing headlights come at us on the empty road.  They
           belong to 

           INT. SENTRA - NIGHT - MOVING

           Vaughn holds up Dwayne's map as he drives.  He seems to be
           on the right road, headed for the radio tower.  He crumples
           the map and throws it in back. 

           EXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           The Mustang stops by the gate to the radio tower.  Chet jumps
           out and quickly disappears into the bushes.  The Mustang
           continues through the gate. 

           EXT. RADIO TOWER - NIGHT

           The property lights illuminate the area.  The Mustang pulls
           up.  Will gets out and looks around the deserted place.  He
           holds up the bag of money.

                                 WILL
                        I'm here!  
           In the shadow of the nearby shed, the minivan is revealed as
           its interior lights come on.  The door opens and Dwayne
           emerges, in his mask. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        How much time you got left?

           Will takes off the jacket and tosses it to the ground.  He
           looks at the timer. 

                                 WILL
                        Ten minutes. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Damn.  Maybe we should just wait
                        around for the money shot. 

           The guys approach each other and meet in a clearing, Will
           still keeping his distance a bit.  Dwayne nods at the bag. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        That the money? 

                                 WILL
                        Maybe.  Where's the girl?

           Dwayne grins. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        In the van.  Maybe.  

                                 WILL
                        Get her out here.  You're wasting
                        time. 

           Will grips the bag close to him.  

           Dwayne whistles loudly.  The minivan door opens and Jay steps
           out, also in his mask.  Strapped to his back is the frame
           pack we saw at his workshop.  A long tube connects the pack
           to the handle of a metal pipe-like device in his hand.  

           Jay pulls Kate, still bound and blindfolded, out of the van. 
           They approach Dwayne and take up position behind him.  

                                 KATE
                        Will, are you there?

                                 WILL
                        I'm here.  It's gonna be okay. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        This is a fucking tearjerker. 
                                 WILL
                        Just let her come over here. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        I will.  But you should know, my
                        associate over there is packing a
                        flamethrower. 

           Jay menacingly aims the metal device he has been holding. 
           He hits a button and a pilot light comes on. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        So if you were planning on pulling
                        some shit, I'd think again.  I doubt
                        either of you can outrun a 25-foot
                        flame. 
                          (gestures to gun in his belt)
                        Or a bullet. 

           Dwayne roughly pulls Kate away from Jay and shoves her
           forward.  Will grabs her, pulls her blindfold off and pushes
           her behind him, protectively. 

                                 WILL
                        Get back. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        I gave you the girl.  Now give me
                        the money. 

                                 WILL
                        How about we get the code out of the
                        way first, since this bomb happens
                        to be ticking so close to all of us.

                                 DWAYNE
                        Fair enough.

           Dwayne pulls a slip of paper from his pocket. 

                                 DWAYNE
                          (taunting)
                        You ready to be a free man? 

                                 WILL
                        Just give it to me!

                                 DWAYNE

           Will quickly keys in the numbers.  The timer freezes and the
           thick lock at the hinge opens.  Will carefully extricates
           himself from the vest.  He lays it down on the ground and
           steps away from it.  His shirt is drenched in sweat from
           where the bomb sat. 
           Will takes a final look at the money bag, then throws it to
           Dwayne.  He opens it and looks inside, smiles.  Jay takes a
           peak at the cash.

                                 DWAYNE
                        It's so fucking pretty, ain't it?

                                 JAY
                        It's awesome. 

           Dwayne looks up at Will. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Okay, you can get out of here now. 

                                 WILL
                        I actually have this sneaking
                        suspicion that once we turn around,
                        you're gonna put a bullet in both of
                        our backs - and this is just a guess -
                        burn our bodies. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        They say great minds think alike. 
                        And in this case, so do we.  

                                 WILL
                        I figured as much.  That's why I got
                        a gun pointed at you, too.  
                          (loudly)
                        I got a sniper in the bushes locked
                        on you right now. 

           Dwayne chuckles. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Do I look that dumb? 

                                 WILL
                        I can't tell, you're wearing a mask. 

           Before Dwayne can react, he stops and blinks, something
           shining in his eyes. 

                                 JAY
                        Hey, Dwayne...on your forehead. 

           Dwayne's eyes turn upward, just barely making out the red
           dot that dances on his forehead.

                                 DWAYNE
                        Son of a bitch.  Well played. 

           In the bushes, hidden from sight, we find Chet carefully
           aiming his laser pointer at Dwayne's forehead. 
           Will grins at Dwayne. 

                                 WILL
                        We're gonna walk out of here now. 
                        If you shoot, my sniper shoots.  I
                        can't guarantee he'll get both of
                        you.  But he'll definitely get you. 

           As Will turns away - 

                                 VAUGHN (O.S.)
                        Hold the fuck up.

           Vaughn emerges from the darkness.  He looks at Will,
           pleasantly surprised.

                                 VAUGHN
                        Wasn't expecting to see you here.

           Without warning, Vaughn cracks Will over the head with the
           butt of his gun.  He goes down hard.  Kate screams.  Vaughn
           points the gun at her and she shuts up. 

           Dwayne steps forward with the bag. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        It's all good.  We got your money. 

                                 VAUGHN
                        Nice mask, Dwayne.  Now throw the
                        money over here. 

           Dwayne complies.  As soon as the bag lands, Vaughn aims the
           gun at him.  

                                 DWAYNE
                        Hold up.  You don't have to do this. 
                        I just paid you.

           Kate looks on, terrified, an unconscious Will at her side. 

           Vaughn's eyes burn a hole through Dwayne.  

                                 VAUGHN
                        I've been hit with a pipe, shot with
                        a pen, and wasted my whole
                        motherfucking day...all because of
                        you and this job. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        I don't know what you're talking
                        about.  Just take the money. 

                                 VAUGHN
                        I will.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 VAUGHN (CONT'D)
                        And then I'm gonna tie up the two
                        loose ends in the gorilla masks.   

                                 DWAYNE
                        I'm not a loose end!

                                 VAUGHN
                        You're a fucking idiot.  You are as
                        loose as ends get.  

           Panicked, Dwayne's eyes flash over to Jay, who is tightening
           his grip on the flamethrower handle.  Jay catches Dwayne's
           eye.  Dwayne nods.  Vaughn sees this. 

                                 VAUGHN
                        What the - 

           Jay suddenly rears up with the flamethrower.  Vaughn couldn't
           be more surprised to see the device Jay is holding spit a
           massive ball of fire at him.  

           A 25-foot flame lights up the night in flickering shades of
           yellow and orange.  It completely engulfs Vaughn. 

                                 VAUGHN
                        Motherfuckers keep sneaking up on me!

           Vaughn fires off two wild shots, one of which - 

           Nails Dwayne in the shoulder, spinning him backward and
           knocking him off his feet. 

           Kate recoils in horror as Jay continues to torch Vaughn.  A
           hand touches her shoulder and she whirls around to find -   

                                 KATE
                        Chet!?  What are you doing here!?

                                 CHET
                        Not now.  We gotta get out of here. 
                          (looks around)
                        Where's Will?

           Kate looks to the empty spot beside her where Will just was.

           A burning Vaughn drops to his knees, fires off one last shot - 

           Which travels right through Jay and hits the fuel filled
           backpack.  Jay goes supernova. 

           Dwayne comes to just in time to see his friend being burned
           alive, running and flailing his arms, shrieking.  His last
           words are -
                                 JAY
                        Dwayne!  Help me!

           Then he drops to the ground.  A flaming corpse. 

           Will pops up behind Chet and Kate, holding the garbage bag.  

                                 WILL
                        I got the money.  Let's get the fuck
                        out of here. 

           They take off toward Will's car and hop in. 

           Dwayne sees the Mustang's lights come on.  It whips a U-turn
           and peels away as flames overtake the field.  Dwayne pulls
           off his mask, frantically looks around.  The money is gone. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        No!

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           The Mustang travels inconspicuously away from the rising
           flames. 

           INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING

           Will is panting, one hand loosely gripped around the steering
           wheel, his face a mess of dirt, sweat and dried blood.  Chet
           just stares ahead, completely shell-shocked.  

           Kate looks from one of the guys to the other, trying to get
           a grasp on the situation. 

                                 KATE
                        I just got kidnapped...

                                 WILL
                        I know.  I'm really sorry about that. 

                                 KATE
                        What the fuck happened since I saw
                        you this afternoon? 

                                 CHET
                        It's a very long story.  And it's
                        probably better if you don't know
                        most of it.  For your own protection. 

                                 WILL
                        Shut up, Chet.  
                          (looks back at Kate)
                        I had to rob a bank.  Your brother
                        helped me.  There's a hundred grand
                        in that trash bag by your feet.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILL (CONT'D)
                        You already met the guys who made us
                        do it.  Fortunately, they're dead.  

                                 KATE
                        What do we do now?  Go to the cops?

           Will and Chet exchange nervous glances. 

                                 WILL
                        That probably wouldn't work out so
                        well.  I say we split the money three
                        ways, then Chet and I get out of
                        town for a while and hope they never
                        connect us to this thing. 

                                 KATE
                        Oh, cool...I guess my credit card
                        debt is no longer an issue. 

           Something catches Will's attention: a set of headlights
           rapidly growing larger in the rear-view mirror.

           INT. MINIVAN - NIGHT - MOVING

           Dwayne's speedometer is buried past 100 mph as he flies down
           the highway.  His eyes burn with rage. 

           INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING

           Will hits the gas. 

                                 WILL
                        Oh, shit, it's him!

           Chet and Kate look out the back window.

                                 CHET
                        Hurry up!  He's already on us!  

                                 KATE
                        Isn't this supposed to be a fast car!? 

                                 WILL
                        He's going too fast already!

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Dwayne's car pulls even with the Mustang.  

           INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING

           Will can't push the gas any harder.  He looks over at Dwayne,
           who pulls out his gun and takes aim.  He flashes a sick grin -  
                                 DWAYNE
                        I own this town. 

           Before Dwayne can get a shot off -  

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           An explosion rocks the minivan from inside.  The back end is
           lifted off the ground and the car tumbles over itself.  It
           lands on its roof and skids into a ditch.  

           INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING

           Chet and Kate watch the burning wreck disappear out the back
           window.  They are equal parts confused and happy to be alive. 

                                 KATE
                        What the hell was that?   

           Will smiles. 

                                 WILL
                        That was the bomb I carried around
                        all day.  I reactivated it and put
                        it in the back of his van.  I guess
                        his time was up. 

                                 CHET
                        "His time was up?"  Were you thinking
                        that one up the whole time? 

                                 WILL
                        Maybe.

           Kate is trembling, smiling, trying to get a grip on all of
           this.  Will glances back at her.

                                 WILL
                        It's gonna be okay.

           She laughs at the absurdity of it all.

                                 KATE
                        So you guys really robbed a bank?

                                 WILL
                        After everything you've seen, that's
                        what you're skeptical of?  Yes, we
                        robbed a bank.  Chet was awesome. 
                        He was all like "anyone moves, and I
                        will kill you where you stand!"

                                 KATE
                        No, he wasn't. 
                                 CHET
                        I totally was.

           SUPER COUNTDOWN: 0 hours, 0 minutes...

                                                             CUT TO:

           EXT. DITCH - NIGHT

           Wind fans the flames of the burning minivan.  The shattered
           windshield suddenly sprouts another crack...then another, as -   

           Dwayne's foot finally kicks it out.  He drags himself from
           the smoldering steel carcass.  He is a charred, blood
           splattered mess, one leg badly broken.  But he is alive.  He
           struggles to his feet with grim determination.    

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Dwayne has somehow crawled or limped a ways down the road. 
           He is propped up against a sign, lingering on the edge of
           consciousness.  The headlights of a lone pickup truck
           approach.  Dwayne feebly waves the truck down for a ride. 

           INT. NICE HOUSE - DAY

           The door opens and Dwayne stumbles through.  He has made it
           home.  He suddenly drops like a puppet whose strings have
           been cut. 

           From where his head has landed on the floor, Dwayne sees
           something odd...long red streaks.  He crawls forward to
           investigate... 

           It is a trail of sticky red blood.  Dwayne follows it until
           he comes upon its source: the crumpled body of his father,
           lying face down.  Dwayne looks from the body to the cordless
           phone, sitting on a nearby counter, that The Major was
           dragging himself toward.  He never made it. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Dad?

           Dwayne inches closer, touches the body.  Nothing.  Dwayne's
           face: shock and confusion and joy.  He pokes the body again.

                                 DWAYNE
                        Dad, are you -

           The body emits a low groan.  Dwayne rolls it over.  His
           father's face is white, he's lost a lot of blood, but he
           isn't totally spent yet.  He struggles to speak - 

                                 MAJOR
                        Dwayne...
                                 DWAYNE
                        What happened to you?

                                 MAJOR
                        You tried...to have me killed.

                                 DWAYNE
                        Dad, I...I'd never...

                                 MAJOR
                        Shut the fuck up...don't stammer
                        like your mother...be a man. 

                                 DWAYNE
                          (with conviction)
                        I am a man. 

           The Major looks up at his son's bruised face. 

                                 MAJOR
                        I know you are...I think I
                        may...actually respect you now.

           Dwayne's eyes well up.  He moves closer to his father. 
           Cradles him in his arms as he expires.  It's like a very
           bloody, white trash version of the Pietà.  Dwayne sobs
           uncontrollably.  Now he's laughing.  Now he's crying again. 

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           A TV mounted above the bar plays the local nightly news.  We
           see footage of the burning radio tower and fire fighters
           battling the blaze, which has spread to much of the surrounding
           wooded area.  An ANCHOR reports -

                                 ANCHOR
                        Fire Fighters have contained a blaze,
                        which began tonight at a
                        decommissioned WSAW radio tower and
                        claimed the lives of two unidentified
                        men.  A car discovered at the scene
                        has led authorities to believe one
                        of the men may be Vaughn Dunn - 

           Vaughn's picture comes up on screen. 

                                 ANCHOR
                        - a Baltimore native wanted in
                        connection with an armed robbery
                        case.  

           The name has caught the attention of Juicy, who sits at a
           booth alone.  And now she realizes the person she is waiting
           for will not show.  As she stands and approaches the TV - 
                                 ANCHOR
                        A map uncovered in the car links
                        these men to today's robbery at the
                        Donner-Wells National Bank, in which
                        a local man was shot. 

           Juicy tunes out the rest of the news report.  Tears well in
           her eyes.  She bites her lip and takes a moment to compose
           herself, the money and her ticket out of town gone.  After a
           beat, she notices an older SHARPLY DRESSED MAN checking her
           out from across the bar.  She puts on her game face and heads
           over to introduce herself, heels click-clacking, working it
           with all she's got. 

                                                            FADE OUT:

           A CLEAR BLUE SKY

           SUPER TITLE: 3 Weeks Later

           "Welcome to Atlanta" by Jermaine Dupri and Ludacris kicks in
           as a plane flies overhead, then touches down on the tarmac.  

           EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL, ATLANTA INTL AIRPORT - DAY

           TRAVELERS haul luggage.  Taxis jockey for position at the
           curb.  A DRIVER tosses a duffel bag in his trunk and slams
           it.  He hops inside

           INT. TAXI - DAY

           The Driver looks back at his fare - 

           It's Will, only slightly different.  He is incredibly tan,
           in a cap and sunglasses.  He looks cool, like Danny Ocean. 
           Or like a guy trying to look like Danny Ocean.  

                                 DRIVER
                        Where to?

           Will looks down at a slip of paper. 

                                 WILL
                        Fourth and Grand. 

           As the cab pulls away - 

                                 DRIVER
                        What are you in town for?

                                 WILL
                        See a friend.  Might check out some
                        schools. 
                                 DRIVER
                        College?

           Will nods. 

                                 DRIVER
                        Never too late.  I went to Oglethorpe. 
                        Great school.  Made a lot of really
                        good connections.  

           Will mentally crosses this off his list.  They pull onto the
           highway and he looks out at the looming city.  

                                 WILL
                        Got any advice for a romantic evening? 

                                 DRIVER
                        Yeah.  Play with her nipples.  It's
                        an aphrodisiac.   

                                 WILL
                        I meant like a restaurant or
                        something.
                          (deciding)
                        Fuck it.  Is there a decent pizza
                        place on the way?

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           The front door opens.  Will stands in the hallway, duffel
           bag slung over his shoulder, pizza box in hand.  

                                 WILL
                        I thought it would be cute if I
                        brought pizza. 

           Kate is beaming, happy to see him.  She takes the pizza box
           and gives him a hug. 

                                 KATE
                        It's very cute.

           Will enters.  The apartment is full of half unpacked boxes. 

                                 KATE
                        How was Mexico?

                                 WILL
                        Not bad.  Chet stayed in the room
                        the whole time.  He was convinced
                        everybody was an undercover Federale. 
                        But it seems like if there was gonna
                        be any heat it's blown over by now. 
                        According to the news, they think
                        those other guys did it.  
                                 KATE
                        So, you're a free man?  

                                 WILL
                        Looks that way. 

           Will and Kate stand there.  A pregnant pause.  

                                 WILL
                        You know, we left right after
                        everything happened, and Chet wouldn't
                        let me use the phone while we were
                        down there...
                          (struggling)
                        I just want you to know that all that
                        stuff I said to you, I meant it.

                                 KATE
                        It wasn't just because you thought
                        you were gonna die?

                                 WILL
                        Well, the only reason I had the balls
                        to say it was because I thought I
                        was gonna die.  But it was all true.
                          (beat)
                        So, did you have a chance to, uh,
                        think about it...?

                                 KATE
                        Will, I've known you for so long
                        that I've thought about you in a
                        hundred different ways.  I mean, we
                        went through puberty together, of
                        course I've been attracted to you. 
                        It's just, before you said anything,
                        I thought we'd settle into a
                        friendship.  For better or worse.

                                 WILL
                        And after I said something...?

           Kate takes a step toward Will.

                                 KATE
                        You were going to die and you thought
                        of me.  You were gone for three weeks
                        and all I thought about was you.  I
                        think there's more than friendship
                        there.  

           Will closes the gap between them.  He stops.  His cell phone
           is vibrating.  He takes it out and checks a text message. 
           Hands it to Kate. 
                                 WILL
                        From Chet. 

                                 KATE
                          (reading the text)
                        "I just got a weird feeling.  Are
                        you making out with my sister?  I
                        think I do have ESP." 
                          (beat)
                        You don't really think...?

                                 WILL
                        Nah, he's sent me like six of those
                        so far.  He's just playing the numbers.

           Kate makes a move for Will.  She tosses the phone.  It lands
           on the couch.  We STAY on the phone.  A new text from Chet
           comes through: You're making out with her right now, aren't
           you?  I can tell.  This is gross.  Call me.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY

           A bare back, covered in healing bruises.  Between the shoulder
           blades is a brand new thug-style "In Memoriam" tattoo showing
           Jay's angelic face.  

           A shirt is pulled over the tattoo as Dwayne dresses in a
           good suit before a mirror.  

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Two headstones, side-by-side.  Husband and wife.  Jerry Cross
           and Elaine Cross. 

           Dwayne looks down at his parents' final resting place.  He
           holds flowers in one hand, the other rests on a fancy cane. 
           He looks like he has grown up quite a bit. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Seems like lately I'm surrounded by
                        so much death and destruction.  I
                        saw my best friend burned alive. 
                        Sometimes I hear his screams at night,
                        then I wake up and there's this
                        creaking all around the house, like
                        little footsteps.  I honestly think
                        Jay's haunting me, and I wish he
                        would stop.  Please put in a good
                        word for me.  Tell him I'm sorry for
                        the way shit went down.  I thought
                        the tattoo squared us.  Let him know
                        that he'll always be my road dog. 

           Dwayne starts choking up, does his best to reign it in. 
                                 DWAYNE
                        I look forward to seeing all of you
                        in the next life.  Right now, I want
                        to get on with this one, which I
                        expect will be filled with many
                        terrific and amazing things.  I only
                        ask that you look down on me from
                        time to time and make sure that none
                        of my enemies ever sneak up behind
                        me.  If they come at me dead on, I'm
                        pretty sure I can handle them myself.   

           Dwayne drops the flowers between the two graves.  He makes
           the sign of the cross, then turns and limps off with his cane.

           INT. LAW OFFICE - DAY

           Dwayne enters and crosses the office.  A LAWYER stands up
           from his desk and greets him.  Dwayne takes a seat. 

                                 LAWYER
                        We put all of the paperwork in order
                        while you were in the hospital. 
                        I'll try to make this as quick and
                        painless as possible.  

                                 DWAYNE
                        Thanks.  It sure has been an ordeal. 
                        Come home from a brutal car wreck,
                        just to find your father killed by a
                        home invader.  Bad luck is what it is. 

                                 LAWYER
                        Certainly. 

           The Lawyer opens a file and turns it toward Dwayne.  

                                 LAWYER
                        As you can see, you owe a little
                        over 500 from the funeral expenses. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        Go ahead and deduct that from the
                        inheritance.  Let's talk lump sums. 

                                 LAWYER
                        Mr. Cross...there is no inheritance.  

                                 DWAYNE
                        My father was a millionaire.  He won
                        the lotto.  Get your shit straight.

                                 LAWYER
                        Your father was a millionaire.  A
                        long time ago.  According to his
                        accountant, his spending had been
                        running unchecked for too many years. 
                        He died deep in credit card debt. 
           Dwayne tries to process this, mind racing.  The Lawyer
           struggles with the rest - 

                                 LAWYER
                        The reason I asked you to come down
                        here in person was to tell you that
                        we'll probably have to sell the house
                        to cover the debt.  I'm so sorry,
                        Mr. Cross.   

           Dwayne just stares at the Lawyer.

                                 DWAYNE
                        Are you fucking with me?

                                 LAWYER
                        I'm not, uh, messing around with -  

                                 DWAYNE
                        I said, are you fucking with me? 

                                 LAWYER
                        No.  I most certainly am not. 

           Dwayne nods, contemplative. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        He was a real sonofabitch, wasn't he?

                                 LAWYER
                        I never knew him. 

           Dwayne gets up and turns to leave. 

                                 LAWYER
                        Mr. Cross, I still need you to sign - 

           Dwayne whirls around and uses his cane to smash a wall of
           framed pictures, diplomas, etc.  His rage subsides, and he
           stands there, panting for a moment.  He glances back at the
           Lawyer, who is staring at him, terrified at the outburst. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        The fuck are you looking at?  Do you
                        even know who I am? 

           The Lawyer says nothing. 

                                 DWAYNE
                        I didn't think so. 

           Dwayne strides out and slams the door -

           BOOM!

                                   THE END
