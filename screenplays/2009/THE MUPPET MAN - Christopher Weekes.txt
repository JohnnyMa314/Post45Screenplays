           INT. DECREPIT HOTEL ROOM, MOO YORK - NIGHT

           KERMIT THE FROG, twenty years older than we’ve ever seen 
           him before, wakes from a DRUNKEN NIGHTMARE.

           He stares, blood shot, at a WHISKEY BOTTLE on his BEDSIDE - 
           a three day growth giving his felt chin a strongly 
           pronounced six o’clock shadow.

           He struggles out of BED - hobbling to his WINDOW.  
           Scratching his GREEN BUTT, KERMIT stares down into the 
           street.

           MOO YORK looks a lot like NEW YORK - a gritty, grimy metro-
           style hot pot of MUPPETS from all walks of LIFE - some 
           drunks, some homeless, some rich, some poor, some a mix and 
           match of everything.  

           A GIANT STATUE OF LIBERTY-BELL, a COW, hangs off from the 
           HAVOC RIVER.  Its BEACON, a milk bucket, pulses an orange 
           glow across the perpetually dirty city...

           ...mesmerizing KERMIT.

                                 KERMIT
                              (sad under breath)
                        Hi-ho.  Kermit the frog here.

           KERMIT stares at a WEDDING INVITE on his DRESSER.

           “...CORDIALLY INVITE YOU TO THE WEDDING OF MISS PIGGY AND 
           LINK HOGTHROB”.

           A photo of MISS PIGGY and LINK HOGTHROB atop a CARRIAGE IN 
           CENTRAL PARK beams back at him.

           KERMIT scrunches the INVITE up and POURS HIMSELF ANOTHER 
           DRINK.

           INT. BEDROOM, JIM HENSON’S NY HOME, 1990 - MORNING

           JIM HENSON, 53, a tall, lanky and gentle soul, slowly opens 
           his eyes - much like KERMIT in the scene above.

           He grabs an ASPIRIN from the BEDSIDE.

           JIM pulls himself from BED, dressed elegantly as ever in 
           his pin-striped pyjamas.  He glares out the WINDOW...

           ...at UPPER MANHATTAN.  There’s street after street of the 
           most expensive TOWN HOUSES the city can buy - no trash or 
           homeless in sight.

           JIM moves his attention to a PHOTO of his family on the 
           DRESSER, taken some years back - JANE HENSON and the kids - 
           BRIAN, LISA, CHERYL, JOHN and HEATHER - look back.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, JIM HENSON’S NY HOME, 1990 - MORNING

           JIM sits at an EMPTY WOODEN TABLE eating TOAST with ENGLISH 
           TEA.  He stares at the WALLS.

           A MUPPET SHOW PROMO is playing on TV - highlighting the 
           upcoming 20th ANNIVERSARY OF SESAME STREET.

           It’s the classic - “MAHNA MAHNA” SKETCH.

                                 MUPPETS
                              (in song)
                        Do do - do do da.  Do do do doo.

           We see the entire house is FILLED TO THE BRIM with HENSON 
           MEMORABILIA - from THE MUPPETS to SESAME STREET, to FRAGGLE 
           ROCK and the LABYRINTH.

           There’s a STAIN GLASS WINDOW by the DOOR that shows BERT 
           and ERNIE holding each other tightly...

           ...underneath is a STYLIZED JIM HENSON and FRANK OZ holding 
           them up with their arms.

           JIM mopes across the room - his lanky legs stretching out 
           like stilts.

           INT. BATHROOM, JIM HENSON’S NY HOME, 1990 - MORNING

           JIM stands under the SHOWER warming his KERMIT THE FROG 
           voice for a taping later today.

                                 JIM
                              (lightly under breath)
                        Mahna mahna.

           INT. BATHROOM, DECREPIT HOTEL, MOO YORK - MORNING

           KERMIT stands under the shower - hung over.  He leans 
           against the tiles, trying to ignore the CAKES OF SOAP 
           singing to him.

                                 BATH TILES
                        Do do da doo da.

                                 KERMIT
                              (annoyed)
                        Mahna mahna.

                                 BATH TILES
                        Do do da doo.

                                 KERMIT
                              (more annoyed)
                        Mahna mahna!

                                 BATH TILES
                        Do do - da doo da - da doo da - 
                        da doo da - da doo da - da doo da 
                        da da da da da da.

           INT. DECREPIT HOTEL, MOO YORK - MORNING

           KERMIT, wife beater singlet on, stares at his unshaven face 
           in a reflection.  Now a broken frog - he’s hardly a shadow 
           of his former self.

                                 KERMIT
                              (riffing on word)
                        Mahna ma na na da da.  Dee da da 
                        dum.

           INT. BEDROOM, JIM HENSON’S NY HOME, 1990 - MORNING

           JIM combs his hair, just out of the SHOWER.  He looks into 
           a mirror just like KERMIT.

                                 JIM
                              (still practicing)
                        Da da ahhh. (beat) Da dum.

           INT. DECREPIT HOTEL, MOO YORK - MORNING

           KERMIT throws back another WHISKEY.

                                 KERMIT
                        Mahna Mahna.

           A SWARM OF RATS in the corner of the HOTEL ROOM sing back.

                                 MOTHS
                        Do doo da doo da.

           KERMIT rips open his CLOSET - revealing a tired old moth 
           ridden TUX hanging on a WIRE HANGER.

           INT. YELLOW CRAB, STREETS, MOO YORK - MORNING

           A GIANT HOLLOWED OUT CRAB (of course shaped like a CAB) 
           drives KERMIT, now dressed smartly in his cheap tux, 
           through the booze ridden streets of MOO YORK.

                                 KERMIT
                        Mahna mahna.

           The CASH COWS (business men types) all sing back to him as 
           they scurry on their way to work.

                                 CASH COWS
                        Doo doo da doo.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           INT. CAB, NY, 1990 - MORNING

           JIM HENSON is being driven along the busy MANHATTAN streets 
           to his PRODUCTION OFFICE.  He’s still practicing voices.

                                 JIM
                        Mahna mahna.

           The CAB DRIVER can’t help himself - suddenly joining into 
           the familiar tune.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        Da do - da dar da - do dar da - 
                        do dar da - do dar dar dar dar 
                        da.

           JIM gets embarrassed.

                                 JIM
                        Oh... sorry.  I was just warming 
                        my voice.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        Buddy - I love that song!

           INT. CHURCH, MOO YORK - DAY

           KERMIT, quite worked up, pounds across the PAVEMENT, 
           grasping tightly to PIGGY’S SCRUNCHED WEDDING INVITATION.

                                 KERMIT
                              (almost schizophrenic)
                        Da do dar dar dum - do dar dar 
                        dum.  De dar da da dum do!

           Across the street, KERMIT stares at LARGE CONGREGATION OF 
           MUPPETS.  All the regulars are there - FOZZIE, GONZO, 
           SCOOTER, SWEETUMS, CRAZY HARRY & ANIMAL to name the obvious 
           (although suspiciously no ROWLF).

           They all look so much older than we’ve ever seen them 
           before.  FOZZIE, now grossly obese, gets around on a MOVING 
           CHAIR; GONZO has a LARGE HEARING TRUMPET; SCOOTER has 
           entered a full blown mid-life crisis wearing LEATHER with 
           piercings; and ANIMAL has gone BALD and GREY.

           KERMIT suddenly coughs and splutters something revolting up 
           onto the SIDEWALK.  

           The MUPPETS all turn, now finally noticing him.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                              (quiet and angry)
                        Mahna mahna.

           A GROUP OF CHICKENS DRESSED AS ALTAR BOYS pass KERMIT on 
           their way to the CHURCH. 

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 ALTAR CHICKENS
                        Do doo da doo do.

           KERMIT looks again at the INVITATION.  He glares at the 
           smug face on LINK HOGTHROB’S photo - his arm draped across 
           MISS PIGGY so casually.

                                 KERMIT
                        Mahna mahna.

           The MUPPETS can’t help themselves.  They just HAVE to join 
           in.

                                 MUPPETS
                        Do doo dar do do.

                                 KERMIT
                        Mahna mahna.

                                 MUPPETS
                        Da do - da dar da - do dar da - 
                        do dar da - do dar dar dar dar 
                        da.

           Suddenly - EVERYONE turns.  A STRETCH LIMO ARRIVES.  The 
           sound of a hundred monsters holding their breath...  

           ...as MISS PIGGY steps out in her WEDDING DRESS.

           KERMIT can’t stand seeing her... so beautiful.

                                 KERMIT
                              (heart broken)
                        Mahna mahna.

           A team of MUPPET SHAPED INSTRUMENTS race over to MISS 
           PIGGY, playing a big brass finish to the SONG.

           Long pause.

           FOZZIE squints - trying to make out this GRIZZLED GREEN 
           FROG standing across the road.

                                 FOZZIE
                        Kermit?  Are you alright?

           KERMIT thinks long and hard about how he’ll answer that.

           INT. MEETING ROOM, HENSON COMPANY, NEW YORK , 1990 - DAY

           JIM HENSON stares at a SKETCH in his NOTE PAD.

                                 FRANK (O.S)
                        Jim?

           He’s drawn KERMIT holding a bunch of roses forlornly.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 FRANK (O.S) (CONT’D)
                        Jim - you okay?

           JIM looks up and sees the HENSON COMPANY sitting around a 
           TABLE - all eyes glued to him.

           There’s JERRY JUHL, RICHARD HUNT, JERRY NELSON, CAROLL 
           SPINNEY, KEVIN CLASH, DAVE GOELZ, DAVID LAZER, “FAZ” 
           FAZAKAS, KATHY MULLEN, CAROLY WILCOX & STEVE WHITMIRE.

           FRANK OZ, 46, a bald man with glasses and a deep throaty 
           voice (in another life the voice of Miss Piggy and Fozzie 
           and also JIM’S closest friend), examines JIM from across 
           the divided table.

                                 JIM
                        What, ahhh, what part were we at?

                                 FRANK
                        We’re trying to get going on the 
                        redraft. 

                                 JIM
                        Redraft?

                                 FRANK
                        -- Muppet high.  You happy with 
                        it?  Because I’ve still got a few 
                        problems with the middle.

                                 JIM
                        Hmmm. (beat) Well, ahhh, you’re 
                        the best person to know Frank, I, 
                        ahhh, I’m not sure.

                                 FRANK
                        About what?

                                 JIM
                        About the middle part.

           The ENTIRE TABLE stares at him - everyone now concerned.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me a moment guys?  I think 
                        I need a lemon tea or something.  
                        Coming down with, ahhh, with 
                        something.

           JERRY JUHL, 52, a grey haired man who appears more mad 
           scientist than lead writer for the MUPPETS, smiles at JIM 
           from under his glasses.

                                 JERRY
                        Jim Henson everybody.  The only 
                        CEO in New York who would ask the 
                        little people if it’s okay for 
                        him to take a five minute break.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JIM
                        Now, you quiet Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        Anyone remember the last time Jim 
                        got sick?

           RICHARD HUNT, 39, a handsome, yorker-style man (who looks a 
           little like Billy Joel’s long lost brother), quickly jumps 
           in.

                                 RICHARD
                        I’ve never seen it.

                                 JERRY
                        Thirty years - not one day off.  
                        I’d be phoning this meeting from 
                        my bed if I had your money Jim.

                                 JIM
                        You got more money than me Jerry. 
                        (beat) Besides, someone’s gotta 
                        watch over the mad house.

           The ROOM laughs - the tension quelled.  JIM stands from the 
           table, towering over them all.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Don’t go ripping the walls off 
                        while I’m gone - okay?  Save that 
                        for when I get back.

           More laughter and familiarity.  It’s clearly a close knit 
           group. 

           INT. BATHROOM, HENSON COMPANY, NEW YORK, 1990 - DAY

           JIM steps into the MIRROR - poking his TONGUE OUT.  It’s 
           STRAWBERRY RED.

           He feels his throat, trying to ease the tickle.

           Suddenly behind in his REFLECTION... ELMO, the lovable red 
           monster from Sesame Street, waddles in.

                                 ELMO
                        Jim?  Are you okay?

           JIM turns, a little alarmed.  KEVIN CLASH, 30, is standing 
           where ELMO was.  KEVIN looks about half his age - his 
           infectious smile beaming out.

                                 KEVIN
                        Man... you’re off our planet 
                        today.

                                 JIM
                        There’s a little, ahhh, edge on 
                        my chords.  Never happened 
                        before.

           KEVIN, ever casual, starts washing his hands.

                                 KEVIN
                        You getting a cold?

                                 JIM
                        It’s all the back and forth to 
                        LA.  Air conditioning is no good 
                        for me.

                                 KEVIN
                        You worried about Arsenio?

                                 JIM
                        I’ll try salt gargle.

                                 KEVIN
                        Or pineapple juice.

                                 JIM
                        Pineapple juice... I haven’t 
                        tried that.

           INT. PRIVATE JET - DAY

           JIM HENSON reclines on a PLUSH LEATHER SEAT, a pile of 
           SCRIPTS and DESIGN DOODLES stacked high on his TRAY.

           He stares across at KEVIN CLASH... asleep.  A CLIFFORD 
           MUPPET rests on his lap.

           JIM pulls out his WALLET and stares at an old SEPIA 
           PHOTOGRAPH of his PATERNAL GRANDMOTHER, 57, - known simply 
           as “DEAR” - taken around 1940.  She’s standing next to a 
           young four year old boy in a safari suit...

           ...JAMES MAURY HENSON (Jim’s birth name).

           Suddenly, a MUPPET walks down the AISLE carrying a tray of 
           LEMONADE.  It’s an old grandmother figure, done in the 
           likeness of “DEAR”.

                                 MUPPET DEAR
                        James?  Are you thirsty dear?  
                        Want some lemonade?

           JIM HENSON stares at this MUPPET INCARNATION OF HIS 
           GRANDMOTHER... perplexed.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 MUPPET DEAR (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been staring at that 
                        contraption for far too long.  
                        You’ll get square eyes.

           Suddenly, looking behind JIM, we find ourselves in his 
           MEMORIES...

           INT. LIVING ROOM, HENSON HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1950 - EVENING

           JIM HENSON’S childhood home, circa 1950.

           A fourteen year old JIM is sitting inches away from an 
           early model BLACK AND WHITE TV - enthralled in “KUKLA, FRAN 
           and OLLIE”.

           He’s already a very tall, handsome young man.  He developed 
           young, and by turn, quite awkwardly.

           Dressed in braces with his hair pomaded back, YOUNG JIM 
           hardly blinks he’s so glued to this show.

           His maternal grandmother, “DEAR”, 60, holds out a tray of 
           LEMONADE, just like her MUPPET counterpart had.

                                 DEAR
                        You’ll get square eyes Jimmy.

                                 YOUNG JIM
                        You don’t get square eyes from 
                        watching tv Gran.

                                 DEAR
                        You don’t know that.

                                 YOUNG JIM
                        If I get it - everyone will get 
                        it.  The whole world watches tv 
                        now.

           DEAR chuckles at the wild imagination of her Grandson.

                                 DEAR
                        Oh Jimmy...

           She turns off the TV.

                                 DEAR (CONT’D)
                        This box sure aint gonna help you 
                        get anywhere in life. (beat) Go 
                        outside a while, huh?  For your 
                        grandma?

           DEAR waddles off to the kitchen.  Sneakily, YOUNG JIM waits 
           till the coast is clear...

           ...then turns “KULA, FRAN AND OLLIE” back on.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           We see on the vintage tv a crude “Punch and Judy” style 
           show; Hand puppets of KULA and OLLIE bang on a XYLOPHONE - 
           the manic energy between them hinting at the lunacy that 
           would become THE MUPPET SHOW in years to come.

           INT. KITCHEN TABLE, HENSON HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1950 - NIGHT

           YOUNG JIM sits at a lime green table cutting into the back 
           of a CEREAL BOX.  He smirks, excited about the mischief 
           he’s about to get up to. 

           He holds one of his CUTOUTS up to his eye.  We see JIM cut 
           out a PERFECT SQUARE.

           INT. HALLWAY, HENSON HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1950 - NIGHT

           It’s late.  The lights are off.  YOUNG JIM sneaks across 
           the hallway wearing goofy CARDBOARD CUTOUTS across his eyes 
           - shaped to resemble SQUARE EYES.  It’s crudely attached 
           with SCOTCH TAPE, but clearly inspired none the less.

           He chuckles to himself as he lumbers past the various DOORS 
           and CUPBOARDS in the house.  His lanky legs wobble like a 
           BABY GIRAFFE only just learning to walk.

           He creeks open a door.  Inside, PAUL HENSON JNR, 18, Jim’s 
           older brother, is studying at his DESK.  PAUL stares at the 
           CARDBOARD eyes rather unimpressed.

                                 PAUL JNR
                        James, what are you doing?  
                        You’ll wake everyone up.

                                 YOUNG JIM
                              (almost in stitches)
                        Square eyes Paul!!  Too much tv!!  
                        Aaargh!!

           PAUL JNR gives a little chuckle.

                                 PAUL JNR
                        You’re such a spazz.  Come here.

           YOUNG JIM walks over.  PAUL JNR takes off his GLASSES.  He 
           starts to color in the SCOTCH TAPE with a MARKER.

                                 PAUL JNR (CONT’D)
                        You’ve gotta hide the tape or no 
                        one will buy it. (beat) Such a 
                        dork.  When you gonna start 
                        acting your age huh?

                                 YOUNG JIM
                        A magician never reveals his 
                        secret.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           INT. PARENT’S ROOM, HENSON HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1950 - NIGHT

           PAUL JNR and YOUNG JIM creep into the icy room, full of 
           childish glee.  They’re BOTH wearing SQUARE EYES now.  

           Their mother, BETTY HENSON, 36, is reading a self help book 
           in bed.  Lying next to her is their father, PAUL HENSON 
           SNR, 40.  He’s fallen asleep above the covers - still 
           dressed in his suit from work.

                                 YOUNG JIM
                        Pssst.  Mom.  Too much tv!

           YOUNG JIM and PAUL JNR crack themselves up.

                                 BETTY
                        Both of you stop it.  You’ll wake 
                        your father.

                                 PAUL JNR
                        Square eyes - you get it?

           BETTY finally chuckles.  She couldn’t hide it forever.

                                 BETTY
                              (through chortles)
                        You’re both as bad as each other.  
                        Now go back to bed.

           YOUNG JIM and PAUL JNR shuffle out of the room.

           INT. GRANDMA’S ROOM, HENSON HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1950 - NIGHT

           JIM and PAUL JNR bumble into their GRANDMOTHERS ROOM 
           wearing handmade SQUARE EYES still.

           DEAR is lying in bed, unsuccessfully trying to sleep.

                                 YOUNG JIM
                        Grandma.  Look! You were right... 
                        (balls into laughter) Too much 
                        tv!

           DEAR clicks on her BEDSIDE LAMP and sees the TWO BOYS.  She 
           bursts out laughing.

                                 DEAR
                        Would you look at that... Square 
                        eyes.

           Suddenly PAUL SNR screams down the hall.

                                 PAUL SNR (O.S)
                        HEY!  I’M TRYING TO SLEEP HERE!

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 DEAR
                              (hushed)
                        It would appear we’ve awoken the 
                        dragon.

                                 YOUNG JIM
                        Uh-oh.

                                 PAUL SNR (O.S)
                        AND WELCOME TO LOS ANGELES!

           YOUNG JIM stares at DEAR confused - “What did he say?”

                                 PAUL SNR (O.S) (CONT’D)
                        PLEASE TAKE CARE DISEMBARKING 
                        FROM THE JET!

           INT. PRIVATE JET, LA AIRPORT, 1990 - DAY

           JIM HENSON has dozed off in his SEAT.  The CLIFFORD MUPPET 
           (a Jamaican musician recently added to the MUPPET SHOW) is 
           thrust into JIM’S face by KEVIN CLASH.

                                 CLIFFORD
                        Yo man!  We’s arrived is Los 
                        Angeleees.

           JIM wakes in fright.  KEVIN smiles at him.

                                 KEVIN
                        I can not believe you slept 
                        through that landing.  HO!

           INT. FLOOR, ARSENIO HALL SHOW, LA, 1990 - DAY

           ARSENIO HALL, 27, dressed in a classic 90’s purple padded 
           suit, grins down the lens.  We’re at a taping of his show.

                                 ARSENIO
                        Yes... starting with a piece of 
                        green cloth and a couple of ping 
                        pong balls, my next guest created 
                        a dynasty that includes Sesame 
                        Street, Fraggle Rock and my all 
                        time favorite - The Muppets.  
                        Please help me welcome... Jim 
                        Henson.

           JIM HENSON, checkered sweater on, strides onto stage rather 
           nervously.  ARSENIO helps guide him down to the couches.

                                 ARSENIO (CONT’D)
                        Oh what... I hear you’ve got a 
                        party going on?  20 years of 
                        Sesame Street.  Is that true?

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JIM
                        Well.  Something like that.  Ya.

                                 ARSENIO
                        Twenty years!  I can’t believe 
                        that.  It’s been going that long?

                                 JIM
                        (trying to laugh) Oh well it’s 
                        hard for us to believe too.  
                        We’ve been all over the world 
                        recently, with Big Bird and Elmo, 
                        doing some filming... sort of 
                        having our brand of fun for a 
                        special we made... that airs on 
                        Sunday.

                                 ARSENIO
                        Oh so that’s the clip we have?  
                        Let’s see that.

                                 JIM
                              (fumbling over himself)
                        Oh.  Yep.

                                                         CUT TO TAPE :

           We see ERNIE from SESAME STREET in the BATH.  He’s covered 
           in suds, holding a RUBBER DUCK up in the air for us to see.

                                 ERNIE
                              (sings)
                        Rubber duckie, you’re the one / 
                        You make bath time lots of fun / 
                        Rubber duckie I’m awfully fond of 
                        you.

           INT. FLOOR, ARSENIO HALL SHOW, LA, 1990 - DAY

           ARSENIO is watching the RUBBER DUCKIE clip on a monitor.  
           JIM HENSON lifts the KERMIT PUPPET onto his arm and 
           prepares for the second half of his interview.

           ARSENIO smiles, talking under his breath so the audience 
           isn’t interrupted.

                                 ARSENIO
                              (hushed)
                        I grew up with this stuff you 
                        know.  I used to sing Rubber 
                        Ducky to my mom.

                                 JIM
                        Oh.  That’s wonderful.

           The CLIP finishes and ARSENIO springs straight back into 
           INTERVIEW mode.  The AUDIENCE claps enthusiastically.

           KERMIT (operated by JIM) starts nodding in appreciation.

                                 ARSENIO
                        We’ve been joined by Kermit the 
                        Frog.

                                 KERMIT
                        How are ya?  Great to see you 
                        Arsenio.

                                 ARSENIO
                        Good to have you back.  Did you 
                        meet Connie backstage?

                                 KERMIT
                        Ahhh, well no I didn’t.  I 
                        didn’t.  No, I don’t know what 
                        happened.  Well you know what? 
                        (voice straining) They keep me in 
                        a bag. (lower than normal 
                        sounding) That’s the truth.  
                        That’s the truth.  They keep me 
                        in a bag, they don’t let me out.  
                        You know.

           The AUDIENCE, a little thrown by the odd sounding Kermit, 
           forces JIM to break his performance.

                                 JIM
                        Excuse me.  Frog in the throat

           JIM sips a glass of WATER.  The AUDIENCE lets out a little 
           chuckle.

           INT. BACKSTAGE, ARSENIO HALL SHOW, LA, 1990 - DAY

           KEVIN CLASH, his CLIFFORD MUPPET ready to go, watches JIM’S 
           interview from the WINGS.

           He turns to a PRODUCTION MANAGER - concerned.

                                 KEVIN
                        You got pineapple juice around?

           INT. FLOOR, ARSENIO HALL SHOW, LA, 1990 - DAY

           JIM is clearly nervous - but he continues with the 
           interview anyway.  ARSENIO tries to cover.

                                 ARSENIO
                        How’s that itchy throat going 
                        there Kermit?  You better now?

           Ever the professional, JIM launches back into character.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 KERMIT
                        Much better, yes, ahhh, thank you 
                        Arsenio.  I ate a few bad flies 
                        for lunch.  I think, you know, 
                        maybe Piggy hit me a few too many 
                        times in the, ahhh, the old 
                        froggy mouth, you know.

           The AUDIENCE laughs.  Everyone is relaxing again.

                                 ARSENIO
                        It’s interesting you say that, 
                        because you have a totally 
                        different tone than you had the 
                        last time you were on here.  And 
                        I’ve heard there’s been problems 
                        between you and Miss Piggy?  Is 
                        that true?

                                 KERMIT
                        Ahhhh... you know...

           Suddenly MISS PIGGY bounds out from the AUDIENCE heading 
           straight for KERMIT.  She’s dressed like SANDRA DEE - 
           covered in cashmere and silk scarves.

                                 MISS PIGGY
                        Ah hum.  Excuse me.  You taking 
                        any notes on this?

                                 KERMIT
                        Am I...

                                 MISS PIGGY
                        Did you... take... notes?

           JIM suddenly drops KERMIT from his arm - perplexed at what 
           is happening.

                                 JIM
                        I, ahhhh, I don’t understand what 
                        you’re asking me...

           INT. PUPPET CLASS, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, 1954 - DAY

           We’ve entered some kind of memory again.  Jim’s youth.  
           College in the Fall - 1954.

           TEEN JIM, now 18, sits very attentively at the back of the 
           class with his books.  Tall and skinny, his giant features 
           have outgrown his head.  He protrudes from the desk.

           An attractive, yet goofy young woman, JANE NEBEL, 20, leans 
           across to him.  She whispers very politely so PROFESSOR 
           JAMES, their puppet teacher, can’t hear.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 TEEN JANE
                        Notes?  Pen and paper.  I’ve got 
                        no idea what this guy is on 
                        about.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        Who?

           TEEN JANE smiles.  JIM’S naivety is pure gold.

                                 TEEN JANE
                        That strange guy in a Brown Suit 
                        talking slow down the front. 
                        (beat) Did you take notes?

           JIM looks.  She means PROFESSOR JAMES.  He gives a polite 
           giggle.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        Ohhhh.  I see.  Ah!  (beat) I 
                        don’t have any notes.

                                 TEEN JANE
                        This guy could put coffee to 
                        sleep couldn’t he?

           They both crack up.  The PROFESSOR peers over from his TWO 
           WOODEN PUPPETS - not impressed.

                                 PROFESSOR JAMES
                        Am I disturbing you at the back 
                        there?

                                 TEEN JANE
                        No.  Nope.  Sorry.

                                 PROFESSOR JAMES
                        Are you sure?

                                 TEEN JANE
                        Actually...

           TEEN JANE stands up and holds her HOME MADE PUPPET in the 
           AIR.  She pretends to talk through it.

                                 JANE’S PUPPET
                        ... could you please slow down a 
                        little?  I’m having... trouble... 
                        understanding... you.

           PROFESSOR JAMES, trying to remain professional, replies 
           quite calmly with his own WOODEN PUPPET.

                                 PROFESSOR JAMES
                        I’ll try.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, HENSON HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1954 - NIGHT

           TEEN JIM sits watching “LIFE WITH SNARKY PARKER” on the 
           family television.

           PAUL SNR, smokes a PIPE on the SOFA.  He’s reading the 
           paper, trying to ignore the TV... the very model of a 50’s 
           nuclear patriarch.

           He puts his WASHINGTON POST down - ready to make a fresh 
           declaration.

                                 PAUL SNR
                        Jim, I think it’s time you got 
                        yourself a nice girl like Paul 
                        has.  You’re at college now... 
                        (beat) You should be out there - 
                        living a little.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        A... ahhhh... a girl?

           PAUL goes back to the PAPER, his declaration completed.

                                 PAUL SNR
                        Steve from the office has a 
                        daughter your age, whose looking 
                        for a nice boy. (beat) I told him 
                        you’d take her out next Saturday.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        I don’t... I don’t need you to do 
                        that.

                                 PAUL SNR
                        I think I do Jim.

           INT. QUADRANGLE, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, 1954 - DAY

           TEEN JIM stands by a COFFEE HOUSE, looking out across the 
           QUADRANGLE.  Various 50’s style COLLEGE STUDENTS eat their 
           lunch.

           They all have a distinctive “boho” style to them - quite a 
           marked difference from the starched atmosphere of his 
           neighbourhood back home.

           JIM is taken by JANE NEBEL, the young woman from his class.  
           Dressed in black with a beret, she’s sketching something in 
           under a tree.

           Nervously, JIM marches over towards her.  He gulps like 
           KERMIT.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        It’s, ahhh, it’s a lovely day 
                        today, isn’t it?

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 TEEN JANE
                        Oh... hey.  Sorry.  I was a 
                        million miles away.  What were 
                        you saying?

                                 TEEN JIM
                        Oh, you know... yeah.

           JIM goes to walk away.  Thinking better of it... he bravely 
           marches straight back to JANE.

                                 JIM
                              (suddenly courageous)
                        Hey - what are you doing this 
                        weekend?

           Suddenly CHARLIE MASTERSON, 22, a fellow STUDENT, also 
           dressed in black with a beret, walks over to them.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey baby.

           TEEN JANE smiles at him.  They quickly kiss hello.

                                 TEEN JANE
                        Oh hey sweetie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Who’s the guy?

                                 TEEN JANE
                        You know what, I don’t actually 
                        know.  We’re in James’ puppetry 
                        101 together but I never caught 
                        his name. (to JIM) I feel 
                          terrible.

                                 JIM
                        It’s ahhh Jim.  Jim Henson.

                                 TEEN JANE
                        Hello there Jim.  I’m Jane. 
                        (beat) And this is my fiance 
                        Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey there Jim.  How’s it goin’ 
                        yeah?

           They shake hands.

                                 TEEN JANE
                        Jim... what were you saying 
                        before?

                                 JIM
                        Oh, nothing, I just, ahhh, I like 
                        your drawing. 
                                 (MORE)

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JIM (CONT'D)
                        (beat) I’ve gotta get going to 
                        class you know, so I’ll, ahhhh, 
                        I’ll see you around?

                                 TEEN JANE
                        Like an orange.

           JIM tries to laugh, but his nerves have gotten the better 
           of him.

                                 JIM
                        Nice meeting you Chuck.

           JIM bounds across the QUADRANGLE - quick as he can.

           INT. FRONT DOOR, HENSON HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1954 - NIGHT

           The doorbell rings.  BETTY HENSON walks over and opens the 
           FRONT DOOR, revealing JENNY SUMMERS, 18, a peachy blonde 
           girl from Jim’s high school.

                                 JENNY
                        Hello Mrs Henson.  I’m here for 
                        Jim.

                                 BETTY
                        Of course dear.  Come on in. 
                        (beat) JIM?!?

           INT. JIM’S ROOM, HENSON HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1954 - NIGHT

           TEEN JIM sits on the end of his bed - his head in his 
           hands.  He really doesn’t want to do this.

                                 BETTY (O.S)
                        JIM!?!  JENNY IS HERE!

           INT. DINING ROOM, HENSON HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1954 - NIGHT

           A family dinner.  BETTY carves a ROAST CHICKEN as PAUL SNR 
           and PAUL JNR look over a TAX FORM at the table.  His other 
           FOUR BROTHERS and SISTERS are scattered around the table.  
           They’re all dressed quite formally...

           ...quite oppositional to TEEN JIM, in checkered shirt and 
           jeans.  He sits with a nervous JENNY SUMMERS.

                                 BETTY
                        So where are you kids going to go 
                        tonight?

                                 TEEN JIM
                        Oh... ahhh... was thinking about 
                        maybe catching the new horror 
                        flick down on Woodmont avenue.

                        What film?

                                 JENNY
                              (disdainfully)
                        Creature from the Black Lagoon.

                                 PAUL SNR
                        You’re not into that nonsense too 
                        are you Jenny?

                                 JENNY
                        I was hoping to see “Seven brides 
                        for seven brothers” actually, 
                        since you asked.

                                 PAUL JNR
                        Oh really?

           The HENSON kids give a little mocking laugh.

                                 PAUL JNR (CONT’D)
                        Don’t have six sisters do you?

                                 TEEN JIM
                        Shut up Paul.

                                 BETTY
                        Manners... the both of you.  We 
                        have a guest.

                                 PAUL SNR
                        Jim, I don’t understand your 
                        obsession with these childish 
                        movies.  Don’t drag a poor girl 
                        to a film she doesn’t want to 
                        see.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        I like those sorts of movies.  
                        There’s an art to it.

                                 PAUL SNR
                        You shown her the rat?  Where’s 
                        the art in your rat?

           PAUL JNR’S face grows with GLEE.

                                 PAUL SNR (CONT’D)
                        Go get the rat out Paul.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, HENSON HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1954 - NIGHT

           The HENSON family sit around the fireplace watching TEEN 
           JIM and PAUL JNR perform with home-made wooden puppets.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           JIM operates an arrogant rodent named - PIERRE THE FRENCH 
           RAT - and PAUL is performing a wimpy cowboy called 
           SHORTHORN.

           JENNY watches - quite confused.

                                 PIERRE
                        Good eve-z-ning to you all.  My 
                        name iz Pierre ze French rat.  Or 
                        as I zay in my country - le ratty 
                        fracois!

                                 SHORTHORN
                        And I am thar famous-est cowboy 
                        in thar west - Shorthorn McDraw!

           The FAMILY laughs.  Even JENNY cracks a smile.  TEEN JIM 
           presses PLAY on the record player.

           A 50’s version of “Freres Jacque” starts to play.  PIERRE 
           THE FRENCH RAT and SHORTHORN dance and mouth along to it.

           The HENSON’S find themselves in stitches.

           INT. JIM’S CAR, WASHINGTON, 1954 - NIGHT

           TEEN JIM drives JENNY along the tranquil streets of 1950’s 
           Washington.

                                 JENNY
                        So Jimmy... you like puppets?

                                 TEEN JIM
                        Oh... I guess so.

                                 JENNY
                        I’ve never met someone who liked 
                        puppets before.

           JIM just looks at her - disappointed.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        Me too.

           INT. WOODMONT CINEMA, WASHINGTON, 1954 - NIGHT

           TEEN JIM and JENNY sit amongst the other rambunctious 50’s 
           TEENAGERS in a packed CINEMA.  “CREATURE FROM THE BLACK 
           LAGOON” plays on screen.

           JENNY looks bored.  Extremely bored.  She’s the “preppiest” 
           girl for miles.  She drapes her pink sweater around her 
           shoulders, making her stand out all the more.

           A piece of POPCORN flies into her hair. 

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JENNY
                        Jim.  Can we go?

                                 JIM
                        You, ahhh, you don’t want to see 
                        the monster?

                                 JENNY
                        The noise is so loud in here!  I 
                        can’t hear the film over all the 
                        screaming... and I don’t, I don’t 
                        like these sorts of movies Jim.  
                        I was too shy to tell you.

           We see what JIM’S actually been looking at.  A few rows in 
           front of him, JANE NEBEL is sitting with her fiance CHARLIE 
           - both cuddled together.

                                 JIM
                        It wont be long now.

                                 JENNY
                        Please Jim...

           JIM stumbles over himself.

                                 JIM
                        You know what will really get ‘em 
                        going?

           JIM sticks his LONG ARM into the air, hitting the PROJECTOR 
           BEAM.  ON SCREEN, the LAGOON MONSTER appears... Along with 
           the silhouette of a ARM reaching up...

           ...and picking the CREATURE’S NOSE.

           The CINEMA erupts into laughter.

                                 JENNY
                              (shocked)
                        Oh, my god.

           JANE and CHARLIE turn around and see JIM.

                                 JANE
                        Jim? (beat) What are you doing 
                        here?

                                 JIM
                              (hiding it badly)
                        Jane?  Ohhhh... hi!

           EXT. BOARDWALK, MARYLAND, WASHINGTON, 1954 - NIGHT

           TEEN JIM and JANE walk together, with CHARLIE and JENNY 
           trailing along behind them.  A CARNIVAL twinkles manically 
           in the background.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           JANE and JENNY lick ICE CREAM CONES while JIM nurses a 
           bright pink packet of FAIRY FLOSS.  

           CHARLIE cracks open his third BEER.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        I heard the guy who played the 
                        creature had to hold his breath 
                        for four minutes to stop bubbles 
                        coming out!

                                 TEEN JANE
                        Why?

                                 TEEN JIM
                        ‘Cause a sea monster is meant to 
                        breath through gills, you see?  
                        If you saw bubbles, you might 
                        know it was a guy in a suit.

                                 TEEN JANE
                        Gee, that’s clever.

                                 JENNY
                        Jimmy?  What was that?

           TEEN JIM turns to JENNY - not interested in including her 
           in this exclusive “puppet” conversation.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        I was just, ahhh, talking about 
                        some college stuff.

           JENNY turns to CHARLIE a little flustered.

                                 JENNY
                        Jimmy’s into puppets.

                                 CHARLIE
                              (cluing in)
                        Uh-huh.  So’s Jane.

           INT. JIM’S CAR, JENNY’S YARD, WASHINGTON, 1954 - NIGHT

           JIM’S CAR pulls up outside a WHITE PICKET FENCE.  It’s 
           JENNY’S parents house.

           They’ve been sitting in silence virtually the entire trip.

           JIM turns the engine off and waits...

           ...JENNY is reduced to tears.

                                 JENNY
                        Do you... do you hate me Jimmy?

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 TEEN JIM
                        No.  Of course not.

                                 JENNY
                        I get the feeling...

                                 TEEN JIM
                        I don’t... you’re wrong about 
                        that. (beat) Please don’t cry.  
                        Please.

                                 JENNY
                        You haven’t even asked me what I 
                        do nowadays.  I feel like I know 
                        everything about you and you 
                        don’t even care to know anything 
                        about me.

           JIM hands her a handkerchief.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        So... what do you do?

                                 JENNY
                        I’m studying nursing.

           They look at each other.  This conversation isn’t going to 
           go anywhere.  JENNY wipes her eyes.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Well, good night Jim.  Thank you 
                        for the movie.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        Goodnight.

           INT. HALLWAY, HENSON HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1954 - NIGHT

           TEEN JIM mopes in the door - sneaking up the hallway.

           As he passes PAUL JNR’S room, he catches his brother 
           playing with PIERRE THE FRENCH RAT at his desk.  PAUL JNR 
           is trying to attach a silly WIG to it’s head.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        Hey!  What are you doing to my 
                        rat?!?

                                 PAUL JNR
                        Dad got a call from some guy at 
                        WRC-TV.  Someone saw that 
                        afternoon show we did work 
                        experience with last year.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        They did?

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 PAUL JNR
                        They want to see us tomorrow - 
                        see what we can come up with.

           TEEN JIM stares at him blankly.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        What can we come up with Jimmy?

           INT. RUMSEN OFFICE, WRC-TV, WASHINGTON, 1954 - DAY

           TEEN JIM HENSON and PAUL JNR sit in the very posh office of 
           MAX RUMSEN, 45, head programmer for WRC-TV in Washington. A 
           bald man with thick black glasses, he takes his television 
           very seriously.

           MAX stares at his watch - impatient already.

                                 MAX
                        Alright kids.  You’ve got two 
                        minutes.  Show me what you’ve 
                        got.

           JIM, nervous, signals for PAUL JNR to start.  He puts 
           PIERRE THE FRENCH RAT on his hand.

           PAUL, following Jim’s lead, puts LONGHORN on.

                                 JIM
                        This is, ahhhh, this is an idea 
                        we had for a little scene.  Maybe 
                        it’s funny, you know... maybe 
                        it’s not.

                                 MAX
                              (smarmy)
                        You’ve got my attention so far 
                        howdy.  Next word might blow it 
                        though.

           No need to hear it twice, JIM turns on the RECORD PLAYER.  
           The “BANANA BOAT SONG” by STAN FREBERG starts to play.

           JIM and PAUL JNR suddenly spring into a performance.  
           PIERRE THE RAT races up towards MAX RUMSEN’S desk - 
           mouthing the song as if they were singing.

                                 PIERRE
                              (mouthing song)
                        DAY-0! Daaaayyyy-O! / Daylight 
                        come and me wan go home. (beat) 
                        Day, he say...

           Suddenly LONGHORN bounces up towards PIERRE, very grumpy.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 LONGHORN
                              (still mouthing song)
                        Wow man... I’m gonna have to ask 
                        you not to shout like that.

                                 PIERRE
                        Well --

                                 LONGHORN
                        It’s like right in my ear man.

                                 PIERRE
                        It goes with the song.

                                 LONGHORN
                        Yeah, but don’t holler in my ear, 
                        man.

                                 PIERRE
                        Well, it’s authentic Calypso.

                                 LONGHORN
                        Yeah, but don’t stand next to me 
                        man.

                                 PIERRE
                        Well the shout go with the bongo 
                        drum.

                                 LONGHORN
                        Not my bongo drums man, I mean, 
                        move away there.

                                 PIERRE
                        Well, I don’t see why --

                                 LONGHORN
                        -- No, no, no.  Stand over next 
                        to the guitar man.

           PIERRE points to MAX.

                                 PIERRE
                        He sent me over here.

                                 LONGHORN
                        Yeah, well, then sing soft man.  
                        You know, I mean like - wow.

                                 PIERRE
                        Okay. (beat) DAY....

                                 LONGHORN
                        It’s TOO loud man!

                                 PIERRE
                              (softer)
                        Day... --

                                 LONGHORN
                        -- That’s better. --

                                 PIERRE
                        -- Me say day, me say day, me say 
                        day, me say day, me say day-o / 
                        Daylight come and we wan go home.

                                 LONGHORN
                        Yeah man.

           PAUL JNR quickly turns off the RECORD PLAYER.  JIM and his 
           brother quickly scurry back to their chairs - nervous.  

           MAX doesn’t give away a thing.

                                 JIM
                        Maybe, ahhhh, maybe it’s not that 
                        funny.

                                 MAX
                        How much do you know about tv 
                        kid?

                                 JIM
                        Ahhhh... not much sir.

                                 MAX
                        Good.  That’s the way I like 
                        ‘em... Unspoilt.

           EXT. QUADRANGLE, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, 1954 - DAY

           TEEN JANE is doing doodling away in her NOTEBOOK under the 
           tree again...

           ...when PIERRE THE FRENCH RAT suddenly pokes his head out 
           from behind the trunk.

                                 PIERRE
                        Excuse-moi Madame.  I wonder... 
                        what are you up to this 
                        afternoon?

           She attempts a serious face.

                                 TEEN JANE
                        Well... I’m really not sure.  Why 
                        would you ask Mr Rat?

                                 PIERRE
                        Ah-ha!  Well, I’m filming a new 
                        show today - for a tv station if 
                        you believe that - and one of my 
                        puppeteering friends dropped out 
                        at ze last moment!

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 TEEN JANE
                        Is that right?

                                 PIERRE
                        Zat is right! And... I have heard 
                        it said you were quite handy wiz 
                        your hand up ze backsides.  No?

                                 TEEN JANE
                        No.

           TEEN JIM, a cheeky smile across his face, peers out from 
           behind the tree.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        You free for a couple of hours 
                        today?

           INT. SOUND STAGE, WRC-TV, WASHINGTON, 1954 - DAY

           We’re on the set for Jim’s first day of shooting “SAM AND 
           FRIENDS”.  We see a MOCK UP POSTER DESIGN for the show.  It 
           sits on an EASEL with the note : “CREW - THIS WAY”.

           TEEN JIM, dressed yet again in a checkered shirt, waddles 
           across stage to the STUDIO FLOOR. 

           He passes the WRC-TV CREW as he goes.  They’re all a good 
           three decades older than him.

           Arriving on the set - literally a STUDIO CAMERA pointed at 
           a CARD BOARD BACKDROP - JIM finds JANE and PAUL JNR waiting 
           for him.  They’re practicing with some of their early 
           MUPPET creations.

                                 TEEN JANE
                              (under breath)
                        What is all this Jim?

                                 TEEN JIM
                        It’s television.

           The CREW, some still smoking, some in the middle of their 
           coffee, stare at these three strange kids.

           MAX RUMSEN comes barging onto the FLOOR.

                                 MAX
                        Right-o everyone.  Smokes down, 
                        heads up.  We’ve some young kids 
                        here, the Hensons, going to put 
                        some skits to tape. (beat) Not 
                        sure where we’re slotting this 
                        one yet, but most important thing 
                        --

                                 TEEN JIM
                        -- Have fun. --

                                 MAX
                        -- stay on time.

                                 PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
                        Is this a kids show?

                                 MAX
                        Jim?

                                 TEEN JIM
                        I, ahhh, I’m not sure.

                                 PAUL JNR
                        No.

           TEEN JIM starts holding up some of the MUPPET cast of “SAM 
           AND FRIENDS”.  He starts with SAM - a prize-fighter with 
           the protruding ears of Clark Gable.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        We’ve got the star of the show - 
                        Sam.  And some of his friends...

           PAUL JNR holds up a VINTAGE PROFESSOR KERMIT, off color and 
           missing his frill neck and webbed feet, it none the less 
           looks like the KERMIT generations would come to love.

                                 TEEN JIM (CONT’D)
                        Professor Kermit, Mushmellow, 
                        Yorick, Henrietta... --

                                 PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
                        -- What are they?  What the hell 
                        is a mush-mellow?

                                 TEEN JIM
                        They’re, ahhh, Muppets.

                                 PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
                        For kids?

                                 TEEN JIM
                        Well... puppet sounds like it’s 
                          for kids.  Muppets are for 
                          everyone.  Hence the name.

                                    MAX
                              (nervously laughing)
                          Ya.  You’re gonna love this one.  
                          Jimmy’s a bit jittery - but get 
                          him talking “puppet” and suddenly 
                          the big goof ball comes alive.

                MAX winks at JIM.  PAUL and JANE try not to laugh.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        The room is yours.  Don’t treat 
                        ‘em too mean - huh?  Or I’ll hear 
                        about it.

                                 JIM
                        No.  Of course.  I’m not like 
                        that.

           MAX slaps his hands and heads on out.

                                 MAX
                        Sam and Friends.  Day one.  Do 
                        good kiddies.

           JIM looks to JANE and PAUL JNR.  It’s up to them now.

                                 JIM
                        Ahhhh... I guess we’ll, ahhh, 
                        we’ll try something straight up 
                        okay?

                                                                LATER.

           JIM and JANE are putting one of their skits down to camera.

           SAM and a WIGGED OUT PROFESSOR KERMIT mouth “THAT OLD BLACK 
           MAGIC” by LOUIS PRIMA & KEELY SMITH.

           PAUL JNR stands to the side - watching proudly.  He taps 
           his feet along to the song.

           This starts a montage that will take us through Jim’s early 
           months of success with “SAM AND FRIENDS” in the mid-50’s.

           These two MUPPETS bounce around the FRAME with a manic 
           energy.

                                 SAM
                        Old black magic has me in it’s 
                        spell.

                                 KERMIT
                        Old black magic that you weave so 
                        well.

                                 SAM
                        Those icy fingers up and down my 
                        spine.

                                 KERMIT
                        The same old witchcraft when your 
                        eyes meet mine.

           The CREW suddenly take notice of the YOUNG PERFORMERS.  
           They realize straight away something is happening here.

           INT. SOUND STAGE, WRC-TV, WASHINGTON, 1954 - DAY

           Another day on set.  Well into the run of “SAM AND 
           FRIENDS”.  “THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC” is still moving along.

           We see JIM staring at a monitor on the STUDIO FLOOR, 
           holding MUSHMELLON (a strange Japanese inspired Muppet) up 
           to the CAMERA.

           The OPERATOR is twisting the REVOLVING TURRETS on the 
           front, changing the LENS to the three different FOCAL 
           LENGTHS.

           JIM is practicing creating illusions with SPATIAL 
           PERCEPTIONS - using a wide angle lens, JIM makes MUSHMELLON 
           appear to be a great distance from camera, then rush into 
           close-up with the speed of an express train - just by 
           moving his arm slightly (a style that would one day become 
           synonymous with KERMIT THE FROG).

           INT. CONTROL ROOM, STAGE, WRC-TV, WASHINGTON, 1954 - DAY

           Musical montage continues.  TEEN JIM is up in the CONTROL 
           ROOM staring at a MATTE BOX.  A TECHNICIAN is showing him 
           how a BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE can be placed on the top of the 
           CAMERA FEED...

           ...to create an early SUPER-IMPOSED GRAPHIC.

           JIM takes a WHITE MARKER and draws a SQUIGGLY WORM on a 
           piece of BLACK.  The TECHNICIAN puts it into the MATTE 
           BOX...

           ...and suddenly the IMAGE comes up on screen.

           TEEN JIM’S eyes widen.

           INT. SOUND STAGE, WRC-TV, WASHINGTON, 1954 - DAY

           JIM and JANE are still performing KERMIT and SAM mouthing 
           “THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC” for the CREW.

           SAM is far in the background (in perspective to the 
           camera), while KERMIT is closer to the lens.

                                 KERMIT
                        I should stay away / But what can 
                        I do? / I hear you name / And I’m 
                        a flame.

           SAM races to meet KERMIT (a little like ANIMAL from the 
           MUPPET SHOW).  The WORDS spell across screen as they sing - 
           using the SUPER-IMPOSE style Jim learnt in the scene above.

                                 SAM
                        FLAME!  BURNING DESIRE!

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 KERMIT
                        That only your kiss...

                                 SAM
                        PUT OUT THE FIRE!

           INT. DRIVEWAY, HENSON’S HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1954- DAY

           MONTAGE CONTINUES.  JIM and PAUL JNR carry a NEW COLOR 
           TELEVISION up the driveway - the other HENSON kids watching 
           excitedly.

           BETTY smiles at her son proudly.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, HENSON’S HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1954- NIGHT

           MONTAGE CONTINUES.  JIM, JENNY, PAUL JNR, BETTY, PAUL SNR 
           and the other HENSON KIDS sit around a NEW COLOR TV.  The 
           pass around a bowl of popcorn - excited.

           “SAM AND FRIENDS” starts.  The OPENING TITLES animate on.

                                 VOICE OVER
                        Sam and Friends!  Twice a day at 
                        6 and 11 - only on WRC-TV!

           The family claps.  JENNY smiles at JIM.  Their relationship 
           is blossoming - the disastrous date now far in the past.

           INT. SOUND STAGE, WRC-TV, WASHINGTON, 1954 - DAY

           MONTAGE CONTINUES.  JIM, far more confident, works with 
           JANE and PAUL JNR on set.  They’re attempting an elaborate 
           sight gag where a TABLE (covered in grass) is holding a 
           CARDBOARD CUT OUT OF A CAR (clearly created by JIM).

           SAM, OMAR (a bug eyed, long nosed Muppet) and MOLDY HAY (a 
           tanned “hick” Muppet) are being controlled by the three of 
           them - giving the illusion that these MUPPETS ar driving 
           along the country-side... still singing along to “THAT OLD 
           BLACK MAGIC”.

           The CREW laughs and claps along.

           INT. SOUND STAGE, WRC-TV, WASHINGTON, 1954 - DAY

           MONTAGE CONTINUES.  It’s a CHRISTMAS PARTY at WRC-TV.  All 
           the REGULARS from the STATION are standing around drinking, 
           eating, mulling by the LARGE CHRISTMAS TREE.

           TEEN JIM sees JANE sitting alone by some MISTLETOE.  
           Determined, he goes to walk over...

           ...when CHARLIE gets there first - planting a KISS ON HER.

           EXT. CAR YARD, WASHINGTON, 1955 - DAY

           MONTAGE CONTINUES.  TEEN JIM strolls with JENNY - arm in 
           arm.  They search for a new car...

           ...now fully blossomed into a relationship.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY, HENSON HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1955 - DAY

           TEEN JIM poses by a WHITE THUNDER BIRD CONVERTIBLE in the 
           driveway.  JENNY reclines across the HOOD.  The HENSON 
           FAMILY stand around cheering and clapping.  JIM’S even put 
           on a BLACK TOP HAT for the occasion.

           PAUL SNR takes a photo - flashing us with white.

           EXT. FREEWAY, WASHINGTON, 1955 - DAY

           TEEN JIM and JENNY take the white THUNDER BIRD CONVERTIBLE 
           for a spin around WASHINGTON...

           ...PROFESSOR KERMIT sticking over the windscreen singing 
           the song still.

           EXT. MAKE OUT POINT, WASHINGTON, 1955-  NIGHT

           PROFESSOR KERMIT sits in the front of the THUNDER BIRD, 
           awkwardly facing out front...

           ...as TEEN JIM and JENNY make out in the back of the car.

           INT. SOUND STAGE, WRC-TV, WASHINGTON, 1956 DAY

           MONTAGE continues.  A typical day of shooting on “SAM AND 
           FRIENDS”.  The amount of people on the floor has tripled.  
           JANE and JIM are being watched by not just a working crew 
           now, but also a large audience of EXECUTIVES.

           Everyone is laughing and having a great old time.  “That 
           Old Black Magic” is still going - only JIM has worked up 
           the courage to actually sing it by this stage (no longer 
           lip syncing).

                                 KERMIT
                              (sings)
                        I should stay away / But what can 
                        I do? / I hear you name / And I’m 
                        a flame.

           MUSHMELLON comes running down to the front of the CAMERA.

                                 MUSHMELLON
                        FLAME!  Burning desire!

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           One of the suits is a smartly dressed man with glasses - 
           JIMMY DEAN - a talk show host.  He grins at MAX RUMSEN.

                                 JIMMY DEAN
                        Who is this guy?

                                 MAX
                        Some kid we found at high school.

                                 JIMMY DEAN
                        You’ll wanna lock that contract 
                        down Max.  Whatever you’re paying 
                        him - it aint enough.

           INT. SOUND STAGE, WRC-TV, WASHINGTON, 1956 - NIGHT

           MONTAGE continues.  TEEN JIM, the last one on the studio 
           floor, repaints SETS for tomorrows taping.

           MAX, drinking his evening scotch, wanders on in.

                                 MAX
                        You work too hard to be the 
                        genius they say you are kiddo.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        Oh... ahhhh, there were some 
                        things that needed to get done 
                        before I headed off.  Paints.

                                 MAX
                        Listen, I had a word with Jimmy 
                        Dean this afternoon.  You know 
                        who Jimmy Dean is?

                                 JIM
                        I, uhhh, of course I know who 
                        Jimmy Dean is.  Everyone knows 
                        who Jimmy Dean is.

                                 MAX
                        He thinks you’ve got a home here 
                        at WRC. (beat) And so do I.

           TEEN JIM just stares back at him like a STUNNED MULLET.  
           He’s speechless.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I’ll go ring my bosses and say 
                        ‘yes’ huh?

                                 TEEN JIM
                        Ahhh... thank you Mr Rumsen.

           He winks.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 MAX
                        Just keep it coming kid.  That’s 
                        all we ask.

           EXT. THUNDERBIRD, WASHINGTON, 1956 - NIGHT

           TEEN JIM, excited, races home in his THUNDERBIRD.  “THAT 
           OLD BLACK MAGIC” starts to wrap itself up.

           INT. FRONT YARD, HENSON HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1956 - NIGHT

           As TEEN JIM pulls into the street, he sees a POLICE CAR 
           parked in his DRIVEWAY.

           Concerned, he cautiously approaches the house.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, HENSON HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1956 - NIGHT

           TEEN JIM, anxious, walks in the front door and sees his 
           father, PAUL SNR comforting his mother BETTY on the lounge.  
           She can’t stop crying.

           The other HENSON children all have tears streaming down 
           their faces.  Something has happened.

           We see a POLICE OFFICER sitting across the other side of 
           the room.  His HAT rests somberly in his lap.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        What’s going on?

                                 PAUL SNR
                        Jim - why don’t you come have a 
                        seat son?

                                 TEEN JIM
                        I, ahhhh, what’s happened?

                                 PAUL SNR
                        Something... (loses himself to 
                          tears) Something happened to your 
                          brother.

                TEEN JIM locks up.  He starts to shake.

                INT. MORGUE, HOSPITAL, WASHINGTON, 1956 - NIGHT

                TEEN JIM waits with his father PAUL SNR as a NURSE unzips a 
                BODY BAG.

                Inside is PAUL JNR, bloodied and bruised.  He’s hard to 
                recognise at all anymore.  

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           His FATHER starts to dissolve - his normally reserved 
           exterior completely broken down.

                                 PAUL SNR
                        Yup.  That’s... that’s... my boy.

           He clutches JIM’S hand for support.  JIM can’t stop staring 
           into the bloodied face of his BROTHER.

           INT. PAUL SNR’S CAR, WASHINGTON, 1956 - NIGHT

           PAUL SNR, broken, slowly drives through TORRENTIAL RAIN.  
           TEEN JIM sits in the passenger seat - unable to talk.  

           A long, painful, pause.

                                 PAUL SNR
                        SAY SOMETHING!  FOR CHRIST SAKE!  
                        DON’T JUST SIT THERE IN SILENCE!!

           PAUL SNR pulls his CAR over to the side of the road.  He 
           slumps against the wheel - sobbing.

                                 PAUL SNR (CONT’D)
                        I can’t... I can’t stop this 
                        coming Jimmy.  I can’t.

           JIM watches his DAD... heart broken.

                                 PAUL SNR (CONT’D)
                        My boy... I’ve lost my little 
                        boy.

           INT. JIM’S BEDROOM, HENSON HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1956 - NIGHT

           TEEN JIM lies awake in bed - listening to the sounds of 
           sobbing from all the rooms of the house..

                                 BETTY (O.S)
                        PAUL!  WHERE’S PAUL!?!

           He pulls the covers up over his head.

           INT. KITCHEN, HENSON HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1956 - NIGHT

           It’s now the middle of the night.  BETTY sits at the 
           kitchen table halfway through a FRESH BOTTLE OF SCOTCH.

           TEEN JIM sheepishly walks in - wearing his familiar STRIPED 
           PYJAMAS.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        Mom? (beat) Are you okay?

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 BETTY
                        Ahhhh... no.

           JIM sits with her.  She slides a GLASS across to him.  JIM 
           just shakes his head.

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        He loved you, you know.  Your 
                        brother.  He loved you so much.

           BETTY starts crying again.

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        Jimmy.  Make it stop.  Make me 
                        laugh - would you?  Go get the 
                        rat...  You and your brother... 
                        (beat) Paul loved that rat.

                                 JIM
                        Mom... I can’t.

           She wont hear this right now.

                                 BETTY
                        I’ll go get it, huh?

           BETTY, drunk, stumbles from the table.

           Leaving him alone with his thoughts, JIM shakes.  It’s all 
           too much.  He RUSHES out the FRONT DOOR.

           EXT. FRONT YARD, HENSON HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1956 - NIGHT

           TEEN JIM pounds across the DRIVEWAY - racing to his 
           THUNDERBIRD.  Wound up, he rip his keys from the SUN VISOR 
           and roars the CAR into action.

           EXT. FRONT YARD, JANE’S HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1956 - NIGHT

           JIM’S THUNDERBIRD rolls up onto the LAWN.  JIM runs from 
           the car - looking like he’ll explode any second.

           He stumbles to JANE’S HOUSE, his arms locking up against 
           his sides.

           JIM throws a ROCK at an UPSTAIRS WINDOW - clearly 
           distressed.

           JANE peers down from above and catches sight of JIM on the 
           LAWN - possessed.

                                 JANE
                        Jimmy?  What are you doing?

           It’s bubbling out.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 TEEN JIM
                        There was a car accident... Paul, 
                        ahhh... Paul...

                                 TEEN JANE
                        What’s...

                                 TEEN JIM
                        Paul’s gone, ahhhh, he’s gone.

           JANE opens her WINDOW - pointing to the GARDEN LATTICE.

                                 JANE
                        Quickly.  Climb up.  Quick.

           INT. JANE’S BEDROOM, JANE’S HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1956 - NIGHT

           Tripping over themselves, JANE helps JIM in through the 
           window.

           She leads him to the BED - just as he bursts into tears.

                                 TEEN JANE
                        Jim... it’s okay.  It’s just us 
                        now.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        I came home and there was a 
                        police car... --

                                 TEEN JANE
                        -- Shhhh.  Shhhhh. --

                                 TEEN JIM
                        -- We went to the hospital, and 
                        he was... he was... --

                                 TEEN JANE
                        -- No more talking - okay?

           JIM looks at her.  He needs this.  Impulsively, JIM goes to 
           kiss JANE.

           She knee-jerks away.

                                 TEEN JANE (CONT’D)
                        Jim... you can’t.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        Why?

                                 TEEN JANE
                        You just... can’t.

           He looks at her, staring at the engagement ring on her 
           finger.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        Do you love him?

                                 TEEN JANE
                        Jim...

                                 TEEN JIM
                        Because, I don’t think you do.

                                 TEEN JANE
                        You don’t know that.

                                 TEEN JIM
                        I see the way you are when you’re 
                        with him and then I see the way 
                        you are when we’re together...

                                 TEEN JANE
                        Jim...

                                 TEEN JIM
                        ... I love you.

           A moment.  They kiss - passionately and deeply - falling 
           onto the bed.

           INT. FLOOR, ARSENIO HALL SHOW, LA, 1990 - DAY

           JIM HENSON, present day, stares out into a SEA OF FACES - 
           lost.  ARSENIO watches him with ever building panic.  
           They’ve been sitting in this silence for a while now.

                                 ARSENIO
                        Ahhhh... Jim?  You okay buddy?

           JIM comes round.  He turns to ARSENIO.

                                 JIM
                        Would you, ahhhh, excuse me a 
                        moment Arsenio?

           ARSENIO smiles down the lens as if nothing were wrong.

                                 ARSENIO
                        We’ll be right back after this 
                        break.

           MUSIC plays as the CAMERA pulls back.  The AUDIENCE is led 
           into forced APPLAUSE.

                                 DIRECTOR (O.S)

           JIM bursts into his dressing room - collapsing at the 
           makeup table.

           He stares into his reflection - troubled.  He knows 
           something is wrong.

           KEVIN CLASH bangs on the door.

                                 KEVIN (O.S)
                        Yo.  Jim.  Talk to me man.

           JIM can’t talk.  He tries to loosen his collar.

                                 KEVIN (O.S) (CONT’D)
                        JIM!

                                 JIM
                        It’s okay... it’s okay.  My 
                        throat got caught up.  I’m 
                        alright now.  I’m alright.

           KEVIN lets himself in.  He stares at JIM, his face covered 
           in sweat, his skin pale.

                                 KEVIN
                        What the hell happened out there?

                                 JIM
                        I don’t know.

           He shuts the door, worried someone will hear.

                                 KEVIN
                        We’re calling a cab - you’re 
                        gonna go see a doctor.

                                 JIM
                        I don’t, ahhh, I don’t need to 
                        bother a doctor, you know.  It’s 
                        a sore throat.  I’m sure there’s 
                        far more important things they’re 
                        dealing with.

           KEVIN grabs JIM by the face - forcing him to listen.

                                 KEVIN
                        Jim... you are going to see a 
                        doctor.

           Backed into a corner - JIM nervously nods - not wanting to 
           be confronted about this.

           EXT. OUTSIDE LA STUDIOS, CALIFORNIA, 1990 - DAY

           KEVIN helps JIM into a CAB.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 KEVIN
                              (to driver)
                        Don’t listen to anything this guy 
                        says.  Take him straight to USC.

           He bangs the roof.  The CAB takes off.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                              (bad english)
                        Where you go?

           JIM thinks about it.

                                 JIM
                        Beverly hills hotel.  Off Beverly 
                        drive and Sunset.

           INT. BUNGALOW, BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL, CALIFORNIA, 1990 - DAY

           JIM sits on the bed - his elongated LEGS making his KNEES 
           rise up in the air.

           He buries his head in his hands.  Something strange is 
           happening.

           EXT. ROME, EUROPE, 1959 - DAY

           1959.  A YOUNG JIM HENSON, 23, walks the cobbled footpaths 
           of the PIAZZA DEL POPOLO.  He wears a tattered brown 
           leather jacket and a backpack.

           His face is already sporting hints at what would become his 
           trademark beard - a small grizzled goatee spreading around 
           his mouth like a rash.

           It’s the middle of the day, and the marketplace is over 
           crowded.

           A STREET BUSKER crouches underneath his RED BOX and 
           performs a “PUNCH AND JUDY” show.

           It grabs JIM’S attention immediately.  He watches all the 
           LOCAL CHILDREN smiling and laughing.

                                                                LATER.

           JIM watches ANOTHER BUSKER performing a DANCING SPANISH 
           MARIONETTE.  He’s fascinated.

                                                                LATER.

           JIM sits in a small theatre, one of only three in the 
           audience.  He watches a SHADOW PUPPET show.

                                                                LATER.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           JIM is back on the street - night time fast upon him.  The 
           place has been filled with lanterns - casting a magical 
           glow across the PIAZZA.

           Suddenly - out of nowhere - an ASIAN STYLE DRAGON starts 
           snaking through the streets; a full bodied puppet 
           controlled by over three performers.

           JIM gets swept up in the excitement.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, ROME, 1959 - NIGHT

           JIM sits on the end of his bed, playing with a WOODEN 
           “PUNCH” puppet he brought on the street.

           He takes off his shoes, noticing his BIG TOE sticking 
           through the top of his socks.

           He places the SOCK over his hand to further examine the 
           PROBLEM...

           ...only to find there are actually TWO HOLES in it.  His 
           fingers stick out of THE SOCK like ANTENNAE.  

           JIM, being JIM, clues into a character straight away.  He 
           starts making a “whomping” ALIEN sound to go with it.

           INT. PLANE, OVER ATLANTIC, 1959 - DAY

           JIM doodles in his NOTE PAD.  We see what he’s drawing...

           ...a strange DOG LIKE CREATURE is being formed - with eyes 
           like fried eggs.  It’s an early sketch for ROWLF.

           INT. SOUND STAGE, WRC-TV, WASHINGTON, 1959 - DAY

           JIM HENSON, brown leather jacket on, walks onto the BUSY 
           SET of “SAM AND FRIENDS”.

           JANE NEBEL, now 25, works with another puppeteer BOB PAYNE, 
           23, a straight shooting clean cut man from Jim’s COLLEGE.

           They’re in the middle of a SKIT where YORICK (a strange 
           handkerchief over his face) sings “I’VE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO 
           HER FACE” by ROSEMARY CLOONEY.  

           PROFESSOR KERMIT (again in a strange wig) sings.

                                 KERMIT
                        I’ve grown accustomed to your 
                        face / It almost makes the day 
                        begin / I’ve grown accustomed to 
                        the tune you whistle / Night and 
                        Noon / Your smiles, your frowns / 
                        The ups, the downs.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           JANE, performing YORICK, finally notices JIM watching from 
           across the floor.  It throws her for a moment...

           ...making her miss a cue.  

           BOB darts her a look as he quickly recovers by thrashing 
           KERMIT around in the AIR with a manic mischief.

           The CREW laughs.  So does JIM.  JANE blushes with 
           embarrassment.

           EXT. OUTSIDE WRC-TV STUDIOS, WASHINGTON, 1959 - DAY

           JANE spots JIM resting against a FIRE DOOR in the corner of 
           the STUDIO.

           She walks over, the two of them using this long walk to 
           figure out what to say.

           They stare at each other... smiling... but nervous.

                                 JIM
                        Did, ahhh, did you get my 
                        letters?

                                 JANE
                        I got them. (beat) I’ve read a 
                        couple of them a few times 
                        actually.

           The silence isn’t fading.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been gone over a year now 
                        Jim.

                                 JIM
                        I, ahhhh, I couldn’t stay away 
                        forever.

                                 JANE
                        Why?

                                 JIM
                        You... you know.

           JANE tries to avoid the topic.

                                 JANE
                        When did you get back?

                                 JIM
                        Maybe an hour ago.  Maybe one 
                        hour twenty, or something like 
                        that... I don’t know.  I dropped 
                        the bags and came straight here.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           Despite her best intentions, she starts melting.

                                 JANE
                        Jim.  I didn’t get married.  We 
                        called the engagement off. (beat) 
                        Before you ask and make a thing --

                                 JIM
                        -- I ahhhh... my mother wrote and 
                        told me already --

                                 JANE
                        -- So don’t ask and --

                                 JIM
                        -- I’m sorry about that.

           They slow down.  JANE knows better.

                                 JANE
                        No you’re not.

                                 JIM
                        Sure I am.

           JANE smiles knowingly.

                                 JANE
                        No you’re not.

           INT. RUMSEN OFFICE, WRC-TV, WASHINGTON, 1959 - DAY

           JIM steps into MAX’S office.  There are several “SAM AND 
           FRIENDS” posters up on the wall.

           MAX glares at him through CIGAR SMOKE.

                                 JIM
                        Some things were happening at 
                        home.

                                 MAX

           JIM goes to get up.

                        Nothing at all.

           MAX smiles ear to ear.

                                 MAX
                        Good.  (beat) Unspoilt.

           INT. CAFETERIA, WASHINGTON, 1959 - NIGHT

           JIM and JANE sit across from each other in a BOOTH, both 
           working on DRAWINGS for a WILKINS COFFEE COMMERCIAL.

           Bits of PAPER, half eaten COBBLER and COFFEE are spread all 
           over the TABLE.

           JIM looks up from his SKETCH PAD.  He watches JANE drawing 
           a FURRY MONSTER in her BOOK.

           He keeps staring.

                                 JANE
                        Jim... stop it.  We’re meant to 
                        be working.

                                 JIM
                        What?

           She throws him a smile.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JANE
                        Jim... you know what.

           He smiles and goes back to his DRAWINGS.  We move under the 
           BOOTH and see JIM and JANE’S LEGS rubbing together... the 
           two of them occasionally giggling.

           INT. MEETING ROOM, WILKINS COFFEE, 1959 - DAY

           JIM and JANE sit at a table with EXECUTIVES from WILKINS 
           COFFEE.  He slides across a HAND-DRAWN storyboard to the 
           head of advertising, BILL DYERSON, 39.

           BILL stares at the strange, comic-book drawings of TWO 
           MUPPET CHARACTERS shooting each other.

                                 JIM
                        So... basically there are two 
                        characters - Wilkins - the little 
                        guy and Wontkins - the big guy.  
                        Wilkins asks Wontkins if he’s 
                        ever tried Wilkins coffee before, 
                        and when he says no - Wilkins 
                        shoots him across the screen.

           The BOARD look at him rather strangely.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        It’s... ahhh... you know... 
                        hopefully funny.  And it’s 
                        something you could only get away 
                        with when you’re using puppets, 
                        obviously...

           The BOARD continues their silence.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Have you... ahhhh... you have 
                        seen my show - right?

           BILL suddenly explodes with laughter.

                                 BILL
                        What do you reckon this is gonna 
                        cost me?

                                 JIM
                        Ten dollars.  

                                 BILL
                        Ten dollars?

                                 JIM
                        Maybe five if I re-use one of the 
                        muppets from “Sam and Friends”.

                                 BILL
                        Tell ya what kid - I’ll give you 
                        three hundred and you go and 
                        shoot as many of these 
                        promotionals as you can think of - 
                        how’s that sound?

           JANE and JIM look at each other.  They can’t believe it.

           INT. GARAGE, SUBURBAN HOUSE, WASHINGTON, 1959 -  DAY

           A LOW-KEY film shoot is underway in a SUBURBAN GARAGE.

           JIM, a new confidence about him, walks around with JANE 
           inspecting the place.  The CREW literally consists of JIM, 
           JANE, A CAMERAMAN and a SOUND RECORDIST.

                                 JIM
                              (to CAMERAMAN)
                        Don’t forget to thank your mom 
                        for letting us do this here.

                                 CAMERAMAN
                        Ah, you know.  She’s excited I’m 
                        finally shooting something.

           Suddenly ETHEL, the CAMERAMAN’S mother, 64, waddles out 
           with a tray of LEMONADE.

                                 ETHEL
                        Would you kids like some 
                        lemonade?

                                 JIM
                        No thank you Mrs Murrows.

                                 CAMERAMAN
                        Ma, go back inside - you’re 
                        embarrassing me.

                                                                LATER.

           JIM and JANE are performing a SKIT in front of a BLACK 
           PIECE OF CARDBOARD.  JIM provides the voice for both 
           WILKINS (a wormy looking MUPPET) and WONTKINS (a spud like 
           MUPPET).  JANE operates WONTKINS.

           Sitting on a brick wall, WILKINS points a CANNON at 
           WONTKINS.

                                 WILKINS
                        Okay buddy - what do you think of 
                        Wilkins coffee?

                                 WONTKINS
                        I’ve never tasted it.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           WILKINS wastes no time BLASTING WONTKINS across the screen.  
           He twirls the CANNON around and points it down the lens.

                                 WILKINS
                        Now what do you think of Wilkins?

           A moment.  JIM stands up.

                                 JIM
                        Well.  That’s one in the can.

           The TEAM laugh.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Has your mom got a hammer 
                        somewhere?

           EXT. BOARDWALK, MARYLAND, WASHINGTON, 1959 - NIGHT

           JIM and JANE walk the same boards they had years before.  
           The landscape has changed with time - TWICE as many SIDE 
           SHOPS have opened and there are people everywhere now...

           ...but still, the OLD CARNIVAL twinkles in the background.

           They share an ICE CREAM CONE.

                                 JIM
                        Gosh.  It used to be so loud 
                        here.  How long was I gone?

                                 JANE
                        It opened up more, over time I 
                        guess.

           Pause.

                                 JIM
                        Jane... when are we getting 
                        married?

                                 JANE
                        Married?  You haven’t even 
                        proposed!

                                 JIM
                        I didn’t think I could.

                                 JANE
                        Well - you can’t.

                                 JIM
                        See.

                                 JANE
                        Jim... it wouldn’t work out 
                        between us.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JIM
                        You don’t know that.

                                 JANE
                        You’re my boss now.

                                 JIM
                        So - you’re older.  It evens 
                        itself out in the mix.

                                 JANE
                        Jim.  No. (beat) Charlie’s family 
                        would kill me.  We only broke off 
                        the engagement six months ago!

                                 JIM
                        Oh man.

                                 JANE
                        What?

           JIM turns JANE around.  They look off towards the HARBOR.  
           A SIGN, made entirely of FIREWORKS, IGNITES UP.

           “MARRY ME JANE?”.

           Her face drops.

                                 JIM
                        I spent my first paycheck hoping 
                        you’d say yes.

           Suddenly - “HE’LL MAKE ME HAPPY” from THE MUPPETS TAKE 
           MANHATTAN starts to play.

           JIM takes JANE’S hand in his own.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Would you...

                                 JANE
                        Jim...

                                 JIM
                        ...I’m not really sure how else 
                        to say it...

                                 JANE
                        ...Not here...

                                 JIM
                        ...I want to spend the rest of my 
                        life with you... you know that?

           JANE thinks long and hard - her heart now sold.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JANE
                        I want to spend my life with you 
                        too.

           JIM takes a deep breath.  He grabs JANE’S ice cream...

           ...AND KISSES HER.

           After a moment, he hands the ICE CREAM back.  JANE smiles 
           and throws what’s left of it in the WATER.

           They KISS again.

           We’ve entered a fantasy sequence involving a virtual army 
           of Muppets (where JIM and JANE appear oblivious to the 
           entire proceedings).

           A STREAM of WATER shoots up behind them - revealing a 50’s 
           style JAZZ BAND. A parade of WOODEN PUPPETS (in the 50’s 
           early morning fashion) suddenly fill the screen.

           MISS PIGGY and KERMIT, dressed in a ball gown and tux, 
           slowly walk towards each other.

                                 MISS PIGGY
                              (sings)
                        He’ll make me happy / Each time I 
                        see him / He’ll be the reason / 
                        My heart can sing.

           JIM and JANE walk off towards the CARNIVAL.

                                 MISS PIGGY (CONT’D)
                              (sings)
                        He’ll stand beside me / And I’ll 
                        have everything.

           EXT. FERRIS WHEEL, CARNIVAL, WASHINGTON, 1954 - NIGHT

           TEEN JIM and TEEN JANE sit in a FERRIS WHEEL CAGE, holding 
           each other.  KERMIT and PIGGY sit on either side of them 
           still singing.

                                 KERMIT
                              (sings)
                        She’ll make me happy / Each time 
                        I hold her / And I will follow / 
                        Where my heart may lead.

           JIM rests his HEAD on JANE’S shoulder.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                              (sings)
                        And she’ll be all I’ll ever need.

           INT. JIM’S THUNDERBIRD, ACROSS US, 1959 - DAY

           JIM, wearing his TOP HAT, drives with JANE towards NEW 
           YORK.  BOXES are stacked up in the back.

           A CAR LOAD OF “YOUNG TEENY” MUPPETS drive alongside them.

                                 YOUNG TEENY MUPPETS
                              (singing)
                        Days go passing into years!

           Another CAR drives across the other side - this one full of 
           “OLD FOLK” MUPPETS.

                                 OLD FOLK MUPPETS
                              (singing)
                        Years go passing day by day!

           INT. FIRST OFFICE, NEW YORK, 1959 - DAY

           The FIRST EVER MUPPET OFFICE - East 53rd street New York.  
           JIM and JANE walk into the SMALL DUSTY SPACE with their 
           belongings...

           ...the PLACE is empty.

           TWO REAL ESTATE MUPPETS show them around.

                                 REAL ESTATE MUPPETS
                              (singing)
                        She’ll make him happy / Now and 
                        forever

                                                                LATER.

           The OFFICE has been filled with furniture - decked out in 
           the wild way only JIM HENSON would.  Frilly feathers over 
           the GAS PIPES, strange SPACE CHAIRS, a WORKING DESK, a few 
           posters from “SAM AND FRIENDS”...

           JANE and JIM share CHINESE TAKE-AWAY on the floor - 
           occasionally  kissing between noodles.

           The REAL ESTATE MUPPETS have been hung up on the WALL with 
           a group of OTHER PUPPETS for storage.  Of course, they’re 
           all still singing.

                                 STORAGE MUPPETS
                              (singing)
                        Until forever / Their love will 
                        grow.

           INT. STUDIOS, NEW YORK, 1959 - DAY

           First day of filming for WILKINS COFFEE on the new decked 
           out STUDIO SPACE in NEW YORK.  The sets are far more 
           elaborate than they ever were back in WASHINGTON.

           JIM has built a WESTERN SET out of CARDBOARD - with WILKINS 
           and WONTKINS now performing as COWBOYS.  JIM and JANE 
           perform underneath the table - still giddy in love.

           We see the CAMERA CREW is in fact a group of LARGE MONSTER 
           MUPPETS, all looking a little “New York”.

                                 MONSTER MUPPETS
                              (singing)
                        She only knows / He’ll make her 
                        happy / That’s all she needs to 
                        know.

           INT. CHURCH, WASHINGTON, 1959 - DAY

           MONTAGE CONTINUES.  JIM’S WEDDING DAY.  It’s a small, 
           family affair.  Thirty or forty FAMILY in attendance, 
           interspersed with MUPPETS everywhere.

           JIM waits with the PRIEST, nervous as ever.  The room 
           turns...

           ...JANE, in full bridal gear, walks down the aisle.

                                 MUPPETS
                              (giant chorus)
                        They’ll be so happy / Now and 
                        forever / Until forever / Their 
                        love will grow.

                                                                LATER.

           JIM lifts JANE’S WEDDING VEIL and kisses her.  The place 
           erupts with applause.

           KERMIT and MISS PIGGY stand on either side of them, dressed 
           for their own WEDDING DAY - still lost in song.

                                 MISS PIGGY
                              (singing)
                        I only know / He’ll make me 
                        happy.

           JIM takes JANE’S hand.

                                 KERMIT
                              (singing)
                        That’s all I need... to... 
                        know...

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           GONZO rushes down and takes a PHOTO of them with his FLASH 
           CAMERA (from the GREAT MUPPET CAPER) - blinding the screen 
           with white.

           INT. BUNGALOW, BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL, CALIFORNIA, 1990 - DAY

           Back in 1990.  JIM splashes his face with WATER at the 
           sink.  He’s looking worse.

           INT. MR CHOWS, RESTAURANT, CALIFORNIA, 1990 - NIGHT

           Posh upmarket restaurant.  JIM HENSON, rugged up for a 
           SUMMER NIGHT, sits with FRANK OZ, 46.

           He’s looking like death.

                                 FRANK
                        Jim?  You cold in here?

                                 JIM
                        Oh... no.  It’s the air con.  
                        It’s getting in my throat.

                                 FRANK
                        You want me to ask them to turn 
                        it down?

           JIM retreats to his meal.  FRANK knows something is wrong.

                        You called Jane lately?

                                 JIM
                        I don’t see the point.

                                 FRANK
                        What point?  You want to call 
                        her, you call her.

                                 JIM
                        I can’t pick up the phone every 
                        time I need to chat.  I can’t lay 
                        that kind of pressure on her 
                        anymore.  We need to move on with 
                        our own lives.

                                 FRANK
                        Jim...

                                 JIM
                        What?

                                 FRANK
                        Don’t be an idiot.

           INT. FRANK’S HOUSE, CALIFORNIA, 1990 - NIGHT

           Frank Oz lives in a very modest Californian brick house.  
           Posters from his DIRECTORIAL EFFORTS litter the walls : 
           “DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS”, “LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS”, “THE 
           MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN” and “THE DARK CRYSTAL”.

           ROBIN, 43, FRANK’S wife, is sitting on the lounge watching 
           DAVID OZ, 9, put together his TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLE 
           PLAYSET.

           JIM and FRANK walk in from dinner.

                                 FRANK
                        Hello, hello.

                                 DAVID
                        Daddy!

           DAVID rushes over and jumps on his fathers leg.

                                 ROBIN
                        We’ve been putting together the 
                        sewer playset all night.  Great 
                        fun.

                                 JIM
                        Oh, I see.

           JIM spots the DONATELLO ACTION FIGURE in DAVID’S hands.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Who’ve you got there Davey?

                                 DAVID
                              (little shy)
                        Donatello.

                                 JIM
                        Oh yeah?  What’s Donatello?

                                 DAVID
                        He’s a ninja turtle.  The smart 
                        one.  He does machines.

                                 JIM
                        He does?

           JIM looks to FRANK.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Why didn’t we think of ninja 
                        turtles huh?

                                 FRANK
                        ‘Cause you would have made them 
                        sing.

                                 JIM
                        I could see that working still.

           INT. STUDY, FRANK’S HOUSE, CALIFORNIA, 1990 - NIGHT

           FRANK lines up a batch of MUPPET BABY HAPPY MEAL TOYS along 
           his desk - part of a new series the company is hoping to 
           launch later in the year.

                                 FRANK
                        Alright.  They fed-exed these 
                        down from New York and Jerry made 
                        me promise I’d show you.

                                 JIM
                        I’m not in the mood Frank.

           JIM sits in a plush red leather CHAIR drinking WHISKEY - 
           quite uninterested in PVC toys.

                                 FRANK
                        McDonalds are gonna put your name 
                        on it either way.

           JIM glances at the MUPPET BABY FIGURES out of spite.

                                 JIM
                              (dry)
                        They didn’t go for the 
                        “storyteller” idea I gave ‘em?

                                 FRANK
                        Har har.

                                 JIM
                        They look like the last ones - 
                        with different vehicles. (beat) 
                        What’s Fozzie riding?

                                 FRANK
                        Looks like... a cart.

           JIM couldn’t care less.

                                 JIM
                        Fine.  Sure.  Tell Jerry to put 
                        them through.  They wouldn’t 
                        listen if I said no anyway.

           FRANK pretends to write that down.

                                 FRANK
                        Fine... sure... put them through.  
                        Don’t care anyway.

           JIM leans his head back and sighs.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JIM
                        When are we going to stop 
                        counting boxes and measuring 
                        suits?  I’m in a time warp Frank.

           FRANK puts the MUPPET BABIES back in their BOX.

                                 FRANK
                        Call Jane.

                                 JIM
                        It’s late.

                                 FRANK
                        Call her anyway.

                                 JIM
                        Maybe you’re the one who has a 
                        problem with this...

           FRANK throws his cordless phone in JIM’S LAP and wanders 
           out of the room.

                                 FRANK
                        Call Jane.  Right now.

           INT. HENSON OFFICE, NEW YORK, 1963 - DAY

           The HENSON PRODUCTION OFFICE is far more advanced than the 
           last time we saw it.  TWO ROOMS now, with a nook for the 
           secretary CAROL, 19,... 

           ...ONE room is a WORKSHOP run by DON SAHLIN, 35, (Muppet 
           head designer; a chirpy clean shaven man with a methodical 
           outlook for costume work)...

           ...while JERRY JUHL, 25, sits at a messy desk covered in 
           papers and an AMPEX TAPE MACHINE (Muppet head writer; a 
           dorky light-haired man with glasses and squint) ...

           ...and the other is JIM’S OFFICE - his door perched with a 
           paper mache MOOSE HEAD and a dart board (with holes all 
           around the bulls eye - but none actually on it).

           A BIG YORICK HEAD rests in the middle of the WORKSHOP - 
           looking down onto EAST 53rd ST MANHATTAN.

           FRANK OZ, 19, at this stage still full of dark black hair, 
           pours WHISKEYS at the drinks table.

                                 FRANK
                        Jim... call Jane.

                                 JERRY
                        For Christ sakes Frank.  You old 
                        enough to be drinking hard stuff?  
                                 (MORE)

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        Go downstairs and get yourself a 
                        sarsaparilla or something hey?

           They burst into laughter.  FRANK hits the MUSIC. “TENDERLY” 
           from the MUPPET MOVIE starts to play in a 60’s fashion.

           JIM, now 27, with a full beard, strides out from his 
           office.

                                 JIM
                        What’s going on now?

                                 DON
                        Here comes the bearded one.

                                 JIM
                        What are we drinking?

                                 FRANK
                        Call your wife.  Tell her you’ll 
                        be late.

                                 JIM
                        Oh yeah?

                                 JERRY
                        Call Jim.  Call. (beat) Carol?

                                 CAROL
                        Yes Mr Juhl?

                                 JERRY
                        Take the rest of the day off.

                                 CAROL
                        But... it’s not Friday.

                                 JERRY
                        What’s ya point?

                                 JIM
                        I’ve gotta use the bathroom.

                                 DON
                        Keep pouring Frank.  Keep 
                        pouring.

                                 JERRY
                        I’ll see you tomorrow honey.  
                        Unless you wanna stay for one of 
                        these drinks?

           FRANK starts passing the WHISKEY around.  JIM heads off to 
           the BATHROOM.

           INT. BATHROOM, HENSON OFFICE, NEW YORK, 1963 - DAY

           As JIM opens the bathroom door... a booby trapped wire 
           causes the SHOWER CURTAIN to open...

           ...revealing a GIANT MONSTER FACE snarling from the 
           bathtub.

           JIM just blinks.  Strange things happen all the time here.

                                 JIM
                        Ha.  Nice touch Don.

                                 DON (O.S)
                        What?

                                 JIM
                        What do you reckon?

           The BOYS can be heard guffawing from outside.

                                 JERRY (O.S)
                        Better watch out for those toilet 
                        monsters Jim.

           INT. HENSON OFFICE, NEW YORK, 1963 - DAY

           DON stands very proudly with his drink, laughing at JIM 
           with the other BOYS.

                                 DON
                        I’ve got no idea what you’re 
                        talking about Jimmy.  No idea.

           He goes to open his DESK DRAWER when THREE SPRING LOADED 
           WORMS shoot out...

           ...scaring him half to death.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Jesus!

           He falls backwards off his chair and onto the floor.  
           JERRY, CAROL and FRANK roll around with laughter.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Nice.  Very nice.

           JIM’S voice echoes through the room - laughing.

                                 JIM (O.S)
                        Why thank you.

           INT. BACKSTAGE, JIMMY DEAN SHOW, NY, 1963 - NIGHT

           DON and JERRY are sitting around the greenroom before a 
           taping of THE JIMMY DEAN SHOW.

           They’re still on the whiskey, enjoying life as only those 
           in the 60’s could.

           JIM and FRANK lean against the wall, practicing tonight’s 
           performance with a two handed ROWLF puppet - a shaggy 
           nightclub DOG with a gruff voice and dry sense of humour.

                                 JIM
                        You move in sync... two... three.

                                 FRANK
                        Two... three... I got it.

                                 JERRY
                        It’s Abbott and Costello, the two 
                        of you.  I’m telling ya.

           JIM speaks back to JERRY as ROWLF.

                                 ROWLF
                        Why don’t ya have another drink 
                        Jerry?  What’s it’s been - three 
                        minutes?

           DON reaches for the ROWLF PUPPET.

                                 DON
                        Let me fix the stitch around his 
                        ear.  I can see it slipping.

           JIM hands ROWLF over.  JERRY, between drinks, is jotting 
           something down on paper.

                                 JERRY
                        What if you wait till Jimmy is in 
                        close, then point out something 
                        like: “Nice hair Mr Dean - is it 
                        yours?”

                                 JIM
                        Hmmph.

                                 JERRY
                        He doesn’t like it.

                                 FRANK
                        How do you know?

                                 JERRY
                        That’s Jim saying he doesn’t like 
                        something.

                        The same.  It’s the way you say 
                        it.

           They crack up.  An ASSISTANT waddles into the room.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Hey, Mr Juhl, we’re running about 
                        two hours behind for rehearsal 
                        today.

                                 JERRY
                        Why didn’t someone call?

                                 ASSISTANT
                        We tried.  No one was on the 
                        phone.

           JERRY eyes FRANK like it was his fault (it wasn’t).

                                 FRANK
                        That was you Jerry.  Don’t look 
                        at me.

                                 JERRY
                        We’re just gonna sit here for two 
                        hours now?

           The ASSISTANT waddles out.  JIM is suddenly taken by a 
           SMALL DOOR, oddly positioned in the middle of the room.

                                 JIM
                        What’s with the mini door?  There 
                        a better green room behind here?

           JIM opens the TINY DOOR.  It’s a SHALLOW CLOSET - filled 
           with a maze of STEAM PIPES.

           His mind starts wandering.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        You bring your paints Don?

           INT. STAGE, JIMMY DEAN SHOW, 1963 - NIGHT

           We’re watching a taping of the JIMMY DEAN SHOW.  A GROUP OF 
           FARMERS dance in a circle around a CARDBOARD FENCE.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O)
                        The Jimmy Dean Show!

           We pan along a group of C GRADE CELEBRITIES sitting by a 
           FARMHOUSE.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        With Denise Glens!  Molly Peas!  
                        Toots Randolph!  And of course...

           We pan across to ROWLF, the DOG MUPPET.  He waves to the 
           audience. 

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        ...your buddy Rowlf!

           The DANCERS speed up their HOE-DOWN.  A CAMEL CIGARETTES 
           LOGO supers on the screen.

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        Brought to you by Camel 
                        Cigarettes.  The best tobacco 
                        makes the best smoke.  Make it 
                        Camel time - right now!

           The DANCERS all fall to their knees as JIMMY DEAN runs 
           between them - fully of energy.

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        And now your host... Jimmy Dean!

           JIMMY DEAN welcomes the audience - a consummate pro.

                                 JIMMY DEAN
                        Such a nice guy to write a song 
                        like that.  Thank you.  Thank 
                        you.  Now one piece of serious 
                        business to talk about tonight, 
                        and I know, you know, what 
                        serious business we’re about. 
                        (beat) My buddy Rowlf was 
                        backstage earlier today, and a 
                        few of the folks around these 
                        parts have been on at me all day 
                        about this amazing thing he’s 
                        done in the dressing room.  I 
                        wonder, Sammy, can we get the 
                        camera backstage there a moment?

           We see on screen a CAMERAMAN rushing through the NBC 
           hallways to a the MUPPETS green room.  Inside, JERRY JULH 
           is smoking his pipe, quite content...

           ...The CAMERA focuses in on the UTILITIES CLOSET JIM was 
           working on earlier.

           The HENSON TEAM decorated all the PIPES with pieces of FUR 
           and PAINTS.  It now resembles a strange HENSON-ESQUE totem 
           pole - like an early throw to the style of THE MUPPET SHOW.

                                 JERRY
                        Rowlf actually rushed back to the 
                        office to grab some of that fur 
                        you see in there.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           We cut back to the STUDIO.

                                 JIMMY DEAN
                        How about that folks?  My buddy 
                        Rowlf and a little re-decorating.

           ROWLF pipes up from the FENCE.

                                 ROWLF
                        The Mad Dog!

           The AUDIENCE claps wildly.

                                                                LATER.

           Another moment from tonight’s show.  ROWLF is pretending to 
           BOX the AIR from behind a fence.

                                 ROWLF (CONT’D)
                        Left cross - right cross.  Left 
                        cross - right cross.  Left cross - 
                        right cross.

           He stares down the camera.

                                 ROWLF (CONT’D)
                        And if he hits me... blue cross - 
                        red cross.

           The AUDIENCE laughs.  JIMMY DEAN walks over to ROWLF 
           dressed as a DOCTOR - scaring him.

                                 ROWLF (CONT’D)
                        Arrrrgh!

           We see from behind the set - JIM and FRANK are performing 
           in unison to operate this PUPPET.

                                 JIMMY DEAN
                        Now wait.  I’m going to help you.  
                        Now open wide... open wide.  
                        That’s it.

           He sticks a PADDLE POP STICK in ROWLF’S mouth.

                                 JIMMY DEAN (CONT’D)
                        Ah ha.  Ahhhhh ha!

           ROWLF suddenly taps him on the shoulder.

                                 ROWLF
                        Hey doc... doc... there’s a hole 
                        in your headlight.

                                 JIMMY DEAN
                        Now just wait a minute.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           The AUDIENCE loses it - laughing hysterically.  JIMMY can’t 
           help it either.  He cracks up in the middle of the skit - 
           hiding his face from the camera.

           ROWLF just mocks him down the lens.

           INT. HENSON APARTMENT, NEW YORK, 1963 - NIGHT

           It’s late.  Very late.  JIM walks into the darkened 
           apartment.

           CHILDREN’S TOYS and CLOTHES are strung everywhere.

           A pregnant JANE, now 29, clicks on a LAMP.  She’s been 
           sleeping on the LOUNGE.

                                 JANE
                        What... what time is it?

                                 JIM
                        Past two.

                                 JANE
                        You didn’t call. (beat) I’d made 
                        meatloaf.

                                 JIM
                        The guys wanted to get an early 
                        dinner.  We ended up on the 
                        street somewhere near the studio.

                                 JANE
                        Were you drinking?

                                 JIM
                        I was working honey.

                                 JANE
                        I put the kids to bed. (beat) 
                        They all said good night already.

           JIM stares off.  It’s hard to know if he minds.

           INT. BEDROOM, HENSON APARTMENT, NEW YORK, 1963 - NIGHT

           Late, late night.  It’s dark.  JIM lies in bed - staring at 
           the ceiling.  JANE reaches across and rests on his 
           shoulders.

                                 JIM
                        I’ve been having some ideas about 
                        getting out...

                                 JANE
                        Jim... it’s late.  The baby wants 
                        to sleep.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JIM
                        I gotta try something else.

                                 JANE
                        You need to slow down.

                                 JIM
                        Honey... I get this part of the 
                        work done and then we can do what 
                        we want, you know.  We can have 
                        everything.  Me, you, the kids, 
                        we wont have to worry about 
                        variety shows and hiding behind 
                        sets anymore.  We can just focus 
                        on being happy.

                                 JANE
                        I thought we were happy.

                                 JIM
                              (hiding)
                        Yeah... we are.

           INT. BEDROOM, HENSON APARTMENT, NEW YORK, 1963 - MORNING

           Sun shines through the windows.  MANHATTAN, 1963, is 
           waiting outside.

           JANE stirs from her sleep.  She goes to hold JIM only to 
           find...

           ...he’s not there.

           The clock on the bedside reads : “6:30 am”.

           INT. KIDS ROOM, HENSON APARTMENT, NEW YORK, 1963 - MORNING

           JIM is sitting on a rocking chair reading “CINDERELLA” to 
           LISA HENSON, 3, - still wrapped up in bed.  He nurses baby 
           CHERYL, 1, on his lap.

                                 JIM
                        ...and Cinderella ran down the 
                        steps as fast as she could.

                                 LISA
                        She ran?

                                 JIM
                        She ran.

           JANE peers in the archway and watches for a moment.

                                 JANE
                        Daddy... you didn’t get much 
                        sleep last night.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           He winks at JANE.

                                 JIM
                        I promised Lisa I would finish 
                        our book.

                                 LISA
                        Yeah mommy.

           JANE just rolls her eyes.

                                 JANE
                        I’ll get breakfast started then, 
                        shall I?

           EXT. BROOKLYN ZOO, CENTRAL PARK, NEW YORK, 1963 - DAY

           The “TIMEPIECE” short film shoot.  A quiet enclosure away 
           from the public.  JIM, dressed in overalls, covers a timid 
           ELEPHANT in PINK PAINT.

           DON, JERRY and FRANK operate a 16mm CAMERA off to the side - 
           all casually smoking cigarettes.

                                 JIM
                        How’s the roll going?

                                 DON
                        Still fifty feet.

                                 JIM
                        I’ll move to the middle.

           FRANK whispers into JERRY’S ear.

                                 FRANK
                        Do you have any idea what he’s 
                        doing?

                                 JERRY
                        None at all.

           EXT. HILLS, SUBURBAN NEW YORK, 1963 - DAY

           Another day of filming “TIMEPIECE”.  DON and FRANK watch 
           mortified as JIM runs along the hills...

           ...dressed with WINGS like a early turn of the century 
           flying-man.

           JERRY is trying to follow him with the CAMERA.

                                 JIM
                        Just keep following me... keep 
                        following.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JERRY
                        I’ve got it Jim.  You’re in 
                        frame.

           JIM jumps in the air between TWO MOUNDS - temporarily 
           giving himself the appearance of flying.

                                 JIM
                        WOOOOHOOOOOOOOO!!!!

           INT. HENSON APARTMENT, NEW YORK, 1963 - NIGHT

           Another lonely night at home.  JANE watches THE ED SULLIVAN 
           SHOW on TV.  She cradles her newborn baby...

           ...BRIAN HENSON.

                                                              ON TV : 

           We see the famous “INCHWORM” sketch.

           PROFESSOR KERMIT, sitting on a WALL, sees a SMALL WORM 
           crawling along the top.  Hungry, he pulls at it to eat...

           ...only to find the worm is actually part of a GIANT 
           MONSTER NOSE.

           It turns around and SWALLOWS KERMIT WHOLE.

                                                              OFF TV :

           LISA rolls over LAUGHING.  JANE puts a BOTTLE in BRIAN’S 
           MOUTH.

                                 JANE
                        Lisa... you’ll get square eyes if 
                        you keep sitting that close.

                                 LISA
                              (like her father)
                        Good!

           INT. BEDROOM, HENSON APARTMENT, NEW YORK, 1963 - NIGHT

           JANE is awoken by JIM sneaking in the bedroom door.  He 
           collapses onto the bed - still fully clothed.

                                 JANE
                        How did the show go?

                                 JIM
                        Well.  I guess. (beat) Well, 
                        well, well.

           JANE kisses him lovingly on the forehead.

           INT. ELECTRONICS STORE, NEW YORK, 1964 - DAY

           We see a rapid montage of Jim’s appearances on THE JIMMY 
           DEAN SHOW, TODAY and THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW from 1963 - 1964 - 
           all playing at once on a large WALL OF COLOR TV’S.

           Pulling back we see JIM standing with the HENSON family on 
           the street - looking in at the display.

           INT. TOY STORE, NEW YORK, 1963 - DAY

           JIM and his FAMILY are dragged into a UPSCALE toy store by 
           LISA.

           She goes straight for a wall of ROWLF PUPPETS towards the 
           back.  A sign labels them : “ROWLF from the JIMMY DEAN 
           SHOW”.

           JIM picks one of them up.  It bares a resemblance to the 
           real thing ... but it’s not a touch on the actual ROWLF.

           JIM puts in one on his ARMS and does the voice for LISA.

                                 ROWLF
                        Wanna see me touch my nose?

                                 LISA
                        Yeah.

           JIM moves ROWLF to LISA’S face - gently rubbing noses - 
           Eskimo style.

           INT. HENSON OFFICE, NEW YORK, 1964 - DAY

           The WHISKEY and CIGARS are flowing.  JIM, JERRY, FRANK and 
           DON are watching the final cut of “TIMEPIECE” up on a wall.

           It’s a strange, abstract film.  More artistic than 
           narrative.  JERRY smirks at a scene of JIM’S HEAD bursting 
           through a TRAY OF FOOD.

                                 FRANK
                        Jim... how long is this thing?

                                 JIM
                        Ten minutes.

                                 JERRY
                        It’s bloody hilarious.

                                 JIM
                        Gee... boys... I’m not going for 
                        funny.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s good Jim.  Don’t listen to 
                        ‘em.

           INT. UPMARKET RESTAURANT, NEW YORK, 1964 - NIGHT

           ELAINE’S RESTAURANT, NEW YORK, 1964.  It’s Christmas.  Snow 
           falls outside.

           JIM and JANE, both looking a little hippy, enjoy a warm 
           dinner in the candle-lit restaurant.  They seem quite out 
           of place compared to the other up-market New Yorkers dining 
           there tonight.

                                 JANE
                        You ever imagine two kids from 
                        Maryland would end up eating... 
                        at a place like this.

                                 JIM
                        You should try this Colorado 
                        lamb.

                                 JANE
                        What happened to the burgers?

                                 JIM
                        We’re celebrating.

           JIM pulls an ENVELOPE out of his pocket and hands it to 
           her.

                                 JANE
                        What is it?

                                 JIM
                        Take a look.

           JANE pulls out a FORMAL LOOKING LETTER.  Her mouth drops.

                                 JANE
                        Jim... this is...

                                 JIM
                        I know.

                                 JANE
                        Is it real?

                                 JIM
                        Well, it says Academy Award on 
                        the top.  You can’t fake that.

                                 JANE
                        You got a nomination Jimmy?  Have 
                        you rung your dad?

                                 JIM
                        Let’s not get carried away.  It’s 
                        for a short film.  But maybe 
                        they’ll fly us out to California.  
                        See some parties.  Take the kids 
                        to Disneyland. 

                                 JANE
                        Jimmy... Of course you’ll win. 
                        (beat) I can’t believe this.

                                 JIM
                        This is the start.  It’s the 
                        start of something new.  I know 
                        it.

           EXT. UPTOWN STREET, NEW YORK, 1964 - NIGHT

           SNOW gently falls to the pavement.  JIM, a little drunk, 
           walks with JANE.  They both share an ICE CREAM CONE, just 
           like they used to back in MARYLAND.

                                 JIM
                              (a little slurred)
                        Can you... can you feel us 
                        changing?

                                 JANE
                        I can feel you changing Jimmy.

                                 JIM
                        Finally people are seeing it’s 
                        about what you can do with the 
                        medium, not what it can do for 
                        you.

                                 JANE
                        I know.

           JANE hangs her head low.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I was thinking of maybe doing an 
                        art course down in Bridgeview.  
                        Get back into the swing of things 
                        again.  I read that it’s quite 
                        good at this place.

           JIM looks to her.  He isn’t sure how to respond.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        What would you think of that?

           JIM retreats into his ICE CREAM.  They continue on in 
           silence for the rest of their walk.

           INT. HENSON APARTMENT, NEW YORK, 1964 - NIGHT

           JIM and JANE arrive home.  CAROL, the secretary, is sitting 
           on the lounge doing a CROSSWORD.

                                 JANE
                        Carol... you saved our life 
                        tonight.

           JIM smiles, ever grateful, reaching for his wallet.

                                 JIM
                        It’s getting late.

           INT. KIDS ROOM, HENSON APARTMENT, NEW YORK, 1964 - NIGHT

           JIM walks in, still a little drunk.  He sees BABY BRIAN and 
           CHERYL asleep in their cots.

           LISA lies in bed, hugging her ROWLF DOLL.  A CINDERELLA 
           BOOK is left half open from where she tried to read it.

           JIM, his heart melting, walks over and closes the BOOK.  

           JANE watches him.

                                 JANE
                        You coming to bed?

                                 JIM
                        Just... gimme a few minutes with 
                        them.

                                 JANE
                        Okay.

           JANE walks out.  JIM leans down and kisses young LISA on 
           the head.  He pulls the covers up over her ROWLF DOLL.

           INT. TOYS R US, MANHATTAN, 1990 - DAY

           THIRTY YEARS LATER.  A GIANT WALL of MUPPET MERCHANDISE 
           stares back at us.  JIM, dressed in his trademark checkered 
           shirt, stands staring at it all.

           He watches as a YOUNG BOY races over and very eagerly picks 
           up a ROWLF DOLL and drags it to his parents.

           JIM coughs and splutters into a HANDKERCHIEF.

           INT. CHERYL’S APARTMENT, MANHATTAN, 1990 - DAY

           JIM waits.  CHERYL HENSON, 29, answers her door - still in 
           pyjamas.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 CHERYL
                        Dad?

                                 JIM
                        Oh... am I... early?

                                 CHERYL
                        No. (beat) Yeah, about an hour.

                                 JIM
                        I could go around the block and 
                        get a sandwich or something.

                                 CHERYL
                        No, no.  Pa’s expecting us for 
                        dinner anyway.  The sooner we’re 
                        on the road - the better... it’s 
                        fine.  It’s fine.

                                 JIM
                        Ok-ay then.  I’ll meet you down 
                        in the car.

                                 CHERYL
                        Okay.

           JIM dawdles off - striding down the hallway.

           INT. CHERYL’S CAR, DRIVING ACROSS US, 1990 - DAY

           An OLD VINTAGE CAR (suspiciously like the one FOZZIE and 
           KERMIT drove in THE MUPPET MOVIE) heads down a wide and 
           empty road.

           MANHATTAN can be seen disappearing off in the distance.

           JIM is falling asleep in the passenger seat, cradling 
           against the window.  CHERYL, driving, keeps glancing at 
           him.

                                 CHERYL
                        How’s everything with the new 
                        show?

                                 JIM
                        Which one?

                                 CHERYL
                        It’s no wonder you can’t stay 
                        awake.

                                 JIM
                        I’m awake.  I’m awake.

           Long pause.

                                 CHERYL
                        You spoken to mom lately?

                                 JIM
                        Not really. (beat) Is she, ahhhh, 
                        is she seeing anyone?

                                 CHERYL
                        What does that matter?  You’ve 
                        been on dates.

                                 JIM
                        No I haven’t.

                                 CHERYL
                        Yes you have.  You can’t be you 
                        and think people wont know about 
                        stuff like that.

                                 JIM
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 CHERYL
                        People write about what sandwich 
                        you buy in the mornings.  You 
                        can’t go to a restaurant and not 
                        have somebody notice when you 
                        don’t take your wife.

                                 JIM
                        Ex-wife.

                                 CHERYL
                        She was upset when she saw that 
                        you know.

                                 JIM
                        How upset?  I didn’t...

                                 CHERYL
                        -- Who was she?

                                 JIM
                        Someone Bernie set me up with. 
                        (beat) I can’t remember her name.  
                        I left before dessert to go watch 
                        Johnny Carson.

           A moment.  They both start laughing.  Suddenly “MOVIN’ 
           RIGHT ALONG” from the MUPPET MOVIE starts playing.

                                                          INTO DREAM :

           JIM does a double take.  KERMIT pops up from the back seat - 
           singing into JIM’S ear.

                                 KERMIT
                              (singing)
                        Movin’ right along in search of 
                        good time and good news / with 
                        good friends you can’t lose.

           Suddenly he turns to the driver... no longer CHERYL but now 
           FOZZIE BEAR.

                              (singing)
                        This could become a habit.

           JIM looks out the window.  Suddenly they’re driving along a 
           strange DREAM SCAPE...

           ...outside - years of JIM’S MEMORIES go passing by in 
           MUPPET FORM.  His first car, his first kiss, his first 
           job...

                                 KERMIT
                              (singing)
                        Opportunity knocked once, let’s 
                        reach out and grab it / Together 
                        we’ll nab it.

                                 FOZZIE
                              (singing)
                        We’ll hitch-hike, bus, or yellow 
                        cab it.

           Suddenly - JIM snaps out of it.

                                                            INTO CAR :

           CHERYL looks at her father - confused.

                                 CHERYL
                        Dad?

                                 JIM
                        Yeah?

                                 CHERYL
                        Something wrong?

           He can hardly keep his eyes open, falling back asleep 
           against the glass.

           EXT. MIDDLE AMERICA, 1990 - DAY

           CHERYL’S CAR continues speeding across the dust road as 
           “MOVIN’ RIGHT ALONG” kicks back into high gear.

           KERMIT and FOZZIE sing to JIM.

                              (singing)
                        Gettin’ there is half the fun, 
                        come share it with me.

                                 KERMIT & FOZZIE
                              (singing)
                        Movin’ right along.

           We cut to JIM sleeping against the window.  He’s imagining 
           all of this.

                                 KERMIT (O.S)
                              (singing)
                        Doog-a-doon, doog-a-doon

                                 FOZZIE (O.S)
                              (singing)
                        We’ll learn to share the load.

           KERMIT and FOZZIE pop up again from the BACK SEAT to finish 
           off the song.

                                 KERMIT & FOZZIE
                              (singing)
                        We don’t need a map to keep this 
                        show on the road!

           They disappear back behind the SEAT.  CHERYL looks again at 
           her father leaning against the window...

           ...his lips twitching.

           She pulls over, rushing out to JIM’S side of the CAR.  

           Opening the door, she gently taps her father awake.

                                 CHERYL
                        Dad?  What’s going on?

           He takes a moment to open his eyes.

                                 JIM
                        Huh?

                                 CHERYL
                        You just passed out all of a 
                        sudden.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JIM
                        No... no... I could hear you.

                                 CHERYL
                        You passed out.

                                 JIM
                        It was the air conditioning.  It 
                        put me to sleep.

           She’s not sure what to do.

                                 CHERYL
                        We’ll be at pa’s in a couple of 
                        hours.  Why don’t you put the 
                        seat back and get a proper rest?

                                 JIM
                        Maybe a little.

           JIM puts the SEAT back and tries to get some more rest.  
           CHERYL drives off down the DUSTY ROAD again.

           INT. HENSON OFFICE, NEW YORK, 1968 - DAY

                The HENSON OFFICE has expanded over the last few years.  
                Twice the space, twice the Muppets, twice the staff.

                The CORE GROUP - JIM, JERRY, DON and FRANK are standing 
                around a TV with the rest of the office.  Something’s 
                happened.

           JIM and the GANG are speechless.  Behind them, a GIANT WALL

                        It’s a zoo out there.

           INT. HENSON APARTMENT, NEW YORK, 1968 - NIGHT

           JIM is sitting on the lounge.  He’s been watching reports 
           on Luther’s assassination all afternoon.

           LISA HENSON, now 8, sits with him, while CHERYL HENSON, now 
           6, is asleep on a RUG.  BRIAN HENSON, 5, plays with a TOY 
           TRAIN SET by the window.

           They’ve also had another child over the years - JOHN HENSON 
           - 3.  He’s sitting in a HIGH CHAIR trying to eat some APPLE 
           SAUCE.

           JANE walks in with an APRON on.  She looks out of place in 
           domesticated garments.

                                 JANE
                        Jim.  Turn it off.  The kids 
                        don’t need to see this.

                                 JIM
                        How can we live in a world where 
                        something like this can happen?  
                        They got the president... they 
                        got Luther... I don’t believe it.

                                 LISA
                        Who was got Daddy?

                        Important men. (beat)  Very 
                        important men.

           Suddenly A COMMERCIAL for APPLE JACK’S BREAKFAST CEREAL 
           comes on. The HENSON KIDS spring to life.  They rush and 
           huddle around the GLOWING BOX.

           Overjoyed, they sing along.

                                 APPLE JACKS AD (V.O)
                        A is for Apple!  J is for Jacks!  
                        Cinnamon toasty Apple Jacks!

           JIM watches as his KIDS lose interest as soon as the 
           COMMERCIAL finishes.

           INT. LECTURE HALL, BOSTON, 1968 - DAY

           JOAN COONEY, 39, a vibrant, well educated and wealthy woman 
           of class, treads a LECTURE STAGE.

           The AUDITORIUM is full of SCHOLARS and LEFT OF CENTRE 
           ARTISTS.  This is a consortium on CHILDREN’S TELEVISION.

           JIM sits among them.

                                 JOAN
                        The main directive at the 
                        Children’s Television Workshop is 
                        to encourage new ways of reaching 
                        out to underprivileged inner-
                        city, youngsters.  The basic 
                        premise is to create a show that 
                        capitalize’s on children’s love 
                        of the slick editing and jingles 
                        found in commercials, and put 
                        them to non-corporate use.  Why 
                        not use these same techniques 
                        that work so well selling 
                        breakfast cereal to children to 
                        also help them to learn?

           JOAN smiles out to the silent audience - undeterred.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Let me play a clip from the Ed 
                        Sullivan Show used in English 
                        classes around the country to 
                        explain the concept of word 
                        associations to pre-schoolers.

           JOAN stands back as a CLIP projects onto the wall.

                        I say it’s true!  You can do it 
                        too!

           A NUMBER 2 appears above GRUMP’S head.

                                 PROFESSOR KERMIT
                        Hmmm uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah.  See - 
                        I dig it.

           A SPADE appears above KERMIT’S HEAD and starts digging.

           JIM is intrigued.

           INT. HENSON OFFICE, NEW YORK, 1968 - DAY

                The HENSON TEAM are sitting around a circle staring at a 
                MOCKUP CYCLIA TENT.

                The product of a PSYCHEDELIC time - CYCLIA is Jim’s concept 
                for a discotheque - a cloth dome made of WHITE FABRIC that 
                would have various “trippy” images projected onto it.

                FRANK OZ hits a button on a small slide projector.  The 
                TEAM watches in awe as the small MOCK-UP comes to life like 
                a living KALEIDOSCOPE.

                                 FRANK
                        This is that new footage you shot 
                        for Cyclia last weekend.  I think 
                        it works well - yeah?

                                 DON
                        It’s good.  But maybe we do 
                        another with blue and green as a 
                        variation.

                                 JIM
                        Hmmmmm.

           FRANK looks to JERRY.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        I feel like we’ve wasted three 
                        years with this thing, you know.

                        I just... I dunno.  

           JIM walks over to the MUPPET STORAGE WALL.  The TEAM watch - 
           concerned.

                                 JERRY
                        Jim.  If you’re gonna jump, just 
                        leave the Thunderbird to me - 
                        okay? 

                                 JIM
                        You know what we need?

           He puts the COOKIE MONSTER puppet on his ARM - a BLUE, 
           FURRY MONSTER with an insatiable appetite for anything he 
           can fit in his mouth.

           He walks over to CYCLIA and before the room knows what’s 
           happening...

           ...COOKIE MONSTER starts devouring the MOCK-UP into pieces.

                        A little more fun again.

           INT. OSCAR’S TAVERN, MANHATTAN, 1969 - DAY

           A decrepit TAVERN on the upper-east side.  Even the RATS 
           feel dirty here.  JIM, FRANK, DON and JERRY are the only 
           patrons they’ve had this week.

           The TABLE is filled with DRAWINGS and SCRIPTS for SESAME 
           STREET - two empty bottles of SCOTCH resting among the 
           debris.

                                 JIM
                        What do you make of this?

           JIM holds up a doodle he’s been working on over a few 
           drinks.  It shows a LARGE YELLOW BIRD, etched with the 
           figure of a MAN inside - detailing how this GIANT MUPPET 
           might work.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Like a kid friendly La Choy.

                                 JERRY
                        What is it?

                                 JIM
                        It’s a chicken.  I dunno.  He’ll 
                        come to life once we build him.

                        We just gotta make sure he looks 
                        pre-school friendly.

                                 JERRY
                        That’s gonna be one really big 
                        bird Jim.

                                 DON
                              (calls to kitchen)
                        Hey... we get out an order here?

           The waiter, PETE OSCARSON, 37, a grouchy New York type, 
           grumbles over to them. 

                                 PETE
                        Yeah?

                                 FRANK
                        What’s the special today?

                                 PETE
                        There’s no specials.

                                 FRANK
                        I thought the board said ask 
                        about our specials.

                                 PETE
                        Sure.  Today it’s my hand up your 
                        ass.  No specials - okay?

           The GROUP stare at him.  They try not to laugh.

                                 FRANK
                        I’ll just get a burger then.

                                 PETE
                        No burgers.  We’re only doing bar 
                        food.

           JERRY starts chortling.  JIM’S trying to stay composed.

                                 FRANK
                        What’s the bar food?

                                 PETE
                        Fries or onion rings.  That’s it.  
                        When you’re the only guys in here 
                        all week - what do ya want me to 
                        do huh? Stock out the kitchen for 
                        just you?  Send your friends in 
                        here - then we’ll do specials.

                                 FRANK
                        I’ll, ahhh, take fries then.

                        They’ll be about forty minutes.  
                        I gotta start the fryer up.

           PETE grumbles off.  They roll over laughing as he leaves.

                        What was that?

           INT. KAUFMAN STUDIOS, CTW, NEW YORK, 1969 - DAY

           SESAME STREET PRE-PRODUCTION.  A VINTAGE STUDIO in the 
           middle of QUEENS has been transformed into a GIANT NEW YORK 
           STREET.

           A PRODUCTION MEETING is underway - with JOAN COONEY, JON 
           STONE, 38, (a bearded, gentle man; head writer and producer 
           of the show) and SAM GIBBON, 35, a typically New York 
           looking film producer.

           FRANK OZ and DON SAHLIN sit to the side with a TABLE OF 
           MUPPETS to present.

           JIM HENSON passes a sketch across the table for JOAN to 
           look at.

           It his BIG BIRD sketch.

                                 JIM
                        Okay... this is our Big Bird.  
                        Basically a loving but stubborn 
                        perineal six year old.  Like we 
                        talked about...

                                 DON
                        Or... Jim as a six year old with 
                        feathers.

                                 JIM
                        Yeah, but smarter. (beat) Okay... 
                        Carol? (beat) Please meet - Big 
                        Bird - our hero of the show.

           CAROL SPINNEY, 36, a tall grey bearded man, walks in 
           performing BIG BIRD.

                                 BIG BIRD
                        Hello Joan and everyone here.  
                        (beat) Wow!  What a big place 
                        this is!  I’ve never been 
                        somewhere this big before!

                        that... is that trash I smell?

           The GROUP laughs.

                                 JON
                        Okay... our Brooklyn aint that 
                        authentic.

                                 BIG BIRD
                        Oh... well you can’t win them 
                        all.  I forgive you.

                                 JON
                              (amazed)
                        That’s a bird... talking to me.

                                 SAM
                        Jimmy - you’re telling me there’s 
                        actually a guy in that thing?

                                 JIM
                        It’s a full body puppet like the 
                        La Choy Dragon.

           JIM walks over and reveals the HEAD FLAP on BIG BIRD’S 
           CHEST.  CAROLL’S FACE pokes through.

                                 CAROLL
                        Hi.  How you doing?  Caroll.

                                 JIM
                        We met Caroll at a convention in 
                        Salt Lake city last month. (beat) 
                        I think, you know, if we do this 
                        the way we’re thinking, we’re 
                        gonna need a few more puppeteers 
                        to come aboard.  More ideas than 
                        hands at the moment. 

                                 DON
                        Tell me about it.

           JOAN’S eyes widen.  She can’t believe it.

                                 JOAN
                        Jim... it’s magic.  Pure magic.

           INT. BACKDROP, KAUFAMAN STUDIOS, NEW YORK, 1969 - DAY

           Still in planning for SESAME STREET, we see BERT and ERNIE 
           (performed by FRANK OZ and JIM HENSON) up against a FENCE.

           JOAN, SAM, JON, DON and CAROLL are rolling over themselves 
           with laughter.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           BERT is an uptight, vertical Muppet, while ERNIE is the 
           complete opposite, being shaped FLAT and HORIZONTAL.

                                 ERNIE
                        Bert, you wanna play a game with 
                        me?

                                 BERT
                        Oh no Ernie.

                                 ERNIE
                        Just repeat after me. (beat) I 
                        one the sandbox.  I two the 
                        sandbox.  I three the sandbox.

                                 BERT
                        Errrr... 

                                 ERNIE
                        ...just keep it going.

                                 BERT
                        I four the sandbox?

                                 ERNIE
                        I FIVE the sandbox!

                                 BERT
                        I SIX the sandbox!

                                 ERNIE
                        I SEVEN the SANDBOX!

                                 BERT
                        I EIGHT THE SANDBOX!

                                 ERNIE
                        Wait.  You ate the sandbox?

                A long pause.  BERT realizes.

                                 ERNIE (CONT’D)
                        How’d it taste Bert?

                                 BERT
                        Awwww no.

           ERNIE laughs.  The GROUP claps.  JIM stands up, putting the 
           ERNIE PUPPET down.

                                 JIM
                        They’ll be a sort of Laurel and 
                        Hardy - but for kids, you know. 
                        (beat) You like them?

                                 JOAN
                        Jim... this thing is going to be 
                        incredible.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           He smiles.

                                 JIM
                        We’ve got more.

           INT. HENSON OFFICE, NEW YORK, 1969 - DAY

                SESAME STREET production is in full swing.  DON is working 
                with another puppet builder now to get the job done - 
                CAROLY WILCOX, 26, a woman of short stature and strong 
                heart.

                JERRY NELSON, 35, an orange haired man who resembles an old 
                west prospector in hippy clothes, works with FRANK OZ - 
                testing out several of the new MUPPETS.

                At the moment, they’re practicing on GROVER - a dweeby BLUE 
                MONSTER - and THE COUNT - a DRACULA inspired-character 
                obsessed with numbers instead of BLOOD.

                                 COUNT
                        Let me count your fingers - ah ha 
                        ha.

                                 GROVER
                        Aaahhhh!  Keep away from me you 
                        freak!

           LISA HENSON watches them with her younger sister CHERYL. 
           They can’t stop laughing.

                                 COUNT
                        Let me count your teeth!!! Ah ha 
                        ha ha!  Vun!!! Two!!! Tree!!!

                                 GROVER
                        Get him off me!  Please girls!  
                        Please!

           JIM HENSON walks past with JANE.  She nurses a BABY BUMP 
           again.  JOHN HENSON, 4, walks around behind her, a little 
           frightened of all the MONSTERS in the room.

                                 JIM
                        We’re gonna need a bigger space.

                                 JANE
                        How many more do you have to 
                        make?

                                 JIM
                        We’re taking characters from Sam 
                        and Friends and Jimmy Dean - but 
                        we’ll still need another fifteen, 
                        twenty or so to make Sesame 
                        Street work. (beat) I’d get you 
                        and the kids in on it if I could.

                        We’ll need every puppeteer I can 
                        find in bay area.

           DON pipes up across the room.

                                 DON
                        Hey... you coming back to this

                        No, no, no.  I’m done with you 
                        boys and your toys.  Thank you.

           JIM notices his son JOHN hiding behind his mom’s LEG.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Johnny?  What’s the matter buddy?

                                 JOHN
                              (quiet and shy)
                        Da monsters.

           JIM isn’t sure what to do.  FRANK notices, GROVER still 
           perched on his arm.

           He rushes over to JIM and crouches down to JOHN, making it 
           appear as if GROVER was hiding on JIM’S LANKY LEGS the way 
           he is.

                                 GROVER
                              (frightened)
                        Wah, wah, wah what did he say?

                                 JIM
                        I think Johnny said he saw some 
                        monsters.

                                 GROVER
                        AAARGH!  MONSTERS!?!  WHERE?

           JOHN can’t help himself.  He chuckles.

                                 GROVER (CONT’D)
                        Where are the monsters?  I don’t 
                        want to see a monster!!  You’ve 
                        got to save me Johnny!

                                 JOHN
                        No - you’re a monster!

                                 GROVER
                        WAH?!?  Me??  A monster?  You 
                        must be joking.

                                 GROVER (CONT'D)
                        I’m not a monster!  I’m a little 
                        boy like you!

           JOHN keeps laughing.

                                 JOHN
                        No... you’re a monster!

                                 GROVER
                        No... I think YOU are the monster 
                        now!

                                 JOHN
                        Hahaha - nooooo.

                                 GROVER
                        You are not?

                                 JOHN
                              (howling with laughter)
                        You’re the monster!

                                 GROVER
                        Monster?  Where?!?  AARRRGH!

           FRANK pulls GROVER away - making him appear to run across 
           the room.   JOHN hasn’t even realized... he’s stepped away 
           from JANE’S leg.

           JANE looks at JIM and smiles.

                                 JANE
                        What happened to all the “adult” 
                        projects?

                                 JIM
                              (smug)
                        I found a more appreciative 
                        audience.

           JANE rolls her eyes.  She looks around the room.

                                 JANE
                        Where’s Brian?  (beat) Brian?

                                 DON
                        He’s found Oscar.

           They all turn and look.  BRIAN HENSON, 7, is talking to a 
           GREEN MUPPET in the trash can - OSCAR THE GROUCH.  CAROLL 
           SPINNEY is lying on the floor performing him.

                                 OSCAR
                        Hey kid!  We aint got no specials 
                        today.

                                 BRIAN
                        What?

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           JERRY smiles at JANE.

                                 JERRY
                        This is that guy from the 
                        tavern... toned down.

                                 JANE
                        Wow...

                                 OSCAR
                        Kiddo... this is my trash zone!  
                        Get out of it!

                                 BRIAN
                              (cheeky)
                        No!

                                 OSCAR
                        Hey!  Who belongs to this brat?  
                        His dad’s gotta be a real piece 
                        of work!

                                 JIM
                        Caroll - you’re enjoying that one 
                        far too much.

                                 OSCAR
                        Who’s Caroll??... Bozo!

           JANE wells up.  Without meaning to, she bursts into tears 
           in front of everyone.

                                 JANE
                        I’m sorry.  Sorry.

           JANE rushes out.  JIM, not knowing what’s happening, 
           follows her.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET, 1969 - DAY

           JANE, tears streaming, hurries away from the HENSON OFFICE.

           JIM chases her.

                                 JIM
                        Jane?  What’s going on?

                                 JANE
                        Jim...

                                 JIM
                        What are you doing?

                                 JANE
                        Go watch the kids.  I need some 
                        air for a while.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JIM
                        Just slow down.  Jane?

           JANE keeps pushing through the CROWD.  JIM grabs her - 
           turning her to face him.

                                 JANE
                        Don’t... --

                                 JIM
                        -- What’s going on?

           She turns away - unable to look him in the eyes.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Are you mad at me for something?

                                 JANE
                        I’m not mad...

                                 JIM
                        If you can’t talk to me - what 
                        hope have we got?

           JANE clutches the cuffs of his SHIRT.

                                 JANE
                        You’re going to leave us.  Me and 
                        the kids.  It’s something that 
                        happens.  It’s the way my life 
                        works.

                                 JIM
                        Don’t say that.

                                 JANE
                        I can’t... I can’t measure up to 
                        you... and you’ll go.  I know... 
                        you’ll see it.  Maybe not 
                        tomorrow, but soon, you’ll 
                        realize there’s better out 
                        there... and then these brief 
                        moments I’ve had in your charmed 
                        life will have passed me by 
                        before I even had a chance to 
                        prove to you...  I have it in me 
                        too.

                                 JIM
                        Jane... that’s not true.

           JANE turns and walks away.  She can’t bring herself to keep 
           it up.  JIM watches her disappear into the CROWD.

           INT. HENSON OFFICE, NEW YORK, 1969 - DAY

                JIM walks back into the OFFICE.  All EYES are on him - no 
                one wants to be the first to ask.

                He jumps in for them.

                                 JIM
                        I think, ahhh, she needed some 
                        air.  You know?

           He dawdles back over to the KIDS.

           INT. HENSON APARTMENT, NEW YORK, 1968 - NIGHT

           BRIAN, CHERYL, LISA and JOHN are sitting around a small 
           wooden table as JIM dishes out CHINESE TAKE-AWAY onto their 
           plates.

           All eyes turn to the FRONT DOOR...

           ...as a PREGNANT JANE creeps back in.

           No one says anything.  The KIDS remain quiet.  JANE heads 
           straight for the bedroom.

           INT. BEDROOM, HENSON APARTMENT, NEW YORK, 1968 - NIGHT

           JIM opens the door.  JANE is sitting on the bed, taking her 
           shoes off slowly

           He holds out a BOX OF CHINESE FOOD for her.

                                 JIM
                        We got you chicken noodle - if 
                        you wanted.

                                 JANE
                        I’ve already eaten.

                                 JIM
                        What you have?

                                 JANE
                        I had a pretzel from the street 
                        corner.

                                 JIM
                        Oh...

           JANE stares at the floor.  She can’t look at him.

                                 JANE
                        Your show is going to be amazing 
                        Jimmy.  It really is. (to tears 
                          again) I’m so sorry.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           JIM joins her on the bed.

                                 JIM
                        You know... since Paul died... I 
                        feel like all I’ve been doing is 
                        chasing the time I’ve lost.  I 
                        want my life to be everything it 
                        can be... And you’re the most 
                        important part of that.  You’re 
                        the only part... that matters.

           Still unable to look him in the eyes - JANE rests her head 
           on his shoulders - melting.

           INT. EDIT SUITE, NEW YORK, 1970 - EVENING

           We see a TELEVISION MONITOR on a LINEAR EDIT DESK.  It 
           displays the SESAME STREET opening from 1970.

                                                               ON TV :

           A bunch of New York inner city kids run around SESAME 
           STREET.

                                 KIDS
                              (singing)
                        Sunny day / Sweepin’ the clouds 
                        away / On my way to where the air 
                        is sweet / Can you tell me how to 
                        get / How to get to Sesame Street

           The KIDS are suddenly interacting with the SESAME STREET 
           Muppets - BIG BIRD, BERT, ERNIE, OSCAR THE GROUCH, GROVER, 
           COOKIE MONSTER and THE COUNT.

                                 KIDS (CONT’D)
                              (singing)
                        Come and play / Everything’s A-
                        okay / Friendly neighbors there / 
                        That’s where we meet / Can you 
                        tell me how to get / How to get 
                        to Sesame Street... / How to get 
                        to Sesame Street... / How to...

           The SONG fades out to the first SEGMENT for the show.  BERT 
           addressing a gathering of MUPPETS at a PODIUM.

                                                               OFF TV:

           JIM HENSON and the EDITOR turn the VOLUME DOWN.

                                 JIM
                        Alright.  Lock it in.

                                 EDITOR
                        I’ll cross that off with 
                        compliments.

           There’s a KNOCK on the SUITE door.

                                 JOAN (O.S)
                        Knock knock.

           JOAN COONEY, the executive producer, walks in with a copy 
           of VARIETY and an ENVELOPE.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey Jim - you got a minute?

           INT. KAUFMAN STUDIOS, CTW, NEW YORK, 1970 - EVENING

           JOAN and JIM walk out into the WINGS of the SESAME STREET 
           SET.  We see the busy CREW wrapping another day of 
           shooting.

           MR SNUFFLEUPAGUS, a giant MUPPET wholly mammoth, is being 
           hoisted into the ceiling with a PINK TARP draped over it.

                                 JOAN
                        We just sold Mexico and Canada.

                                 JIM
                        Oh Joan.  That’s fantastic.  
                        Congratulations.

                                 JOAN
                        And... the best part... drum 
                        roll... I just got off the phone 
                        to Ed... we got four Emmy noms.

                                 JIM
                        You’re joking me!  I can’t 
                        believe that!

           JOAN holds up the VARIETY page with Emmy nominations.  
           She’s already high-lighted the SESAME STREET ones.

                                 JOAN
                        Number one children’s show 
                        thirteen weeks and counting.  
                        That has never happened before in 
                        the history of television.  You 
                        think we’re not gonna win those 
                        little gold statues?

           JIM seems non-fussed.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Do you ever smile?

                                 JIM
                        Ohhh... I told Jane I’d be back 
                        an hour ago.

                        Trouble with the tape system?

                                 JIM
                        We were just messing around with 
                        a few of the animations.  It’s my 
                        fault.  Episode is locked now.

                                 JOAN
                        Good!  I can’t wait to see this 
                        one.

           JOAN stuffs an ENVELOPE in his pocket.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t work too hard Jimmy.  We 
                        need you at your best right now.

           JOAN walks off.  JIM takes a look inside the envelope.

           It’s a cheque - made out to “THE HENSON COMPANY PTY LTD” 
           for $564,352.

           JIM, shocked, doesn’t notice KERMIT creeping up behind him.

                                 KERMIT
                              (singing)
                        It’s not easy bein’ green / 
                        Having to spend each day the 
                        color of the leaves.

           JIM looks around at the busy SESAME STREET set.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                              (singing)
                        When I think it could be nicer 
                        being red, or yellow, or gold / 
                        Or something much more colorful 
                        like that.

           JIM and KERMIT look at each other - understanding.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET, 1970 - NIGHT

           JIM and KERMIT make their way home along the SNOWY STREETS 
           of NEW YORK.

           They stare at a giant ADVERTISEMENT ACROSS TIMES SQUARE for 
           “SESAME STREET”.  It features all the MUPPET CHARACTERS 
           waving to the frozen CROWDS.

                                 KERMIT
                              (singing)
                        It’s not easy bein’ green / It 
                        seems you blend in with so many 
                        other ordinary things.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           JIM sees a YOUNG MOTHER pushing her BABY in a PRAM.  The 
           PRAM is decorated with SESAME STREET patterns - a little 
           BIG BIRD toy trying to peer out.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                              (singing)
                        And people tend to pass you over 
                        ‘cause you’re / Not standing out 
                        like flashy sparkles in the 
                        water.

           JIM and KERMIT look up to the SKY.  They’re unrecognizable 
           in this big city.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                              (singing)
                        Or stars in the sky.

           INT. ELEVATOR, HENSON APARTMENT, 1970 - NIGHT

           JIM and KERMIT lumber into the ELEVATOR of their APARTMENT 
           BUILDING.  He’s exhausted.

                                 KERMIT
                              (singing)
                        But green’s the color of spring / 
                        And green can be cool and 
                        friendly-like.

           They get out and bumble down the hallway.  JIM waves at his 
           NEIGHBOR as they pass in the hall.

           INT. HENSON APARTMENT, NEW YORK, 1970 - NIGHT

           JIM and KERMIT through the front door, about to collapse.  
           There’s no one around.  

           Concerned, they go looking.

                                 KERMIT
                              (singing)
                        And green can be big like an 
                        mountain / Or important like a 
                        river / Or tall like a tree.

           JIM sees a NOTE on the fridge.  He reads it - his face 
           dropping.

           INT. HENSON APARTMENT, NEW YORK, 1970 - MORNING

           JIM and KERMIT haven’t slept.  They’re sitting on the 
           lounge staring at the LARGE CHEQUE resting on the coffee 
           table...

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           ...wedged between a MACY’S brochure for SESAME STREET 
           MERCHANDISE...

           ...and a newspaper clipping from the ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
           ASSASSINATION of MARTIN LUTHER KING.

                                 KERMIT
                              (singing)
                        When green is all there is to be 
                        / It could make you wonder why / 
                        But why wonder / Why wonder...

           They look up to the TELEVISION.  SESAME STREET is playing.  
           JIM gets up from the LOUNGE and walks to the window...

           ...across the STREET he can see FIVE or SIX KIDS in 
           different APARTMENTS watching SESAME STREET on their TV’S 
           right this very moment...

           ...the smiles on their faces saying it all.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                              (singing)
                        I am green and it’ll do fine / 
                        It’s beautiful / And I think it’s 
                        what I want to be.

           JIM turns to the sound of the FRONT DOOR opening.  JANE 
           walks in with the KIDS.  She puts a SUITCASE back down on 
           the ground.

           INT. FARM, AHOSKIE, NORTH CAROLINA, 1990 - DAY

           YEARS LATER.  A familiar face leans in through the 
           PASSENGER WINDOW at JIM HENSON, still dozing in his seat.

           It’s BETTY HENSON, his mother, 76, old and grey now, but 
           still full of life.

                                 BETTY
                        Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.  You’re home 
                        my darlin’.

           JIM opens his eyes.  His mother smiles down at him.

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna miss lunch if you 
                        don’t get up.  We let you sleep 
                        as long as we could.

                                 JIM
                        What, ahhh, what time is it?

                                 BETTY
                        It’s time to cut the turkey.

           INT. DINING TABLE, HENSON FARM, AHOSIKE, NC, 1990 - DAY

           JIM sits around a table with his mother and father, PAUL, 
           80, and BETTY.  CHERYL, his daughter, brings in a BASKET OF 
           HOT CORN BREAD.

                                 PAUL SNR
                        You falling asleep like that 
                        Jimmy - oughta not have so many 
                        late nights, wouldn’t ya think?

                                 JIM
                        I’m just, ahhh, just battling a 
                        flu at the moment.

                                 PAUL SNR
                        You been gettin’ to church?

                                 JIM
                        Dad --

                                 CHERYL
                        -- Grandma, I keep telling him to 
                        go see a doctor.  Can you please 
                        tell him he needs to see a 
                        doctor?

                                 PAUL SNR
                        Jim doesn’t need a doctor.  
                        There’s no reason to bother a 
                        professional with something like 
                        a flu.  I can tell you what’s 
                        wrong - Jim needs to sort himself 
                        out.  He needs to get back to 
                        church.  Even just the once Jim.  
                        You’re receiving a message here.

                                 JIM
                        Dad... there’s no message.  I’m 
                        just run down.

                                 PAUL SNR
                        Hector James, three farms up, 
                        woke himself with a locked back 
                        not so long ago - claimed it was 
                        from fruit picking.  Went to 
                        church the next week and all was 
                        well on the Monday.  God will 
                        look after you if you look after 
                        him.

                                 JIM
                        I fell asleep in the car - that’s 
                        all.  I’m not coughing up blood.  
                        Please, everyone... just drop it.

                                 PAUL SNR
                        I’m only saying Jimmy --

                                 JIM
                        -- I got it dad.  I got it.

           BETTY watches her son - concerned.  She passes him some 
           CORN BREAD.

           EXT. FARM, AHOSKIE, NORTH CAROLINA, 1990 - AFTERNOON

           JIM, perked up, plays a ROUSING game of CROQUET with the 
           HENSON FAMILY...

           ...the other BROTHER and SISTERS having now arrived.

           EXT. PORCH, AHOSKIE, NORTH CAROLINA, 1990 - DUSK

           JIM sits on the porch - stuck between two older renovations 
           to the HENSON FARMHOUSE.  It’s Jim’s secret porch.

           PAUL HENSON stumbles out and sits with him.  They watch the 
           ORANGE SUN setting across the CAROLINA HORIZON in silence.

                                 PAUL SNR
                        Your mother thinks you’re 
                        depressed.

                                 JIM
                        I’m not depressed.

                                 PAUL SNR
                        Well, I’m looking at ya Jimmy - 
                        and for a man who has achieved 
                        what you have - had the life 
                        you’ve lived... you don’t look so 
                        happy about it.

                                 JIM
                        Of course I’m happy.

                                 PAUL SNR
                        Son... you need to get back with 
                        Jane.  Put that right.

                                 JIM
                        She’s not my wife anymore.

           PAUL thinks on this a while.

                                 PAUL SNR
                        I don’t know who you think you’re 
                        foolin’.

           PAUL slaps him on the knee - his fatherly duties finished.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 PAUL SNR (O.S) (CONT’D)
                        You oughtta put things right with 
                        that woman soon as you can.  
                        While you can Jimmy.

           JIM continues to stare.  He sees a LANDSTRIDER from the 
           DARK CRYSTAL slowly move across the horizon in silhouette.

           INT. SNL, NBC STUDIOS, NEW YORK, 1975 - NIGHT

           October 1975.  The first season of SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.  
           Strange MUPPET type creatures are performing in front of a 
           bubbling tarpit - part of a fictional land called “GORCH”.

           A live audience watches as the show goes down.

           KING PLOOBIS, a giant pompous LIZARD is being performed by 
           JIM HENSON, 40, while QUEEN PEUTA is being performed by 
           ALICE TWEEDY, 35, a timid blonde woman of short stature.

                                 PEUTA
                        Ploobis!  Ploobis!  Do you know 
                        what your son Wisss is doing?

                                 PLOOBIS
                        What?  Has he locked himself in 
                        the bathroom with a magazine 
                        again?

                                 PEUTA
                        No!  Your son Wisss is smoking... 
                        craters!

                                 PLOOBIS
                        No!

                                 PEUTA
                        Yes!

                                 PLOOBIS
                        Not my son.  Why, my son is a... 
                        he’s a...

                                 PEUTA
                        A crater head!

                                 PLOOBIS
                        A crater head!

           The AUDIENCE seems restless.  No one is laughing.

           BACKSTAGE.  LORNE MICHAELS, 31, the young hotshot brains 
           behind the show, is watching the LAND OF GORCH sketch from 
           the wings.

           He whispers into a headpiece.

                                 LORNE
                        That’s three for three.  Not too 
                        late to pull in laugh tracks huh?

           CONTROL ROOM.  The TECHNICIANS are watching the LIVE CAMERA 
           feeds of the SKETCH.  Some of the banks of monitors show 
           unimpressed AUDIENCE MEMBERS.  A DIRECTOR barks down the 
           headpiece.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        I’ve got some unhappy people out 
                        there Lorne.  This stuff isn’t 
                        funny.  Someone should tell this 
                        guy to stick to pre-schoolers.

           BACKSTAGE.  LORNE receives the message from the room.  He 
           looks across to the head writer for the show MICHAEL 
           O’DONOGHUE, 35, a hard looking comedian type.

                                 LORNE
                        What the hell is this?

                                 O’DONOGHUE
                        I don’t write felt Lorne.  Don’t 
                        look at me.

           BACK ON STAGE.  The SKETCH comes to a close.  The AUDIENCE 
           is dead quiet as JIM HENSON and ALICE TWEEDY rush off 
           stage.

           A PROMPTER starts the clap, avoiding any embarrassment.

                                 PROMPTER
                        Ladies and gentlemen - Saturday 
                        Night Live is back in five... 
                        four... three... two... ONE!

           CHEVY CHASE, 32, a tall handsome regular on the show, 
           bounds out to THUNDEROUS applause.  

                                 CHEVY CHASE
                        In America today, certain 
                        oppressed minorities... are 
                        treated like second class 
                        citizens.  All because of a 
                        harmless little affliction.  I 
                        refer to saliva displacement 
                        difficulties, or, as we are 
                        sometimes called, “droolers”.

           CHEVY trickles DROOL down his CHIN.  The AUDIENCE erupts 
           into HYSTERICS.

           BACKSTAGE.  JIM HENSON, FRANK OZ, 31, and ALICE TWEEDY 
           stand with their GORCH MUPPETS.  They all watch the CHEVY 
           CHASE sketch, a little disappointed.  The AUDIENCE is 
           actually responding to this one.

                        It’s probably just an off night 
                        Jim.  Don’t worry about it.

                                 JIM
                              (not convinced)
                        Yeah.

           INT. UPMARKET RESTAURANT, NEW YORK, 1975 - NIGHT

           POSH restaurant near NBC.  JIM HENSON and FRANK OZ are 
           sitting with BERNIE BRILLSTEIN, 44, a powerful, well 
           dressed man with a typical New York agency attitude.

                                 BERNIE
                        So the show didn’t go so well, 
                        eh, the show didn’t go so well.  
                        There’s always next week.  Flash 
                        ‘em the last five years of Emmys 
                        from S. Street - then we’ll see 
                        who is smarter.

                                 JIM
                        Lorne’s gonna drop the segment.  
                        It’s three for three tonight.  
                        He’ll be backed in a corner.

                                 BERNIE
                        Saturday Night Live loves the 
                        Muppets.  That’s a fact.  I’m 
                        your agent.  I know the things 
                        you don’t.  NBC wouldn’t let you 
                        go.

                                 FRANK
                        We should be writing our own 
                        material.  We know how these 
                        segments can work - but we’re 
                        given these pieces... we can’t 
                        make that funny.

                                 BERNIE
                        You’re right.  You should be on 
                        your own show.  And I’m working 
                        on that.  We’re close.  We’re 
                        real close.

           JIM buries his head in his PLATE.

                                 JIM
                        I don’t - I don’t want to be 
                        pigeonholed as a children’s 
                        entertainer Bernie.  I wanna move 
                        into something everyone can 
                        enjoy.  That’s where I started.  
                        That was the plan, you know.

           INT. EXPENSIVE HENSON APARTMENT, NEW YORK, 1975 - MORNING

           The HENSON APARTMENT has been upgraded, courtesy of the 
           GIANT WEALTH Jim has accumulated over the last few years of 
           SESAME STREET.

           No longer filled with hippie style relics from the 60’s - 
           the place seems a shrine to all things MUPPETS - SESAME 
           STREET merchandise proudly on display round every corner...

           ...including a MOCK-UP BIG BIRD head on the wall and a 
           STAINED GLASS WINDOW of BERT and ERNIE.

                                                               ON TV :

           The OPENING of the SONNY AND CHER COMEDY HOUR.  CHER, a 
           tall attractive young woman, verbally spars with her 
           husband SONNY, a much older southern-Italian man.

                                 SONNY
                        Cher, c’mon, stop it.  My friends 
                        are out there watching the show.

                                 CHER
                        Hi Dopey.  Hi Doc.

                                                              OFF TV :

           JIM watches with his children - LISA, 15, CHERYL, 13, 
           BRIAN, 12 and JOHN, 10.

           JANE HENSON, 41, sits with HEATHER, 5, on the other side of 
           the room, knitting.

           They’re one big happy family - at least on the surface.

                                                               ON TV :

           We see an EGYPTIAN SKIT from SONNY AND CHER.  CHER is 
           dressed as QUEEN CLEOPATRA, lying across a SOFA.

                                 CHER (CONT’D)
                        Another Cairo night - and here I 
                        am alone.  Cleopatra - the 
                        greatest woman in all of Egypt - 
                        without a date... or even a 
                        knight.

           SONNY walks in dressed as a MARC ANTONY.

           The AUDIENCE erupts into HYSTERICS.

                                                              OFF TV :

           JIM looks around.  His KIDS are laughing.  Even JANE gets a 
           small giggle out.

                                                               ON TV :

           SONNY and CHER sing “BABY DON’T GO” together.

                                                              OFF TV :

           HEATHER has jumped off her mothers lap and has started 
           dancing around the room.

           The HENSON FAMILY just laughs.

                                 LISA
                        Dad... can we get the puppets?

                                 JIM

                        Jane?  What do you think?

                        Oh yeah!  Please!  Please!

           JANE just shrugs.

                                 JANE
                        You all finished your homework?

           The KIDS nod in unison - excited.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        John... you’ve finished too?

           INT. KITCHEN, NEW HENSON APARTMENT, NEW YORK, 1975 - NIGHT

           BRIAN HENSON takes a SONNY AND CHER VINYL and carefully 
           places it on the PLAYER.  The KIDS all gather around the 
           KITCHEN BENCH.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           A verbal banter starts.  We suddenly see KERMIT THE FROG 
           (now with frilly neck and webbed feet from Sesame Street) 
           jump up by the stove - performed by JIM.

           Another puppet - a strange female pig - HOGGY - 
           (recognizable as an early MISS PIGGY) pops up next to 
           KERMIT - being performed by JANE.  HOGGY has the trade mark 
           BLONDE WIG that would become the staple of MISS PIGGY in 
           time to come.

           The MUPPETS mouth the words of the SONNY & CHER VINYL.

                                 KERMIT
                              (mouthing)
                        Cher, c’mon, stop it.  My friends 
                        are out there watching the show.

                                 HOGGY
                              (mouthing)
                        Hi Dopey.  Hi Doc.

                                 KERMIT
                              (mouthing)
                        What’s with you tonight?  Just 
                        take it easy will you please?  
                        What if you were sitting out 
                        there and watching us, you know, 
                        right now.  Be honest, what would 
                        you say?

                                 HOGGY
                              (mouthing)
                        I’d say the same thing everybody 
                        else says.  What does she see in 
                        that man?

           HOGGY pretends to KARATE CHOP KERMIT.  The KIDS bowl over 
           laughing.  Everyone except LISA and JOHN, who stand in the 
           DOORWAY rolling their eyes.

                                 LISA
                        I don’t get it.  You’re both 
                        embarrassing.

                                 JOHN
                        It’s not funny.

                                 JIM
                              (through Kermit)
                        Boo to the peanut gallery whiners 
                        and ON with the show!  Yaaaaaay!

                                 LISA
                        Boo to you Froggy!

                                 JOHN
                        Frog legs!

           There’s more than a little WALDORF and STATLER to them.

           JIM and JANE share a knowing look under the table. “I GOT 
           YOU BABE” starts to play.

           KERMIT and HOGGY mouth along to the record as the HENSON 
           KIDS join in singing.

                                 HOGGY
                              (mouthing)
                        They say we’re young and we don’t 
                        know / We won’t find out until we 
                        grow old.

                                 KERMIT
                              (mouthing)
                        Well I don’t know if all that’s 
                        true / ‘Cause you got me, and 
                        baby I got you.

                                 HOGGY & KERMIT
                              (mouthing)
                        Babe / I got you babe / I got you 
                        babe.

           INT. OFFICE, WALDORF, NEW YORK, 1975 - DAY

           The most extravagant NEW YORK office imaginable.  JIM sits 
           with BERNIE, JERRY JUHL, now 37, FRANK OZ, DON SAHLIN, now 
           47, and RICHARD HUNT, 24, by the receptionist desk.  

           RICHARD is the youngest of the HENSON GROUP, a clean 
           shaven, squeaky clean performer.  JIM nervously pours WATER 
           into a glass.

                                 JIM
                        I’ve been in expensive places 
                        Bernie.  But this takes the cake.  
                        I’m nervous just drinking the 
                        water.

                                 BERNIE
                        Lew Grade is serious money my 
                        friend.  You’re money, don’t get 
                        me wrong.  I’m money.  But this 
                        guy is serious money.  (beat) 
                        Dead serious.

                                 JIM
                              (dry)
                        He sounds perfect for this.

           MISS TRACY, 21, the secretary, coughs at her DESK.

                                 MISS TRACY
                        You can, ahhh, you can see him 
                        now.

           There’s more than a slight air of THE MUPPET MOVIE to the 
           scene.

           The GROUP gets up and nervously walks to the GIANT WOODEN 
           DOORS.

                                 JIM
                        Well guys, this is it.

           The DOOR SWINGS OPEN to a flurry of CHORAL MUSIC.

           INT. LEW GRADES OFFICE, WALDORF, NEW YORK, 1975 - DAY

           JIM, BERNIE, FRANK, DON, RICHARD and JERRY shuffle across 
           the POSH LOOKING OFFICE.  The BACK OF A LEATHER CHAIR faces 
           them - smoking rising from behind.

                                 JIM
                        Ahhh... sir?

           The CHAIR revolves around.  Sitting there is LORD LEW 
           GRADE, 69, a rounded man of great wealth.  He sneers with a 
           British pomp and panache, smoking a CIGAR and eyeing off 
           these crazy New York artists.

           JIM gulps.  FRANK whispers into his ear.

                                 FRANK
                        We’re all behind you man.

           Bravely, JIM steps up to the challenge.

                                 JIM
                        Mr Lew Grade... I’m Jim Henson 
                        and this is my team.

                                 LEW GRADE
                        I know who you are.

                                 JIM
                        Ohhh... good.  Yeah.

                                 BERNIE
                        I assume you’ve seen the idea --

                                 LEW GRADE
                        -- I’ve seen all the things 
                        you’ve sent to my office Mr 
                        Brillstein.  Yes. (beat) I am, I 
                        should add, a massive fan of your 
                        work, Mr Henson.  I’ve admired it 
                        from afar for some time, even 
                        before this strange man over here 
                        came into contact with my 
                        secretary.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JIM
                        Well, thank you.  Gee.

                                 LEW GRADE
                        As for your proposal...

           They ALL hold their breath as LEW GRADE continues to suck 
           back on his CIGAR.

                                 LEW GRADE (CONT’D)
                        I like it.  Not an ounce of 
                        American crass.  I’ll need twenty-
                        four half hour episodes to start, 
                        and I’ll need to shoot in 
                        England.

           The GROUP doesn’t know what to say.  JIM, dumbstruck, just 
           nods.

                                 JIM
                        Ahhh... okay?

           INT. BAR, UPTOWN, NEW YORK, 1975 - DAY

           The small, cramped BOOTH is filled with JIM, BERNIE, DON, 
           FRANK, RICHARD and JERRY all sharing a GLASS of WHISKEY - 
           celebrating.  It’s like the old times back in the SIXTIES.

           They toast to their own success.  Overjoyed, JIM does an 
           impression of LEW GRADE, using a PRETZEL as a PROP CIGAR.

                                 JIM
                              (as LEW GRADE)
                        I know who you are!

           RICHARD, a little drunk, makes a high pitched whine sound 
           that mimics JIM.

                                 RICHARD
                              (like Beaker the Muppet)
                        Mi, mi, mi, mi... mi, mi.

           The GROUP fall over themselves laughing.

           INT. BEDROOM, NEW HENSON APARTMENT, NEW YORK, 1975 - NIGHT

           JIM sits on the edge of the bed looking quite sorry for 
           himself.  JANE is crying across the other side of the room.

                                 JANE
                        What about the kids Jim?  Their 
                        life is here - not in England.

                                 JIM
                        We’ll get a big house and have 
                        two homes.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JANE
                        It’s not the money.  Things were 
                        finally settling.. And you always 
                        do this... you always drive a 
                        wedge into our life with your 
                        work.

                                 JIM
                        I thought you believed in this.

           A long pause.  JOHN calls out from his bedroom.

                                 JOHN (O.S)
                        Mom?  MOM!

           JANE sighs, heading out the door.

                                 JANE
                        When did what I think start 
                        mattering?

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS, LONDON, 1975 - DAY

           We see the OPENING TO THE MUPPET SHOW.  KERMIT THE FROG 
           sticks his head out of the “O” on a GIANT MUPPET SHOW PLACE 
           CARD.

                                 KERMIT
                        It’s the Muppet Show with our 
                        very special guest Juliet Prowse!  
                        YAAAAAAAYYYYY!

           KERMIT goes ballistic.  The TITLE CARD rises into the AIR 
           revealing an old RUSTIC 40’s style VAUDEVILLE STAGE.  A 
           PAIR OF RED CURTAINS PART TO REVEAL...

           ...SEVERAL GOLD ARCHES.  The FEMALE CAST of the MUPPET SHOW 
           start running on STAGE - MONSTERS and GIANT BIRDS et al.

                                 FEMALE MUPPETS
                              (singing)
                        It’s time to play the music / 
                        It’s time to light the lights / 
                        It’s time to meet the Muppets / 
                        On the Muppet Show Tonight.

           The MALE CAST of THE MUPPETS - including even more colorful 
           MONSTERS and CHICKENS - race onto STAGE singing.

                                 MALE MUPPETS
                              (singing)
                        It’s time to put on makeup / It’s 
                        time to dress up right / It’s 
                        time to get things started...

           WALDORF and STATLER (two old, grumpy MUPPETS) whine from up 
           in their BALCONY.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 WALDORF
                        Ohhh... they’ll never get this 
                        started.  Boo!

           STATLER holds up a score card with “1” on it.  The MUPPET 
           audience boos them.

                                 STATLER
                        Oh!  I know what you want!

           He holds up another card... this time with an “0”.  The 
           place erupts with APPLAUSE.

           We pull back from KERMIT resting in his ARCH...

                                 KERMIT
                              (singing)
                        It’s time to get things started.

           ...to reveal the ENTIRE CAST of the MUPPETS all in a 
           MASSIVE LINE.

                                 MUPPETS
                              (singing)
                        On the most sensational / 
                        Inspirational / Celebrational / 
                        Muppetational / This is what we 
                        call the Muppet Show!

           The “THE MUPPET SHOW” title is lowered again into frame.  
           GONZO (a blue beaked “whatever” Muppet) blows a TRUMPET 
           from inside the “O”.

           It BLOWS up in his face - ending the OPENING.

           INT. MUPPET SET, ELSTREE STUDIOS, LONDON, 1975 - DAY

           Filming on THE MUPPET SHOW.  The set of VETERINARIAN’S 
           HOSPITAL is laid out with a small CAMERA CREW huddled 
           around watching a REHEARSAL.

           DR. BOB (aka ROWLF THE DOG) is dressed in HOSPITAL GOWNS.  
           He’s performed by JIM HENSON (with the assistance of JERRY 
           JUHL on the other arm).

           With him is NURSE PIGGY (aka MISS PIGGY) also dressed in 
           HOSPITAL GOWNS.  She’s performed by FRANK OZ.  Standing 
           with her is NURSE JANICE (a squinty eyed CHER rip off with 
           blonde hair) performed by RICHARD HUNT.

           The PATIENT on the GURNEY is covered with a SHEET.  DR BOB 
           rips the cover off - revealing a LOAF OF BREAD with EYES.

                                 DR BOB
                        What?  This is no patient!  It’s 
                        a loaf of bread!

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 BREAD
                        And a very sick one...

                                 NURSE PIGGY
                        Good grief!  It’s talking bread!

                                 NURSE JANICE
                        Dr Bob... what do you make of it?

                                 DR BOB
                        What else?  TOAST!

           The CREW crack themselves up. JIM hams up ROWLF’S 
           EXPRESSION down the lens.

           OFFSET.  CHERYL and BRIAN HENSON laugh with the rest of the 
           CREW.  They’re hanging around by the LIGHTS.

           We see underneath the raised set - JIM, FRANK, JERRY and 
           RICHARD are cracking themselves up too.

           INT. CAFETERIA, ELSTREE STUDIO, LONDON, 1975 - DAY

           JIM sits in the STUDIO CAFE, earpiece still in, listening 
           to the AD’s.  He eats a quick lunch with BRIAN and CHERYL.

                                 JIM
                        So what do you think of the show?

                                 BRIAN
                        It’s funny.

                                 JIM
                        Yeah?  Reckon your mom would 
                        laugh at it?

                                 BRIAN
                        I don’t know about that.

           He looks across to the VIDEO SPLIT showing what’s happening 
           on SET.  MARVIN SUGGS (a BLUE MUPPET with a SPANISH FLAIR) 
           is banging small furry balls (muppephones) on the head with 
           a large MALLET.  As he does, they scream out in pain - 
           creating notes...

           ...that in turn is being used to perform a SONG.

                                 JIM
                        This is like the show I met your 
                        mom on - years and years ago now.  
                        Back at college.  (beat) Maybe a 
                        little more... you know...

           FRANK OZ stands up from behind the table, holding the 
           MARVIN MUPPET.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        It’s like we let the inmates out 
                        of the nut house and gave them 
                        all puppets.  (beat) I don’t know 
                        why she doesn’t come down here 
                        and be a part of it.  She’d be so 
                        much happier.  She used to love 
                        performing.

           CHERYL smiles, not convinced for a second.

                                 CHERYL
                        Dad... she hates it.  She says 
                        that all the time.

                                 JIM
                              (surprised)
                        Really?

           INT. RESTAURANT, LONDON, 1976 - NIGHT

           A posh, stifling, upmarket restaurant.

           JIM and JANE sit at a table.  She finishes her dessert 
           while JIM gulps down his third coffee.

                                 JANE
                        You need to eat more.  You still 
                        look gaunt.

                                 JIM
                        I always look like that. I’m not, 
                        I’m not worried about it.

                                 JANE
                        Well I am.

           They’ve both run out of things to say.

                                 JIM
                        The show is doing well.  Time 
                        Magazine was thinking of doing a 
                        cover.  The editor said it’s the 
                        best television show being 
                        produced on planet earth... which 
                        is... you know.  It’s nice. 
                        (beat) We were right.  Years ago, 
                        you know.  With Sam and Friends.  
                        How much time did we lose when we 
                        should have just followed our 
                        heart all along?  We knew what 
                        works.  We always did.

           JANE just looks at him - filled with sadness.

                        You were right Jim.  I was just 
                        watching you do it. (beat) I want 
                        to go back to New York with the 
                        kids.  We don’t fit in here.

                                 JIM
                        Jane...

                                 JANE
                        ...it’s not... it’s not something 
                        we’re going to fight about.  
                        There wouldn’t be any point... 
                        you’re not... we’re not fighting 
                        people.  Why don’t we try friends 
                        for a while?  See if that works 
                        out better than keeping up this 
                        game of husband and wife another 
                        night?

                                 JIM
                        Now we’ve started the show, I can 
                        slow down.

           JANE just stares him the eyes.

                                 JANE
                        Jim.  You know that’s not true. 
                        (beat) I got my first cheque in 
                        the mail.  For a silly little 
                        painting I did of an orange.  I 
                        wasn’t even trying to sell it, I 
                        just meant for it to be framed.  
                        But somebody saw it at the 
                        shop... and of course I said yes. 
                        (beat) That was a big thing for 
                        me.  I’d never made a cent before 
                        in my life - and yet here was 
                        this cheque outta nowhere.  The 
                        kids and I... we celebrated with 
                        tea and cookies round the table.  
                        And it felt good... even if it 
                        wasn’t the way I might have 
                        wanted something like that... 
                        with everyone around - cheering 
                        me on.  It wasn’t a tv show, but 
                        to me it was something - you 
                        know?  I called the studio just 
                        to tell you about it - but of 
                        course you were on set.  And that 
                        was a moment of my life you 
                        missed Jim.

                                 JIM
                        It’s been a rough few weeks 
                        getting the show started.  It’s 
                        always like that...  I don’t, I 
                        don’t know what --

                                 JANE
                        -- It wasn’t this week Jim.  I 
                        got the cheque six years ago.

           JANE pulls the CHEQUE out of her WALLET and shows JIM.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I have a seller and sometimes I 
                        make off with two or three 
                        paintings a month through this 
                        little store.  And I can do all 
                        this from home.  All without you 
                        ever having known... somehow.

                                 JIM
                        Honey, I could pay you a hundred 
                        times what’s on this signature if 
                        you just want to paint.  If I’d 
                        known you needed some money... 
                        that’s... that’s not a problem.  
                        Of course it’s not.  I want you 
                        to be happy.

                                 JANE
                        That is my happiness Jim.  And 
                        you haven’t been there to share 
                        it. (beat) I love you, but you 
                        don’t belong to me.  You belong 
                        to people I’ll never even meet.

           JIM stares at the CHEQUE, his heart heavy.

                                 JIM
                        Let me make this right.

                                 JANE
                        Then say we’ll try friends Jimmy.  
                        That’s all I ever wanted anyway.

           JIM looks like he’ll cry.  JANE holds his head in her 
           hands.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe, you know, maybe it just 
                        means we’ll disappoint each other 
                        less...

                                 JIM
                        How’s that?

                                 JANE
                        Don’t make me be the one to say 
                        it...

           JIM stares at the table.  He’s ripping apart with pain.

           INT. MUPPET SET, ELSTREE STUDIOS, LONDON, 1975 - DAY

           A KITCHEN SET.  The MUPPET CREW is hard at work filming.  
           The SWEDISH CHEF (a crazy humanoid muppet).  He’s being 
           performed by JIM HENSON with FRANK OZ doing the spare arm.

                                 SWEDISH CHEF
                              (singing)
                        Nerd gorsh di hort.  der gersch 
                        di hoo... ort BORT! BORT! BORT!

           The SWEDISH CHEF throws his UTENSILS across the room.

           Behind the table - FRANK is trying no to burst into 
           laughter.  JIM is taking the performance very seriously, 
           hardly even cracking a smile.

                                 SWEDISH CHEF (CONT’D)
                        Yergish born - der Sweedish 
                        Meatball!

           He picks up a SAUCE DISPENSER.

                                 SWEDISH CHEF (CONT’D)
                        Yerdin sauce din meatball!

           The SWEDISH CHEF sprinkles a little CHEESE on top - but 
           when he goes to stir it - ONE OF THE MEATBALLS springs out 
           of the PAN and BOUNCES across the table.

                                 SWEDISH CHEF (CONT’D)
                        Bort?

           He tries it again.  Picking up a MEATBALL - he bounces it 
           across the TABLE.

                                 SWEDISH CHEF (CONT’D)
                        Ohhhh... de beency bouncy burger 
                        de? (thinks) Zerns de burger - 
                          comme su!

                The SWEDISH CHEF picks up a TENNIS RACQUET and launches the 
                MEATBALLS off CAMERA.  BOING!

                He laughs and tries it AGAIN.

                                 SWEDISH CHEF (CONT’D)
                        Orrridi hoooo!

           The SKETCH finishes and the CREW burst out into the usual 
           uncontrollable laughter.

           JIM and FRANK appear from under the table.  JIM’S covered 
           in sweat - panting.

                                 FRANK
                        You okay Jim?

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JIM
                        Uh... yeah.

                                 CREW MEMBER
                              (parroting sketch)
                        Bort!  Bort!  Bort!

           JIM, overwhelmed, rushes away from the set.

           INT. BACKSTAGE, ELSTREE STUDIOS, LONDON, 1975 - DAY

           In the bowels of the MUPPET SHOW SET, JIM hobbles through 
           the CORRIDORS, the SWEDISH CHEF MUPPET still on his arm.

           He gently places it down on a table...

           ...and leans against the wall - about to burst.

           He stares at the COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE pinned to the STAFF 
           NOTICE BOARD in front of him...

           ...it shows JIM HENSON posing with the MUPPETS - “SHOW OF 
           THE CENTURY”.

           JIM cries into his hands.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, HENSON FARM, AHOSIKE, NC, 1990 - DAY

           YEARS LATER.  BACK AT HIS JIM’S PARENTS FARM.

           ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT is playing on TV.  JIM, wrapped in a 
           blanket, is watching.

                                                               ON TV :

           MARY HART grins down the camera.

                        Once described as the creator of 
                        the most popular show on 
                        television, Jim Henson, 
                        mastermind behind The Muppets, 
                        suffered a new blow yesterday as 
                        his once untouchable dynasty 
                        continues its downward decline.

           We cut to images from “GHOST OF FAFFNER HALL”.  A BLUE 
           GHOST puppet flies around the screen.

                        of Faffner Hall”, was given the 
                        axe by HBO late yesterday.

                        The latest in a decade long line 
                        of commercial disasters for the 
                        man once tipped as the modern day 
                        Walt Disney.  Some even say the 
                        master magician may have finally 
                        lost his touch --

           We cut to footage from THE STORYTELLER series.  We see the 
           DEVILS from the episode “The Soldier and Death” sitting 
           around playing cards.

                        -- Recent failures include the 
                        critically praised, but 
                        commercially disastrous, 
                        “Storyteller” Series - a passion 
                        project using puppets to retell 
                        classic, if lesser known, folk-
                        tales, fables and legends.

           We see some footage from the 1986 feature film THE 
           LABYRINTH.  DAVID BOWIE, as JARETH, whirls a GLASS BALL 
           around the screen.

                        The 1986 flop, “The Labyrinth” - 
                        reported to have cost over twenty 
                        five million dollars to produce, 
                        and winding up grossing less than 
                        twelve million of that back at 
                        the box office.

           Cut to footage from the 1982 feature film THE DARK CRYSTAL.  
           Various highlights from the film including THE SKEKSIS 
           (gaunt, dragon like creatures), the MYSTICS (elephantine 
           lizard like creatures) and the GELFLINGS (strange elves).

                        And the project that many 
                        attribute as the start of Hensons 
                        decline - “The Dark Crystal” - 
                        way back now in 1982.  An 
                        unparalleled critical success for 
                        the fantasy master, but one 
                        audiences didn’t seem to share.

           We see footage of JIM and the DARK CRYSTAL CREW hard at 
           work on set.

                        from the Muppets, you know.  
                        There’s many elements to the art 
                        of puppetry audiences have never 
                        been exposed to.

                        In fact, outside of repeats from 
                        The Muppet Show and Sesame 
                        Street, the greatest success for 
                        Henson in the last ten years was 
                        the short-lived HBO show “Fraggle 
                        Rock”...

           We see some CLIPS from FRAGGLE ROCK, a MUPPET-STYLE show 
           about underground “fraggles” that live in harmony with all 
           the other creatures.

                        And even this new “muppet” 
                        offering had an element of 
                        darkness that you would never 
                        find down on Sesame Street.

           We see an interview with LEONARD MALTIN interviewing JIM 
           HENSON on THE LABYRINTH press JUNKET.

                                 LEONARD MALTIN
                        You seem worlds away from the 
                        vaudeville style of The Muppet 
                        Show with your new movie. 
                        (mocking) I almost have to ask... 
                        is everything alright at home?

                        things, you know.

           We see more CLIPS from FRAGGLE ROCK.

                                 MARY HART (V.O)
                        Even so, HBO cancelled “Fraggle 
                        Rock” half way through its fourth 
                        season.

                                                              OFF TV :

           BETTY HENSON clicks off the TV set.

                                 BETTY
                        Jimmy... you shouldn’t be 
                        watching that trash.  (beat) 
                        It’ll give you square eyes.

           JIM gives her a smile.

                                 JIM
                        I don’t understand why they can’t 
                        leave it alone.

                                 BETTY
                        People want to laugh.  That’s it.  
                        That’s all there is to it.

           JIM thinks about it a while.  BETTY gives him a gentle tap 
           on the shoulder.

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        You start making them think... 
                        well then... people just wanna 
                        laugh again. (pause) It’s getting 
                          late honey.  You and Cheryl 
                          oughta get a good nights rest.

                She heads out.  JIM nods - lost in thought.

                INT. LOCAL MOTEL, AHOSKIE, NORTH CAROLINA, 1990 - MORNING

                The sun is trying to break through the CURTAINS.  A TV in 
                the corner is playing a MUPPET SHOW MARATHON - the sound 
                down low.

                CHERYL HENSON sits on the side of the bed, tying her shoes.  
                She grins at the ON SCREEN antics of KERMIT and MISS PIGGY.

                JIM HENSON, gaunt and ill, is asleep in his cheap bed - 
                wrapped up in the blankets - shivering.

                                 CHERYL
                        Dad.  You wanna get up?  It’s 
                        almost eleven thirty.  We’ve 
                        gotta get back to pa’s for lunch.

           JIM doesn’t respond.  CHERYL walks over and gently shakes 
           him.  He struggles to open his eyes.

                                 CHERYL (CONT’D)
                        Dad?  It’s time to get up.

                                 JIM
                        Honey... I think I need to rest.  
                        I can’t... I don’t have it in me 
                        today to handle your grandfather.

                                 CHERYL
                        We’re calling a doctor.

                                 JIM
                        No... no.  Don’t bother anyone 
                        with this.  I’m tired is all.  
                        Just tired.

           CHERYL thinks.

                                 CHERYL
                        If I come back and catch you 
                        working on something - I’m gonna 
                        kick your butt, okay?

           CHERYL grabs her handbag.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 CHERYL (CONT’D)
                        I’ll pick you up some chicken 
                        soup or something on the way 
                        home.

                                 JIM
                        Sounds good.

           CHERYL kisses him on the forehead and heads out.

                                 CHERYL
                        I wont be late. (beat) I love 
                        you.

                                 JIM
                        I love you too honey.

           A moment.  JIM tries to go back to sleep.  Suddenly...

           ...KERMIT THE FROG walks into the room.  It’s the KERMIT we 
           saw at the start of the film - older, dishevelled - his 
           face covered in whiskers.

           He stares at JIM - concerned.

                                 KERMIT
                        Ahhhh... Jim?  I’m sorry to... 
                        you know... disturb you.

                                 JIM
                        No.  It’s okay.  I was just 
                        dozing.  This sun...

                                 KERMIT
                        I know... very bright isn’t it? 
                        (beat) Jim... I was... ahhhh... I 
                        was worried about what’s 
                        happening... to us.

                                 JIM
                        What’s happening to us?

           KERMIT doesn’t know how to say it.

                                 KERMIT
                        I think you should call your 
                        wife.

                                 JIM
                        I can’t do that.

           KERMIT walks over and sits with JIM on the bed.

                                 KERMIT
                        It’s strange. I almost know how 
                        you feel. (beat) My sweetheart is 
                        gone too.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JIM
                        Piggy?

                                 KERMIT
                        I have, you know... I have.  
                        There’s, gee,  there’s no other 
                        way to say it.  Never actually 
                        spoken these words out loud... 
                        Piggy married that creep Hogthrob 
                        last week...

                                 JIM
                        She got married?

                                 KERMIT
                        And not to me. I thought, I 
                        thought we’d be together... 
                        Forever you know.

                                 JIM
                        Maybe you will still.

                                 KERMIT
                        Too late now. (beat) I’ve lost 
                        the greatest love of my life. 
                        (beat) Obviously...  She’s not 
                        here... is she?

           They stare at each other - knowing.

           Understanding, JIM reaches across to the HOTEL PHONE and 
           dials a number.

                                 JIM
                        I’m not even sure if this is 
                        still her number.

                                 KERMIT
                        Worth a shot, right?

           The other end picks up.  JIM listens.

                                 JANE
                              (on phone)
                        Hello.  Jane speaking. (beat) 
                        Hello?

           A moment.  JIM hangs up.  He’s not ready yet.

           INT. AIRPORT, NEW YORK, 1990 - NIGHT

           JIM and CHERYL move their bags through the AIRPORT.  
           Exhausted, looking more and more like death each second, 
           JIM stops for a moment...

           ...resting to the side of the RADIATOR near ARRIVALS.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 CHERYL
                        Oh Daddy, are you okay?

                                 JIM
                        I’m just tired.

           JIM’S mind wanders.  He looks out and sees KERMIT drinking 
           a SHOT at the AIRPORT BAR.

           KERMIT waves - noticing he’s been seen.  He mimes for JIM 
           to call - using his FROGGY hands like a PHONE.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                              (smiling)
                        Hi ho.  Kermit the Frog here.

           CHERYL watches him - stunned.

                                 CHERYL
                        What daddy?

                                 JIM
                        Huh?

                                 CHERYL
                        What did you say?

           JIM suddenly comes to.  He smiles at his daughter.

                                 JIM
                        Nothing.

           CHERYL helps him get up.

                                 CHERYL
                        You’re seeing a doctor.

                                 JIM
                        I’ll call Phil tomorrow.  He’ll 
                        be at home - it’s after six.

                                 CHERYL
                        I will turn up first thing in the 
                        morning and force you to go - you 
                        hear me?  No more ass-ing around 
                        with this.

                                 JIM
                        I’ve gotta get to bed.

           INT. JIM HENSON’S NY HOME, 1990 - NIGHT

           CHERYL helps JIM into his posh apartment - overlooking 
           central park.

           He flops down onto the lounge.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 CHERYL
                        You want something to eat or 
                        drink?

                                 JIM
                        Something cold maybe.

                                 CHERYL
                        I’ll check your fridge.

           CHERYL walks into the KITCHEN.  JIM thinks.  He picks up 
           the telephone and dials again.

                                 JANE
                              (on phone)
                        Hello?

           JIM can’t talk.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                              (on phone)
                        Jim?

           Hearing his name... JIM hangs up.  He lies down on the 
           COUCH - resting his head.

           INT. BEDROOM, JIM HENSON’S NY HOME, 1990 - NIGHT

           JIM is lying in BED.  He looks terrible.  The APARTMENT is 
           deathly quiet.  Even the FRIDGE HUM has made its way into 
           his BEDROOM.

           KERMIT THE FROG walks in again.  He carries a BOX OF 
           CHOCOLATES that he keeps snacking on.

           KERMIT plonks down on the end of BED - offering a few of 
           his BON BONS to JIM.

                                 JIM
                        You don’t go away - do you?

                                 KERMIT
                        I can’t Jim.  That wouldn’t be 
                        possible - if you think about it. 
                        (stuffs mouth with chocolate) I 
                        am so depressed.

                                 JIM
                        I feel so sick... so run down.

                                 KERMIT
                        Maybe you’re not, like you think, 
                        you know.  Maybe you’re getting 
                        worse.

                                 JIM
                        You’re not helping.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 KERMIT
                        Well, you’ve gotta consider it 
                        Jimbo.  You’re a smart guy.  
                        What’s left at the end, you know?  
                        What’s there at the end of the 
                        rainbow?  We’re just gonna go out 
                        alone?  How’d that happen?

                                 JIM
                        I’m not alone.

                                 KERMIT
                        Well - no offence - but you’re 
                        talking to a piece of cloth.

           JIM thinks.

                                 JIM
                        I couldn’t imagine a world where 
                        you and the pig didn’t end up 
                        together.

                                 KERMIT
                        Yeah... You know... neither could 
                        I.  But, I guess it happened, you 
                        know.

                                 JIM
                        It’s never too late.

                                 KERMIT
                        Ahhh... she’s deserves to be 
                        happy.  She deserves that.

           They stare at each other.  KERMIT pops another CHOCOLATE.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                        So - we gonna chew the fat all 
                        night - or are you gonna pick up 
                        that phone?  ‘Cause my bon bons 
                        are just about finished.

           JIM thinks.  He reaches for the phone again...

           ...suddenly a LOUD KNOCKING is heard from outside.  LIGHT 
           FILLS THE ROOM.

                                                              CUT TO :

           JIM wakes in his bed.  It’s the middle of the afternoon.  
           He’s been sleeping for hours... maybe days.

           There’s a LOUD KNOCKING from the front door.

           INT. JIM HENSON’S NY HOME, 1990 - AFTERNOON

           JIM, wrapped in a SHEET, opens the front door.  Standing 
           there is JANE HENSON, 58.  Older than we’ve ever seen her 
           before - but still unmistakably JANE.

           They stare at each other - unsure who should speak first.

                                 JANE
                        Hi Jim.

                                 JIM
                        I was... I was dreaming that I’d 
                        called you.

                                 JANE
                        Cheryl told me you missed a 
                        recording. (beat) I came straight 
                        over.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, JIM HENSON’S NY HOME, 1990 - AFTERNOON

           JIM and JANE sit on the couch.  It’s extremely awkward 
           between the two.

           JANE stares at some familiar looking PAINTINGS of ORANGES 
           on the wall.

                                 JANE
                        I thought... maybe you might have 
                        moved out of this place by now.

                                 JIM
                        Oh... eternal creature of habit.

                                 JANE
                        I tried to get a place around the 
                        park, long ago, but the broker 
                        said I might be waiting years.

                                 JIM
                        You should have told me.

                                 JANE
                        Oh... no Jim.  No.  I was fine.

           JIM coughs.  JANE watches - worried - but unsure how much 
           she should comfort him.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        You want some water?

                                 JIM
                        No, no, no.  I’m okay.

           JIM relaxes.  A long pause.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           JANE reaches under her cushion for something that’s 
           annoying her.

                                 JANE
                        There’s something sticking into 
                        my back.

           She pulls the HEAD OF A BROOM out.  They both look at it.

                                 JIM
                        I’ve been looking for that.

           JANE bursts out laughing.

                                 JANE
                        Jim... how... how did you lose 
                        part of a broom down the lounge?

                                 JIM
                        I was building something.  I 
                        think.  I can’t remember.

           She keeps laughing.

           INT. KITCHEN, JIM HENSON’S NY HOME, 1990 - NIGHT

           JIM and JANE sit at the KITCHEN TABLE sharing a CUP OF TEA.  
           They’re getting more comfortable by the minute.

           He still doesn’t look well, but there’s a sudden burst of 
           color to JIM’S skin.

                                 JIM
                        How’s the... you know... the 
                        canvas stuff?

                                 JANE
                        Oh... good some years.  Not so 
                        good others.  It is what it is I 
                        guess.

                                 JIM
                        I’ve seen ads for your exhibits 
                        in the paper a few times.  I cut 
                        them out to give to the kids.

           JIM points to the FRIDGE.  He’s cut out all the NEWSPAPER 
           ADS from JANE’S ART SHOWS over the last few years.  All of 
           them ORANGES (similar to the ones above the TV).

                                 JANE
                        Brian helped design them you big 
                        dope. (beat) They were all there.

                                 JIM
                              (already knew this)
                        Oh.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           JANE slides her hand across the table... a little nervous.

           It seems to take an eternity for them to hold hands.

                                 JANE
                        I’m gonna have to get going soon.  
                        Getting late.

                                 JIM
                        Jane... will you stay a bit 
                        longer?

                                 JANE
                        Why?

                                 JIM
                        I want you here.

           They stare at each other.

           INT. BALCONY, JIM HENSON’S NY HOME, 1990 - NIGHT

           CENTRAL PARK twinkles with FAIRY LIGHTS down below the 
           Sherry-Netherlands Hotel in NEW YORK.  JIM, wrapped in a 
           blanket, holds JANE in his arms.

           They stare out at the STARS together - their clenched hands 
           never wanting to let go.  They’ve been here for hours.

           JIM suddenly starts COUGHING.  JANE opens her eyes, 
           concerned.  She lifts her head from his chest.  He can’t 
           stop.

           JIM gently moves JANE’S arms away and heads to the 
           bathroom.  JANE looks down at her hand.  There’s spots of 
           BLOOD on them.

           INT. BATHROOM, JIM HENSON’S NY HOME, 1990 - NIGHT

           JIM is leaning over the TOILET BOWL - coughing.  
           Splatterings of BLOOD spew out.

           JANE watches in the archway - mortified.

                                 JANE
                              (terrified)
                        Jim... can we go to the hospital?  
                        Can we call a nurse?  A doctor?  
                        Somebody?

                                 JIM
                        It’s okay... it’s okay.  It’s not 
                        going to happen again.  I’ve been 
                        pushing too hard when I cough. 
                        (beat) Maybe try rubbing my back.  
                        Calm my breathing down a little.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           Worried - she finds herself sucked into this delusion.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, JIM HENSON’S NY HOME, 1990 - NIGHT

           JIM is lying on the LOUNGE with the back of this SHIRT up.  
           JANE rubs his back gently - trying to ease the pain.

                                 JANE
                        Is it working?

                                 JIM
                        Yeah.  I think so.

                                 JANE
                        You want me to get some ointment 
                        or something?

                                 JIM
                        No... just keep doing that.

                                 JANE
                        Jim... I think we should go to 
                        the hospital.

                                 JIM
                        I want to be here.  I’m okay.  
                        I’m okay.

           JANE keeps rubbing his back - hoping for the best.

           INT. BEDROOM, JIM HENSON’S NY HOME, 1990 - NIGHT

           JIM is shaking on the edge of his bed.  His HANDKERCHIEF is 
           full of BLOOD.

           JANE stares at him - now reduced to tears.

                                 JIM
                        Oh God... I think I’m dying.

           He coughs again into his bloodied rag.

                                 JANE
                        Jim... we’ve given it a few 
                        hours.... please!

           JIM thinks - as if examining his body with his mind.

                                 JIM
                        Okay. (beat) We should go to the 
                        hospital.  I’m breathing too 
                        hard... my heart is racing.

                                 JANE
                        Jesus.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 JIM
                        Don’t panic.  Don’t panic.  It’s 
                        okay.  It’s okay.

           INT. TAXI, NEW YORK, 1990 - NIGHT

           JIM leans against the window of the TAXI.  He looks 
           horrible.  JANE holds his hand - terrified.

           They race through the streets of NEW YORK.

                                 JANE
                        Jim... you still here?

                                 JIM
                        I’m fine.  Honestly.

           EXT. OUTSIDE NY HOSPITAL, NEW YORK, 1990 - NIGHT

           The TAXI pulls up outside the OUTPATIENTS ENTRANCE.  JANE 
           helps JIM out.

           She looks up at the sign.

                                 JANE
                        This is outpatients.  We’re in 
                        the wrong place.

           JANE knocks on the CAB WINDOW.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        You’ve dropped us at the wrong 
                        entrance.

                                 DRIVER
                        What?

                                 JANE
                        This is outpatients!

                                 DRIVER
                        Get in.  Get in.  I’ll drive you 
                        around the block.

           JIM pulls JANE away from the CAB.

                                 JIM
                        It’s a quarter block.  We’ll 
                        walk.  We’ll walk.

                                 JANE
                        Jim, he said he’d drive us.

                                 JIM
                        Don’t bother the man.  Come on. 
                        (beat) Let me walk with you.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           She’s not sure what to do.

                                 JANE
                              (resigned)
                        We’re okay.  Thank you.

           JANE waves the TAXI OFF.  She grabs JIM’S arm and helps him 
           as they STUMBLE across the block.

           JIM smiles at her.  Her touch clearly means the world.

           INT. ADMISSIONS, NEW YORK HOSPITAL, 1990 - NIGHT

           JANE helps JIM in through the EMERGENCY DOORS.  The STAFF 
           see the situation straight away.

                                 JANE
                        Please!  We need a doctor!

           TWO NURSES race over to help as JIM collapses into a heap.

           BANG.  JIM is pushed through the HOSPITAL CORRIDORS on a 
           GURNEY.  He’s having trouble - gasping for air.

           A DOCTOR throws an OXYGEN PUMP over his mouth.

           INT. XRAY, NEW YORK HOSPITAL, 1990 - NIGHT

           JIM, gasping, is carefully being placed through a GIANT 
           XRAY MACHINE.

           It CLUNKS and CLANGS as lights bounce off his BODY.

           Things aren’t looking that great.

           INT. PRIVATE ROOM, NEW YORK HOSPITAL, 1990 - NIGHT

           JIM lies on a HOSPITAL BED, an OXYGEN MASK over his face.  
           JANE waits with him.

           A DOCTOR walks in with SEVERAL X-RAYS.  They look to him 
           for answers.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Mr Henson, we’ve got the first of 
                        your x-rays back.  I’ve taken a 
                        look.  You can see we’ve picked 
                        up several pockets of infection 
                        around your lungs - here and 
                        here... 

           We see on the X-RAYS a large CLOUD covering JIM’S RIB CAGE.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        It’s a concern.  A real concern.  
                        (beat) We’ll send you in for 
                        another scan in a couple of 
                        minutes, to see how it’s 
                        progressing, but my first 
                        thoughts are we’re dealing with a 
                        form of pneumonia or perhaps a 
                        Group A streptococcal infection. 
                        (beat)  It’s quite abnormally 
                        advanced.  Can I ask how long 
                        you’ve had trouble breathing?

                                 JANE
                        He was coughing blood maybe two 
                        or three hours ago - but he’s 
                        been feeling off the last week or 
                        two weeks I think.  (beat) Is 
                        that right Jim?

           JIM, pained, nods.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Is he going to be okay?

                                 DOCTOR
                        We need to get anti-biotics into 
                        his body straight away.  There’s 
                        a real risk of toxic shock with 
                        the amount of time that might 
                        have elapsed here.  (visibly 
                        worried)  I’ll be right back.

           The DOCTOR rushes out of the room.  JIM looks to JANE.

                                 JANE
                              (to tears)
                        Jim... Jesus!  Why did I let you 
                        wait?  For crying out loud!  So 
                        stupid!  It was so stupid.

           JIM holds her hand.  He gently pulls his OXYGEN MASK down 
           from his face.

                                 JIM
                        Jane...

                                 JANE
                        Jimmy, don’t talk.  You need to 
                        rest.

                                 JIM
                        I want you to know.  I love you.

           JANE looks at him.  Her eyes well up with tears.  She holds 
           him.

                                 JANE
                        Jim - I love you too.

           He whispers into her ear.

                                 JIM
                        Don’t leave me again.

                                 JANE
                        I won’t.  I won’t.

                                 JIM
                        It’s nothing without you.  All of 
                        it.  Nothing.

           They hold each other tightly.

           KERMIT walks into the room, his head hanging low.  He 
           starts to sing “I’M GOING BACK THERE SOMEDAY” from THE 
           MUPPET MOVIE.

                                 KERMIT
                              (sings)
                        This looks familiar, vaguely 
                        familiar / Almost unreal, yet, 
                        it’s too soon to feel yet / Close 
                        to my soul, and yet so far away / 
                        I’m going to go back there some 
                        day.

           JIM starts to SHAKE.  JANE screams.  Luckily we can’t hear 
           her pain.  It’s muted.  All we’re left with is the song.

           It builds into a CONVULSION.  She runs out to find the 
           DOCTORS.

           KERMIT walks closer to JIM - ready to say goodbye.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                              (sings)
                        Sun rises, night falls, sometimes 
                        the sky calls / Is that a song 
                        there, and do I belong there?

           INT. HOSPITAL WARD, NEW YORK HOSPITAL, 1990 - NIGHT

           JANE runs around rounding up NURSES.  They race back into 
           JIM’S ROOM and hold him down...

           ...trying to get the situation under control.

                                 KERMIT (O.S)
                              (sings)
                        I’ve never been there, but I know 
                        the way / I’m going to go back 
                        there someday.

           INT. PAY PHONE, OUTSIDE NEW YORK HOSPITAL, 1990 - DAWN

           The SUN is starting to rise.  JANE, trembling, puts some 
           money into the pay phone.

                                 JANE
                        Honey... the doctors told me your 
                        father might not make it through 
                        the night.  You need... (falls 
                        into tears) you need to come 
                        here.

           JANE loses herself again, collapsing into the PAY PHONE.

                                 KERMIT (O.S)
                              (sings)
                        You can’t go with me, it’s not 
                        one to share / I know I’ll be 
                        completely at home in midair.

           INT. OUTSIDE PRIVATE ROOM, NEW YORK HOSPITAL, 1990 - MORNING

           JANE waits with BRIAN, CHERYL, LISA, JOHN and HEATHER in 
           the waiting room.  DOCTORS come and go from JIM’S room.

           KERMIT watches, head hanging low, by the WATER COOLER.

                                 KERMIT
                              (sings)
                        I’m flyin’, not walkin’, on 
                        featherless wings / We can hold 
                        onto love / like invisible 
                        strings.

           A DOCTOR walks out - quite distraught.  He bends down very 
           casually to the HENSON family and takes JANE’S HAND.

           She knows already.

                                 JANE
                        No... no.....

           She collapses into BRIAN’S ARMS.

           KERMIT walks towards JIM’S ROOM.  He sneaks inside.

           INT. PRIVATE ROOM, NEW YORK HOSPITAL, 1990 - MORNING

           KERMIT sees JIM on the hospital bed.  He’s covered with 
           TUBES and MONITORS...

           ...he DIED only a moment ago.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 KERMIT
                              (sings)
                        There’s not a word yet, for old 
                        friends who’ve just met / Part 
                        heaven, part space, or have I 
                        found my place? / You can just 
                        visit, but I plan to stay / I’m 
                        going to go back there someday.

           KERMIT looks outside.  Half the HENSON COMPANY has turned 
           up to see JIM - up front are FRANK, JERRY and DON.  They 
           hold JANE and JIM’S CHILDREN - weeping at hearing the news.

           It’s incredible.  KERMIT watches - the line of VISITORS 
           snakes all the way down the corridor.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                              (sings)
                        I’m going to go back there 
                        someday.

           INT. JIM HENSON MEMORIAL, NEW YORK, 1990 - DAY

           Some days have passed.  A GIANT PUBLIC MEMORIAL is being 
           held at the CATHEDRAL OF ST. JOHN THE DIVINE.

           The room is FILLED with THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN and MEMBERS 
           of the PUBLIC, each holding up a little PUPPET BUTTERFLY.

           Interspersed among them are MUPPET CHARACTERS, sitting 
           among the KIDS, holding them tightly.

           A JAZZ BAND sits on stage - a giant PROJECTION shows JIM 
           HENSON with his arm around KERMIT the FROG.

           A SPOTLIGHT shines onto a PODIUM where BRIAN HENSON is 
           bravely talking to the MOURNING CROWD.

                                 BRIAN
                        My father, worried his kids would 
                        not get to his bedside in time, 
                        wrote a letter for us, that I 
                        would like to share with you all 
                        today.

           BRIAN pulls out a small handwritten letter.  He looks down 
           into the AUDIENCE at JANE, CHERYL, LISA, JOHN and HEATHER 
           all holding each other up front.

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                              (fighting back tears)
                        Life is meant to be fun, and 
                        joyous, and fulfilling. May each 
                        of yours be that - having each of 
                        you as a child of mine has 
                        certainly been one of the good 
                        things in my life.

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        Know that I've always loved each 
                        of you with an eternal, 
                        bottomless love. A love that has 
                        nothing to do with each other, 
                        for I feel my love for each of 
                        you is total and all-
                        encompassing. Please watch out 
                        for each other and love and 
                        forgive everybody. It's a good 
                        life, enjoy it.

           BRIAN looks out at the AUDIENCE - fighting back tears.  
           It’s not just HUMAN EYES staring at him...

           ...it’s also HUNDREDS OF MUPPETS.

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s a good life, enjoy it.

           BRIAN puts the letter away and slowly walks off stage.

           We see a group of JIM’S FRIENDS walking on with something 
           hidden behind their backs...

           ...It’s FRANK OZ, RICHARD HUNT, DAVID GOELZ, STEVE 
           WHITMIRE, JERRY NELSON and KEVIN CLASH.

           A LONE PIANO across the other side of STAGE begins to play.  
           The GROUP start singing “BABY FACE” as CHICKENS.

                                 GROUP
                        Bwarrrk bwarrrk bwarrrrk / bak 
                        bak bak bwaaark bak bak

           The PLACE erupts into laughter.  The KIDS wave their 
           BUTTERFLY PUPPETS in the air.

           Even BIG BIRD, walking down the AISLE, does a CHICKEN DANCE 
           to try and lighten to mood.

           After a moment the song changes into something a little 
           slower.

           RICHARD HUNT walks to the MICROPHONE.  He pulls SCOOTER, 
           the spectacled yellow manager of THE MUPPET SHOW, out from 
           behind his back.

           SCOOTER begins to sing to the crowd - “JUST ONE PERSON”.

                                 SCOOTER
                              (sings)
                        If just one person believes in 
                        you / Deep enough, and strong 
                        enough, believes in you / Hard 
                        enough, and long enough / Before 
                        you knew it, someone else would 
                        think / If he can do it, I can do 
                        it.... Making it...

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           Suddenly JERRY NELSON turns around holding the GOBO FRAGGLE 
           MUPPET.  Both he and SCOOTER start singing into the 
           MICROPHONE.

                                 SCOOTER & GOBO
                              (sings)
                        Two whole people, who believe in 
                        you / Deep enough, and strong 
                        enough, believe in you / Hard 
                        enough and long enough / There’s 
                        bound to be some other person who 
                        / Believes in making it a 
                        threesome...

           STEVE WHITMIRE turns around holding WEMBLEY FRAGGLE.  He 
           joins in with the others.

                                 SCOOTER & GOBO & WEMBLEY
                              (sings)
                        Making it three! / People you can 
                        say / Believe in me.... / And if 
                        three whole people...

           Suddenly KEVIN CLASH turns around holding ELMO.  Now he 
           joins in on the song.

                                 SCOOTER, GOBO, WEMBLEY & ELMO
                              (sings)
                        Why not four? / And if four whole 
                        people...

           Suddenly FRANK OZ turns around holding FOZZIE BEAR and 
           DAVID GOELZ turns around with GONZO.  They all join in 
           together.

                                 GROUP
                              (sings)
                        Why not more? / And more? / And 
                        more?

           Suddenly the ENTIRE HENSON COMPANY walks on stage holding 
           his creations.  The HALL fills with SINGING MUPPETS, all 
           standing underneath a PHOTO OF JIM HENSON.

                                 THE MUPPETS
                              (sings)
                        And when all those people / 
                        Believe in you / Deep enough, and 
                        strong enough / Believe in 
                        you.... / Hard enough, and long 
                        enough...

           JANE turns around to see.  The ENTIRE ROOM is clapping and 
           SINGING ALONG.  She wipes her eyes.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
                                 THE MUPPETS (CONT’D)
                              (sings)
                        It stands to reason that you 
                        yourself will / Start to see what 
                        everybody sees in / You...

           The MUPPETS all TURN and look up at the PHOTO of JIM.

                                 THE MUPPETS (CONT’D)
                              (sings)
                        And maybe even you / Can believe 
                        in you... / too!

           JANE turns to the IMAGE OF JIM as APPLAUSE fills the room.

           INT. DECREPIT HOTEL ROOM, MOO YORK - DAY

           We see KERMIT, covered in growth, still sitting on the end 
           of his bed, eating CHOCOLATES.

           Long pause.  He looks up into the camera.

                                 KERMIT
                        Well... darn it... you didn’t 
                        think we’d end like that did you?

           EXT. STREET, MOO YORK - DAY

           KERMIT walks out of his BUILDING into the COW COVERED 
           STREET.  He thinks...

           ...before RUNNING... fast as he can.

           He keeps running - past buildings; into tunnels; past trees 
           and parks...

           ...as fast as he can go.

           EXT. HOG MANSION, MOO YORK - EVENING

           KERMIT finds himself in a HOG INSPIRED SUBURBIA.

           He walks up a driveway - possessed.  He rings the DOOR 
           BELL.

           MISS PIGGY answers.

           The two of them stare at each other for a long, long time.

                                 MISS PIGGY
                        Yes?

                                 KERMIT
                        Piggy...

                                 MISS PIGGY
                        Uh-huh....?

                                 KERMIT
                        I wish...

                                 MISS PIGGY
                        You wish....

                                 KERMIT
                        ... I wish you knew...

                                 MISS PIGGY
                        Know what...?

                                 KERMIT
                        That, ahhhh, you knew....

                                 MISS PIGGY
                        OUT WITH IT ALREADY FROG!

                                 KERMIT
                        I wish you knew how much I loved 
                        you.

           MISS PIGGY is floored.  She thinks for a moment.

                                 MISS PIGGY
                        You do... do you?

                                 KERMIT
                        Very, ahhhh, very much.

                                 MISS PIGGY
                        Wait just a moment.

           MISS PIGGY turns and walks inside the house.

           INT. INSIDE HOG MANSION, MOO YORK - DAY

           MISS PIGGY barges into the LIVING ROOM.  LINK HOGTHROB, a 
           giant beer gut on him now, is watching a BALL GAME.

                                 MISS PIGGY
                        Link.  I don’t love you anymore.  
                        I’m sorry.

                                 LINK HOGTHROB
                        Baby... I can’t hear you over the 
                        tv.

                                 MISS PIGGY
                        I said I’m leaving you.

                                 LINK HOGTHROB
                        Piggy... come on.  This is the 
                        playoffs.

           Frustrated, MISS PIGGY karate chops the TELEVISION in HALF.

           EXT. HOG MANSION, MOO YORK - EVENING

           KERMIT waits on the LAWN.  He is suddenly taken by surprise 
           as MISS PIGGY races out the FRONT DOOR and takes him in her 
           arms.

                                 MISS PIGGY
                        You’re a stupid frog.

                                 KERMIT
                        Yup.

                                 MISS PIGGY
                        What took you so long?

                                 KERMIT
                        I don’t know... I, ahhh, you 
                        know, there was this and then 
                        there was that.

           MISS PIGGY holds her hand up to his MOUTH.

                                 MISS PIGGY
                        Don’t ruin this with your 
                        jabbering!

           KERMIT, shocked, just dissolves in the moment.  They KISS.

           He turns to the CAMERA - a GIANT RAINBOW falling out of the 
           SKY - way off in the distance. “FINALE - THE MAGIC STORE” 
           begins to play.

                                 KERMIT
                              (sings)
                        Why are there so many song about 
                        rainbows?

                                 PIGGY
                              (sings)
                        That’s part of what rainbows do.

           INT. MISS PIGGY’S CAR, MOO YORK - DAY

           KERMIT drives with MISS PIGGY, FOZZIE and GONZO all crowded 
           in the back.  They head towards the RAINBOW.

                                 FOZZIE
                              (sings)
                        Rainbows are memories / Sweet 
                        dream reminders.

                                 GONZO
                              (sings)
                        What is it you’d like to do?

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           EXT. OUTSIDE CHURCH, MOO YORK - DAY

           We’re back at the CHURCH from the beginning.  There’s a 
           GIANT CONGREGATION OF MUPPETS again...

           ...watching as KERMIT, MISS PIGGY, FOZZIE and GONZO all 
           pull up in their car.

                                 MUPPETS
                              (sings)
                        All of us watching, and wishing 
                        we’d find it.

                                 KERMIT
                              (sings)
                        I’ve noticed you’re watching too.

           EXT. OUTSIDE CHURCH, MOO YORK - DAY

           KERMIT lifts a VEIL on MISS PIGGY at the front of the 
           ALTAR.  They KISS.

           The CONGREGATION smiles and sings.

                                 MUPPETS
                              (sings)
                        Someday you’ll find it, the 
                        rainbow connection.

           KERMIT and MISS PIGGY join in.

                                 MUPPETS (CONT’D)
                              (sing)
                        The lovers, the dreamers, and 
                        you.

           Suddenly ANIMAL (the crazy unhinged MUPPET - part LION - 
           part BEAR) gets overwhelmed.  He RUSHES at the WALLS - 
           eating straight through them.

           The MUPPETS scream and rush away.  CHAOS erupts.  CHICKENS 
           fly everywhere.

                                 KERMIT
                        Wait!  Everybody!  Don’t panic!

           It’s too late.  The entire CHURCH is coming down.  The 
           WALLS FALL...

           ...crashing to the GROUND.

           We suddenly see that the MUPPETS weren’t in a CHURCH at 
           all, but rather, all on a GIANT SOUND STAGE...

           ...An EXPLOSION goes off in the ceiling - creating a HOLE.

             (c) Casp Productions - "The Muppet Man" by Christopher Weekes 08/08/08
           The RAINBOW gently falls down through the gap... straight 
           onto KERMIT’S FACE.

           The INSANITY stops as all the MUPPETS bunch together to 
           watch this amazing sight.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                              (sings)
                        Life’s like a movie, write your 
                        own ending.

           The MUPPETS join in.

                                 MUPPETS
                              (sings)
                        Keep believing, keep pretending / 
                        We’ve done just what we set out 
                        to do....

           They all watch as a STEEL DOOR creeps open.  They see a 
           HUMANOID MUPPET plodding in...

           ...it’s JIM HENSON in MUPPET FORM - smiling at them all.

                                 MUPPETS (CONT’D)
                              (sings)
                        Thanks to the lovers / The 
                        Dreamers / And you!

           A RED VELVET curtain closes across the SCREEN.

           INT. BALCONY MUPPET SHOW - DAY

           We see WALDORF and STATLER in their familiar BALCONY.  They 
           yawn.

                                 WALDORF
                        Well... that wasn’t half bad.

                                 STATLER
                        No... it was ALL bad!

           They both roll over laughing.

                                                         CUT TO BLACK.

           THE END
