                                Fogelman Draft 6/5/07
           OPEN ON SKY BLUE:

           As a QUOTATION types across screen...

           “ALL WOMEN BECOME LIKE THEIR MOTHERS.  THAT IS THEIR 
           TRAGEDY.  NO MAN DOES. THAT’S HIS.”  

           - Oscar Wilde, The Importance of Being Ernest.

           A line of clouds slide in, wiping away the quote.  The 
           clouds settle bottom-frame: a FLOOR OF CLOUDS.

                                 NARRATOR
                        When I was a little boy, my mother used 
                        to tuck me into bed every night.  And 
                        every night she’d tell me the same story.

           A PEARLY GATE appears.  It swings open.  We ENTER, 
           following an unseen MOTHER’S POV.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        She told me that if she ever went to 
                        Heaven, and met God...

           A WHITE-HAIRED MAN materializes, motions toward...

           AN INFINITE LINE OF FIVE-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        And God lined up all the little boys in 
                        the world, and told her she could only 
                        pick one... 

           The POV walks the line.  ADORABLE FIVE YEAR OLD’S make 
           puppy dog eyes.  They continue getting passed, until... 

           A BOY.  Really cute. The POV’S HAND enters frame, POINTS. 

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        She’d pick me every time.  

           The boy JUMPS, thrilled!  He steps forward.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Every night she told me the story.  And 
                        as I grew older, from child to boy...

           A LINEUP OF TEN YEAR OLD’S. The BOY holds a basketball, 
           stands with friends.  The POV picks him again. He smiles.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        And boy to teenager...
           A LINEUP OF TEENAGERS.  The POV selects HER BOY (reading 
           Kafka, smoking a joint).  He rolls his eyes, steps forth.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        A fear began to materialize in my mind.  
                        I began to fear that I had not, in fact, 
                        turned out to be a very good son.

           A LINEUP OF HEAVY COLLEGE GUYS. Again, the POV picks her 
           BOY.  He downs a beer, tosses it, and steps forward.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        I feared if my mother actually went to 
                        heaven, and met God, she’d still pick me.  
                        But she’d be making the wrong choice.

           A FINAL LINEUP of THIRTY-YEAR OLD MEN.  The POV scans, 
           settling on our now fully EVOLVED YOUNG MAN.  He’s 
           wearing a suit and is on a cell phone, pre-occupied.  

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        So ironically, my mother’s bed-time 
                        story, meant to make me feel special... 

           The young man shakes his head at her (”don’t pick me).” 

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Would make me feel guilty for the rest of 
                        my life.  And looking back, I can’t help 
                        but wonder if maybe, just maybe...

           She POINTS at him. 

                                 NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                        That wasn’t her intention all along.  

           CUE TITLE CARD: MY MOTHER’S CURSE.  (ROLL CREDITS)

           INT. BEDROOM (NEW JERSEY) - MORNING

           A WOMAN lies on one side of a king-sized bed, sleeping.  
           The other side is empty, sheets untouched.  She’s asleep 
           in a seated position.  A book on lap.  Glasses on nose.  
           Three M&M wrappers litter her body.

           An alarm: CUING the soft 50’s song: The Great Pretender.

           Waking, she begins removing the M&M wrappers.  She stops, 
           discovering a leftover M&M.  She hesitates then... pops 
           it in her mouth.

           And so we meet JOYCE BREWSTER, 56.
           PAN TO THE NIGHTSTAND.  Her almost ancient alarm clock 
           reads 8:30 AM.  Next to it...

           A SINGLE PHOTO.  Large and framed.  It shows Joyce with 
           the YOUNG MAN from our recent montage...

           INT. BEDROOM (CALIFORNIA) - MORNING

           The same PHOTO on a different nightstand.  This photo is 
           smaller and less prominent, set amidst other photos of 
           the YOUNG MAN: with friends, on vacation, etc.  

           BESIDE THE PHOTOS: an Ipod alarm clock reads 5:30 AM.  It 
           goes off: CUING Kanye West’s rap, The New Workout Plan.

           PAN to the bed, where the YOUNG MAN lies on his back, 
           already awake.  A NAKED GIRL’S arm is draped over his 
           chest. As he tries to extricate himself she STIRS.

                                 NAKED GIRL
                                 (groggy)
                        Mmmmm. I love you.

           She wraps half her naked body over his and returns to 
           sleep.  He looks completely smothered.

           And so we meet ANDY BREWSTER, 29.

           INT. JOYCE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           RE-CUE: The Great Pretender.

           Joyce primps at a mirror, wearing a sweatsuit.  She puts 
           on a pair of CLIP-ON EARRINGS and removes her GLASSES 
           (which split open/close over the nose, a magnetic 
           miracle.  When “open” they simply hang around her neck.)  

           She pulls her eyes toward her ears, a pseudo face-lift.  
           She SIGHS.  Re-clicks her glasses into place.

           INT. ANDY’S BEDROOM - LATER

           RE-CUE: The New Workout Plan.

           Andy stands at his own mirror in a suit, looking sharp.  
           He feels his gut.  All good.  He notices something 
           hanging from his suit-sleeve: a PRICETAG reading $1200.  

           He takes a deep breath, then rips it off and tosses it in 
           the garbage.
           INT. JOYCE’S KITCHEN - LATER

           RE-CUE: The Great Pretender.

           Another price, this time on a COUPON (”two dozen eggs for 
           three dollars”).  A scissor clips the coupon. 

           PULL BACK to reveal Joyce clipping away while eating 
           eggs. Outside the window, it’s a cold, dreary, New Jersey 
           winter day. Joyce puts the paper aside, revealing...

           A POST-IT NOTE: “Andy, United 45, 4:36 PM tomorrow.”  

           Joyce smiles to herself, picks up a phone.

           INT. ANDY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Andy drives his BMW, beset on all sides by palm trees and 
           sun, a perfect California morning.  He’s listening to 
           Kanye, bobbing to it. His CELL PHONE begins ringing.  He 
           looks at it: “Mom.” He pauses, thinks about it, then...

           He turns up the SONG, drowning out the RING.

           END MUSIC (END CREDITS).

           INT. WAITING ROOM - LATER

           Andy sits, holding a BOX and rehearsing to himself.

                                 ANDY
                        Hello, my name is Andrew Brewster.
                                 (then, ala James Bond)
                        The name’s Brewster.  Andrew Brewster.  
                        Okay, let’s not do that.

           An OFF-SCREEN GIGGLE.  A CUTE RECEPTIONIST looks on.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        First sales pitch?

                                 ANDY
                        How could you tell?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Don’t be nervous.  It’s a good room.
                                 (whispering, conspiratorial)
                        You got the nice ones.  They bring me 
                        coffee sometimes after lunch.  
                                 ANDY
                        Good to know.

           He returns to his prep. Conversation over... until:

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Megan by the way.

                                 ANDY
                        Oh, hi.  Nice to meet you.

           She looks away.

                                 MEGAN
                        Okaaay. That was embarrassing.

                                 ANDY
                        What?  Why?

                                 MEGAN
                        My friend made me promise the next time I 
                        saw a cute guy I’d make the first move.  

                                 ANDY
                        Oh.

                                 MEGAN
                                 (dying)
                        Telling you my name.  That was my first 
                        move.

           Andy suddenly gets it.

                                 ANDY
                        Ohhhh. I’m sorry.  I was just... I spent 
                        five years developing what’s in this box 
                        and... I wasn’t paying attention.  You 
                        seem really nice but--

                                 MEGAN
                        You’re not interested.

                                 ANDY
                        Yes.  I mean, no.  I have a... 
                                 (swallowing it)
                        Girlfriend.

                                 MEGAN
                        You say that the same way you’d say “I 
                        have cancer.”

                                 ANDY
                        Yes, it feels that way sometimes. 
           He looks away.  Then, unable to help himself...

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t get me wrong.  She’s very nice.  My 
                        girlfriend. Bethany. 

           The receptionist nods.  Andy pauses, can’t help himself:

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        She’s starting to say “I love you.”  My 
                        girlfriend.  She’s saying it a lot.

                                 MEGAN
                        And what do you say?

                                 ANDY
                        I’ve been rotating between three things.  
                        Usually I just go with “Thank you.”  
                        Sometimes, “Awww, that’s nice.” And once 
                        in a while I just pat her on the head.

                                 MEGAN
                        Wow.  That’s the darkest thing I’ve ever 
                        heard.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, it’s pretty bad.  Anyway, that’s 
                        why I’m not interested.  If it’s any 
                        consolation, you’re better off.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Yeah, I’m getting that.

           A MAN sticks his head out the door.  

                                 MAN
                        We’re ready.

           He EXITS.  Andy stands, gathers his box.  He turns to 
           Megan, awkwardly tries to find the right exit line.  

                                 ANDY
                        It’s not you it’s me.

                                 MEGAN
                        Wow.  

                                 ANDY
                        Yep.

           Awkwardly, he heads in.
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           TIGHT ON ANDY, at the end of a long conference table.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        What do you have for us, Mr. Brewster?

                                 ANDY
                        What I have, Sir, is a product that you 
                        fine folk at Ralph’s Grocery desperately 
                        need on your shelves.

           AT THE OTHER END sit TWO CORPORATE SUITS.  Stone-faced.  
           Andy smiles, strangely confident.  After a long beat...

                                 SUIT #1
                        Would you care to tell us what it is?

                                 ANDY
                        Really?  You mean you don’t just want to 
                        place an order?

           The suits share a look, then... chuckle.  Andy smiles.  
           His skill and charm while pitching is masterful.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Fair enough.  I’m a UCLA grad and I’ve--

                                 SUIT #1
                        Careful, USC alum over here.

                                 ANDY
                        Good to know. I’ll use small words.

           They LAUGH.  He’s got them.  Andy continues...

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        After school, I spent five years working 
                        at the chemist at the EPA. While there, I 
                        heard thousands of complaints about 
                        reactions children were having after 
                        ingesting household cleaning products.  
                        So I began using my free time in the lab 
                        to develop a completely safe, organic, 
                        cleaning supply.

           He REACHES into the box, pulls out a BOTTLE. 

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        It’s called...
                                 (”ta-da”)
                        Organiclean!
           No reaction.  Andy pulls out a pot of dirt, pours it on 
           the table, and rubs it in.  He SPRAYS ORGANICLEAN over 
           the mess and wipes it clean.  

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Cleans like a dream.  Smells nice too.

                                 SUIT #2
                        So do the household name brands we carry.

           Andy reaches into his box, pulls out a bottle of WINDEX.

                                 ANDY
                        Like Windex?

           Andy pulls out a shot glass, pours himself a SHOT OF 
           ORGANICLEAN.  He DOWNS it.  His audience looks startled.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Organiclean is one hundred percent non-
                        toxic. Completely organic, totally safe

           Using a dropper he drips it in his eyes like Visine...

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        You can flavor your golden retriever’s 
                        food with it, put it in your baby’s 
                        bottle.   So I’ll put it to you in a way 
                        even a USC grad can understand...

           Andy opens the bottle of Windex.  Pours a WINDEX SHOT.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Can you say the same thing about Windex?

           He slides the Windex shot across the table.  It stops in 
           front of them.  They look at each other, smile. 

                                 SUIT #1
                        Very impressive.

                                 ANDY
                        I have an extensive business plan as well 
                        as investors, insurance --

                                 SUIT #1
                        Unfortunately, we just don’t have any 
                        shelf space for this in our stores.

           Andy stops, caught off-stride for the first time.

                                 SUIT #1 (CONT’D)
                        We have existing deals with major brands--
                                 ANDY
                                 (desperate)
                        Whose products are toxic and harmful--

                                 SUIT #1
                        As well as established organic companies.  
                        But still, very impressive.  If you 
                        develop some brand recognition...

           His voice FADES into WALLA.

           ON ANDY

           Gutted.  He nods and smiles, but clearly this was not the 
           outcome he’d expected.  For the first time, he looks like 
           a lost little boy. 

                                 GIRL (O.S.)
                        Screw them.

           INT. SUSHI RESTAURANT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Andy sits at the SUSHI BAR with his girlfriend, BETHANY, 
           27.  She’s the naked girl who snuggled with him earlier.

                                 BETHANY
                        The next two weeks you’ll pitch your cute 
                        little ass off all over the country.  
                        Everyone is gonna love you.

                                 ANDY
                        Thank you.

                                 BETHANY
                        You know how I know?  Because I love you.

           She smiles at him, huge. Andy hesitates, then:

                                 ANDY
                        Thank you. 

                                 BETHANY
                        Oh, I almost forgot!  If you’re back in 
                        time, Pete and Shelly are doing a co-ed
                        wedding shower two weeks from Saturday.

                                 ANDY
                                 (dying)
                        Awesome.

           She holds out sushi.  He waves her off.  She eats it.
                                 BETHANY
                        What a boyfriend.  Doesn’t like sushi, 
                        takes me here anyway.  God, I love you.

                                 ANDY
                        Awwww.  That’s nice.

           Bethany smiles, turns to a SUSHI CHEF behind the bar.

                                 BETHANY
                        Can I get this wrapped to go?

                                 SUSHI CHEF
                        WRAPPED TO GO!

           The OTHER CHEF’S REPEAT in kind...

                                 CHEFS
                        WRAPPED TO GO!

           Bethany turns back to Andy, notices the look on his face.  

                                 BETHANY
                        The “I love you’s” are freaking you out, 
                        aren’t they?  Am I saying it too much?

           She clearly is.  

                                 ANDY
                        No, of course not.  

           She smiles. Andy takes a DEEP BREATH, treading carefully.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        But since you mention it: have you 
                        noticed how I respond when you say it?

                                 BETHANY
                                 (unconcerned)
                        You say “thank you.”  Or “Awww, that’s 
                        nice.”  Or you pat my head.

           Andy shakes his head, confused.  She takes his hand.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Listen, Andy.  I am completely in love 
                        with you-- Andy, don’t.

           She grabs his hand, which was instinctively heading 
           toward her head.  He puts it down.
                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Clearly you’ve got serious commitment 
                        issues. You said so when we met.  I’m 
                        giving you time. I can wait.

           He takes a DEEP BREATH, tries a different tact.

                                 ANDY
                        The thing is: I really need to focus on 
                        the business right now.

                                 BETHANY
                        And I’m totally supportive of that.

                                 ANDY
                        Yes.  Yes, you are.  Which is great. 
                                 (then)
                        But if things don’t work out on this 
                        trip, I have to start all over and then--

                                 BETHANY
                        Then we’ll figure it out together.

           She smiles.  He doesn’t. 

                                 ANDY
                        I’m gonna be honest, Beth.  You’re an 
                        amazing girl.  And I’m sure many men - 
                        men far better than me - would be head 
                        over heels in love with you.  But I’m not 
                        really interested in being in love.  Not 
                        even sure I’m capable of it.  I mean, the 
                        idea of caring about someone more than 
                        you care about yourself, of not being 
                        able to sleep unless they’re with you?  
                        It kind of makes me want to throw up.

                                 BETHANY
                        In time you’ll--

                                 ANDY
                        I won’t. I’ve been here before.  I’m 
                        content with my life.  I’m trying to get 
                        this company off the ground.  That’s 
                        really important to me.  So is having 
                        time to hang out with the guys.  And if 
                        you’re waiting for me to fall completely 
                        in love with you... you might be waiting 
                        a very, very long time.

           She nods, finally getting it.  Then...
                                 BETHANY
                        Give me a time frame.  How long?  

                                 ANDY
                        Really long.

                                 BETHANY
                        More than three years?

                                 ANDY
                        Much more.

           She goes to respond, then stops.  After a beat:

                                 BETHANY
                        What are you saying?

           Jesus, is she kidding?  Andy takes a deep breath.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m wasting your time, Beth. I think we 
                        need to take a break.  Up. We need to 
                        take a... break up.

           Now she gets it.  She turns forward, away from him.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want this to end badly.

           Bethany immediately starts getting louder.

                                 BETHANY
                        How do you want it to end, Andy!?  Should 
                        I be psyched!?  Do you want me to start 
                        doing jumping-jacks and juggle edamame!?  

                                 SUSHI CHEF
                        EDAMAME!

                                 CHEFS 
                        EDAMAME!!!

           He tries WAVING THEM OFF, turns back to Bethany:

                                 ANDY
                        You know I’m a huge fan of yours.

                                 BETHANY
                        A HUGE FAN!?  What am I, a fucking rock 
                        and roll band?

                                 SUSHI CHEF
                        ROCKIN’ ROLL!
                                 CHEFS
                        ROCKIN’ ROLL!!!

           Andy has lost control.  Bethany is on her feet. 

                                 BETHANY
                        You’re so pathetic!  

                                 ANDY
                        Maybe we should go outside... oh shit.

           Bethany is up on her chair, a woman possessed.

                                 BETHANY
                        I’d like to introduce you all to Andrew 
                        Brewster.  He’s twenty-nine, from New 
                        Jersey, and like most upper middle class 
                        boys from New Jersey, he has three-to-
                        five go-to sexual moves he rotates 
                        between on a nightly basis.

           LAUGHTER.  Andy, giving up, toasts the crowd with SAKE.  

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Keep your panties on, Girls!  Because 
                        even if you feign interest in his fantasy 
                        football team, Andy will never fall for 
                        you.  He’s incapable.  He’s...
                                 (to Chefs)
                        Say it with me, Boys: Commitment-phobic.

                                 CHEFS
                                 (confused)
                        COMMITMENT-PHOBIC!

                                 BETHANY
                        I don’t know what causes it. Maybe it’s 
                        his obsession with succeeding in the uber-
                        fascinating world of cleaning supplies.  
                        Or maybe it’s the high school girlfriend 
                        who broke his heart.  Her name’s Jessica 
                        and boy, is she fun to talk about!  
                        Whatever it is: be sure never to say “I 
                        love you.”  Andy just says “thank you.”

           Bethany gets down, steps up face-to-face with Andy.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Anything to say for yourself?

                                 ANDY
                        It’s not you it’s me?
                                 BETHANY
                        Please, Andy.  You don’t know why you’re 
                        like this any more than I do.  Figure it 
                        out before you get fat.

           She turns, walks away.

                                 ANDY
                        Bethany?

           She stops.  He knows it’s a bad idea before he says it...

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        What about your sushi?

           She gives him the finger, EXITS.  Andy turns to the bar.  
           The Chef hands him a STYROFOAM CONTAINER.  Awkward.

                                 SUSHI CHEF
                                 (weakly)
                        Wrapped to Go!

                                 (equally weak)
                        Wrapped to Go!

           INT. ANDY’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Andy walks into his apartment, exhausted.  He trudges 
           toward the ANSWERING MACHINE, stopping at his garbage can 
           where he picks up the discarded price tag from his 
           expensive suit.  As he stares at it, he hits PLAY.

                                 JOYCE (O.S.)
                        Hi Honey, Mommy.  You weren’t answering 
                        your cell.  I wanted to check I had the 
                        right flight time for tomo--

           Andy skips it.  Next message.

                                 JOYCE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Mommy again.  Forgot to tell you: I hear 
                        you can bring a ziplock bag with hair gel 
                        on the plane-

           Andy skips it again.  Another message.

                                 JOYCE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I was thinking: if you don’t have ziplock 
                        bags--

           He skips over this one as well.
                                 MACHINE
                        No more messages.

           Andy closes his eyes, spent.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. AIRPLANE - NEXT DAY

           TIGHT ON ANDY, eyes still closed.  He’s praying, 
           clutching the armrests.

                                 ANDY
                        Please God, let me survive.  If you help 
                        me, I swear I’ll try to be a better man.  

           PULL BACK: an OLDER WOMAN watches him.

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        Nervous flyer?

           Andy continues looking forward.

                                 ANDY
                        No.

           INT. NEWARK AIRPORT - LATER

           HORDES OF PEOPLE, waiting for loved ones.  Andy ENTERS 
           and takes a BREATH, bracing himself.  Then...

                                 JOYCE (O.S.)
                        ANDY!!!

           Her voice pierces.  People look over their shoulders, 
           trying to find the source.

                                 JOYCE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        ANDY!!!!  ANDY!!!  I’M OVER HERE!

           A note to reader: as Andy interacts with Joyce, please 
           keep in mind your interaction with your own mother.  When 
           it’s your mother, your fuse is always shorter than it 
           should be.  Don’t blame poor Andy.  We all do it.

           She BURSTS through!  It’s like Andy has returned from  
           ‘Nam.  She PEPPERS him with kisses.  Andy looks uneasy.

                                 ANDY
                        Okay, okay.  Ma?  Ma, stop.  Ma!
           He holds her back at arm’s length.  She clicks her 
           glasses on, getting a better look.

                                 JOYCE
                        Look at you!  You look just like a man!

                                 ANDY
                        Thank you I think.

           An OLDER WOMAN looks on, Joyce turns to her.

                                 JOYCE
                        Isn’t he handsome?

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        Very.

                                 ANDY
                                 (to older woman)
                        I’ve had work done.

                                 JOYCE
                                 (to Andy)
                        You’re wearing a sportsjacket! How did 
                        you even know how to buy a sportsjacket?

                                 ANDY
                        I took a class.
                                 (re: her glasses)
                        Those are... unusual.

           She UNCLICKS, demonstrating.

                                 JOYCE
                        They’re magnetic.  This way I can always 
                        find them.  Neat, right?
                                 (then)
                        Your hair’s so long.

           She LICKS her finger, presses down his hair.  Andy reacts 
           instantly, brushing her hand away.  She barely notices.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to waste a minute.  I know I 
                        only get you for the weekend.

                                 ANDY
                        Yep. The entire weekend. Just me and you.

           They start walking.  Joyce begins fanning herself.

                                 JOYCE
                        Is it hot in here, or is it just me?
                                 ANDY
                        It’s just you.

                                 JOYCE
                        You have no idea how awful menopause is.

                                 ANDY
                        No, but maybe one day.

           Joyce removes her jacket, thrilled by his mere presence.

                                 JOYCE
                        That sportsjacket!

                                 ANDY
                                 (calm but strong)
                        Ma, I need you to stop with the 
                        sportsjacket, okay?

           She nods, stopping herself.  Then...

                                 JOYCE
                        I made chicken!

           INT. JOYCE’S KITCHEN - LATER

           A feast of CHICKEN sits on the table, an absurd amount 
           for two people.  Andy looks around... 

           THE KITCHEN: chock-full of FROG KNICK-KNACKS: BOBBLE 
           HEADS, STATUES, NAPKIN HOLDERS, SALT SHAKERS.  All frogs.

                                 ANDY
                        You got more frogs since Thanksgiving.

                                 JOYCE
                        You wouldn’t believe how many places sell 
                        frogs.

                                 ANDY
                        Well, you seem to have found them all.

           Joyce looks at his plate, half-full. Then at hers, empty.

                                 JOYCE
                        Look at this.  How am I finished already?

                                 ANDY
                        You’re a human garbage disposal, Ma.  I 
                        really don’t know where you put it.

           She SHRUGS, content watching him eat.  A beat, then...
                                 JOYCE
                        Do you want more chicken? 

                                 ANDY
                        No, I’m good.  Thanks. 

                                 JOYCE
                        It’s your favorite.

                                 ANDY
                        It is.  I’m just getting full.

           A beat of silence.  

                                 JOYCE
                        A little piece.

           MORE CHICKEN on his plate.  Andy smiles, trying patience.  
           Pleased, Joyce downs a BOTTLE OF WATER, goes to the sink:

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I drink six bottles of water a day now.  
                        It was on Oprah.

           She begins re-filling her bottle at the sink.  She 
           rescrews the top on, puts it into the fridge.

                                 ANDY
                        What did you just do?

                                 JOYCE
                        It’s silly to pay six dollars for a case 
                        of bottles when one can last forever.

           Andy looks at his OWN HALF-EMPTY BOTTLE of water, now 
           grossed out.  He pushes it aside.  Joyce sits back down.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        So... you’re really going to drive cross 
                        country for these meetings?

                                 ANDY
                        All the way to Vegas.

                                 JOYCE
                        Renting a car will be very expensive.

                                 ANDY
                        Yes, but it will be faster than walking.

           The sarcasm brings silence.  Joyce tries a new topic.
                                 JOYCE
                        And how are things with Bethany?

                                 ANDY
                        They’re okay.

                                 JOYCE
                        What happened?

                                 ANDY
                        Nothing.

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m your mother.  I know when you’re 
                        lying.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m not lying.
                                 (changing course)
                        What about you?  Are you, you know, 
                        seeing anyone?

                                 JOYCE
                        Don’t be disgusting, Andy.

           And that ends that topic.  She looks at his plate.  

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I wish you’d eat more chicken.

           Andy STANDS, willing himself not to lose it.

                                 ANDY
                        Okay, I think I’m gonna call it a night.

           Joyce turns, surprised.  That quick?

                                 JOYCE
                        I got out the old home movies. I thought 
                        we could watch them. Wouldn’t that be 
                        fun?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, I’m just wiped, Ma.  I should get 
                        to bed, get my clock adjusted. 

           Joyce smiles weakly, disappointed.  Andy smiles weakly, 
           knowing he’s disappointed her. A true mother-son dynamic.

           INT. ANDY’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Andy ENTERS his bedroom, carrying his suitcase. 
           It’s like a SHRINE to Andrew Brewster.  PHOTOS of Andy 
           line shelves and dressers.  He looks at one:

           A PROM PHOTO: young Andy with a PRETTY GIRL.

           Andy approaches his BED.  It bears the baseball sheets a 
           ten year old might use, as well as an old stuffed animal.  
           In the center of the bed: a SHOPPING BAG.

                                 JOYCE (O.S.)
                        I picked up underwear for you at the Gap.  

           Joyce stands at the door.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to try it on now, I know 
                        you’re tired.

                                 ANDY
                        Thanks.

           Joyce stands there.  Andy doesn’t know what she wants.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Okay.  Well, good night, Ma.

                                 JOYCE
                        Andy?

                                 ANDY
                        Yes?

                                 JOYCE
                        Just... if you could try on the underwear 
                        sometime in the next two days--

                                 ANDY
                        Okay, Ma.

                                 JOYCE
                        Because if it doesn’t fit we can exchange 
                        it while you’re here--

                                 ANDY
                                 (stronger)
                        Okay, Ma!  Jesus!

           She stops, smiles weakly.

                                 JOYCE
                        Right.  Sorry.  Good night, Sweetie.
           Joyce EXITS.  Andy sits, guilty.  He feels something, 
           reaches beneath him.  He’d sat on the stuffed animal.

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Andy tosses and turns in the small twin bed.  He looks to 
           his nightstand: the same original PHOTO of he and Joyce.

           He SIGHS, guilty.  Lies there for a moment.  Gets up.

           INT. JOYCE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Her door is OPEN a crack.  Andy speaks as he ENTERS.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m sorry I snapped, it’s been a rough--

           REVEAL JOYCE

           Sleeping, in her seated position.  Glasses still on.  Two 
           M&M wrappers in her lap.  To her side, a small TV: 

           ON THE TELEVISION

           An old HOME MOVIE.  A YOUNG JOYCE sits in a chair holding 
           a BABY, completely absorbed.  A MAN (off camera) directs.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        How long do you want me to film this?

                                 JOYCE
                        Just a few more minutes, please.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Would you at least talk or something?

           She never stops looking at BABY ANDY.

                                 JOYCE
                        He’s perfect, isn’t he?

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Okay, that’s it.

           The camera goes off.

           ON ANDY

           Now even more guilty.  He SHUTS OFF the TV.  He 
           approaches Joyce, removes the M&M’s from her lap, 
           unclicks her reading glasses, and turns off the light.
           INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING

           JOYCE sits at the table, reading the PAPER.  Andy ENTERS.  

                                 ANDY
                        I’m sorry I was short last night, Ma.

           She WAVES him off.

                                 JOYCE
                        We can return the underwear. You probably 
                        buy your own underwear now. 
                                 (then)
                        So, what do you want to do today?

                                 ANDY
                        I don’t know.  Whatever you want.

                                 JOYCE
                        Well, maybe we’ll go to the mall to 
                        return the underwear.

           Andy cracks his neck, trying patience.  

                                 ANDY
                        What do you do on a normal Saturday?

                                 JOYCE
                        I usually hit garage sales in the 
                        morning, look for frogs.  And there’s a 
                        gas station in Marborough with cheap gas, 
                        so I try and get there to fill up.  If 
                        there’s time, at night I go to a movie. 

           Andy perks up.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah?  Who with?

                                 JOYCE
                        Well, sometimes Ruth if Jerry’s tired.  
                        Usually I just go by myself.

           There it is: the saddest image of all time.  Andy’s 
           mother spends her weekends hunting for cheap gasoline and 
           going by herself to the movies.  

                                 ANDY
                        I can’t believe I’m saying this but: you 
                        really need to meet some men, Ma. 
                                 JOYCE
                        I was married twenty years, Andy.  I did 
                        my time.  I’ll be damned if I’m going to 
                        spend Saturday night at some pathetic 
                        singles event that they advertise in the 
                        paper like a garage sale.

           Andy SIGHS, looks at her PAPER.  The spark of an idea.

           INT. RESTAURANT/BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Andy and Joyce ENTER a HALL outside the bar.  Joyce wears 
           a DRESS, looking nice... and really uncomfortable.   
           There’s a folding table set up. A chipper HEAVY-SET WOMAN 
           sits behind it, checking people in.  Andy APPROACHES.

                                 ANDY
                        We’re here for the “Mature Singles” 
                        Event.

           She looks confused by Andy.  She quickly covers.

                                 WOMAN
                        Welcome!  My name is Jane and--

           Joyce steps forward, almost militant.

                                 JOYCE
                        How much does this thing cost?

                                 JANE
                        It’s twenty dollars a person-- 

           Instantly, Joyce turns to go. Andy stops her. She GROANS.

                                 JOYCE
                        For forty dollars Steve McQueen better be 
                        back from the dead in there.

           INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

           They ENTER the SMALL BAR. The crowd is entirely FIFTY to 
           SIXTY YEAR OLD’S.  Men on one side, women on the other.  
           It’s like a junior high dance... with “mature singles.”

                                 ANDY
                        You want a drink?  A nice glass of wine?

                                 JOYCE
                        Water.  The free kind.  And you too.  
                        We’ve wasted enough money already.
                                 ANDY
                        Well this is gonna be fun.

           Andy approaches the bar. TWO EARLY 50’s WOMEN notice him.  
           They’re dressed to the hilt, drinking appletinis. Tipsy.

                                 WOMAN #1
                        Hi, I’m...
                                 (pointing at name-tag)
                        Marjorie  And this is...
                                 (at hers)
                        Ruth.

                                 ANDY
                        Hi.

                                 MARJORIE
                        And you must be...
                                 (at his)
                        Andrew.

           The women GIGGLE, trying, one would guess, to flirt.  
           Andy is suddenly really uncomfortable.

                                 MARJORIE (CONT’D)
                        How long you been with “Mature Singles?”

                                 ANDY
                        I’m just here for my Mom.  First time.  

                                 RUTH
                        Ooooh, a virgin.

           Marjorie and Ruth LAUGH and CLINK glasses.  Andy looks 
           nauseous.  He tries waving over a BARTENDER to no avail. 

                                 MARJORIE
                        Jimmy!  Andrew here needs a drink.

           The bartender NODS.  Andy turns, looks back toward...

           ON JOYCE

           Across the bar.  Talking to a MAN.

           BACK TO ANDY

           Huh.  That’s good.  Ruth notices.

                                 RUTH
                        Leave her be.  The sharks already smell 
                        blood.  You’re not going anywhere.
           Ruth PUSHES Andy down into a BARSTOOL..

           BACK TO JOYCE

           Across the room, mid-conversation with a BALD MAN.  

                                 BALD MAN
                        Anyway, my youngest and I are close, but 
                        I haven’t spoken to the oldest in a few 
                        years.  What else?  I’m in real estate--

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m not interested.

                                 BALD MAN
                        Oh... can I ask why?

                                 JOYCE
                        What kind of man doesn’t talk to his 
                        daughter because she sided with her 
                        mother in a divorce?  She’s the child, be 
                        a parent for God’s sake!

           JUMP-CUTS:

           As Joyce turns down various suitors:

           A GOOD-LOOKING MAN:

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Divorced three times and you’re back for 
                        more?  What the hell is wrong with you?

           A DORKY MAN:

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Honestly, if I was your first wife I’d 
                        probably have been frigid as well.

           A TOUPEE MAN:

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Only thing more absurd than a man your 
                        age driving a Porsche is that hairpiece.

           MEANWHILE:

           Andy sits at the bar, doing shots with his new friends.  
           A GROUP OF OLDER WOMEN have gathered around him.  He 
           seems to be enjoying the attention... and getting drunk.
                                 ANDY
                        So, I ended things with her.  It just 
                        wasn’t happening, you know?  It never 
                        seems to happen for me. 

           The women COO.  A HAND enters, grabs Andy.  It’s JANE, 
           the check-in lady.

                                 JANE
                        I’m going to have to ask you to leave.

                                 MARJORIE
                        Relax, Jane.  We’re just having some fun 
                        with the boy.  He’s more entertaining 
                        than the usual ninnies.

                                 JANE
                        It’s not him.  It’s his mother. 

           ON JOYCE:

           HOLDING COURT in front of a large group of MEN AND WOMEN.

                                 JOYCE
                        The only reason these men are here is 
                        because they’re not rich or attractive 
                        enough to date someone young enough to be 
                        their daughter.

           Women NOD in agreement.  MEN look uncomfortable.  Andy 
           approaches, puts his hand on his mother’s shoulder.

                                 ANDY
                        Okay, Ma.  Time to go.

           He begins leading her away.  She turns back.

                                 JOYCE
                        They’re damaged goods, Ladies.  You’re 
                        buying broken floor samples for half off 
                        and hoping no one will notice the nicks 
                        and scratches and stains.  

                                 ANDY
                        It’s nice meeting you all--

                                 JOYCE
                        Show me one man in here you find 
                        interesting, there’s a woman out there 
                        who can’t stand him.  It’s a fact.

           Andy pushes his mother out of the room.  We stay in there 
           for a beat.  After a moment, a MAN approaches TWO WOMEN.
                                 MAN
                        She was a prize, huh?

                                 WOMAN #1
                        Get away from me.

                                 WOMAN #2
                        Bastard.

           JOYCE’S KITCHEN - LATER

           Andy and Joyce sit, eating ICE CREAM in silence.

                                 ANDY
                        That went well, I think.

           Joyce goes to the sink, RE-FILLS her WATER BOTTLE.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        You’ll never meet anybody like this, Ma.

                                 JOYCE
                        You know what it comes down to, Andy?  
                        M&M’s in bed. For twenty years I couldn’t 
                        enjoy my M&M’s.  I hid them under my 
                        pillow, waiting for your father to fall 
                        asleep so he couldn’t judge me. I will 
                        never hide M&M’s again.
                                 (then)
                        And you’re one to give relationship 
                        advice.  Now: what happened with Bethany?  
                        And don’t lie to me, I’m your mother.

           Andy gives up, exhausted.

                                 ANDY
                        She just... wasn’t the one.
                                 (off her look)
                        What do you want me to tell you, Ma? 

                                 JOYCE
                        That at some point I’m going to have a 
                        daughter-in-law, preferably one whose 
                        parents are dead so I don’t have to share 
                        my grandchildren.

                                 ANDY
                        Maybe I’m not wired for that, Ma.  I 
                        mean, I appreciate what some of my 
                        friends have - marriage, kids - but... 
                        it’s like jazz.  
                                      (MORE)
                                      ANDY (CONT'D)
                        I recognize that it’s amazing music, but 
                        it still gives me a headache.
                                 (off her look)
                        Maybe I just enjoy eating my M&M’s alone 
                        in bed, too.

                                 JOYCE
                        Oh please.

                                 ANDY
                        What? Why is okay for you and not for me?

                                 JOYCE
                        Because I’ve lived my life, Andy.  I had 
                        my marriage, my family. I went to the 
                        dance and now I’m tired.  But you?  
                        You’re just skipping the dance entirely. 

                                 ANDY
                        I’m told I have commitment issues.

                                 JOYCE
                        That’s true, you do.  One very big issue.

                                 ANDY
                        Bethany says I’m obsessed with my work. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Nope.  That’s not it.

           Andy pauses, confused.

                                 ANDY
                        Also my high school relationship with 
                        Jessica.

                                 JOYCE
                        Uh uh.  Wrong issue.
                                 (then)
                        I guess it’s time. You want to know 
                        what’s wrong with you, Andy? 

           Andy looks at her, waiting:

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I cursed you.

           Andy half-smiles, unsure.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m sorry... you cursed me?
           Note to reader: As Joyce tells her story, we never leave 
           her.  It is told in one continuous shot, requiring no 
           flashbacks, no cutaways. Story-telling at its purest.

                                 JOYCE
                        I was cross-eyed when I was little.  Kids 
                        were relentless.  Joyce-Eye.  That was my 
                        name.  Eventually it got fixed, but... I 
                        always felt like Joyce-Eye, you know? 

           She pauses, lost for a moment.  Takes a SIP of water.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Boys started talking to me, but I was so 
                        shy. Never had a date.  Never went to 
                        prom.  When I turned eighteen, I left.  I 
                        moved to Manhattan, got a job, and I 
                        thought: “Look Joyce!  You’re living in 
                        New York, everything is going to change!”  
                        But it didn’t. I was in this strange 
                        city, no friends. I think about it now...

           She stops. A moment of reflection.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I dreaded vacation time.  Two weeks with 
                        nothing to do.  One day I decided I’d go 
                        some place hot and at least it would feel 
                        like... like I was doing something.  So I 
                        borrowed Grandma’s car and drove to 
                        Florida.  That became my vacation.  One 
                        week a year, every year. Sad, right?  A 
                        nineteen year old girl going on vacation 
                        by herself?  But I kept going.  Twenty 
                        years old.  Twenty-one.  And then...

           She smiles, lost in the memory.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I met a boy, Andy.  And he was just so... 
                        nice. And he invited me to dinner and we 
                        talked and talked and I remember - God, I 
                        can’t believe I remember this - there was 
                        a band at the restaurant and he got me to 
                        go on stage with him and sing.  In front 
                        of the entire restaurant.  Little Joyce-
                        Eye. I was SINGING.  

           She pauses.  She’s now almost speaking to herself.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        And he told me I was beautiful.  He was 
                        the first man who ever told me that.  
                                      (MORE)
                                      JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        He said that he was embarrassed being out 
                        with me because I was too beautiful for 
                        him.  Turned out, he lived in Manhattan.  
                        A music exec.  So we started seeing each 
                        other.  And I was happy. God, I’d never 
                        been so... happy.
                                 (a beat, then)
                        But I knew something wasn’t right.  He 
                        worked too much, he had pictures of an 
                        old girlfriend around.  But I didn’t 
                        care.  I just loved being around him.  
                                 (a beat, then)
                        I did want a family, though. A baby.  
                        That was all I really ever wanted.  And 
                        eventually your father came along.  This 
                        larger than life charmer.  He told me... 

           She LAUGHS.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        He told me he was going to marry me on 
                        our first date. On our third he told me 
                        he loved me. Someone actually loved me!  
                        I liked the boy from Florida too much to 
                        stop dating him, though.  I’d never had a 
                        boyfriend, now I had two!  Your father 
                        proposed within like a month.  I said 
                        yes.  I figured, he’s nice.  He loves me. 
                        What else do I need? God, I was so young. 

           She shakes her head, continues.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I went to the other boy and said: “I met 
                        somebody, and he asked me to marry him,” 
                        hoping, I guess, I don’t know - I guess I 
                        was hoping he’d say, “No, Joyce! You 
                        can’t marry him!  I’ll marry you.”  
                                 (a beat)
                        But he didn’t.  He told me I was 
                        “wonderful” but he couldn’t offer me a 
                        commitment.  He told me I should marry 
                        your father. And I told him I couldn’t 
                        see him anymore. I never saw him again.

           She looks at the table for a moment, studying it. 

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I married your father.  We started 
                        fighting, about stupid things.  I knew 
                        things weren’t right... but I made my 
                        bed, you know?  After a year or so, I got 
                        pregnant.  
                                      (MORE)
                                      JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        And when we found out we were going to 
                        have a boy, we started going through 
                        names, as you do.  You want your child’s 
                        name to remind you of something positive, 
                        you know? 
                                 (then, matter-of-fact)
                        So I named you Andy, after the boy from 
                        Florida.

           ON ANDY

           Shock isn’t the right word.  Yes, the mouth hanging open, 
           the inability to speak, it presents itself as shock. But 
           this is more. This is a world crashing upon itself and 
           being rebuilt in the span of one story.  It’s your mother 
           as a human being, it’s your father as the anti-hero, it’s 
           learning about your namesake... and, a curse:

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        You remind me of him sometimes, Andy.  I 
                        really do believe you’ve been cursed with 
                        the same fear of commitment as he was; 
                        the thing that prevented me from winding 
                        up with the man who may have been the 
                        love of my life.

           Andy can’t move.  He opens his mouth, nothing comes out. 

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                                 (nonchalant)
                        You want more ice cream?

           Andy NODS, stunned.  She goes to the fridge.  Finally...

                                 ANDY
                        Holy shit.

                                 JOYCE
                        Andy!

                                 ANDY
                        Does Dad know?

                                 JOYCE
                        It’s not exactly something I felt I could 
                        share.

                                 ANDY
                        Holy shit.  

                                 JOYCE
                        Stop that!

           Andy continues taking it in.
                                 ANDY
                        He’s not... he’s not my father is he?

                                 JOYCE
                        Oh please.  

           Andy RUBS his HEAD.

                                 ANDY
                        What was his last name?

                                 JOYCE
                        Margolis. Andy Margolis from J&R Records.

           Joyce STANDS.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Anyhow that’s what’s wrong with you.  I 
                        cursed you.  

           Andy stares off into space, taking it all in.

           INT. ANDY’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Andy lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.  Sleep is not 
           happening.  He gets up, walks into...

           INT. JOYCE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Where Joyce, once again, lies in her seated sleeping 
           position, snoring.  Her glasses on, a book on her chest.  
           Andy reaches down, grabs an M&M wrapper.  Looks at it.

           INT. ANDY’S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Andy lies on his side, not having slept.  He’s staring at 
           the same M&M Wrapper: the candy wrapper has become a 
           symbol of everything - his mother’s lonely existence.  
           His commitment issues.  It’s as if it’s judging him.  He 
           reaches down, pulls out his laptop.

           ON SCREEN:

           He GOOGLES listings for the name “ANDREW MARGOLIS.”  
           There are way TOO MANY.  He thinks, tries “J&R RECORDS.”  
           A LISTING in New York City.  It has a WEB-SITE.  He 
           clicks on it.  A PHONE NUMBER.  

           He looks out his door, the coast is clear.  He takes out 
           his CELL (SPEAKERPHONE).  Dials.  It RINGS.
                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        J&R Records.

                                 ANDY
                        Hi... I’m trying to track down someone 
                        who may have worked there years ago?  
                        Name’s Andy, or Andrew, Margolis.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Hold on... okay, I see an Andrew Margolis 
                        in our San Francisco offices.

                                 ANDY
                        No kidding?  And how long ago was that?

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        No, Sir.  Mr. Margolis is an executive VP
                        in our San Francisco office.  Currently.

           Andy almost drops the phone.  No freakin’ way.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Would you like to be connected?

                                 ANDY
                        Uh, yeah, okay.

           The phone starts RINGING.  Andy looks over his shoulder, 
           as if fearing someone is playing a practical joke on him.  

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        J&R Records. 

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, uh, Andrew Margolis’ office please?

           Hold music.  Andy’s mouth drops.  Can it be this simple?  
           A phone RINGS.  After a few rings...

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Andrew Margolis’ office.

                                 ANDY
                        Jesus!  Seriously?
                                 (then)
                        I’m sorry, hi.  Is, uh, Andrew in?

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Mr. Margolis is on vacation until a week 
                        from Monday.  This is Becky.  
                                 ANDY
                        Oh.  Okay.  Becky, I’m an... old friend 
                        of his.  I’m trying to track him down.  

                                 BECKY (O.S.)
                        I can leave a message.  Your name please?

           Andy pauses, then...

                                 ANDY
                        Frank.  Franklin.  Frank Franklin.
                                 (then, double-checking)
                        This is Andrew Margolis who used to be at 
                        the New York office, right?

                                 BECKY (O.S.)
                        He transferred out here three years ago.

                                 ANDY
                        Jesus!

           Confused silence.  Andy figures out what to ask...

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        So, uh, ol’ Andy finally took the wife on 
                        vacation, huh?

                                 BECKY (O.S.)
                        Uh, Mr. Margolis isn’t married, Sir.

                                 ANDY
                        No freakin’ way.
                                 (then, covering)
                        Still hasn’t settled down, huh?

                                 BECKY (O.S.)
                        Everyone’s tried, trust me.

                                 ANDY
                        And where’s Andy living out there?  Bet 
                        he’s got a nice spread in his old age.

                                 BECKY (O.S.)
                                 (getting uncomfortable)
                        Nob Hill.  Sir, is there a specific 
                        message you’d like to leave?

                                 ANDY
                        No.  Week from Monday, right?  I’ll--

           Joyce ENTERS.  Andy quickly shuts the phone.
                                 JOYCE
                        You want an omelette?

                                 ANDY
                        Fantastic.

           She EXITS.  One she’s gone, Andy grabs the COMPUTER.  

           ON SCREEN:

           He GOOGLES again.  This time, he adds: SAN FRANCISCO.

           BAM. A listing!  Andrew Margolis in Nob Hill.  He 
           scribbles down the info and DIALS.  It RINGS a few times.

                                 ANSWERING MACHINE
                        It’s Andrew.  I’m gone till Monday, leave 
                        a message or try Becky at the office.

           Andy slams down the phone.  It’s HIM!

                                 ANDY
                        Holy shit.

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Andy sits eating breakfast, ravenous.  Joyce watches him.

                                 JOYCE
                        I’ve never seen you eat like this.  It 
                        does my heart good.

           Joyce grabs a bunch of BUSINESS CARDS scattered around 
           the table, heads to the garbage with them.  Andy notices. 

                                 ANDY
                        What’s that?

                                 JOYCE
                        Business cards from those men last night. 
                        As if a business card will convince me 
                        they’re not revolting. 

           She tosses them in the garbage and stops at the kitchen 
           counter, rearranging THREE BOBBLE HEAD FROGS in a 
           perfectly straight line.  Andy watches.  There’s an 
           innate sadness in the simultaneous move of tossing away 
           the business cards and arranging the frogs. 

                                 ANDY
                        I want to ask you something, Ma.
           He braces himself for what he’s about to ask.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Thing is: I leave tomorrow for this trip 
                        and...

           Is he really going to do this?  

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        I was thinking... maybe you’d want to 
                        come?

                                 JOYCE
                        Huh?

                                 ANDY
                        It’s a lot of driving.  I could use 
                        company.

           Joyce isn’t quite understanding this.

                                 JOYCE
                        You want to drive cross-country?  In a 
                        car?  With your mother?

           Andy NODS, nauseous.

                                 ANDY
                        You won’t be gone long.  I have to be in 
                        San Francisco in eight days.  My last 
                        meeting is in San Francisco now.

                                 JOYCE
                        Andy, if this is you worrying about me--

                                 ANDY
                        It’s not.  It’s just... we never get to 
                        spend time together.
                                 (a beat)
                        I want to get to know you better.

           Music to a mother’s ears.  But she’s still confused.

                                 JOYCE
                        You want to spend a week in a car?  With 
                        me?

           Andy looks like he might throw up.

                                 ANDY
                        Yes.

           Joyce thinks about it.
                                 JOYCE
                        I’d have to cancel my mail.

                                 ANDY
                        Okay.

                                 JOYCE
                        I’ll miss book club.

                                 ANDY
                                 (losing it)
                        Ma, do you want to come or not!?

           The moment of choice.  She jumps up!

                                 JOYCE
                        This will be so much fun!

           She PEPPERS him with kisses. 

           ON ANDY

           Horrified and smothered.  What the hell has he done?

           INT. JOYCE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Joyce packs a gargantuan suitcase, filled with clothing, 
           books, M&M’s.  She stuffs empty water bottles on top.

           PULL BACK to Andy, sitting on the corner of the bed 
           watching.  Horrified.  He’s got MAPS in front of him. 

           Joyce puts her weight down on it, manages to close it.

                                 ANDY
                        You’re only going to be gone a week, Ma.

                                 JOYCE
                        I require layers.  You know me with my 
                        hot flashes. 

                                 ANDY
                        I do.

                                 JOYCE
                        Menopause is not fun, Andy.

                                 ANDY
                        Can you please not say that word?

                                 JOYCE
                        Menopause?
                                 ANDY
                        That’s the one.

                                 JOYCE
                        Why?

                                 ANDY
                        It’s out of my comfort zone.

           She SHRUGS, pulls out a second monstrous bag and begins 
           filling it.  Andy looks away in horror, turns to his map.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got three meetings tomorrow: Babies 
                        R’ Us, Linens and Things, and Pathmark.

                                 JOYCE
                        I love Pathmark.

                                 ANDY
                        I’ll let them know.  Next day, I’ve got a 
                        meeting in Roanoke, Virginia.

           Joyce tries making it sounds exotic.

                                 JOYCE
                        Roanoke.

           Andy looks at her, confused.  Presses on.

                                 ANDY
                        Walmart is next.  That’s the big one.  To 
                        make it to Little Rock in time we need to 
                        get to about Tennessee by Tuesday--

                                 JOYCE
                        You know who lives in Tennessee, right?

                                 ANDY
                        I do.  After that--  

                                 JOYCE
                        Jessica.  In Memphis.  Diana just visited 
                        her.  She said it was lovely.

           Andy takes a DEEP BREATH, ignores her.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m sure it is.  From Arkansas, we head 
                        to Santa Fe.  One pitch, then Vegas.

                                 JOYCE
                        A mom and her baby boy in Vegas.
                                 ANDY
                        I think that’s their new slogan.  QVC is 
                        having an open call there, so I 
                        registered.  It’s a longshot.

                                 JOYCE
                        I once bought a frog on QVC.

                                 ANDY
                        Well, hopefully that will help.  Then
                        San Francisco, then we’re done.

                                 JOYCE
                        What meeting is in San Francisco?

           Andy stops.  There’s no store.  Only Andy Margolis.

                                 ANDY
                        A small chain.  Not a big deal.  

           Joyce zips up her rapidly expanding second suitcase.

                                 JOYCE
                        What did I forget?

                                 ANDY
                        I think you have everything.  Literally.  

           INT. HERTZ RENTAL CAR - NEXT MORNING

           Andy and Joyce wait in LINE, her luggage piled in front.

                                 JOYCE
                        Andy?

                                 ANDY
                        Yes, Ma?

                                 JOYCE
                        Ask them if they take Triple A.

                                 ANDY
                        Okay.

                                 JOYCE
                        Because sometimes if you have Triple A 
                        you can get a nice discount.

                                 ANDY
                        I’ll ask.
           A HERTZ AGENT MOTIONS for them to step up.  They 
           approach.  The agent is young and exceedingly chipper.

                                 AGENT
                        Hi, I’m Mark, I’ll be assisting you 
                        today!  Do you have a reservation?

                                 ANDY
                        I do.  Last name Brewster.

           Mark TYPES away.

                                 MARK
                        There you are.  I just need a valid 
                        license and credit card.

           Andy digs in his wallet.  Joyce nudges Andy, mouths the 
           words “Triple A.”  He waves her off, “give me a second.”

                                 ANDY
                        I wanted to double-check that I’m getting 
                        an SUV with a GPS system.

                                 MARK
                        I’ve got you in a Dodge Durango, GPS 
                        included, returning in San Francisco.

           Joyce grabs Andy, whispers.

                                 JOYCE
                        Do you really need to spend for an SUV? 

                                 ANDY
                        We could hit snow, Ma.

                                 MARK
                        That comes out to $112 dollars a day--

                                 JOYCE
                                 (under her breath)
                        Ask him about Triple A.

           Andy motions “wait a second.”  He’s trying to listen.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Eight days, for a total, including tax, 
                        drop-off fee, and mileage... $1432.41

           Before Andy can open his mouth...

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        WE HAVE TRIPLE A.
                                 MARK
                        Oh, good!  That actually saves you 
                        fifteen percent off.

           Joyce smiles at Andy: you see?

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        And brings it down to... $1212.12.  

                                 JOYCE
                        I still don’t think we need an SUV.

                                 ANDY
                        Ma, please.  It could snow. Plus we need 
                        a GPS.

                                 JOYCE
                        Small cars are fine in snow.  And maybe 
                        they’ll have GPS.

                                 ANDY
                        They won’t have GPS, Ma!

                                 MARK
                        Actually, many of our economy cars do 
                        come equipped with GPS.  And they handle 
                        relatively well in snow.

           Andy looks up.  Mark beams at him. 

                                 ANDY
                        Thank you, Mark.

           INT. FORD FOCUS - MINUTES LATER

           Joyce’s luggage fills the backseat of the TINY FORD 
           FOCUS.  Joyce drives.  Andy looks miserable, cramped.  He 
           begins inputting an address in the GPS SYSTEM. 

                                 ANDY
                        You sure you don’t mind driving?

                                 JOYCE
                        Work on your presentation.  I’ve got my 
                        book-on-tape.  Let me just get organized.

           Andy looks up.

           ON JOYCE

           Who begins her driving preparation.  It’s like watching 
           an astronaut prepare for liftoff:
           (1) She OPENS a small SQUARE BAG: it holds TWO BOTTLED 
           WATERS.  (2) She PLACES ONE BOTTLE in each of the two CUP 
           HOLDERS.  (3) She REACHES back, picks up a BOOK-ON-TAPE 
           CASING. (4) She OPENS the CASING, revealing SIXTEEN 
           CASSETTES.  (5) She CLICKS ON her READING GLASSES from 
           around her neck, finds the correct tape. (6) She UNCLICKS 
           her reading glasses, GRABS a pair of SUNGLASSES from the 
           dash.  (7) She REMOVES a BLUETOOTH HEADSET from her 
           purse.  (8) She PUSHES a button on it, listens.  Frowns. 
           9) She REMOVES her SUNGLASSES, clicks back on the READING 
           GLASSES, ANALYZES the bluetooth. (10) Problem corrected, 
           she UNCLICKS the reading glasses.  Sunglasses back on.

           ON ANDY

           Watching her, horrified.  Finally...

                                 ANDY
                        Expecting an important call?

                                 JOYCE
                        There’s a hands-free law in New Jersey 
                        now.  

                                 ANDY
                        Oh.  Okay.

           He finishes inputting an address in the GPS SYSTEM.

                                 GPS
                                 (robotic)
                        Finding destination.

           Joyce acts as if she’s discovered a new form of life.

                                 JOYCE
                        LOOK AT THAT!  IT TALKS!

           Andy looks at her, confused.  She pops in the BOOK-ON-
           TAPE.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        It’s called Middlesex.  It’s about a 
                        hermaphrodite.  Oprah loved it.

                                 ANDY
                        Well, then I’m sure I will.

                                 JOYCE
                        Here we go.  The adventure begins!

           Joyce POPS IN the TAPE, starts the car, and pulls out.
                                 BOOK ON TAPE
                        This begins Tape One, Side A, of 
                        Middlesex...
                                 (then)
                        I was born twice: first, as a baby girl, 
                        on a remarkably smogless Detroit day in 
                        January of 1960, and then again, as a 
                        teenage boy--

                                 JOYCE 
                        Is it me, or is it very hot in here?

                                 ANDY 
                        Let’s just assume it’s always just you.

                                 GPS 
                        Turn right in two hundred feet.

           Joyce SCREAMS, surprised by the GPS.

           INT. FORD FOCUS - LATER

           Joyce DRIVES on the highway.  Andy tries reading his 
           paperwork, but is distracted by...

           THE-BOOK-ON-TAPE.

           One VOICE does every character, driving Andy nuts.  And 
           the sexual content is clearly making him uncomfortable.

                                 BOOK-ON-TAPE
                        She had never rested her head in a man’s 
                        lap before.  She’d never slept like 
                        spoons, encircled by a man’s arms; she’d 
                        never experienced a man getting hard 
                        against her--

           Andy EJECTS the tape, unable to take anymore.

                                 ANDY
                        Why don’t we take a little break?

           Joyce shrugs.  They drive in silence.  Then...

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        So... I’ve been thinking about Andy 
                        Margolis, Ma.  Aren’t you at all curious 
                        what happened to him?  

                                 JOYCE
                        It’s in the past, Andy.
                                 ANDY
                        But you wouldn’t want to see him?  I bet 
                        I could track him down on the net. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Don’t you dare.  He’s probably fat and 
                        bald and middle-aged and obnoxious now.  
                        I like remembering him how he was when--

           THE GPS interrupts...

                                 GPS
                        Exit highway in one mile.

           Joyce SCREAMS, swerves the car.  A car blasts a HORN.

                           ANDY
                                                        JOYCE
           MA!
                                             TURN THAT THING OFF!  IT 
                                             COMES OUT OF NOWHERE! 

                                 GPS (CONT’D)
                        Exit in .5 Miles.

                           ANDY
                                                        JOYCE
           Ma, you have to merge to 
           the right. 
                                             I can’t concentrate with 
                                             that thing yelling at me!

                                 GPS (CONT’D)
                        Exit in 500 feet.

                                                         ANDY
                           JOYCE
           That exit is not 500 feet.
                                             It was when it said it.

                                 GPS (CONT’D)
                        Exit, 100 feet.

                                                         ANDY
                                             Ma, get off here!
                           JOYCE
           I’m telling you that’s not 
           far enough!

                                 GPS (CONT’D)
                        Exit, now.

                           JOYCE
           IT’S NOT ONE HUNDRED FEET!
                                                         ANDY
                                             IT IS!  GET OFF!

                                 GPS (CONT’D)
                        EXIT, EXIT!

                           JOYCE
                                                         ANDY
           SHUT UP!
                                             MA!
           Joyce SWERVES onto the exit ramp.  A car blasts a HORN.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BABIES R’ US WAITING ROOM - LATER

           They sit in silence, next to each other.  A long beat.

                                 ANDY
                        I think I’ll drive the rest of the way.

           Silence.  Joyce looks at a PRETTY RECEPTIONIST.

                                 JOYCE
                        The receptionist is pretty.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m focusing here, Ma.

           Joyce looks disappointed, not sure what to do.  She LICKS 
           her finger, presses down a piece of his hair.  As usual 
           he bats her hand away without looking up.

                                 JOYCE
                        Your show is going to be great.

                                 ANDY
                        Pitch, Ma. It’s called a pitch. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Mr. Brewster?  They’re ready for you.

           Andy STANDS, heads to a door.  Joyce’s voice stops him.

                                 JOYCE
                        Good luck, Sweetheart! 

           Andy turns slowly, dying.

                                 ANDY
                        Thank you, Ma.

           He EXITS. 

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           THE WAITING ROOM - LATER

           Andy RE-ENTERS, finds Joyce standing up front, talking 
           the receptionist’s ear off.  He doesn’t look happy.
                                 JOYCE
                        How’d it go?

           Andy shakes his head.  Not well.  Joyce frowns, covers...

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        We still have a lot more meetings.

                                 ANDY
                        Yes.  “We” do.

           Andy turns to go.  Joyce stops him.

                                 JOYCE
                        I was telling Amanda here about our 
                        little adventure.  How you wanted to 
                        spend time with your mother.

                                 AMANDA
                        I think what you’re doing is great.  I’d 
                        love to take a trip with my Mom.

           Andy smiles weakly, clearly not in the mood.  

                                 JOYCE
                        Amanda is single, Andy.

           Andy closes his eyes.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                                 (whispering)
                        She thinks you’re cute.  

                                 ANDY
                        Oh God.

           Amanda is looking at him, expectant.  Andy realizes.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Amanda, I’m sorry.  You seem like a very 
                        nice girl, you know, in the two plus 
                        seconds I’ve spoken to you.  But you want 
                        no part of me.  I spend the bulk of my 
                        time thinking about organic cleaning 
                        supplies.  Relationship-wise all I want 
                        is someone to hang out with on Friday 
                        nights when my friends are busy.  And 
                        even if you decide you’re fine with that, 
                        you won’t be fine with it in eight months 
                        which is when I’d start feeling bad and 
                        break up with you.  Nothing to do with 
                        you, it’s me.  
                                      (MORE)
                                      ANDY (CONT’D)
                        In fact, that’s exactly what I’d say to 
                        you in eight months when I’d break up 
                        with you.  “It’s not you, it’s me.”  So 
                        really, you’re better off.

           Andy turns, EXITS.  Joyce looks at Amanda.

                                 JOYCE
                        He’s got issues.  I cursed him.

           Amanda looks upset.  We hold for a beat, until... 

           Andy RE-ENTERS FRAME, puts a BUSINESS CARD on her desk. 

                                 ANDY
                        Your bosses asked me to leave my contact 
                        info with you just in case.

           She just glares at him.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        They really did ask that.  This isn’t me 
                        trying to get you to call me.

           Nothing from her.  Andy is dying.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        You should take that trip with your mom.  
                        It’s really great.  Really.

           As Andy sheepishly EXITS we CUE Aretha Franklin’s 
           “Freeway of Love” and begin...

           A MONTAGE:

           - A LINEN’S AND THINGS corporate office.  

           - Joyce sits in a waiting room, drinking a bottle of 
           water.  She spots a water purifier in the corner.

           - Andy does shots of Organiclean in front of stone-faced 
           SUITS.  They shake their heads “no.”

           - Joyce stands at the water purifier, filling four empty 
           water bottles.  A RECEPTIONIST watches, confused.  Andy 
           exits his meeting, sees her, and pulls her away.

           - PATHMARK offices.

           - Andy emerges from a meeting.  Joyce looks up.  His 
           expression tells the story.  Another no.  She goes to fix 
           his hair, he stops her.

           - The Focus passes a sign: “Welcome to Philadelphia.”
           - Joyce turns over a cassette of the book on tape.  Andy 
           watches, losing patience. 

           - Another sign: “Leaving Maryland, 12 miles.”  

           - Joyce fans herself, mid hot flash.  Andy watches, 
           shakes his head.  She motions: no big deal. 

           - Another sign: “Leaving Maryland, 9 miles.”

           - Joyce has her head out the window, cooling herself like 
           a dog.  

           - A gas station.  Joyce pumps gas.  Around the corner, 
           Andy quickly steals drags of a cigarette.

           - Finally, the car pulls off the highway.

           INT. HOLIDAY INN (VIRGINIA) - EVENING

           Joyce ENTERS.  She’s carrying a water bottle in one hand, 
           a purse in the other.  After a beat...

           Andy ENTERS FRAME.  He’s schlepping both of her enormous 
           bags, his own suitcase, and his laptop (around his neck).  
           He drops the luggage, unable to carry anything anymore.  
           He goes to the counter and approaches a CLERK (MAN).

                                 ANDY
                                 (exhausted)
                        Do you have rooms available?

           The Clerk tries sizing the odd couple up.  He looks from 
           Andy to Joyce (who is busy looking at a stand in front of 
           a small gift shop).

                                 JOYCE
                        Andy, look!  They have clip on frog 
                        earrings!  

           As she tries them on, the clerk WINKS at Andy.  At first 
           Andy doesn’t get it.  The clerk NODS at Joyce, smiles 
           lasciviously.  Andy is horrified.

                                 ANDY
                        I need two rooms.  One for me, one for my 
                        Mom.

           The phrase “I need two rooms” gets Joyce’s attention.  
           She joins at the counter, stopping him.
                                 JOYCE
                        Andy, don’t be ridiculous--

                                 ANDY
                        Ma, please don’t start.  I don’t mind 
                        paying for it.  I need my own room.  

           Joyce does not look happy.

           INT. ROOM - LATER

           Andy lies in bed, practicing his presentation.

                                 ANDY
                        Sir, this isn’t just showmanship.  I have 
                        investors and FDA approval. This is the 
                        kind of product you need--

                                 JOYCE (O.S.)
                        Oooh, that sounds very good, Honey.

           REVEAL Joyce, lying in an ADJACENT BED in the incredibly 
           small room.  She’s reading and eating M&M’s.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        FDA approval!  That sounds very 
                        professional.

           Andy puts down his paperwork.  It’s pointless.  

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I’m having such a nice time.  I never get 
                        to stay in nice places.  
                                 (then)
                        You know they have free continental 
                        breakfast? 

                                 ANDY
                                 (exhausted)
                        I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself, Ma.

           She notices his depression, changes tone.

                                 JOYCE
                        Everything will work out, Andy.

                                 ANDY
                        I don’t know what I’m going to do if 
                        doesn’t, Ma.  I’ve spent five years on 
                        this.  I quit my job.  
                                      (MORE)
                                      ANDY (CONT'D)
                        I invested everything I had, completely 
                        overextended myself. If this thing fails: 
                        I have... nothing.

                                 JOYCE
                        You’ll always have your mommy.

                                 ANDY
                        Yes, well, there’s always that.

           Silence.  What should she say?  She TOSSES HIM a pack of 
           M&M’s.  That’s her solution.  

           Andy looks at the snack.  Giving up, he digs in.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. ROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Light creeps in.  We REVEAL Andy and Joyce, asleep in 
           their separate beds, both covered in M&M wrappers  

           Andy gets up, tries creeping to the bathroom, hoping not 
           to wake Joyce.  Of course, that’s impossible...

                                 JOYCE
                        Don’t use the conditioner.  I want to 
                        keep that.

                                 ANDY
                        Okay.  

                                 JOYCE
                        You can take one of my books in if you 
                        have to make.

           Andy doesn’t even know how to respond to that.  He stands 
           there for beat, then trudges into the bathroom.

           EXT. OFFICE PARKING LOT (VIRGINIA) - LATER

           Andy and Joyce EXIT an office building and walk to the 
           car.  Andy looks completely dejected.  Another failure.

           INT. FORD FOCUS - CONTINUOUS

           They sit into the Focus.  Andy takes a deep breath.

                                 JOYCE
                                 (optimistic)
                        We still have Walmart, right?
                                 ANDY
                                 (dejected)
                        Yeah.

           Andy starts the car, pulls out.

                                 JOYCE
                        How far is Arkansas?

                                 ANDY
                        It’s a hike. We need to get to about 
                        Memphis by tonight.

           Before Joyce can start, he cuts her off preemptively.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Ma, please don’t start with Jessica.

                                 JOYCE
                        I didn’t say anything.  You’re very 
                        tense, Andy.  You need to relax.

           She looks to the GPS, has an idea.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I was reading the GPS manual.  Did you 
                        know it has nine different voices?  One 
                        of them is English. 

                                 ANDY
                        Go nuts, Ma.  

           Joyce starts tinkering with the GPS.  Different VOICES 
           and instructions click on and off.  Finally...

                                 GPS 
                                 (with robotic English accent)
                        Make right in 500 feet.

           Joyce SQUEALS in delight. 

                                 JOYCE
                        I did it!

           Andy looks at her.  She’s beaming.  He can’t help but 
           smile, tension diffused... for the moment.  

                                 ANDY
                        Good work, Magellan.  Let’s get to 
                        Tennessee.
           EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER

           FROM ABOVE the car continues, southbound.  Out of 
           Virginia, into Tennessee.  Bristol, then Knoxville.  

           As they do, it starts getting really dark, cloudy.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Andy drives, Joyce is listening to the book on tape...

                                 BOOK ON TAPE
                        The corset seemed to possess its own set 
                        of hands.  One was softly rubbing her 
                        between the legs.  Two more cupped her 
                        breasts--

           Andy hits EJECT.  Joyce rolls her eyes.  Andy looks 
           upwards.

                                 ANDY
                        It’s getting kind of dark, isn’t it?

           Joyce un-clicks on her glasses, looks upwards.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        It’s twenty-eight degrees out.  I hope it 
                        doesn’t snow.

                                 JOYCE
                        We’re in Tennessee, Andy.  It doesn’t 
                        snow in Tennessee.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. HIGHWAY - TWO HOURS LATER

           A torrential BLIZZARD.  From OVERHEAD, we spot our Ford 
           Focus driving along slowly, surrounded only by giant 
           trucks and SUV’s.  It looks about the size of a bicycle.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Andy is clutching the wheel, desperately trying to keep 
           the car in control.  He can’t see more than two feet in 
           front of him.  Tense silence fills the car.
                                 ANDY
                                 (muttering)
                        I can’t believe I didn’t get an SUV.  
                        What the hell was I thinking?

                                 JOYCE
                                 (gentle)
                        Andy?

                                 ANDY
                        Yes, Ma?

                                 JOYCE
                        Just drive slow.  Don’t worry about what 
                        the truckers think.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m not worried about what the truckers 
                        think, Ma.

           A PASSING TRUCK SPLATTERS SNOW over the windshield.  It 
           freezes instantly. 

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Jesus!

           Andy applies the wipers, but it’s useless.  He squints, 
           trying to see through the ice.  Joyce watches.  She wants 
           to say something but bites her tongue.  Finally...

                                 JOYCE
                        If you squirt wiper fluid it might melt 
                        the ice on the windshield.

           Andy is tense, and past the point of holding back.

                                 ANDY
                        That’s brilliant, Ma!  Yes, I should 
                        squirt more water on the windshield so it 
                        can freeze!

           She doesn’t respond, holding back.  Again, she fails...

                                 JOYCE
                        Sometimes the wiper fluid is warmer than 
                        ice--

                                 ANDY
                        You want me to squirt the fluid, Ma!  
                        Will that stop you from talking!?  Fine, 
                        I’ll squirt the fluid!
           He squirts it.  Immediately, the wipers clear the 
           windshield.  As always, Mom is right.  No “I told you so” 
           necessary.  She simply smiles.  

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Well that must feel good.

           It does, but Joyce doesn’t say it.  She changes topics.

                                 JOYCE
                        Well, the good news is we’re almost to 
                        Memphis like you wanted.  Maybe we should 
                        call Jessica, see if she knows a place--

           Out of nowhere, The car starts SHAKING.  

                                 ANDY
                        Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me!

                                 JOYCE
                        Okay, we won’t call Jessica.

                                 ANDY
                        We have a flat.  

           Andy BANGS on the wheel, losing it.  

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        God dammit! Son of a--

           Andy turns off the highway.

           EXT. EXIT RAMP - CONTINUOUS

           The Ford Focus EXITS slowly, but comes to a stop in the 
           middle of the ramp because...  

           ON THE RAMP

           A huge TRUCK just sits there.  It’s not moving. 

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Andy and Joyce sit in confused silence, looking at the 
           stopped truck.  It’s dirty, bears Tennessee plates, and 
           we can faintly make out the BARE ARM of a MAN, smoking a 
           cigarette out the driver’s side window.

                                 JOYCE
                        He’s not moving.
                                 ANDY
                        I see that, Ma.

           The HAND MOTIONS out the truck window.  It looks like 
           he’s telling them to move back?

                                 JOYCE
                        Where does he want us to go?

                                 ANDY
                        I don’t know, Ma.

           Silence.  They just sit there.

                                 JOYCE
                        Maybe you should give him a little honk.

                                 ANDY
                        I don’t want to honk.

           Silence again.  Nothing.  No movement.

                                 JOYCE
                        I don’t see why you don’t just give a 
                        little honk?

                                 ANDY
                        Because we’re not in Princeton, New 
                        Jersey, Ma!  We’re in the backwoods of 
                        Tennessee!

           Silence.  A long beat.  Joyce COUGHS.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t.

                                 JOYCE
                        I didn’t say anything.

           A long beat of silence.  Finally...

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I wonder how long we’ll sit here if we 
                        don’t honk.

           Andy, falling apart, submits and HONKS the HORN. 

           ON THE TRUCK

           Where a MAN leaps from the truck.  In the middle of the 
           snowstorm, he’s wearing a WIFE-BEATER.  He’s got long 
           hair and is storming from the truck towards them.  
                                 ANDY
                        Well, Mom.  It’s been fun.

           The man marches towards them, SCREAMING and WAVING 
           furiously.  It’s clear now: he wants them to back up.

           ON ANDY

           Who waves politely at him as if to say, “Sorry, my bad.”  
           He backs the car down off the ramp toward the highway.  

           The trucker throws down his cigarette, gets back in the 
           truck, and backs down off the RAMP. As he passes the 
           Focus, he’s still SCREAMING and GESTICULATING.

           Simultaneously, Andy and Joyce wave politely at him.

           EXT. ABANDONED PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           The Focus RATTLES to a stop in a large parking lot.  
           There are barely any other cars there.  It’s immediately 
           clear that they have pulled over with a flat in the worst 
           possible place in Tennessee.

           They EXIT the car, begin examining tires.

                                 ANDY
                        I don’t see it on my side.

                                 JOYCE
                        It looks okay over here.

           Andy RUBS his head, looks around.  It’s the middle of 
           nowhere.  You couldn’t even call the place a REST STOP.  

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        There’s a restaurant over there.  Maybe 
                        we can call Triple A and wait inside.

           Joyce squints, trying to figure out what THE UNSEEN PLACE 
           is.  She clicks on her glasses, but still struggles. 

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Ooh, does that say Tapas?  I love tapas!

           Andy looks like death warmed over.

                                 ANDY
                        No, Ma.  It doesn’t say tapas.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. TOPLESS BAR - LATER

           Andy and Joyce sit at the bar.  In the foreground, BEATEN-
           UP STRIPPERS dance listlessly for a few random PATRONS.

           Andy puts his head down on the bar, a beaten man.  A HALF-
           DRESSED BARTENDER (she’s seen better days) approaches.

                                 BARTENDER
                        You all get caught in the storm?

                                 JOYCE
                        Yes. Something’s wrong with our car.  
                        We’re waiting for Triple A.

                                 BARTENDER
                        A drink while you’re waiting?

           Still face-down on the bar, Andy answers...

                                 ANDY
                        A Bud, please?

                                 BARTENDER
                                 (to Joyce)
                        And for you, Sweetie?

                                 JOYCE
                        Do you have green tea?

           Andy MOANS from his face-down position.  

                                 BARTENDER
                        Let me see what I can find.

           Joyce LOOKS AROUND, taking in the strip club.

                                 JOYCE
                        You know, when I was younger, your father 
                        tried to make me go to one of these 
                        places with him, thought it’d be “sexy.”

           Andy looks up from his face-down position as a little bit 
           of vomit reaches the back of his throat.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Speaking of sex: it’s not that, is it?

                                 ANDY
                        Excuse me?
                                 JOYCE
                        Why you can’t settle down?  Is it the 
                        idea of being physical with only one 
                        person for the rest of your life? 

                                 ANDY
                        Ma, I’m in a pretty fragile state right 
                        now.  I can’t do this.

                                 JOYCE
                        I just worry is all.

                                 ANDY
                        Please don’t worry.

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m your mother.  It’s my job to worry.  
                        When you were a baby, about two months 
                        old, your penis started turning purple.

                                 ANDY
                        Please stop.

                                 JOYCE
                        Dr. Kirschner said you were fine and that 
                        I shouldn’t worry.  But I swear I checked 
                        your penis every day until you were four.  

                                 ANDY
                        I’m begging you--

                                 JOYCE
                        And to this day, God help me if I don’t 
                        lie in bed every night and worry that you 
                        have problems.  Down there.

                                 ANDY
                        Wow.

                                 JOYCE
                        Andy?

                                 ANDY
                        What?

                                 JOYCE
                        You’d tell me if your penis ever started 
                        turning purple again, right?

                                 ANDY
                        Ma!  I don’t want to talk about my purple 
                        penis!
           The bartender stands in front of them with drinks.  She 
           looks at them askew. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        The roads are something awful.  Could 
                        take Triple A a while.  Our girl 
                        Moonlight is pretty good with cars.  Want 
                        me to ask her to take a look?

           EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER

           Andy and Joyce stand with the bikini-clad BARTENDER (who 
           wears a coat over her bikini).  Toward the front of the 
           car, a half-naked STRIPPER (also in a heavy coat) walks 
           around in stilettos, examining the car.

                                 ANDY
                                 (calling out)
                        Nothing looks wrong with the tires.  I’m 
                        wondering if maybe it’s the fan belt or 
                        something.

           Clearly he has no idea what he’s talking about.  

                                 JOYCE
                        This is very nice of you, Moonlight.  I 
                        wish you were wearing a warmer coat.

           Moonlight STANDS up, examination complete.

                                 MOONLIGHT
                        Well, I see your problem.

                                 ANDY
                        Is it the fan belt?

                                 MOONLIGHT
                        You got ice frozen up all around the 
                        tires.  It’s blockin’ the wheels, making 
                        it feel like you got a flat.

           Moonlight takes off one of her stilettos, begins CHOPPING 
           AWAY at ice around the tires.  The bartender smirks.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Well, at least it ain’t the fan belt.

           Andy feels like an idiot.  He approaches Moonlight.  
           Hands her CASH.  She WINKS, stuffs it in her G-STRING.  
                                 MOONLIGHT
                        You wanna private dance?  Maybe one for 
                        your girl?

                                 ANDY
                        Thank you.  Another time, maybe.

           She SHRUGS, heads inside.  The bartender talks to Joyce.

                                 BARTENDER
                        They’re saying you shouldn’t get on the 
                        highway right now.  You staying local?

           Andy is impatient already, ready to go. 

                                 ANDY
                        We’re just gonna find a hotel nearby. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Gonna be tough finding something in this.  
                        Everyone’s already pulled off the road.  
                        Anyone you can crash with in Memphis?

           Joyce looks to Andy.  He looks like he’s going to cry.  
           In fact, you can almost hear the faint sound of...

           INT. LARGE SUV - LATER

           CRYING.  From a BABY.  The baby is in a carseat. Andy 
           and Joyce sit next to the baby, in the back.

                                 JOYCE
                        We really appreciate you guys picking us 
                        up, Jessica.

           UP FRONT, a PRETTY GIRL (from Andy’s PROM PICTURE).  
           Jessica.  The ex.  Next to her, a HANDSOME GUY.

                                 ANDY
                        Rob, I hope this wasn’t a huge pain. 

                                 ROB
                        Not at all.  We’re nearby.

           Awkward silence.  Andy watches as Rob puts his free hand 
           on Jessica’s neck and starts rubbing.  Andy blinks, as if 
           trying to wake himself from a bad dream.  

                                 JOYCE
                        So, Jessica!  Your mother fills me in 
                        occasionally.  How’ve you been?
                                 JESSICA
                        Pregnant, Mrs. B.  Feels like I’ve been 
                        pregnant for the last decade.  I’m due 
                        again in April.  I don’t know how I keep 
                        getting pregnant.

                                 ROB
                        I do.

           They LAUGH.  Andy could vomit.  Joyce looks at the baby.

                                 JOYCE
                        He is so adorable.  Isn’t he adorable, 
                        Andy? He looks just like Jessica!

           Andy looks at the BABY.  It spits up on him.  

           INT. LARGE LIVING ROOM - LATER

           In a really nice house.  Impressive for a young couple.  
           Everyone sits in the living room.  Rob with Jessica on 
           one couch.  Andy with Joyce on another.  Andy can’t take 
           his eyes off Rob’s hand, currently massaging Jessica’s 
           thigh. 

                                 ANDY
                        So.  Rob.  Looks like you’re doing pretty 
                        well, huh?

                                 ROB
                        We like it here.  Took a while for my 
                        Jersey girl to get adjusted, but I think 
                        she digs it.

                                 JESSICA
                                 (playful)
                        I’m a full-on Southern belle.

           Rob TOASTS her with his beer.

                                 ROB
                        Prettiest girl in all of Memphis.

           Joyce and Jessica COO.  Rob’s hand moves a tad higher up 
           Jessica’s thigh.  Andy takes a big GULP of his own beer.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        So, Andy, you’re Jess’s high school 
                        sweetheart, right?  She talks about you 
                        all the time.
                                 JOYCE
                        Isn’t that funny?  Andy was just talking 
                        about Jessica the other day.  Tell them 
                        what Bethany said about her.

                                 ANDY
                        Ma.

                                 JESSICA
                                 (confused)
                        Who’s Bethany?

                                 JOYCE
                        His latest.  He broke up with her.  She 
                        claims you’re one of the reasons he has 
                        commitment issues.  

           Silence.  Andy could die.  But then... everyone starts 
           LAUGHING.  Well, everyone except Andy.

                                 JESSICA
                        How ridiculous!  We broke up, when, Andy?  
                        When we were like seventeen?

                                 ANDY
                                 (can’t help himself)
                        Sixteen actually.

                                 JESSICA
                        Sixteen!

           She LAUGHS.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        God, remember how crazy you were?  Mrs. 
                        B, did you know Andy asked me to marry me 
                        when we were sixteen?  Like a serious get 
                        on your knee kind of proposal?

                                 ROB
                                 (joking)
                        You son-of-a-bitch.

           Rob PUNCHES Andy’s arm.  Andy forces out a miserable 
           chuckle.  Joyce suddenly looks at him differently: she 
           hadn’t known this.

                                 JESSICA
                        Seriously, Andy.  Can you imagine if I’d 
                        said yes?

           Andy’s face tells the story: he clearly can.
                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        You were such a romantic.

           Nothing we’ve seen from Andy thus far has painted him as 
           “romantic.” Joyce’s attention is now solely on her son, a 
           concerned look on her face.  Jessica may not realize how 
           gut-wrenching this is for Andy, but Joyce finally does.  

           Joyce STANDS.  She clears her coffee, changing topics... 

                                 JOYCE
                        So Jessica, do you know if it’s a boy or 
                        a girl yet?

           ON ANDY

           They start CHATTING but he’s not listening anymore.  His 
           head is clearly in a different place.

           EXT. STRIP CLUB PARKING LOT - NEXT MORNING

           Rob and Jessica say their goodbyes to Joyce, now back at 
           the site of the Ford Focus.  Andy stands off to the side.

                                 JESSICA
                        You tell my Mom I say hey, Mrs. B.  And 
                        don’t you give her any ideas about a 
                        cross country road trip with me.

           Joyce LAUGHS.  Rob goes to say goodbye to Joyce.  Jessica 
           approaches Andy.  One single private moment between old 
           high school sweethearts...

                                 ANDY
                        The kid is adorable.

                                 JESSICA
                        He’s okay.  Hoping to do better on the 
                        next one.

           She PATS her stomach.  Andy smiles, confesses.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m having sort of a... mid-life crisis 
                        right now.  It’s pretty weird.

                                 JESSICA
                        You’re twenty-nine, Andy.
                                 ANDY
                        That’s probably what makes it so weird.
                                 (then)
                        It’s not you.  That’s not why I’m--

                                 JESSICA
                        I know.  

           Jessica kisses him on the cheek, WHISPERS:

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        For the record: if you’d waited five 
                        years I probably would have said yes.
                                 (then)
                        And then I probably wouldn’t be living in 
                        friggin’ Memphis.  Thanks a lot.

           And suddenly, as it goes sometimes, that’s just... it.  
           Just like that.  A chapter of a life finally closed.  
           Andy looks almost relieved.  He smiles, gets in the car.

           The Focus pulls out of the strip club parking lot, saying 
           goodbye to Memphis forever.

           INT. FORD FOCUS - LATER

           Andy drives.  Joyce sits up front, in silence.  

                                 JOYCE
                                 (apologetic)
                        I didn’t know.   I thought it would be 
                        good to see her.  Get some closure.

                                 ANDY
                        It’s okay, Ma.  You didn’t know.

           Silence.  Andy looks at her.  She really does feel bad. 

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        I was so crazy about her.  I don’t know, 
                        maybe it did screw me up.  I was just... 
                        I was so crazy about her, Ma.

                                 JOYCE
                        It’d be nice to feel that again, no?

                                 ANDY
                        Honestly, right now it’d be nice to make 
                        a sale at Walmart. That’s what I want to 
                        feel. I want to feel a sale at Walmart.
                                 (off her look)
                        One step at a time, Ma.  
                                      (MORE)
                                      ANDY (CONT'D)
                        I’m glad we saw her.  You were right... 
                        about the closure.  This was good.

           Joyce looks at him, SHRUGS.  

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Alright, what tape are we up to?

                                 JOYCE
                        Tape five, side B.

                                 ANDY
                        Well we better do some serious listening.  
                        We’re gonna be in Arkansas soon and they 
                        haven’t even found her penis yet.

           Joyce smiles, happy to oblige.

           EXT. SMALL TOWN - LATER THAT DAY

           The Focus ENTERS Bentonville, Arkansas: the home of 
           Walmart.  Bentonville is a small town, completely 
           consumed by Walmart. The Walmart mark is everywhere you 
           look.  Stores, warehouses, signage. That said: there’s 
           not a lot of aesthetic here; you wouldn’t know that it’s 
           the home of one of the biggest companies in the world. 

           The Focus pulls up in front of a nondescript building.

           INT. WALMART LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Andy and Joyce ENTER a hallway, approach reception.

                                 ANDY
                        Hi, Andrew Brewster.  I have a two 
                        o’clock with... Ryan McFee?

           The receptionist doesn’t even look up.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Go to the Lobby, pick up a house phone, 
                        dial extension 151, tell him you’re here.

           Andy NODS, confused.

           INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Cafeteria style tables fill the room.  Scattered around, 
           people sit talking. Andy and Joyce go to an EMPTY TABLE.  
           Andy spots a bunch of hotel styled house phones on a back 
           wall.  He leaves Joyce at the table, goes over.  DIALS.

                                 ANDY
                        Hi, Andrew Brewster for Ryan McFee?
                                 (a beat, then)
                        Yes, in the lobby.
                                 (a beat, then)
                        Oh.  Okay.

           Andy HANGS UP, walks back to Joyce (at the table).

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        I guess they come down to get me.

           Joyce is looking around.

                                 JOYCE
                        I don’t think they’re coming to get you.

           ON OTHER TABLES

           People aren’t just sitting and chatting... they’re 
           pitching.  There are corkboards, diagrams, products.

           BACK TO ANDY 

           Who realizes: this is where Walmart buyers hear pitches.

                                 ANDY
                        Ma, go wait out in the hallway.

           Joyce NODS, gathers her purse.  But then...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Andrew?

           In front of them stands RYAN MCFEE, a Walmart buyer.  
           He’s wearing jeans and a t-shirt, casual.

                                 ANDY
                        Ryan?

                                 RYAN
                        Nice to finally meet you, Andrew.  

           They SHAKE.  Ryan turns toward Joyce, extends his hand.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Ryan McFee.  Walmart.

           Joyce looks to Andy, unsure what to do. He jumps in.
                                 ANDY
                        This is Joyce.  Joyston. Joyce Joyston.  
                        My business partner.

           Joyce shakes.  Ryan sits.  Andy follows suit, motions for 
           Joyce to follow.  She smiles, excited to play the part.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Ryan, I’ve got a product that’s perfect 
                        for Walmart. I spent five years 
                        developing it and--

                                 JOYCE
                        Tell him about the FAA approval.

           Andy shoots Joyce a glare.  Ryan looks confused.

                                 RYAN
                        It’s for airplanes?

                                 ANDY
                        No, FDA.  It’s a cleaning product, Ryan. 

           He reaches BENEATH him, goes for the dramatic...

                       ANDY (CONT’D)
                   (slowly, dramatic)
                                                        JOYCE
                                                (too quickly)
           I call it... 
                                             Organiclean!

           As a result, it comes out GARBLED.  Ryan is confused.

                                 RYAN
                        What’s the name?

                                 ANDY
                                 (sadly)
                        Organiclean.

           The dramatic moment is gone.  

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Let me demonstrate.

           Andy pulls out his BOX.  We hear his standard spiel.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        While at the EPA I heard complaints from 
                        consumers whose children had ingested...

           Andy stops, noticing that Ryan’s attention has gone to 
           Joyce.  She’s fanning herself with her hand, mid-flash. 
                                 RYAN
                        Is she alright?

                                 JOYCE
                        Oh, I’m fine.

           She gulps down some water.  Andy tries pressing on.

                                 ANDY
                        The complaints came from consumers whose 
                        children were having reactions to 
                        everyday cleaning supplies--

                                 JOYCE
                        Like Windex.

           Andy pauses, his rhythm again broken.

                                 ANDY
                        Exactly, Joyce.  Like Windex.  

           He’s thrown.  Ryan waits.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        And I, uh, decided to, you know, develop 
                        something better than Windex.  

                                 JOYCE
                        Organiclean!

           Andy drops his head momentarily, continues valiantly:

                                 ANDY
                        Organiclean is completely non-toxic.  If 
                        you so desire you can flavor your baby’s 
                        bottle with it--

                                 JOYCE
                        You can even drink it!

                                 ANDY
                                 (giving up)
                        You can even drink it.

           Andy pours a SHOT, downs it.  They look to Ryan.  He’s 
           obviously trying to put it all together.

                                 RYAN
                        So it’s a non-toxic, organic cleaning 
                        supply?

                                 ANDY
                        In a nutshell.
                                 RYAN
                        Interesting concept.
                                 (to Joyce)
                        Do you drink it?

           Joyce hesitates, looks toward Andy.

                                 ANDY
                        Of course!  Anyone can drink it! 

           He pours her a shot, puts it in front of her.

           ON JOYCE

           She looks to Andy. She can’t let him down.  She puts it 
           to her lips, takes a very small sip.  Immediately, she 
           cringes.  It obviously doesn’t taste good.  She takes a 
           huge chug from her water bottle, washing it down.

           Ryan watches, confused.  Andy shakes his head.

                                 JOYCE
                                 (unconvincing)
                        Mmmm. Good.

           INT. FORD FOCUS - TEN MINUTES LATER

           Andy pulls out of Walmart. Joyce looks at him.

                                 JOYCE
                        I was just trying to help.

                                 ANDY
                                 (tense)
                        I know.

                                 JOYCE
                        I shouldn’t have--

                                 ANDY
                        Ma, I need a few minutes, okay?  I just 
                        want to find a hotel and get a drink.

           Joyce knows to shut up.  

                                 GPS
                                 (still in English accent)
                        Bear right in one mile.

           Andy SMASHES the GPS with his hand, starts beating the 
           shit out of it.  Joyce watches, says nothing.
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Another miniature hotel room.  Andy lies in bed, staring 
           up, drinking a mini-bar bottle of whiskey.  Joyce stands 
           at the other bed, piling conditioner into her suitcase.

                                 JOYCE
                        Well, the good news is I’ve got enough 
                        hair product to last me four years.

           Andy says nothing.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Andy, you’re so smart, so talented.  
                        Someone is going to give you your break.

           Andy takes a gulp of whiskey.  Joyce watches, concerned.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        If you’re going to drink all that 
                        alcohol, you should really hydrate.

           Nothing.  Joyce treads carefully...

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to say it again, so I’ll 
                        just leave an empty bottle here.  You can 
                        refill it whenever you want.

           She puts it on the nightstand next to him.  Andy drinks 
           more whiskey.  She sits on the bed, watching.  She waits.  

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I only say it because I read that for 
                        every glass of alcohol you should drink 
                        an extra glass of water to--

           And that’s it.  That’s the one that pushes Andy past the 
           point of no return...

                                 ANDY
                        JESUS CHRIST, MA!  WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG 
                        WITH YOU?  JUST STOP!  STOP WITH THE 
                        WATER, STOP WITH THE NAGGING, JUST STOP 
                        TALKING!  CAUSE I SWEAR TO GOD, IF YOU 
                        SAY IT ONE MORE TIME, I’M GOING TO EMPTY 
                        OUT THE ENTIRE GOD-DAMN MINIBAR AND DRINK 
                        MYSELF TO DEATH!  JUST SHUT UP!

           Andy lies back down.  Joyce looks at him, then...
                                 JOYCE
                        Who the fuck do you think you are to talk 
                        to me like that?

                                 ANDY
                        Who do I think I am!?  I think I’m a guy 
                        who’s spent three days with a woman who--

           Andy stops, realizing.  He shifts tone.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Did you just say fuck?

           This time, it’s Joyce who explodes:

                                 JOYCE
                        YES, I SAID FUCK!  I’M NOT JUST SOME 
                        MOTHER, SOME THING WHO EXISTS ONLY TO NAG 
                        YOU TO DRINK MORE WATER AND PICK YOUR WET 
                        TOWELS UP OFF THE FLOOR!  I’M A HUMAN 
                        BEING, ANDY!  I HAVE FEELINGS!  AND I CAN 
                        SAY FUCK!  FUCK, FUCK, FUCK, FUCK, FUCK, 
                        FUCK, FUCK!

           Andy doesn’t even know what to do.  But Joyce isn’t done.  

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve devoted my entire life to you: a bad 
                        marriage, no career, and this is how you 
                        talk to me!?  Like I’m some “thing” you 
                        can barely tolerate?  And I try, Andy!  I 
                        try to bite my tongue when you don’t eat 
                        enough, or drink enough, or squirt fluid 
                        on the frozen window!  You think I don’t 
                        know that you can’t stand me!?  You think 
                        I don’t realize that you went away to 
                        college at the furthest possible place, 
                        that you still live in California so you 
                        only have to see me twice a year!  But 
                        I’m still so desperate for your affection 
                        that I drop my own life - and yes, Andy, 
                        pathetic as it might seem to you I do 
                        have my own life - to drive cross country 
                        with you on a whim!  And this is how you 
                        talk to me?  I deserve more than that, 
                        you selfish little boy.  Now fill up your 
                        fucking water bottle and drink it before 
                        you drop dead from dehydration!

           Joyce STORMS out of the room, slamming the door behind.

           ON ANDY
           Wide-eyed.  What the hell was that?  Not knowing what 
           else to do, he puts down the whiskey, picks up the empty 
           water bottle, and heads to the bathroom.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Andy lies in bed, waiting on Joyce.  He looks to a CLOCK.  
           It’s been a few hours and she’s still not back.  

           INT. HOTEL BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Joyce sits at the bar with a group of MEN: some young, 
           some old, all southern.  They’re drinking heavily.  Andy 
           approaches, wary.  Joyce sees him.

                                 JOYCE
                        Hey everyone, look!  It’s my son, Andy!  

           She’s wasted.

                                 ANDY
                        Okay, Ma.  Let’s get you going.

                                 JOYCE
                        Why!?  Look how much fun I’m being!  I’m 
                        meeting men like you wanted!

           Andy looks around: it’s a tough, southern-looking crowd.  
           Scary.  A few are missing important teeth.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        This is my little boy!  He lives in 
                        California, far, far away from his 
                        Mother.

                                 ANDY
                        Ma, you’re drunk.  

                                 JOYCE
                        Far, far, far away.  Far as he can go.  
                        But that’s okay.  He calls me on my 
                        birthday and comes home for most 
                        Thanksgivings... so that’s exciting.
                                 (then)
                        Bobby, get me another martini please.

           A YOUNG HILLBILLY motions for the BARTENDER.  

                                 ANDY
                        Thank you, Bobby.  But really, she’s had 
                        enough.
                                 JOYCE
                        Don’t you listen to him!  You get me that 
                        drink!  And I want more cheesy fries.  

           Bobby smiles, CALLS the bartender over.  Andy puts his 
           hand on Bobby’s shoulder, says it more strongly.

                                 ANDY
                        Seriously, she’s had enough, Man.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Sorry, Boss.  Lady wants a drink, she’s 
                        getting a drink.

           Andy grabs Bobby’s wrist, the one reaching for her drink.

                                 ANDY
                        But Lady doesn’t need a drink, Bobby.

           And like that, the atmosphere in the room changes 
           instantly.  Bobby turns slowly, facing Andy.

                                 BOBBY
                        I paid for it, she’s drinking it.

           Andy may not be the world’s toughest guy, but everyone 
           has their limit.  And he’s found his.

                                 ANDY
                        I appreciate you taking care of my Mom.  
                        Really.  And I’m happy to pay for the 
                        drink if you want.  But so help me God, 
                        that martini is not going in her mouth.

           One of the MEN around Andy STANDS.  Joyce, drunk as she 
           may be, suddenly sobers up.  She is, after all, still 
           Andy’s mother.

                                 JOYCE
                        Actually, I am tired.  We should get 
                        going.  Thanks again for all the drinks.

           Bobby touches Joyce’s shoulder, a bit too strong.

                                 BOBBY
                        You sit down and drink--

           BAM! Andy NAILS Bobby with a right cross.  Joyce 
           SCREAMS.  The men jump up, but slowly realize... there’s 
           no need.  Bobby is completely un-phased.  

           He wipes his lip, smiles at Andy.
                                 ANDY
                        Oh shit.

           BAM! Andy gets rocked.

           INT. FORD FOCUS - NEXT MORNING

           Andy drives, sporting a black eye and cut lip.  Joyce 
           sits shotgun, looking exhausted from worry as well as a 
           little hungover. Silence.  It’s awkward, and tense, and 
           there are things to be said.  In the background, the book-
           on-tape comes to a halt...

                                 BOOK ON TAPE
                        And that concludes tape 11, side A of 
                        Middlesex.  Please flip over--

           Andy hits EJECT.  A long beat of dead silence.  Finally, 
           Andy breaks the tension...

                                 ANDY
                        You remember that bunsen burner you got 
                        me for Christmas when I was a kid?

                                 JOYCE
                        You didn’t stop playing with it for a 
                        year.

                                 ANDY
                        All the other kids played basketball and 
                        Nintendo. But I put on those dorky
                        goggles and conducted experiments in the 
                        basement all day. 

           He smiles, nostalgic.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        You remember what I’d say when people 
                        asked me what I wanted to be when I grew 
                        up?

                                 JOYCE
                        An organic chemist.  All the other little 
                        boys wanted to be astronauts or baseball 
                        players.  And here was this kid, telling 
                        anyone who would listen that he was gonna 
                        be an organic chemist.

           Joyce smiles at the memory.  A beat. 

                                 ANDY
                        Ma?
           She turns to him.  Andy suddenly looks more serious.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        I went to UCLA because they had the best 
                        organic chemistry program in the country.  
                        That was the only reason.

           Joyce NODS and waves him off, as if feigning nonchalance.  
           Only when she turns toward her window, away from him, can 
           we see that it means a great deal more to her.

           Andy gives her a moment, changes topics...

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        You hungry?

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. BIG TEXAN - LATER

           The Big Texan is a restaurant/tourist trap located just 
           off the interstate (in Amarillo, Texas).  It bears an 
           arcade, a large gift shop, and a rocking chair the size 
           of a small building that you can sit in and take photos 
           on.

           Joyce and Andy sit at a table, waiting.

                                 JOYCE
                        You were entitled to snap at me last 
                        night, Andy.  I know I’ve been driving 
                        you crazy.

           Before he can object...

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        You were entitled.  Rationally I know 
                        you’re almost thirty years old. But I 
                        look at you, Andy, and I only see a 
                        newborn baby.  
                                 (then)
                        You don’t need me to fix your hair and 
                        tell you what to eat anymore.  You’re not 
                        a child. 

                                 ANDY
                        It goes both ways, Ma.  You... I don’t 
                        know, existed before me.  You exist 
                        without me.  You’re not just my mother.  
                        You’re this whole... person.  Thing.

           She NODS.  
                                 JOYCE
                        Well, I’m just sorry you’ve been having 
                        an awful time--

                                 ANDY
                        It hasn’t been awful.

                                 JOYCE
                        Yes it has.  But just the idea that you 
                        wanted to at least try and spend time 
                        with me, that means more than anything.

           Andy smiles, weakly.  He has to tell her.

                                 ANDY
                        Ma?  In San Francisco--

           A WAITRESS (in cowboy hat) comes over, interrupting:

                                 WAITRESS
                        Welcome to the Big Texan!  You all know 
                        what you want?

           Joyce clicks on her glasses, looks at the menu.  

                                 JOYCE
                        I am starving.  Andy, you order, I’ll 
                        find something.

                                 ANDY
                        I’ll have a cheeseburger, medium well.

                                 WAITRESS
                        And to drink?

           Andy looks at Joyce, her eyes still on menu.  He knows 
           the routine...

                                 ANDY
                        Just water please.

                                 JOYCE
                                 (still reading)
                        Oh, have a coke.  You want a coke, have a 
                        coke.  What could it be, a dollar?

                                 WAITRESS
                        Two, actually.

           Joyce looks up, hesitating.  Andy smiles.

                                 JOYCE
                        Screw it.  You only live once.
                                 ANDY
                                 (to waitress)
                        Okay.  I’ll have a coke.  

                                 JOYCE
                        What’s this?

           She points at her menu.  The waitress looks on.

                                 WAITRESS
                        The 72 Ouncer? Oh, that’s our specialty.  
                        Seventy-two ounces of Grade-A steak.  
                        Comes with a dinner salad, roll, shrimp 
                        cocktail, and baked potato.  If you eat 
                        it all, in under an hour, you get it for 
                        free.  And you get a t-shirt.
                                 (then)
                        You want to try?

                                 JOYCE
                        How much is it if you don’t finish?

                                 WAITRESS
                        Seventy-two dollars.

           Andy can’t even believe she’s having this conversation.

                                 ANDY
                        Ma, are you kidding?  

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m very hungry.  You know how I can eat.

                                 ANDY
                        You actually think you can eat seventy-
                        two ounces of steak?

                                 JOYCE
                        It’s not “if” I can do it, I know I can 
                        do it.  It’s if I want to do it.

           Andy looks concerned, not sure what’s coming over her.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Well, you want to do it?

           Joyce SHRUGS.

                                 JOYCE
                        I do like eating for free.  And how many 
                        times am I gonna be in Amarillo, Texas 
                        with my boy?
           She unclicks her glasses.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, I want to do it.  And I’d like a 
                        glass of wine.

           Andy LAUGHS, confused, unsure of what’s happening.

           INT. BIG TEXAN (STAGE) - LATER

           Joyce sits on an ELEVATED STAGE, a large electronic TIMER 
           behind her.  It reads one hour.  Andy stands behind her.

           A MAN rings a BELL.

                                 MAN
                                 (loudly)
                        Ladies and Gentlemen!  If you will direct 
                        your attention to the stage, you will 
                        find Ms. Joyce Brewster.  She’s from New 
                        Jersey but she’s got a Texas-sized 
                        appetite tonight!

           ON THE TABLE

           We watch MATCHING FOOD get set down as he narrates... 

                                 MAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        In the next hour, Joyce will have to 
                        consume a salad, a dinner roll, a shrimp 
                        cocktail, and a baked potato as well as 
                        seventy-two ounces of Grade-A steak.

           The STEAK: it’s enormous to the point that seeing it 
           makes you sick.  The equivalent of five large steaks.

                                 JOYCE
                                 (interrupting)
                        Is it possible to get the salad dressing 
                        on the side?

           He nods, continues.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        It all has to get down in under an hour.  
                        If it comes up, figuratively speaking, 
                        we’ve got buckets.  But it will eliminate 
                        her.  Everyone let’s give Joyce a hand!

           ON ANDY AND JOYCE

           As the crowd CLAPS.  Joyce smiles.  Andy looks nauseous.
                                 ANDY
                        Ma, you don’t have to do this.

                                 JOYCE
                        Honey, if you think I’m paying seventy-
                        two dollars for a piece of meat you’re 
                        crazy.  Now get out of my way.

           The timer starts, Joyce digs in.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. BIG TEXAN (STAGE) - SIXTEEN MINUTES LATER

           A CROWD has gathered around Joyce.  She’s plowing through 
           the steak, juice dripping down her mouth and coating her 
           manicured fingers.  

           A SPECTATOR snaps a picture, Joyce holds up a forkful of 
           meat to her mouth, posing.

           Andy watches it all from the side, smiling and shaking 
           his head.  An OLDER MAN steps up beside him, also 
           watching.  He’s wearing a cowboy hat and jeans.  He’s got 
           a grey mustache, handsome, a Sam Elliot type.

                                 COWBOY
                        I’ve seen some things in this place, but 
                        never a gal like yours trying the seventy-
                        two ouncer.

                                 ANDY
                        She’s my Mom.

                                 COWBOY
                        You’re puttin’ me on?

           Andy shakes his head, “no.”

                                 COWBOY (CONT’D)
                        Looks too young to be your Mom. Pretty 
                        gal.

           Andy smiles.  The man puts out his hand.

                                 COWBOY (CONT’D)
                        James Graw.

           They SHAKE.

                                 ANDY
                        Andrew Brewster.
                                 COWBOY
                        What brings you to Amarillo, Andrew?

                                 ANDY
                        Travelling for work. 

                                 COWBOY
                        Same here.  I’m in oil.  Always try and 
                        stop at the Texan.  Watching folks up on 
                        the stage there is the best form of free 
                        entertainment around.

           Up on stage, Joyce takes a breath.  She’s getting full.  
           She reaches for the shrimp cocktail, takes a bite.

                                 COWBOY (CONT’D)
                                 (to himself)
                        No, no.  Save the shrimp for last, 
                        Darlin’.  
                                 (then, to Andy)
                        You know, I could probably help your Ma, 
                        give her some tips.  You know, if that’s 
                        alright with you?  

           Andy waves him on.

                                 ANDY
                        Good luck.

           The cowboy tips his hat at Andy, approaches the stage.  
           Andy watches as he stops Joyce from eating the shrimp, 
           pulls a chair up next to her.  She doesn’t shoo him away.

           Andy raises a brow, surprised.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. BIG TEXAN (STAGE) - LATER

           The clock shows FOUR MINUTES remaining.

           The crowd has gotten even fuller.  People are chanting:

                                 CROWD
                        Joyce!  Joyce!  Joyce!  Joyce!

           The Cowboy sits with her, she’s down to about seven 
           ounces of meat.  But she doesn’t look well.  She’s down 
           to a t-shirt and fanning herself, a bit green.  On top of 
           the steak, the shrimp cocktail still remains.
                                 JOYCE
                        I think I need more water.  

           The Cowboy STANDS.

                                 COWBOY
                        Robin, dear!?  When you get a moment, the 
                        young lady would love another glass of 
                        water.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Comin’ right up.

           Joyce smiles, but then... turns even more green.  
           Suddenly, she’s getting nauseous.  She looks down next to 
           her: there’s a BUCKET, ostensibly to throw up in.

                                 JOYCE
                                 (panicked)
                        Andy!?  Where’s Andy!?

           Andy runs up onto stage, kneels down next to Joyce.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                                 (desperate)
                        Andy?

                                 ANDY
                        Ma, are you going to be sick?

           She NODS, sad.  She has tears in her eyes.  It is the 
           saddest, sweetest, most pathetic thing you’ve ever seen.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        I’m throwing in the towel.  You did 
                        great.  Let’s get you to a bathroom.

                                 JOYCE
                                 (desperate)
                        I thought I could do it.  I don’t want 
                        you to have to pay seventy-two dollars.  

                                 ANDY
                        I would pay a thousand dollars not to see 
                        my mother throw up in a bucket in front 
                        of a roomful of strangers.

                                 JOYCE
                        Oh, that’s so sweet--

           She GAGS.  Andy takes her napkin, puts it on her plate.  
           It’s over.  The crowd GROANS.  But just then...
           The waitress returns with a big glass of water.  The 
           Cowboy puts his hand on Joyce’s shoulder.

                                 COWBOY
                        Now just sit here for one minute, ride it 
                        out.  Drink some water.  I’ve seen people 
                        get sick, I think you’re okay.  

           She DRINKS.

                                 COWBOY (CONT’D)
                        There you go, there you go.  Deep breaths 
                        young lady.  Now... how you feeling?

           Joyce NODS, calming herself.  Slowly, she removes the 
           napkin from the plate, picks her fork back up.  The crowd 
           CHEERS.  The cowboy turns to Andy, comforting.

                                 COWBOY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got my eye on her.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, I can see that.

           Joyce continues.  Bite after bite.  The clock ticks away.  
           Two minutes.  One and a half.  One.  She takes one final 
           bite.  It’s done!  The crowd SCREAMS!  Andy smiles.

           All that remains: THAT SHRIMP COCKTAIL.  The clock ticks.  
           Forty-five.  Forty.  Thirty-five.  Joyce takes a bite of 
           shrimp, the Cowboy stops her.

                                 COWBOY
                        No, no, no. That’s why we save it for 
                        last.  You just shoot and swallow.  You 
                        know how to do a shot?

           Joyce looks at Andy, smiles.  She picks up the shrimp 
           cocktail and stands... twenty-five, twenty, fifteen...

                                 JOYCE
                        To my son.

           Andy smiles, raises his COKE to her shrimp. 

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I’d still pick you every time.

           She DOWNS the shrimp with five seconds to spare.  She 
           shows the waitress her empty mouth and...

           THE CROWD ERUPTS!  Joyce holds her hands up in the air 
           like a victorious heavy-weight champion.
           EXT. BIG TEXAN PARKING LOT - LATER

           Andy and Joyce walk with the Cowboy toward the Ford 
           Focus.  Joyce is wearing a t-shirt that says: “I ate the 
           72 Ouncer at the Big Texan and lived to tell about it.”

                                 COWBOY
                        You planning any sightseeing the rest of 
                        the way?

                                 ANDY
                        Not really.  We’re on a schedule: Santa 
                        Fe, then Vegas, then San Francisco.

                                 COWBOY
                        Well, I hope you at least get to stop at 
                        the Grand Canyon.

                                 JOYCE
                        Ooh! The Grand Canyon!  I’ve always 
                        wanted to go to the Grand Canyon.

                                 ANDY
                        We just don’t have time.

                                 COWBOY
                        Maybe next trip, then. 

           They’re at the car.  The Cowboy bids farewell to Andy:

                                 COWBOY (CONT’D)
                        Andrew.  A pleasure.

           They SHAKE.  Andy walks around the car.  Cowboy opens the 
           door for Joyce, she gets in.  She lowers the window.

                                 COWBOY (CONT’D)
                        Hope this isn’t too forward, but heck, 
                        you see a woman who eats like that, 
                        you’ve got to stick your neck out... 

           He reaches into his pocket, hands her a BUSINESS CARD.

                                 COWBOY (CONT’D)
                        I do business in New York.  Maybe I’d 
                        have the pleasure of your company one 
                        night for dinner?  

           Joyce takes the card, unsure of what to say.
                                 COWBOY (CONT’D)
                        I do know a few places where you don’t 
                        have to eat on stage.

           Joyce LAUGHS.  

                                 JOYCE
                        I’ll think about it, James.

           He TIPS his hat.  Andy waves, pulls out.  After a beat... 

                                 ANDY
                        Why, Mother!  How scandalous.

                                 JOYCE
                        Oh, stop it.

                                 ANDY 
                                 (imitating her)
                        I’ll think about it, James.

                                 JOYCE 
                        Stop it!

           Andy LAUGHS.  They drive in silence for a moment.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        What the hell is wrong with me?

           Andy looks at her: where’d that come from?

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I mean, I haven’t had fun like that in...
                                 (then)
                        I’m a fifty year old woman and I’m still 
                        clipping on earrings.  What kind of woman 
                        is scared of getting her ears pierced?  
                        Of getting a man’s business card?

           It’s a statement more than a question.  Andy NODS.  
           Smiles.  Suddenly, he stops the car.

                                 ANDY
                        You want to see the Grand Canyon?

                                 JOYCE
                        I thought we didn’t have time.  

                                 ANDY
                        I can skip my meeting in New Mexico.

                                 JOYCE
                        Don’t even think about it.  
                                 ANDY
                        It’s a small company anyway. Even if I 
                        make a sale, it won’t be big enough to 
                        keep me afloat.  QVC in Vegas, that’s our 
                        hail-mary.
                                 (then)
                        You want the Grand Canyon, you’re getting 
                        the Grand Canyon.  

           Andy pulls forward to the road.  The GPS talks at him.

                                 GPS
                                 (English accent)
                        Turn right, in two miles.

                                 ANDY 
                        To the Grand Canyon, Jeeves.

           We CUE CREEDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL’S “Down on the 
           Corner” which COVERS...

           MONTAGE:

           - Andy drives as the car passes into New Mexico.

           - Joyce points, takes pictures of the New Mexico 
           landscape.

           - Another tape goes into the cassette player

           - Joyce is telling a story, expressing herself with her 
           hands.  Andy LAUGHS.

           - Tumencari, New Mexico.

           - Andy and Joyce lie in adjacent beds in a small hotel, 
           both eating M&M’s.

           - Andy is in the hallway of a HOTEL.  He looks around.  
           The coast is clear.  He steals toiletries from an 
           abandoned maid cart.  

           - He runs into a room, gives them to Joyce.  She SQUEALS 
           and piles them into her suitcase.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. GRAND CANYON HOTEL - MORNING

           We stay on the hotel as night turns into morning.

           INT. GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK - MORNING

           The entrance to the Grand Canyon looks much like the 
           entrance to an amusement park.  Cars wait on line, 
           waiting to pay RANGERS who provide admission.

           Andy pulls the car up to a RANGER.

                                 RANGER
                        Welcome to the Grand Canyon.  You have a 
                        pass already?

                                 ANDY
                        No, first time.

                                 RANGER
                        It’s twenty-five dollars per vehicle.  
                        That entitles you to unlimited entrance 
                        to the park for the next seven days.

           Andy looks to Joyce.  She holds her tongue.  Andy SIGHS, 
           bites the bullet.

                                 ANDY
                        Let me ask you: do you take Triple A?

                                 RANGER
                        Sorry, no.

           Joyce smiles off to the side, she’s never been prouder.

                                 RANGER (CONT’D)
                        Only discount we offer is if anyone’s 
                        over sixty-two.

           Andy looks over at Joyce.  She looks up at him.

                                 JOYCE
                        Don’t even think about it.  Pay the man 
                        his twenty-five dollars.
           Andy smiles, forks over the CASH.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. GRAND CANYON - LATER

           Andy and Joyce stand in front of the Grand Canyon, 
           looking out.  For the four of you who haven’t been there, 
           it’s as breath-taking and awe-inspiring as everyone says.

                                 JOYCE
                        Wow.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah.

           They take it in, silent.

                                 JOYCE
                        You see that over there?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, beautiful.

           Silence.  Then...

                                 JOYCE
                        How long are we supposed to look at it?

                                 ANDY
                        I don’t know.

                                 JOYCE
                        I mean it’s beautiful...

                                 ANDY
                        So beautiful...

           A beat, then:

                                 JOYCE
                        Who are these people who spend twenty-
                        five dollars to look at rocks for seven 
                        days?

                                 ANDY
                        I don’t know, Ma.

                                 JOYCE
                        Don’t get me wrong, it’s beautiful...
                                 ANDY
                        So beautiful.

           Silence.  Andy looks around.  People clearly have more 
           patience for it then they do.

                                 JOYCE
                        We’re not far from Vegas, right?  We can 
                        stay here for a few hours.

                                 ANDY
                        Good.

           Silence.  They sit and look out at the Canyon for about 
           ten seconds.  Then...

                       ANDY (CONT’D)
                                                        JOYCE
           Vegas?
                                             Let’s go.

           They quickly turn away, back toward the car.

           EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT

           Billboards and lights everywhere.  We pull down off a 
           WAYNE NEWTON BILLBOARD to...

           The Ford Focus.  Dirty and disgusting, entering the VEGAS 
           STRIP.

           INT. FORD FOCUS - CONTINUOUS

           Joyce looks out, awed by everything.  

                                 JOYCE
                        I have a good feeling about this, Andy.  
                        You’re going to do well tomorrow.

                                 ANDY
                        I better.  This is my last hope.

                                 JOYCE
                        Besides your meeting in San Francisco.

           Andy smiles, weakly.  It’s time.  He has to tell her.

                                 ANDY
                        You know, Ma.  I’ve been thinking about 
                        your Andy.  Margolis.  I keep thinking it 
                        would be nice to track him down.
                                 JOYCE
                        I told you the story, so if you need to, 
                        go ahead.  But for me, it’s... it’s
                        wrapped up in too many things.  It makes 
                        me sad.  It makes me think about a time 
                        in my life when I...
                                 (then)
                        You know what, we’re in Vegas.  I don’t 
                        want to talk about Andy Margolis.

                                 ANDY
                        But--

                                 JOYCE
                        Andy, I really don’t want to talk about 
                        it.

           Andy stops, the wound is clearly too deep for her.  He 
           turns forward, continues down the strip.  

           INT. CEASERS PALACE - LATER

           Andy drags Joyce’s bags through the CASINO, towards an 
           elevator.  Joyce looks around in wonder.

                                 ANDY
                        Let’s go drop our bags off, shower up, 
                        then we’ll get a nice meal, oh, I want 
                        you to see the fountain at the Bellag--

           But Joyce is not with him.  He looks back.  She’s in 
           front of a five cent slot machine.  He heads back.

                                 JOYCE
                        It has frogs!

           Sure enough, the machine spins FROGS.  Triple-frogs.  
           Double-frogs.  Bonus frogs. 

                                 ANDY
                        Ma--

                                 JOYCE
                        And it’s on the aisle.  Right in front.  
                        I bet they put it here so people can see 
                        a winner.

                                 ANDY
                        There’s lots of machines on aisles--

                                 JOYCE
                        This one is a winner.
           Joyce SITS, digs through her purse.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Honey, I showered this morning.  Go drop 
                        off the bags and shower, I’ll be here.

           Andy SHRUGS.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        The drinks are free, right?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah.

                                 JOYCE
                        Flag me down a waitress if you see one.

           Andy raises a brow.

                                 ANDY
                        Okay.

           And that’s when Andy loses his mother to Las Vegas...

           JUMP CUTS:

           As Andy repeatedly approaches Joyce, tries to remove her 
           from the machine.

           AS SHE DRINKS A BLOODY MARY:

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Ma, if we want to get dinner--

                                 JOYCE
                        The big one’s coming, I feel it.

           WHEN HE RETURNS AGAIN:

                                 ANDY
                        Ma, don’t you want to see the fountain?

                                 JOYCE
                        You go ahead, Honey.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, well, the thing is, I’ve seen the 
                        fountain.

           She waves him off.  A WAITRESS approaches, takes Joyce’s 
           empty bloody Mary, replaces it with...
                                 WAITRESS
                        Double scotch, rocks?

           Joyce, without looking, hands her a buck.

                                 ANDY
                        Jesus.

           AND ONE FINAL TIME:

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Well, Ma?  I think I’m gonna turn in.

                                 JOYCE
                        You get some sleep.  Big day tomorrow.

                                 ANDY
                        You’re not coming up?

                                 JOYCE
                        In a bit, in a bit.

           Andy shakes his head.  Oh well.  He EXITS.  Joyce spins 
           again.  Starts BANGING the machine.

           INT. CEASER’S PALACE ROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Andy lies in bed, asleep.  Next to him, a completely made 
           bed, not slept in.

           The door opens, waking him.  He looks up.  It’s Joyce, 
           bloody Mary in hand.  She smiles.

           Andy looks at his clock: 7:45 AM.

                                 JOYCE
                        So... do you notice anything different?

           Andy squints.

                                 ANDY
                        You’re drinking at seven in the morning?

           Joyce shakes her head, announces...

                                 JOYCE
                        I got my ears pierced!

           Andy sits up.
                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I was up sixty dollars and decided to 
                        call it quits and I passed a jewelry 
                        store and got my ears pierced!

                                 ANDY
                        Okay.

                                 JOYCE
                        It didn’t even hurt!

                                 ANDY
                        Well.. way to go, I guess. I’m happy if 
                        you’re happy.

           Joyce sits on the bed.

                                 JOYCE
                        Oh, Andy.  I’m so happy.  I never want to 
                        leave.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, but at some point the frog machine 
                        could short-circuit.

                                 JOYCE
                        I know, I lost control.  But I do want to 
                        see more of Vegas.  I was thinking: maybe 
                        you should go to San Francisco alone and 
                        I’ll stay through the weekend, fly home 
                        from here.

                                 ANDY
                        Absolutely not.

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m letting you off the hook, Kiddo. You 
                        drove with your mother to Las Vegas.  I 
                        have enough bragging material to last me 
                        the rest of my life. 

           Andy sits up.

                                 ANDY
                        Ma, you have to come.

                                 JOYCE
                                 (joking)
                        Because I’ve been so helpful so far?

           It’s time.  He has to tell her.
                                 ANDY
                        I don’t have a meeting in San Francisco, 
                        Ma.  I tracked down Andy, Andy Margolis.  
                        He’s the meeting in San Francisco.

           Joyce opens her mouth, but nothing comes out.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        He still works at J&R Records! They 
                        transferred him to the West Coast office.  
                        I’ve got his numbers address, everything. 
                        Ma, he’s not married! 

           Joyce sits on the bed, taking it in.

                                 JOYCE
                        When?

                                 ANDY
                        When, what?

                                 JOYCE
                        When did you track him down? 

                                 ANDY
                        The morning after you told me the story.

           Joyce NODS, suddenly things are clear. 

                                 JOYCE
                        That’s why you invited me to come?  So I 
                        could see Andy Margolis?

                                 ANDY
                        No.  I mean, I wanted to see him, too.  I 
                        wanted both of us to see him.  He’s my 
                        curse, right?

           He smiles, trying to lighten things.  Joyce doesn’t take.

                                 JOYCE
                        How stupid I was.  To think you’d 
                        actually want to spend time with me.  

                                 ANDY
                        I did!

                                 JOYCE
                        No.  This was you worrying about your 
                        pathetic shut-in mother.  Reunite her 
                        with the love of her life, you don’t have 
                        to feel responsible for her anymore.
                                 ANDY
                        It’s not like that.

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m not mad.  Most children wouldn’t even 
                        care enough.  I just... I thought this 
                        was something else, you know?

           Joyce gets up, and walks out of the room.

           INT. CASINO - LATER

           Joyce sits at the FROG SLOT MACHINE, monotonously pulling 
           the lever.  Depressed.  She looks up.  Andy stands there.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m sorry.  I should have told you.

                                 JOYCE
                        Yeah, you should have.

           There’s nothing Andy can say.  She spins the WHEEL again.

                                 ANDY
                        I want to talk but I have to go to my 
                        presentation.  Are you okay here?

                                 JOYCE
                        Oh, don’t worry about me, Andy.  You’ve 
                        done that enough already.

           Ouch.  Andy looks at his WATCH.  He has to go.  

           INT. BANQUET HALL - LATER

           A BANNER READS: “QVC OPEN CALL.”  We PAN DOWN to...

           Andy.  He’s sitting in a waiting room.  A QVC MAN emerges 
           from a room off to the side.

                                 QVC MAN
                                 (reading)
                        Andrew Brewster for Organiclean?

           Andy STANDS, approaches him.  The Man leads him into a...

           INT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           It’s a no frills mini STAGE.  There’s a long table set up 
           front, above it a QVC BANNER.  
           Behind the table stands a PRETTY WOMAN.  A CAMERA faces 
           her.  Two QVC EXECS sit in folding chairs next to the 
           camera.  It’s not unlike a casting session.

           The QVC Man leads Andy behind the table.

                                 QVC MAN
                        Okay, Mr. Brewster.  You get five minutes 
                        to explain the product and demonstrate.  
                        Our hostess Amy will introduce you.  You  
                        can interact with her however you want.  
                        We’re looking for both a good product, 
                        and good salesmanship.  Any questions?

                                 ANDY
                        No.

           He takes a seat next to the other.  Amy smiles at Andy.

                                 AMY
                        Break a leg.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Roll tape!

           Amy introduces, reading off cue cards.

                                 AMY
                        Welcome back to QVC.  I’m here with 
                        Andrew Brewster, creator of a new organic 
                        cleaning product called Organiclean. Tell 
                        us a little about Organiclean, Andrew.

           Andy is clearly distracted, not himself.

                                 ANDY
                        Yes, uh, thank you.  Organiclean is a 
                        product I invented five years ago.  
                        Actually, no, I came up with the idea 
                        five years ago, but I’ve been working on 
                        the formula for the last five years.  
                        Technically I invented it only a few 
                        months ago I guess.

           The execs exchange looks.  Amy looks confused. 

                                 AMY
                        Well, why don’t you tell us a little 
                        about the product Andrew?

                                 ANDY
                        Sure, sure.

           Andy pulls out his box.
                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Well, Organiclean cleans like any regular 
                        cleaning product.

           Andy does his dirt demonstration.  Amy CLAPS, impressed.  
           But she’s really not.  We can tell.  Essentially, he 
           wiped a table clear of dirt.

                                 AMY
                        Well, look at that.  The table is clean.

           An exec STIFLES a yawn.  Andy notices.

                                 ANDY
                        Well, hold on Amy.  That’s not what makes 
                        Organiclean special.  Many products clean 
                        dirt, but they’re also toxic.  You don’t 
                        want your children ingesting them.  But 
                        Organiclean...

           He PULLS OUT his SHOT GLASS, does it.  The execs sit up, 
           taking notice.  They share an intrigued glance.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Organiclean is completely non-toxic.  You 
                        can get it in your eyes, drink it... here 
                        Amy, try it.  It’s perfectly safe.

           He hands Amy a SHOT GLASS.  She hesitates.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, it’s completely non-toxic.

           Amy looks off camera, no longer in “character.”

                                 AMY
                        I don’t think I’m comfortable with this.

                                 JOYCE (O.S.)
                        Then get out of the way.

           They turn.  Joyce ENTERS FRAME, marches up to the table.  
           One of the execs STANDS.

                                 EXEC
                        I’m sorry, who are you?

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m the mother.

           Joyce grabs Amy’s shot glass and DOWNS it in one gulp.  
           Andy looks at her, smiles.  She POURS another, hands it 
           to Andy.
                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I am this boy’s mother and I am allowing 
                        him to sit here and drink this.  And any 
                        mother out there knows that if it wasn’t 
                        one hundred percent safe I wouldn’t even 
                        let it near his mouth, no matter how much 
                        money it could make him.

           Andy TOASTS her, does the shot.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        That’s a mother job: you protect your 
                        child.  I would jump in front of a train 
                        for this boy, even at his worst moments.  
                        Any mother would.  So why do we sit at 
                        home cleaning our counters and floors - 
                        the very counters and floors they play on 
                        - with something we wouldn’t dare let 
                        them put in their mouths?
                                 (then, to Andy)
                        Now, tell them about the FAA approval.

           The execs watch them go back and forth, as if watching a 
           ping-pong match.  

                                 ANDY
                        It’s FDA, Ma.

                                 JOYCE
                        Well, whatever it’s called, tell them 
                        about it.  And show them how you drip it 
                        in your eyes.

                                 ANDY
                        I think they get the point, I want to 
                        talk about the ingredients.

                                 JOYCE
                        No one cares about the ingredients, we 
                        told them it was safe, now drip it in 
                        your eyes.

                           ANDY
           I didn’t bring the dripper.
                                                        JOYCE
                                             Why didn’t you bring it?  
                                             It’s the neatest part.

                           ANDY
                                                        JOYCE
           Ma, I can handle this.  
                                             I know you can handle it 
                                             but--

           QVC MAN STANDS up. 
                                 EXEC
                        Okay, stop tape.

           Andy and Joyce stop.  Have they blown it?  Andy starts 
           gathering his belongings.

                                 ANDY
                        Well, you have my business plan and 
                        contact info.  Thank you for the time.

           Andy leads Joyce toward the door.

                                 EXEC #1
                        How soon will you be ready to go to 
                        market with this?

           Andy turns, surprised.

                                 ANDY
                        As soon as we have somewhere to sell it.

                                 EXEC #2
                        You have financial backing, FDA approval?

                                 ANDY
                        Uh huh.

           The EXECS conference.  Andy looks at Joyce, SHRUGS.

                                 EXEC
                        We’ll want you on the air as soon as 
                        possible.  How’s April?

           Andy looks at Joyce in complete disbelief.  

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, sure.  April’s cool.

                                 EXEC #3
                        Obviously, we’ll want your mother 
                        presenting with you. 

                                 QVC MAN
                        She’s going to be a huge star on QVC.

           Andy looks at Joyce.  She primps her hair.

                                 ANDY
                        Ma?  You good with that?

                                 JOYCE
                        I always thought I’d do well on QVC.  
           Andy shakes his head, in complete disbelief.

                                 QVC MAN
                        Come to dinner with us, tonight.  We’d 
                        love to tell you more about the QVC--

           Andy is about to agree when...

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m sorry, we can’t.  We have an 
                        important meeting to get to in San 
                        Francisco.  

           Andy turns to Joyce, surprised. She NODS.

           EXT. BAY BRIDGE - LATER

           From ABOVE, the Focus crosses toward the San Francisco 
           skyline.

           INT. FORD FOCUS - CONTINUOUS

           Andy drives, Joyce looks at him.

                                 JOYCE
                        So what was your plan?  

                                 ANDY
                        He was getting back this morning.  I 
                        thought you’d call his office, say “hey, 
                        remember me?”  Then we’d meet for coffee 
                        or something and you’d marry him.

           Joyce holds out her hand.  Andy hands her the cell phone 
           and a piece of paper.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        His work number is on top.

           This is it.  She takes a deep breath, DIALS.

                                 JOYCE
                        Hi, I’m trying to reach Andrew?
                                 (a beat)
                        Oh.  Okay.  No, no message.

           She HANGS UP.  Andy waits expectantly.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        She said he’s working from home today.
           Andy points at the paper.

                                 ANDY
                        Home number is at the bottom.  

           Joyce breathes deeply again, DIALS.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Put it on speaker, I want to hear.

           She puts it on speaker.  RING.  RING. Then...

                                 VOICE
                        Hello?

                                 JOYCE
                        Andy?

                                 VOICE
                        Speaking.

           Joyce FREEZES.

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Hello?  Are you there?

           A beat, then... Joyce SHUTS THE PHONE.  She’s completely 
           freaked out.

                                 JOYCE
                        It was him.

                                 ANDY
                        I heard.

                                 JOYCE
                        I got scared.

                                 ANDY
                        I saw.

                                 JOYCE
                        What am I supposed to say? 

                                 ANDY
                        I don’t know... “Hi, Andy.  It’s Joyce.  
                        The girl from Florida”

           She shakes her head, no.  She’s suddenly really unnerved.  
           She looks at the paper.

                                 JOYCE
                        This is his address, right?
           Andy NODS.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s just go there.  If we’re going to 
                        do this, we’re going to do it in person.

           Andy agrees, takes the paper and starts programming the 
           GPS.  Joyce pulls down the car visor, starts primping 
           herself.  Andy looks at her, smiles.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        The man hasn’t seen me since I was twenty-
                        three.  Some make-up might not help, but 
                        it can’t hurt.

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER

           The Focus pulls up in front of a LARGE HOUSE.  Andy EXITS 
           the car, comes around and opens Joyce’s door.

           ON ANDY

           Waiting.

                                 ANDY
                        This is it.  This is his house.

           Nothing.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Ma?  You ready?

           After a beat...

           JOYCE EXITS the car.  She stands in front of Andy.  She’s 
           clearly gotten much more dressed up, and more made-up.  
           She looks great... and extremely nervous. She shows Andy 
           her hand.  It’s shaking.

                                 JOYCE
                        Do I look okay?

           Andy looks at his mother.  Mid-fifties, dressed up, and 
           nervous like a little girl going to her first dance.  

                                 ANDY
                        You look great, Ma.  Now, take a deep 
                        breath.

           Joyce BREATHES IN.  Settles herself.
                                 JOYCE
                        Okay.

                                 ANDY
                        Okay?

           She NODS.  On instinct, she LICKS her finger and makes a 
           move toward Andy’s hair.  Before she gets there, she 
           stops herself, pulls her hand back.  Andy smiles, takes a 
           step toward her, and lowers her head just a bit.  She 
           smiles, presses down his cowlick.  And with that...

           Andy turns, a man on a mission, and heads toward the 
           house.  She follows, talking as they walk.

                                 JOYCE
                        You know, whatever happens in there, it 
                        really doesn’t matter.  It was always 
                        you.

           Andy turns toward her, confused.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        The love of my life.  It will always be 
                        you, Andy.

           Andy smiles, touched.  Joyce immediately changes tone.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I hope he doesn’t look like hell.

           EXT. FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Andy approaches the door, RINGS the bell.  Joyce stands 
           to his side, slightly behind him.  They share a look.  
           Nothing.  Andy RINGS again.

                                 VOICE
                        Coming!

           Joyce tenses.  Andy puts his hand on her shoulder, 
           settling her.

           ON THE DOOR

           Which opens slowly, revealing...

           A HANDSOME MAN

           Actually, let me re-phrase. A handsome young man (29).
                                 ANDY
                        Sorry to bother, I’m looking for Andrew 
                        Margolis?

                                 MAN
                        We’re not interested.  Thanks.

           He starts closing the door, Andy stops it with his hand.

                                 ANDY
                        No, I’m sorry.  We’re not selling 
                        anything.  We’re old friends of Andrew 
                        Margolis.

                                 MAN
                        Yeah, well, unless I’m suffering from 
                        amnesia, we’re not old friends.

           Confusion.  Andy looks to Joyce.  Back to the guy.

                                 ANDY
                        You’re Andrew Margolis?  From J&R 
                        Records?

                                 MAN
                                 (uncomfortable)
                        What is this about?

           It occurs to Joyce before it occurs to Andy.  She speaks 
           for the first time.

                                 JOYCE
                        He’s his son. 

           Andy looks at her.  Suddenly he gets it.

                                 ANDY
                        Is your father named Andrew as well?

                                 ANDREW MARGOLIS JR.
                        Yes.  What can I help you with--

                                 ANDY
                        And he worked at J&R as well?

                                 ANDREW MARGOLIS JR.
                        He owned it.  I’m sorry, I’m confused. 

           Andy is suddenly relieved.

                                 ANDY
                        No, no.  You must think we’re crazy.  My 
                        mother is an old friend of your father’s.  
                                      (MORE)
                                      ANDY (CONT'D)
                        We thought you... it doesn’t matter.  Is 
                        it possible to find out how to get in 
                        touch with your him?   

                                 ANDREW MARGOLIS JR.
                        I’m sorry, Dad died five years ago.

           And like that, all the air goes completely out of them.  
           Joyce quickly braces herself against the wall. 

           INT. ANDREW MARGOLIS’ KITCHEN - LATER

           They sit at a table, drinking coffee.  Joyce is looking 
           at a PHOTO, lost in thought.

           ON THE PHOTO

           It’s an OLDER MAN (the original Andy).  He’s kissing an 
           OLDER WOMAN.  They are standing with their son.  They all 
           look incredibly happy.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Andrew (Margolis) and Andy (Brewster) drink coffee, 
           they’re looking at Joyce.

                                 ANDREW MARGOLIS
                        Is she okay?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, she’s just... your father was very 
                        important to her.  

                                 ANDREW MARGOLIS
                        He was a good man.

                                 ANDY
                        So I hear.  How long were your parents 
                        married?

                                 ANDREW MARGOLIS
                        Twenty-four years.  Mom lives in Florida 
                        now.

           Andy STANDS, looks at Joyce.  This was all a mistake.

                                 ANDY
                        We should get going. I know you’re just 
                        getting back from a trip.

                                 ANDREW MARGOLIS
                        No, it’s okay.  
           Joyce finally speaks, still looking at the picture.

                                 JOYCE
                        Did he ever mention me?  We dated for two 
                        years, probably not long before your 
                        mother.

           Andrew thinks about it.

                                 ANDREW MARGOLIS
                        I’m sorry, no.  He never talked about 
                        anyone besides my mother.  At least to 
                        us.

           Gut-shot.  Joyce STANDS to go, hands him back the photo.

                                 JOYCE
                        Your father was a very nice... he was 
                        very nice to me.  I’m sorry he’s gone.  

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey, Big Brother!  I’m here!

           A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN ENTERS the room.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        You got enough mail to choke a--

           She sees Andy and Joyce, stops.  

                                 YOUNG WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I’m sorry.  I didn’t know you had 
                        company.

                                 ANDREW MARGOLIS
                        No, they’re uh, old friends... of Dad’s.

           Andy STANDS, faces her.  She’s adorable.  Instant 
           chemistry.  He holds out his hand.

                                 ANDY
                        Hi, I’m Andy.

           She smiles, SHAKES his hand.

                                 GIRL
                        Joyce.

           ON ANDY

           Who freezes instantly.  He looks behind him to...

           HIS MOTHER
           She looks up, stunned.  A single name says everything.   
           An unrequited love... finally requited.

           EXT. HERTZ RENTAL CAR DROP OFF - LATER

           The FORD FOCUS, dirty and disgusting, pulls into the DROP 
           OFF LANE of Hertz.

           INT. HERTZ RENTAL CAR DROP OFF - CONTINUOUS

           Inside the car, Joyce and Andy sit in their customary 
           positions, listening to the book on tape...

                                 BOOK ON TAPE
                        The wind swept over the crusted snow into 
                        my Byzantine face, which was the face of 
                        my grandfather and of the American girl I 
                        had once been--

           A BANG ON THE WINDOW.  A RENTAL AGENT stands there.  Andy 
           stops the tape, lowers the window.

                                 ANDY
                        Just give us a minute.

           Andy raises the window back up as the agent just stands 
           there, confused.  He pushes PLAY AGAIN.

                                 BOOK ON TAPE
                        I stood in the door for an hour, maybe 
                        two.  I lost track after a while, happy 
                        to be home, weeping for my father, and 
                        thinking about what was next.
                                 (a beat, then)
                        And that concludes the audio presentation 
                        of Middlesex.

           The tape stops.  Andy looks at Joyce.  She NODS.  They 
           did it.  Dramatically, she takes the tape out and places 
           it back in the final spot of the casing.

           INT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - LATER

           Andy and Joyce hold separate BOARDING PASSES.  This is 
           goodbye.

                                 ANDY
                        Well, I’m this way.
                                 JOYCE
                        I’m that way. 

                                 ANDY
                        You’re okay with flying alone?

                                 JOYCE
                        I pierced my ears and ate 72 ounces of 
                        steak.  I can handle American Airlines.
                                 (then)
                        So what’s next for you?

                                 ANDY
                        I don’t know.  I’ll go back to LA and 
                        start prepping for QVC--

                                 JOYCE
                        That’s not what I meant.

           Andy smiles.

                                 ANDY
                        I don’t know, Ma.  I mean, it’s not like 
                        he gave us any answers did he?   

                                 JOYCE
                        Andy, I’ve spent almost forty years 
                        thinking I didn’t matter to the man who 
                        mattered the most to me.  He gave me all 
                        the answers I needed.  
                                 (then, with a smile)
                        Now, as for you and your “curse?”

                 Joyce removes a BOTTLE OF WATER from her purse.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        No such thing.  I wasn’t meant to be with 
                        my Andy.  I was meant to meet him.  To 
                        learn about myself from meeting him.  And 
                        then... I was meant to marry your father.  
                        If I hadn’t, I wouldn’t have had you.  
                        And if I had it to do all over again, I’d 
                        do it all the same.  I’m sure Andy would 
                        too.

           She smiles.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        When it’s not meant to be, you know it.  
                        And when it is, no matter how hard you 
                        try, you won’t be able to stop it.  No 
                        fear of commitment can stop it.  When 
                        it’s time for you to go the dance... 
                                      (MORE)
                                      JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        you’ll dance.  You won’t be able to help 
                        yourself.
                                 (then)
                        You’re going to be just fine, Andy.

                                 ANDY
                        You promise?

                                 JOYCE
                        I do.

           Joyce hands him the WATER BOTTLE.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Now you make sure to drink your water.

                                 ANDY
                        I will.

                                 JOYCE
                        Six bottles a day.

                                 ANDY
                        What’s good for Oprah is good for me.

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m going now before I start crying.  
                        Remember: if all the boys in the world 
                        were lined up and I could only pick--

                                 ANDY
                        Ma?

           She stops, interrupted.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        I wouldn’t have let you pick anyone else.

           Joyce touches her heart, feigns a swoon.  Then...

                                 JOYCE
                        Please.  You’d have let Mrs. Ernst pick 
                        you in a heartbeat.

                                 ANDY
                        No I wouldn’t.

                                 JOYCE
                        You loved her cookies.

                                 ANDY
                        You know what, Ma?  I try and say 
                        something nice and--
           The camera PULLS AWAY, as they continue arguing in the 
           middle of San Francisco airport.

                        JOYCE (O.S.)
           What about Mrs. Shapiro?  
           Remember how she’d let you 
           kids watch TV--
                                                     ANDY (O.S.)
                                             Well, yeah, well maybe if 
                                             you let me watch more than 
                                             two hours a week--

                                                     ANDY (O.S.)
                                             For the last time: UCLA was 
                                             not halfway around the 
                                             world!
                        JOYCE (O.S.)
           Sue me because I wanted you 
           to read!  It didn’t exactly 
           hurt you when you needed 
           that scholarship halfway 
           around the world-

           As the argument continues, we leave the airport and ...

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           TITLE CARD: EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER

           INT. UNDISCLOSED LOCATION - MORNING

           We open TIGHT ON ANDY.  He’s wearing a TUXEDO, looking 
           nervous.  A WEDDING PLANNER approaches.

                                 WEDDING PLANNER
                        It’s time.  You nervous?

                                 ANDY
                        A little.

                                 WEDDING PLANNER
                        No second guessing, I hope?

                                 ANDY
                        No.  None at all.

           Andy TURNS, revealing:

           ON JOYCE

           In a WEDDING GOWN.  Andy approaches her.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        You ready, Ma?

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m not sure I should be wearing white at 
                        this point in my life but what the hell.

           DOORS OPEN as Andy walks his mother down the AISLE OF...
           THE BIG TEXAN

           The site of her steak eating championship. 

           At the end of the “aisle” (the “stage”) stands JAMES, the 
           Cowboy she first met during her eating display.  He 
           smiles at the sight of her.

           INT. BIG TEXAN - LATER

           Up on STAGE, Joyce and James feed each other huge steaks 
           like a bride and groom share wedding cake at a normal 
           wedding.  They LAUGH.  We pull back to...

           ANDY

           He sits at a table, watching.  A country band starts 
           playing music and people begin DANCING.

                                 GIRL (O.S.)
                        Hey there.

           Andy turns, revealing...

           JOYCE MARGOLIS, the “original” Andy’s daughter.  Andy is 
           clearly surprised.  He stands.  As before, there’s 
           instant chemistry.

                                 ANDY
                        Hi.

                                 JOYCE
                                 (helping him)
                        Joyce.  Margolis.

                                 ANDY
                        No, yeah, of course.  Hi.  How are you?

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m good, I’m good.

           Awkward silence.  She breaks it.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Is it weird that I’m here?  Your Mom 
                        invited me, we’ve kept in touch a bit. 

                                 ANDY
                        Really?  I didn’t know that.
           Andy looks toward the dance floor.  His mother is dancing 
           with James, but watching them.  She smiles at him.  He 
           shakes his head at her.

                                 JOYCE
                        She’s hysterical.

                                 ANDY
                        Yes, well, that’s her thing.

           Andy looks at the girl in front of him.  She’s standing 
           there, vulnerable, beautiful, a little awkward.  

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        So?

                                 JOYCE
                        So?

           He smiles.  She smiles back.  It’s that awkward moment 
           when two people both realize there’s a legitimate 
           connection and they don’t know how to address it.

                                 ANDY
                        You like to dance?

                                 JOYCE
                        Not really.

                                 ANDY
                        Me neither.
                                 (then)
                        You want to dance?

                                 JOYCE
                        Definitely.

           Andy smiles, holds out his hand.

                                 ANDY
                        Let’s see what you got, Margolis.

                                 JOYCE
                        You can call me Joyce.

           He takes her hand, leads her toward the dance floor.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m sorry, I can’t.  I just can’t.

           She LAUGHS.  We pull back OVERHEAD as Andy and Joyce join 
           James and Joyce on the dance floor...
           INT. QVC STAGE - LATER

           ROLL END CREDITS as we watch Joyce and Andy, on a major 
           QVC set, selling Organiclean to the masses.  As they 
           bicker, phones LIGHT up in the control room.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Andy sits at a table with Joyce Margolis, drinking coffee 
           as they talk and laugh... clearly the last patrons there.

           INT. ANDY’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Andy plops contentedly into his empty bed, a big smile on 
           his face.  Clearly, he’s just had the best date ever.

           We PAN to his nightstand toward... A NEW PHOTO.  Andy and 
           his mother, smiling at the lip of the Grand Canyon.

           INT. JOYCE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A different nightstand, the same photo.  We PAN to the 
           bed where Joyce sits, glasses on, reading her book and 
           eating her M&M’s.  

           Next to her, her new cowboy husband sits reading the 
           paper.  Fittingly, he’s also eating M&M’s.   

           A DEDICATION types across screen:

           TO ALL THE MOTHERS, FROM ALL THE SONS... WE’D PICK YOU 
           EVERY TIME.

           AND NO, WE DON’T WANT MORE CHICKEN.

                                                           FADE TO BLACK:

                                         THE END.
