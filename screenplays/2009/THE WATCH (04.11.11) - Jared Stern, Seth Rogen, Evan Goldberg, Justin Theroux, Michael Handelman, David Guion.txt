           A starry sky hangs over a giant...

           EXT. COSTCO - NIGHT

           It's three a.m. in suburbia. Flood lights drench a massive empty parking lot.

           INT. COSTCO - NIGHT

           There's a GIANT STEREO display at the front of the store. WE SEE hands 
           turning it on, and CRANKING the volume way up.

           MUSIC UP: BOYZ IN THE HOOD by EAZY-E

           We see a CHUBBY SECURITY GUARD strutting like a gangsta through the 
           giant aisles of the store. He casually grabs a bottle of vodka off a shelf as he 
           passes.

           In another aisle, he crip-walks over to a martini shaker, still in the box. He takes 
           it out, pouring in the vodka as he DANCES. He shakes the shaker as he 
           rounds the corner.

           WE SEE a GIANT jar of olives. The guard unscrews the top and takes one, 
           resealing the jar after. He drops the olive in the shaker and chugs his drink. 
           This dude's getting fucked up.

                                                      SHOTS OF THE 
                                                      GUARD:

           - Playing DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION in the video game section.

           - Helping himself to some pills from the Pharmacy.

           - Taking a box of cigars.

           - Driving like a Gangsta on a kid's Big Wheel, chugging beers, and eating 
           cookies.

           The Guard is now using a forklift to put a massage chair in front of a wall of fifty 
           TV screens. He sits in the chair and picks up a remote, turning EVERY TV to the 
           same PORNO MOVIE. He pulls out a GIANT TUBE of LUBE and a joint.

                        Costco security, motherfucker.

           He's about to go to town, when suddenly, ALL THE TV's start to FLICKER.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
                        What the hell?

           Then, they all lose power, going black.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
                        Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.

           He gets up, going over to the fuse box, when suddenly, ALL THE LIGHTS IN 
           THE STORE GO OUT. It's pitch black.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
                        Oh man...

           The Guard pulls out his flashlight and starts walking over to the front doors, 
           when he hears a SKITTERING noise. He whips his flashlight around, only to 
           see...nothing.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
                        Hello?

           INT. COSTCO - BEVERAGE AISLE - MOMENTS LATER

           The guard tiptoes past oversized soda boxes. It's a little unsettling in here at 
           night in the dark -- one man dwarfed amidst the huge stacks. He spots an 
           overturned case of CRACKERS.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Who's here?! Stop fucking with me!! This isn't 
                        funny!

           The guard hears a louder SKITTERING sound behind him. He SPINS around 
           to see a towering PILE OF MICHELINS up against a wall, slowly wavering back 
           and forth.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He hears a noise behind him and whips his flashlight over and shines it on a 
           completely empty BATTERY DISPLAY CASE. One lone battery rolls onto the 
           floor, the noise echoing through the store.

           The guard steps forward into something squishy and looks down; he's 
           stepped in a pile of GREEN GOO.

           The guard nervously pulls out his gun.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
                        Listen, whoever's in here! They gave me a 
                        gun, okay? And...they didn't teach me how to 
                        use it properly! So if you don't fuck off, there is 
                        a very good chance I'll shoot you by accident!

           THUD! THUD! THUD!

           The Guard quickly spins around, shining the flashlight behind him.

           THUD! THUD! THUD!

           The sounds are getting louder. Closer.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        JUST TAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT! YOU 
                        WIN! Don't hurt me...

           The Guard squints in the direction of the sound, trying to make out the source. 
           Then...he sees it. His eyes widen in sheer terror. The guard shoots wildly, 
           manically trying to hit whatever is in front of him - BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! CLICK. 
           He's out of bullets.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
                        FUCK ME!!!

           The guard runs for his life. We can hear footsteps gaining on him.

           FROM WHATEVER IS CHASING THE GUARD'S POV: We see we are gaining 
           on the Guard as he frantically pulls whatever he can off the shelves and throws 
           it back at us.

           The guard reaches the FRONT DOOR. Desperately fishes for his keys. Finally 
           finds the right one.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
                        YES!!!

           Too late. Something pounces on him.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
                        NOOO-

           EXT. COSTCO - CONTINUOUS

           BLOOD SPLATTERS on the sliding doors of the front entrance, covering the 
           "Welcome to Costco" sign.

           EXT. SUBURBS - DAY

           - As the sun comes up over the horizon, a GROUP OF EIGHT MEN run through 
           the quiet suburbs.

           Leading the pack is EVAN, wearing an oversized fanny pack and listening to an 
           iPod, a satisfied smile on his face. They run past a welcome sign to 
           HUMBOLDT, ARIZONA.

                                 EVAN
                             (yelling to the group)
                        STAY IN FORMATION! ONLY FIVE MILES TO 
                        GO!!! KEEP THOSE HEART RATES UP 
                        PEOPLE!!!

           - Evan and the group run past a SLEEPY WOMAN getting her newspaper. Evan 
           waves to her but she does not see.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                             (too loud)
                        HEY MRS. KITCHNER!!!

           CONTINUED:

           Unbeknownst to Evan, who keeps on jogging, the woman stumbles 
           backwards, startled.

           - Evan and the group runs up and down the stairs at HUMBOLDT 
           HIGHSCHOOL'S football stadium.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                             (counting the stairs)

                        (to the group)
                        ONLY THIRTEEN THOUSAND TO GO! KEEP 
                        UP THE HUSTLE GUYS!!!

           - Evan and the group run through a beautiful park. One of the RANDOM 
           JOGGERS gets a pain in his leg.

                                 RANDOM JOGGER
                        CRAMP! CRAMP!

           Evan and everyone stops, serious looks on their faces.

           - Evan stretches the Random Jogger's leg in a humorously sexual manner as 
           the rest of the group jogs on the spot.

                                 EVAN
                        Breathe deep and breath easy, Jared. Close 
                        those eyes. Where are you? You're sitting in a 
                        very comfortable chair. Let all the tension 
                        slide up your spine and out through the top of 
                        your head...

           - The group is stopped near a public restroom. Evan steps out of the restroom.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        Okay guys! My pee was notably more yellow 
                        than I'd like to admit, so we should probably 
                        all hydrate. It's a scorcher out here, better safe 
                        than sorry.

           - Evan SPRINTS around a corner and comes to a quick stop at a community 
           bulletin board. He runs in place while unzipping his fanny pack and removing a 
           stack of FLYERS. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

           He staples them to the corkboard: 1)VOLUNTEERS NEEDED FOR 
           COMMUNITY LANDSCAPING PROJECT 2)JOIN THE HUMBOLDT RECYCLING 
           TEAM 3)MEALS ON WHEELS. Just as he finishes, the rest of the group rounds 
           the corner and he nonchalantly rejoins the pack.

           - Evan runs down his block towards his house. A neighbor is happily washing 
           his car. As Evan approaches him he waves to the neighbor.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        Spray me! Jake! Spray me, neighbor!

           Jake smiles and gives Evan a quick spray to the face.

           Evan runs up to his picturesque suburban home. He looks back on his 
           neighborhood; the manicured lawns, kids playing in front of their perfect 
           houses as the sun glistens from on high. The suburbs kick fucking ass.

           INT. EVAN'S HOME - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Evan disrobes and hops in the shower.

           We see FRAMED PHOTOS of Evan with his wife ABBY. They look like a happy 
           couple.

           INT. EVAN'S HOME - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Evan, dressed in a Costco polo shirt and looks himself over in the mirror.

           We see Evan's wife ABBY look up from her PACKED SUITCASE.

                                 EVAN
                        I'm gonna miss you.

                                 ABBY
                        Aww, I'll miss you too. It's just two nights, and 
                        you're so busy anyway with all your clubs and 
                        stuff.

                                 EVAN
                        Don't I know it. The recycling team is turning 
                        out to be way more than I bargained for.

                        This city really has an ass backwards system 
                        in place.

                                 ABBY
                        Well, now you can focus on getting that stuff 
                        out of the way and I'll take in some shows. Go 
                        to a museum. You know, get some culture.

                                 EVAN
                             (playful)
                        Well, I guess that's the trade-off then. Get a 
                        little culture, lose a lot of personal safety. No 
                        biggie though, right? I mean, it's only your life.

           Abby rolls her eyes and zips up her suitcase.

                                 ABBY
                        You're such a pussy.

                                 EVAN
                        I'm not a pussy. You always say that, but I'm 
                        not. I'm prudent, and educated. Did you know 
                        that in New York every three minutes 
                        someone gets stabbed, every four minutes a 
                        baby is abandoned and every six minutes a 
                        tranny shoots an innocent businesswoman in 
                        the back?

           Abby smiles.

                                 ABBY
                        Every four minutes?

                        Another businesswoman was JUST gunned 
                        down by a tranny. As we were talking.

                        The city isn't like Humboldt, where we're 
                        completely insulated from nutjobs and 
                        crackheads by an invisible financial barrier. 
                        That's why they invented the suburbs in the 
                        first place. So people wouldn't have to worry 
                        about things like vandalism, robbery, 
                        assaults, murders. Why would anyone 
                        choose to live somewhere like that? Being 
                        nothing more than an anonymous face in a 
                        huge, uncaring crowd; here today, gone 
                        tomorrow. In a place like Humboldt you can 
                        have a legacy, it's contained, controlled. It's 
                        just so much easier.

                                 ABBY
                        Are you done yet?

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, I'm done. Now I'm just gonna walk 
                        across my front yard, which doesn't exist in 
                        New York, and head on down to my adorable 
                        little mailbox, which definitely doesn't exist in 
                        New York, and then have an amazing 
                        breakfast featuring bacon, which I'm pretty 
                        sure, due to all the Jewish people, also does 
                        NOT exist in New York.

           Evan winks at her. Abby's not amused.

                                 ABBY
                        I'll call you when I get there.

                        I'll be waiting here...in the comfort of our 
                        beautiful home...situated in our quiet and 
                        charming suburban neighborhood...free from 
                        the societal ills of-

                                 ABBY
                        Okay! Okay.

           Abby goes over to Evan and starts KISSING him. He gets a little uncomfortable.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        You think... maybe we can... get one in before I 
                        go?

                                 EVAN
                             (clearly doesn't want to have sex)
                        Oh man. I wish. Like...I'm so super horny. I'm 
                        like hard already just talking about it... but I 
                        just, I gotta get to work-

                        Are you sure we can't-

                                 EVAN
                        I'm the boss, Abby. Leadership by example. 
                        Costco wouldn't function without me there.

                                 ABBY
                        Okay, that's fine. I don't want to pressure you.

                                 EVAN
                        I appreciate that. I love you.

           He kisses her.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        Call me when you get there!
           INT. EVAN'S CAR - LATER

           We see Evan, dressed in his Costco polo shirt, driving his car towards work 
           while talking on the cell phone.

                                 EVAN
                             (into phone)
                        What do you mean the toilet paper's not 
                        coming in till Tuesday? Well we're down to 
                        four crates, and we got two extra frozen burrito 
                        shipments last week, so, you do the math.
                             (beat)
                        No, I'm literally saying that the people of 
                        Humboldt will be shitting more than there is 
                        toilet paper to wipe it up with.
                             (beat)
                        Okay, good. Thank you. And I've gone through 
                        the inventory again, we're missing another 
                        crate of batteries. That means shoplifting, 
                        Terry, and I don't tolerate shoplifting in my 
                        store. As the deputy of the anti-shoplifting 
                        committee I really hoped you'd be more on top 
                        of this. 
                             (beat)
                        Okay. I'm sorry for raising my voice. Talk to you 
                        later. 

           Evan hangs up.

           EXT. COSTCO - LATER

           Evan pulls into the parking lot drinking a large, pink JAMBA JUICE only to find 
           the entrance of Costco sectioned off with POLICE CAUTION TAPE. Behind the 
           tape is a PARTITION, blocking the front doors. In the background there is a 
           single NEWS VAN setting up.

           Evan parks his car and heads towards the front doors. He passes by a GROUP 
           OF COPS standing off to the side, drinking coffee. One of the officers, 
           SERGEANT BRESSMAN (mid-30s, friendly) spots Evan approaching the tape 
           and jogs over.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Whoa. Sorry sir, can't let you go back there.

                                 EVAN
                        Oh, I'm actually the manager here, so-

           Evan proudly shows his IDENTIFICATION and steps forward. Again, Evan tries 
           to enter but Sergeant Bressman holds him back.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        Okay, well, can you tell me what happened? Is 
                        it serious?

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        I'm really not supposed to share details of an 
                        on-going investigation. It's policy.

                                 EVAN
                        Look, I run this place. Can you at least tell me 
                        when I can expect to be allowed back inside?

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Gee, tough to say. We still gotta make heads 
                        or tails of the situation. Never dealt with 
                        anything even close to this before. So, I don't 
                        know, a few weeks? Months maybe?

                                 EVAN
                        What?!

           Evan looks over at a GROUP OF POLICE OFFICERS standing around, drinking 
           coffee.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        Okay, look, can I just speak to whoever's in 
                        charge here?

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Yes. Uh, that would be me.

           Sergeant Bressman smiles and points to his badge.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 EVAN
                        You?

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Yes, sir. Sergeant Bressman.
                             (beat; leans in)
                        Tell you what, I'm not supposed to do this, but 
                        seeing as how you're the manager, and you 
                        seem really interested, I think we can bend 
                        the rules this one time.
                             (beat; whispering)
                        It's murder.

                                 EVAN
                        WHAT?! Are you fucking serious?!

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        'Fraid so. It's real messed up in there. By far 
                        the grossest thing I've ever seen in my whole 
                        life. Yeah, looks like buddy was ripped apart 
                        by a wild animal.

           Evan can't believe what he's hearing. Sergeant Bressman whips out his NOTE 
           PAD, excited.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN (CONT'D)
                        Oh, speaking of which, do you happen to 
                        know the name of the guy that was working 
                        here last night?

                                 EVAN
                        Uh, yeah. Antonio De Luca.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                             (writing)
                        Whoa, that's a mouthful. Slow down a second. 
                        An-to-nio De Lu-ca.
                             (beat)
                        Yeah, you could make out the uniform but, uh, 
                        the name tag was torn to shreds.
                             (beat; to himself)
                        Okay. Victim's name. Check.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Yep.

                                 EVAN
                             (overwhelmed)
                        Oh my god...
                             (thinks)
                        Well, what're you guys gone do? Someone 
                        has to do something!

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Oh yeah! I know. I mean, there's a lot to deal 
                        with. I gotta talk to the media. I mean, that's a 
                        whole job right there, and then on top of that 
                        you throw on a whole murder investigation 
                        and-
                             (shaking his head)
                        Let's just say it's a lot more "stuff" than I'm 
                        used to. But I'm on it. 

           Evan looks at Sergeant Bressman skeptically.

                                 EVAN
                        Well, what steps have you taken so far?

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Gee, uh, we only got here a few hours ago. 
                        Umm, we've set up this partition, as you can 
                        see...

                                 EVAN
                        Have you dusted the scene for prints? 
                        Searched the perimeter of the building? 
                        Anything?

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Uh, not just...

                        you're talking about. You an ex-cop?

                                 EVAN
                             (annoyed)
                        No. I'm just applying common sense.
                             (beat, proud)
                        And, actually, I am experienced. I've been 
                        spearheading an anti-shoplifting campaign at 
                        Costco for the past few months.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Cool, man.

                             (cocksurely)
                        Were any of the windows or doors broken in?

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                             (taken aback)
                        Sir. A man is dead.

                                 EVAN
                        No, I mean is there any sign of forced entry?

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Oh. Ohhhh. No, I don't think so.

                                 EVAN
                        So the suspect must've had a key.

           Sergeant Bressman nods along.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Do you have a key?

                                 EVAN
                        Of course I do. I'm the manager.

                        took a quick peek, see if anything catches 
                        your eye.

                        Finally.

           Sergeant Bressman lifts the tape for Evan to duck under, then leads him to the 
           partition. Sergeant Bressman pulls the partition back a few inches for Evan to 
           see:

           Antonio De Luca's body is SPLATTERED across the front doors, blood and 
           guts everywhere.

                        Oh my fucking-

           Evan lurches over, drops to his knee and VOMITS pink Jamba Juice on the 
           ground. The news crew captures it on film.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Aww, jesus man, I thought you were a pro!

           Evan looks up again and sees a severed arm covered in blood and GREEN 
           GOO. Evan throws up again.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN (CONT'D)
                        Aww, gross! Alright, this was a mistake. Just 
                        get out of here. Go!

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah...okay. I'm...uh...sorry. Just, call me when 
                        I can be of service.

           Evan walks back to his car, a disturbed look on his face.

           WE SEE: Evan driving his car down the road, crying.

           WE SEE: Evan pulling up to a modest home in a Hispanic neighborhood, now 
           wearing a black suit. He somberly knocks on the door, and a short Hispanic 
           lady answers. Evan and her exchange a few words, and he hands her 
           Antonio's name tag. The woman drops to her knees, crying hysterically.

           WE SEE: Evan, standing in front of a PACKED CROWD of weeping Hispanic 
           people in Antonio's living room. He is finishing delivering a heartfelt eulogy.

                                 EVAN
                             (in perfect Spanish)
                        ...y es el razon que Antonio va a estar vivir
                        siempre.

           INT. EVAN'S HOME - NIGHT

           Evan sits on the couch, saddened, eating TV dinners while watching the 
           LOCAL NEWS. The headline reads "MAN KILLED AT COSTCO". Sergeant 
           Bressman appears on the screen being interviewed.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        ...we, as cops, will do the best we can, but I for 
                        one would like to put some of the 
                        responsibility on the citizens of this town.
                             (looks into camera)
                        Where were you? How could nobody see 
                        anything? There's only like five cops in this 
                        town, and there's thousands of you guys, 
                        so...yeah, not to point fingers or anything, but...

           Sergeant Bressman points at the camera, then walks away.

                                 NEWSREPORTER
                        We caught up with several Humboldtians who 
                        gathered around the store this morning, 
                        some literally sick to their stomachs over the 
                        incident.

           - We see multiple angles of Evan throwing up at Costco.

           INT. EVAN'S SUBURBAN HOME - A BIT LATER

           Evan is now on the phone.

                                 ABBY (O.S.)
                             (through phone)
                        You threw up on TV?

                                 EVAN
                        It was gross, okay? You would've done the 
                        same.

                                 ABBY
                        I can't believe that. That's just crazy. I'm so 
                        sorry.

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah. It's pretty fucked. The whole De Luca
                        family was pretty rocked by the news.

                                 ABBY
                        Oh man.

                                 EVAN
                        I don't mean to bum you out. Are you having 
                        fun?

                                 ABBY
                        Yeah... You know. It's fine. Nothing too crazy.

                                                      WE CUT TO:

           INT. CRAZY PARTY - CONTINUOUS

           We see Abby is in fact at an AWESOME New York party in the meat packing 
           district. Her friends CARLA and ABBY are dancing in the background with 
           martinis in hand.

                                 CARLA
                        Get off the FUCKING phone, girl!

                        We're just... having a few drinks. Well what are 
                        you gonna do all day if Costco's closed?

                                 EVAN
                        Well, I think it's obvious. I have to do 
                        something about this.

                                 ABBY
                        What? No you don't. That's what the police are 
                        paid to do.

                                 EVAN
                        The police? Yeah right! They couldn't solve a... 
                        you know... simplistic, simple, like, thing that's 
                        super easy to solve. Abby, I'm a pillar of the 
                        community. People are gonna be looking to 
                        me for a solution.

           Evan notices the TV is playing yet another news story of him throwing up.

                                 ABBY
                        Are you starting another club, Evan?

                                 EVAN
                             (beat)
                        Maybe.

           Abby rolls her eyes.

                                 ABBY
                        Well-

           Carla comes up to Abby and grabs her shoulder.

                                 CARLA
                        Seriously, Abby. Look at who we are 
                        FUCKING dancing with!

           Abby looks to see Stephanie grinding with DAVID BOREANAZ.

                                 ABBY
                        Okay. Fine. Do what you've gotta do. I'll see 
                        you tomorrow.

                                 EVAN
                        Alright, love ya.

           Abby gets the bartender's attention.

           MUSIC UP: WE WANT EAZY by EAZY-E

           INT. EVAN'S HOME - BATHROOM

           - Evan stares at himself in the mirror, psyching himself up.

           - Evan grabs a Costco Shirt out of his closet.

           - He irons LETTERS onto his shirt.

           - He grabs a tube of hair gel and slicks his hair back. All business.

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

           The whole town has come out for the high school football game, Friday Night 
           Lights-style.

           The 2nd quarter ends and both teams run off the field.

           Evan sits in the stands, mentally preparing.

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH

           A TEENAGE ANNOUNCER shuffles through some papers.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        That's the half. And as the players march into 
                        their dressing rooms, we are now joined on 
                        the field by...

           The Announcer look at a piece of paper that has a FIFTY DOLLAR BILL paper 
           clipped to it.

                        Evan. Trautwig.

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Evan walks on the field. The front of his Costco shirt reads "NEIGHBORHOOD 
           WATCH". The back says "NO MORE MURDERS".

                                 TEENAGE ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Hey, isn't that the guy that puked himself on 
                        the news?

           Sporadic laughter throughout the crowd. Evan nods and takes the mic. His 
           voice carries through the stands.

                                 EVAN
                        Sure. Go ahead. Laugh. If that's how you 
                        choose to cope with the grief of this terrible, 
                        terrible tragedy, then so be it.
                             (beat; gravely)
                        But make no mistake about it Humboldt, you 
                        are grieving. We are in shock. And yes, I did 
                        vomit on television. And do you know why? 
                        Because what I saw...made me sick.

           And this effects all of us.

           In the stands, we see BOB (45) listening intently to Evan's message. Bob then 
           directs his attention to CHELSEA, his blossoming teenage daughter (15, 
           Cheerleader) who is flirting with JASON (15, football player). Bob's eyes 
           narrow.

                        I come to you as a humble citizen attempting 
                        to preserve the sanctity of our suburbs. You 
                        know, I was born and raised here in 
                        Humboldt, just like most of you. Proud of it. 
                        Because unlike the New Yorks and the 
                        Parises of the world, here we care for each 
                        other. We look out for our own. We don't live in 
                        virtual anonymity; we know who our neighbors 
                        are, and we have the consideration to protect 
                        them.

           Evan lets this sink in.

                                 EVAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Our police are ill-equipped to deal with this 
                        new threat. They've said so themselves.

           In the stands, we see this resonate with FRANKLIN (22). He nods and crushes 
           a plastic beer cup in his hand.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        And so we need to step up our game as 
                        neighbors. It is with this in mind, that I am 
                        forming a Neighborhood Watch group to keep 
                        an eye on any and all suspicious activity, and, 
                        you know...generally get to the bottom of 
                        things.

           JAMARCUS (36, African American) listens to Evan, intrigued.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        It is my sincere hope that this Neighborhood 
                        Watch will become an institution in Humboldt. 
                        Join me, and join my legacy.

           SPORADIC PITY APPLAUSE from the audience. Essentially the entire crowd is 
           unmoved and annoyed by Evan's speech. All except for Bob, Franklin, and 
           Jamarcus, who are standing on their feet, nodding in agreement.

           INT. EVAN'S HOME - EVENING

           Evan is rushing around as he lays out a HUGE array of appetizers. The 
           doorbell rings.

           INT. EVAN'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Franklin and Jamarcus are uncomfortably squashed together on the lone, tiny 
           couch. Bob browses the living room, curiously inspecting family photos and 
           various antiques. Evan stands before them, looking at his watch. Then to the 
           door.

           Bob picks up a RUSSIAN DOLL and starts opening it. He continues to open the 
           doll, layer after layer.

                                 BOB
                        Man this thing is great! Where can I pick up 
                        one of these?

                                 EVAN
                        Not actually sure.

                                 BOB
                        Well where'd you get this one?

                                 EVAN
                        I don't remember. Might have been a wedding 
                        gift...please don't touch it.

           Bob drops the doll and is SMASHES on the floor.

                                 BOB
                        Well, this is a bad first impression. I am truly 
                        and honestly sorry.

                                 EVAN
                        It's fine. Really. You wanna, uh, grab a seat?

           CONTINUED:

           Bob reaches the couch where Franklin and Jamarcus are sitting. There is 
           barely any space left.

                                 FRANKLIN
                             (annoyed)
                        I hope you're not thinking of trying to sit here, 
                        'cause that's just not gonna work.

                                 BOB
                        No worries, fella. It's the only other spot there 
                        is. We'll just have to make do. Shove-a-bum.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Seriously dude...

           Bob squeezes himself between Franklin and Jamarcus. They are very 
           uncomfortable.

           Evan stands before them with a map of the neighborhood on a cork board 
           beside him.

                                 EVAN
                        Alright guys! I'm so happy to see you guys 
                        came out. How about we just start with 
                        everyone introducing themselves and saying 
                        why they joined?

           Bob waves to the group.

                                 BOB
                        Bob with a B. Love my town, love my

                        I applied to Humboldt police department and 
                        those uppity shitheads laughed right in my 
                        face. Those stupid fucking assholes said I 
                        didn't have what it took. This vigilante squad 
                        seemed like the quickest and easiest way to 
                        get back at them.

                                 EVAN
                        Okay, I wouldn't quite call us a vigilante 
                        squad, but-

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Well, whatever we're called, I wanna solve this 
                        Costco shit and shove it right up Sergeant 
                        Bressman's ass and all his fuck-off flunkies!

                                 BOB
                        Whoa, you kids got balls. Nice.

           The guys all look to Jamarcus.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Uhh, I'm Jamarcus.

                                 EVAN
                        Great. Well, welcome Jamarcus. I feel like I 
                        haven't seen you around before. Are you new 
                        to Humboldt?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Yep, just moved here. I'm recently happily 
                        divorced. I'm retired, and, I just don't have 
                        much to do with my evenings, so I thought I'd 
                        join this. 

                                 EVAN
                        Wow. It's great to see that you wanna protect 
                        the community that you just moved to.

                        Oh, yeah, but mostly, I have this scenario in 
                        my head, and I'm hoping it plays out like this: 
                        a young sexy Asian housewife alone at night, 
                        frightened. A sound outside by the trashcans, 
                        is it a raccoon, a prowler, or something much 
                        worse? Better call the Neighborhood Watch! I 
                        show up, look heroic, and then... I fuck the 
                        living shit out of her. 

                                 FRANKLIN
                        I also want that to happen. 

                                 BOB
                        Due to my marital vows, I can't  participate, but 
                        I'd love to watch. 

                                 EVAN
                        Well, Jamarcus, Bob, Franklin... I guess it 
                        doesn't matter what brought us here, all that 
                        matters is that we have a common goal. I'd 
                        like to welcome you all to the first official 
                        meeting of...THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH.

           Evan flips over a piece of cardboard and reveals their neighborhood watch 
           logo. Evan is pleased with himself. He unfolds a MAP in front of the guys.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        So...I printed out a map of the neighborhood, 
                        and I think really what we need to do is get a 
                        system going. We break it down into 
                        quadrants and then assign roles-

           Bob squirms on the couch.

                                 BOB
                        Sorry to be the squeaky wheel, but the kid's 
                        right; we're squished here. And it sounds like 
                        you've got a lot of really dense material to get 
                        through. If I'm not stepping on your toes, my 
                        place is just a few blocks away. I got a great 
                        little set up. Drinks. Lazy Boy's.

                        up, you guys'll love it. I'm practically wet just 
                        thinking about it.
                             (to Evan)
                        But, hey, if I'm overstepping, you say the word, 
                        and you won't hear another squeak from this 
                        wheel.

                                 EVAN
                        Well, I kinda thought we'd hit the ground 
                        running right after our short "breaking of the 
                        ice" portion of the evening.

                                 BOB
                        Squeak! Squeak! It's just...wouldn't it be even 
                        better to break ACTUAL ice? Into cubes? And 
                        pour scotch all over them? In my awesome 
                        dude-cavern?

           Franklin perks up, interested.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Well that sounds way better than this. No 
                        offense, Kevin.

                        Evan.

           Beat.

                                 BOB
                        Okay! Off we go then.

           Bob winks at Evan. Evan reluctantly removes the map from his wall.

           INT. BOB'S HOUSE - GARAGE - SOON AFTER

           Bob opens the door and flicks on the light, revealing a garage which has been 
           converted into a pimped-out old boy's club -- Lazy boys, big screen TV, fridge, 
           pool table, the works.

           CONTINUED:

           Franklin and Jamarcus are psyched. Evan follows behind.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Oh, man! A pool table!? Now we're talking. 

           Jamarcus excitedly rubs the felt of the table.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, yeah. Just got it re-felted. Go ahead, 
                        take her for a spin. She's lubed up and ready 
                        to fuuuuck.

           Jamarcus and Franklin laugh. Bob notices that Evan found the comment 
           disgusting.

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        Fair warning: I get a little raunchy when the 
                        wife's not around. Just putting that out there 
                        right now.

           Franklin plunks down in a Lazy Boy massage chair, and turns it on.

                                 FRANKLIN
                             (vibrating, in ecstacy)
                        Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

           Bob points at the massage chair.

                                 BOB
                        Ha, you like that, huh? Best $2300 bucks I 
                        ever spent, Relaxtheback.com. It's like Toys R  
                        US for your ass and back.

           Bob turns to Jamarcus.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Rack 'em up, I'll play ya. Maybe we could do a 
                        little round robin type thing. Evan, you in? 
                        What's your poison? You down with scotch?

           Bob excitedly walks over to his fully-stocked bar, and takes out an old bottle of 
           SCOTCH. Jamarcus noisily starts gathering the balls. The massage chair 
           starts vibrating as it kneads Franklin's back, causing him to moan in ecstacy.

                             (annoyed)
                        Guys, I think we might be getting a little side-
                        tracked here. We're all here for a 
                        reason...pretty sure it's not to shoot pool.

                                 BOB
                        Aw, c'mon Evan, we're bonding here. Tell me 
                        about yourself. I know you have a wife. Got 
                        kids? How old?

                        Uh, zero. We don't have any.

                                 BOB
                        That's a shame. What's the plan? You waiting 
                        til you're 50 and your balls shrivel up into 
                        raisins?
                             (laughs)
                        I'm just kidding around. But seriously, why the 
                        big wait?

                                 EVAN
                             (unamused)
                        Well, frankly Bob, that's really none of your 
                        business.

                                 BOB
                        Got it. I hear ya loud and clear. Ol' Bob-a-roo's 
                        been known to overstep his boundaries a 
                        time or two. Sorry buddy!

           Bob can't help himself.

                        It's just...such a huge part of the human

                        You know what it is? It's the feeling that you've

                        Just knowing that, to her, the sun rises and 
                        sets with her old man. I wouldn't change a 
                        hair on her head.

                        Come on! Are you serious?! Megan's allowed 
                        to stay out til 12 on weeknights.

                        Well thank you for proving my point. Megan's 
                        going nowhere in life. It's time you realized 
                        that. Go upstairs and read or something.

                        I thought you hit the nail right on the head the 
                        other night in your announcement. About

                        for bringing us all together under the same 
                        roof. My roof. But enough of this jive talk...let's
                        celebrate. I got this 18-year old bottle of 
                        scotch, so let's suck this bitch down.

           They cheers and slam back their shots.

                        this, we could get mad pussy. Bob, you sure 
                        you aren't down to mess around? 

                                 BOB
                        Talk to the ring!

           Bob holds up his wedding ring.

                        Fair enough. Can I get another swallow of that 
                        scotch? 

                                 BOB
                        Swallow all you like. There's no law against it. 
                        She's aged eighteen and begging for it.

           Franklin laughs.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        You are sincerely a dirty motherfucker, Bob. 

                                 BOB
                        I warned you! I go for it.

           Evan watches the guys laughing. Bob tops off Franklin and Jamarcus' drinks. 
           Evan realizes they aren't going anywhere. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Evan? More hooch? 

           Evan looks at his watch. 

                                 EVAN
                        Nah. You know what, you guys should totally 
                        get to know each other tonight and tomorrow 
                        we can hit the streets. I think I'm just gonna
                        head home.

                                 BOB
                        What? Come on, we're just getting started.

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, I'm just...tired.

                                 BOB
                        Alright, well then, tomorrow; same Bob-time, 
                        same Bob-house. 

                                 EVAN

           Evan leaves, dismayed.

                        Alright Jamrock, you rack I crack!

           EXT. STREET - SOON AFTER

           Evan walks home. The streets are quiet. No activity whatsoever. He suddenly 
           hears some rustling in a neighbor's bushes, and perks up. A raccoon 
           emerges, stops, looks at Evan with disdain, and runs away. Evan walks on, 
           disappointed.

           EXT. EVAN'S HOME - SOON AFTER

           Evan approaches his house to see PAUL (35, good looking), peering in his 
           windows.

                                 EVAN
                        Hey! You! What the hell?!

           The man turns around.

                                 PAUL
                        Oh. There you are. 56 Jerome Park Drive.

                                 EVAN
                        What?

           Paul approaches, MAGAZINE in hand.

                                 PAUL
                        I'm 46. Jerome Park Drive. Name's Paul. I 
                        believe this was meant for you...

                        Evan Trautwig. Subscriber to Mens' Fitness.

           Paul presents Evan with a MENS' FITNESS magazine.

                                 EVAN
                             (warily)
                        Thank you.

           Evan reaches to take it and Paul pulls the magazine back.

                                 PAUL
                        Not that you need it.

                                 EVAN
                        Excuse me?

           Paul folds the magazine into a telescope. He looks through it, scanning Evan 
           up and down.

                                 PAUL
                        You have the body of a decathlete.

           Evan feels violated as Paul hands him back the magazine.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                             (searching)
                        So, uh, you live alone in that big 'ol house?

           Thoroughly creeped out, Evan starts walking back inside.

                                 EVAN
                        No, actually I live with my female wife. Abby. 
                        I'm, uhhh, going to go inside now.

                                 PAUL
                        Oh, by the way, I heard your little speech the 
                        other day. It was rousing. I wish I could 
                        participate, but my evenings are generally 
                        filled.

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah? That's great.

                                 PAUL
                        It truly is.
                             (beat)
                        Alright Evan Trautwig. Stay fit.

           Evan shuts the door and locks it.
           EXT. AIRPORT - THE NEXT MORNING

           Abby walks out of the airport with her suitcase and numerous large shopping 
           bags. She sees Evan in his car waiting at the curb. He gets out and hugs her. 

                                 EVAN
                        Welcome back!!

           INT. EVAN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           They drive home. 

                                 ABBY
                        It. Was. Amazing. Like, unbelievable.

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah?

                                 ABBY
                        God, there's just so much to do there. We saw 
                        all these shows, the Natural History Museum, 
                        the Met, MOMA. Central Park. And the 
                        shopping, Evan! I got the cutest pair of shoes.

           Abby unzips her suitcase.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        Ohhh, I have soooo many amazing stories. 
                        That city is just alive! The restaurants, oh my 
                        god.

                                 EVAN
                        Mmm hmm. And you didn't get mugged?

                                 ABBY
                        No, I didn't get mugged.

                                 EVAN
                        What about Carla and Stephanie?

                                 ABBY
                        Nobody got mugged, Evan.

                        That's surprising. Statistically, one of you 
                        should've been mugged.

                                 ABBY
                        Well, sorry to disappoint you. It's not nearly as 
                        bad there as you think. New York is actually 
                        surprisingly safe these days. Unlike... some 
                        places...

                                 EVAN
                        You can say it. Antonio got murdered, and 
                        now you think my whole argument about the 
                        city is stupid. 

                                 ABBY
                        I never said that. It's completely and utterly 
                        true, but I never said that. 

                                 EVAN
                        Well, it might be true, that the burbs might not 
                        be as safe as we thought, but you know the 
                        difference between people here and the city? 

                                 ABBY
                        People in the city know what aioli is? 

                                 EVAN
                        No. It's that people here help each other. 
                        Yesterday I made an appeal to the community 
                        to keep an eye out for each other and form 
                        and Neighborhood Watch and people came 
                        out in droves to participate. 

                                 ABBY
                        How many people? 

                                 EVAN
                        Three.

                                 EVAN
                        Very funny. 

           INT. EVAN'S HOME - A BIT LATER

           Abby and Evan come in the front door. Abby puts down her stuff and goes over 
           to Evan, somewhat sexually. 

                                 ABBY
                        Well, I'm really happy I'm home, and... I 
                        thought since you're not working today, maybe 
                        we could go upstairs and... you know... have 
                        sex.

                                 EVAN
                        I mean, well, I was just about to go out and 
                        start putting up the Neighborhood Watch 
                        signs...

           Evan motions to a stack of home-made signs that say "NEIGHBORHOOD 
           WATCH PATROLLED AREA. ANY SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY SHOULD BE 
           REPORTED." 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        And it's early. You know how I feel. I don't 
                        usually get, you know...horny...until it's dark 
                        out. Morning sex always feels pre-emptive. 

                                 ABBY
                        So... maybe tonight?

                        tonight, maybe steak out the Costco, so... I 
                        can't commit at this moment to sex tonight. 

                                 ABBY
                        Look, is this about...

                                 EVAN
                        No. 

                                 ABBY
                        Because when I was in New York, I actually 
                        looked on line and found that they have some 
                        of the best fertility clinics in the country, and-

                                 EVAN
                        It's not that. It has nothing to do with... that. I 
                        just have alot of stuff to do. Welcome home. 
                        I'm glad you're back. Tomorrow night, my 
                        penis and your vagina have a date. 

           Abby smiles and this lightens the mood. 

                                 ABBY
                        Okay, good.

                                 EVAN
                        Alright, great. Now I've got to get going. These 
                        signs aren't going to put themselves up. Love 
                        you.

           Evan pecks her on the cheek and leaves. Abby's smile fades away; she is 
           clearly worried. 

           INT. STREET - LATER

           VARIOUS SHOTS of Evan putting up Neighborhood Watch signs around town.
           INT. EVAN'S CAR - NIGHT

           The Neighborhood Watch sit in Evan's parked car across the street from 
           Costco. The guys sit in silence. Everyone but Evan looks bored.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Well, not a cop in sight. No surprise there. 
                        Such fucking amateurs. It's like we're doing 
                        their job for them.

           A long silent beat as the guys sit in the car. Evan peers around the surrounding 
           area, vigilantly looking for anything suspicious. Everyone else is just bored. 

                                 BOB
                        Can we at least put some tunes on?

                                 EVAN
                        No. We don't wanna give away our position. 
                        Could draw undue attention.

           Franklin nods in agreement.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Copy.

           Beat.

                        I know this is gonna sound childish, but I have 
                        to pee. 

                                 EVAN
                        Well, that does sound childish, and as an 
                        adult, you should have thought of that before. 
                        Now you're gonna have to hold it.

           Long silent beat. 

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Seriously, how long are we gonna do this for? 
                        Franklin owes me a rematch at pool. Or we 
                        could go to a titty bar.

                        Let's just have some fucking fun. We could 
                        literally be drunk at a titty bar right now. God 
                        this is boring...

                        You guys, this is a stake out. We have to stay 
                        as long as it takes till we see some action.

           The guys sit in silence.

                                 BOB
                        I still have to pee. 

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Here, piss in this empty pop can. 

                                 EVAN
                        NO! Don't piss in that can, it'll get all over. 

                                 BOB
                        No it won't. I shoot straight, Ev-dog. 

                                 FRANKLIN
                        I have a ziploc bag. You could piss in that. 

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Why'd you bring a ziploc? 

                                 FRANKLIN
                        In case we find any evidence. 

                                 EVAN
                        God! Just...just open the door a bit and piss
                        out. 

                                 BOB
                        Gotcha. 

           Everyone sits in silence as Bob opens the door a few inches, unzips his pants, 
           and pees out the side of the car.

                        So, did I miss anything while I was pissing? 
                        You guys catch the killer?

                        This isn't a joke, Bob! Sickos like this Costco
                        Killer always return to the scene of the crime. 

                                 FRANKLIN
                        It's true! They get off on it. The guy is probably 
                        beating off and staring at it right now, reliving 
                        his sick fantasy.

           CRACK! Evan turns around to see Bob cracking open a BEER.

                                 BOB
                        What?

                                 EVAN
                        You can't have open liquor in a car.

                                 BOB
                        Why not? The car's not even moving.
                             (to Franklin)
                        Hey Franklin, you failed police academy. Is 
                        this illegal or what?

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Definitely illegal.

                        of them shits.

           Bob tosses Jamarcus a beer. Franklin starts nodding.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        It's illegal, but so is sodomy in this state, so 
                        what's the law know? 

           Bob tosses Franklin a beer. Evan shakes his head, annoyed.

           INT. EVAN'S CAR - LATER

           Evan still stares out the window, annoyed. Music is loudly playing and the guys 
           are throwing back beers, drunker than before. All the guys are having a blast, 
           except for Evan, who stares at Costco getting more and more annoyed. 

                                 BOB
                        What the fuck is your problem, Evan? Just 
                        relax, have a beer? I mean, we're here. We're 
                        staking out. This is exactly what you wanted. 
                        Stop being such a wet towel. 

                                 EVAN

                        A fucking normal, regular... dry towel. 

           Bob chugs the rest of his beer, then takes out the last one.

                                 BOB
                        Shit, one beer left. We gotta go get more.

                        that why we got together in the first place?

                        No! It isn't! We formed this Neighborhood

           Jamarcus and Franklin nod. Evan is really touched.

           The guys cruise down the street, jamming along to "AIN'T SEEN NOTHING 
           YET" on the radio. All of them have beers in hand. They sing poorly over top of 
           one another.

                        looked at me with them big brown eyes and 
                        said-

           Terrified, Evan slams on the accelerator and speeds down the street, 
           fishtailing around the corner.

           EXT. BOB'S HOME - SOON AFTER

           Evan's car comes to an abrupt stop in Bob's driveway. Evan grips the wheel, 
           freaking out.

                        A pile of leaves?

           Evan starts hyperventilating. Bob puts a hand on Evan's shoulder, trying to calm 
           him.

                                 BOB
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa, Evan, relax. I'm sure it 
                        was just a possum or...or a prairie dog.

           Franklin and Jamarcus exit the car to take a look at the front bumper. Jamarcus' 
           eyes bug out.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        What? What is it? 

           Franklin looks at it and seems confused. Evan and Bob get out of the car and 
           see that the bumper is stained with a strange GREEN GOO.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Huh. Looks like you just hit some kind of 
                        freakishly big fly or something.

           Franklin inspects the goo.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Fuck, must have been a Jeff Goldblum-sized 
                        fly.

           Franklin picks something out of the grill and holds it up - it looks like the last 
           four inches of an octopuses tentacle.

                        Hmm. Alright, then I think it's pretty obvious 
                        what happened here: Evan accidentally hit a 
                        crate that fell off the back of a truck that was 
                        taking freshly caught octopus to a sushi 
                        restaurant. 
                             (beat)
                        I mean, am I crazy or does that actually seem 
                        to make a lot of sense?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        That works for me.

                                 EVAN
                        I don't think I hit a crate. It felt... alive. 

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Didn't feel alive to me. The second we hit it, I 
                        was like, fuck we hit a crate of Octopus.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        You know what? Even if Evan hit a Japanese 
                        dude eating octopus, it doesn't matter, 
                        because nobody's gonna say shit about this 
                        to anybody. We don't drop the dime on our 
                        fellow Neighborhood Watchmen, right?

           Something strikes Evan. He looks at some green goo on the tentacle, then 
           looks at the goo on the car's grill.

                                 EVAN
                        Wait... I've seen this before.
           EXT. STREET - SOON AFTER

           Evan, Bob, Franklin, and Jamarcus scour the hit-and-run site for clues. Across 
           a ravine, we see Costco in the distance.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Guys! This is stupid. Why are we back at the 
                        scene of the crime? This is exactly what I was 
                        talking about! This is dumb. 

                                 EVAN
                        Shut up, Franklin. 

           Finally, Evan spots a GREEN PUDDLE OF GOO by the side of the road.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Back at Costco, I saw this stuff beside Antonio 
                        De Luca's body. I thought it was liquid 
                        detergent or Draino at first, but now...

           Evan looks to Bob, unsure. Bob dips his sneaker in it.

                                 BOB
                        What the hell is this stuff?

           Bob bends over and dips his finger in the goo. He then slowly rubs it between 
           his thumb and middle finger, carefully inspecting it. He turns to Evan.

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        It kind of feels like cum.

                                 EVAN
                        Ew, man.

                                 BOB
                        Come on! I dare you to touch this and tell me 
                        it doesn't feel like cum.

                                 EVAN
                        Maybe we should put some in one of 
                        Franklin's bags. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Why would we want a bag of green cum? 

           Evan shakes his head at him, and continues looking for the source.

                                 FRANKLIN (O.S.)
                        Guys, will you stop talking about cum and 
                        come look at this.

           The guys turn around to see Franklin kneeling over something in a bush. They 
           run over to find a STRANGE DEVICE somewhat resembling a metallic bowling 
           ball with many holes in it.

                                 BOB
                        What is it?

           The guys stand there mesmerized for a moment.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Yo, I wouldn't touch that if I were you.

           Evan leans over and touches along the side of the device, closely examining it. 
           Jamarcus throws his arms up in protest.

           Evan takes a deep breath and slowly sticks his index finger in one of the holes. 
           Once his finger is all the way in, LIGHT on the base of the device 
           ILLUMINATES.

                                 EVAN / BOB / FRANKLIN
                        Whoa!!!!

           Everyone recoils and pulls his finger out. The light flickers off. Evan excitedly 
           turns to the guys.

                                 EVAN
                        We're taking this fuckin' thing.

                                 MANFRED
                        Who's there?! Outta my bushes!

           Evan, Bob and Franklin stand side-by-side in order to cover the device from 
           view. Out of the shadows walks a middle aged guy, MANFRED.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        No need to be alarmed, sir. We're the 
                        Neighborhood Watch.

                                 BOB
                        We're just on our nightly patrol.

           Manfred looks Jamarcus up and down, displeased.

                                 MANFRED
                        Well, patrol elsewhere. Get the fuck off my 
                        lawn.

                                 EVAN
                        Don't mean to trouble you, but have you 
                        noticed anything strange?

                                 MANFRED
                        Yeah, there's four fucking weirdos standing 
                        on my lawn in the middle of the fucking night.

           Evan is very put off. Bob, on the other hand, is intrigued.

                                 BOB
                        Sir, we're taking time out of our busy 
                        schedules to help the neighborhood, so a 
                        little cooperation would be appreciated.

                                 MANFRED
                        What do you want me to tell you? I live next to 
                        a ravine. Every night, I got punk kids from the 
                        neighborhood hopping my fence, tearing up 
                        my lawn, trying to steal my things. You telling 
                        me you're gonna do something about it? No? 
                        Well then, get the fuck off my property.

                                 EVAN
                        Alright then. Well, if you see anything out of the 
                        ordinary, please give us a call.

           Evan hands Manfred a BUSINESS CARD with "NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH" 
           written on it. Manfred takes the card.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 MANFRED
                        Yeah, yeah.

           Manfred turns around and walks back to his doorway. Evan quickly picks up the 
           device and puts it behind his back. Manfred turns around and stands in the 
           doorway.

                                 EVAN
                        Sorry for the bother! Have a good night.

           They snicker as they walk away with the device.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        You made cards?

           Evan notices some green goo on the device and wipes it off. He puts the device 
           in the car as they all pile in.

           INT. EVAN'S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Abby sits on the couch alone, watching Sex and the City on TV. She looks like 
           she's enjoying the show, but she's bored. She picks up the phone. 

           INT. EVAN'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Abby is now talking on the phone. She's half-way through a bottle of wine.

                                 ABBY
                             (on phone)
                        Hey, Carla. How you doing? No, I'm not 
                        jetlagged at all, are you? Good, good. You 
                        know what I am though, is bored. I mean, do 
                        you want to go out and get a drink?  I know we 
                        don't usually do that here, but why not? Ok. I'll 
                        pick you up.  

           INT. CHILI'S - CONTINUOUS

           Abby, Carla and Stephanie sit in a booth. The rest of the tables are occupied by 
           families and elderly people.

           The YOUNG PIMPLE-FACED SERVER comes to the table with THREE PINTS 
           filled with red liquid. The ladies look at the drinks disappointed.

                        What? Don't you have any martini glasses? Or 
                        something more festive?

                                 SERVER
                        Uh, hold on. I'll ask.

           The Server walks away.

                        Might as well make the most of it.

           Abby raises her pint; Carla and Stephanie follow suit.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        To sex and the suburbs.

           They laugh and drink.

                        So...about sex...anyone actually getting any?

                        Well, I wish I had something good to share. 
                        The best sex I've had lately has been with 
                        myself. I think I'm starting to build a bigger toy 
                        collection than my six year old.

           They laugh. Abby nudges Stephanie, motioning to Carla.

                                 ABBY
                        Yeah, she's got a Furby, but her's does 
                        something completely different.

                        I usually just use my fingers.

           Abby and Carla stop laughing. It gets awkward. Stephanie immediately feels 
           self conscious.

                                 CARLA
                        How about you Abby? You and Evan going to

                        roll on top of each other.

                        some kind animal that only has sex for 
                        procreation. I like it. Or at least I used to... 
                        when we used to do it.

           EXT. FARM - LATER

           The STRANGE DEVICE is leaned up against a fence. We pull back to reveal 
           Evan, Bob, Jamarcus and Franklin staring at it curiously in an open field. Cows 
           graze in the background.

           Sporadically, Evan, Bob and Franklin stick their fingers in the device so it 
           LIGHTS UP.

                                 EVAN
                        Huh. Maybe all the holes need to be filled at 
                        the same time for it to work.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah guys, we're all going to have to finger 
                        these holes together.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, yeah, you're probably right.

                        I think we should fucking stop. What if it blows 
                        our goddamn fingers off?

           Everyone's a little apprehensive. Franklin steps forward.

                        I can finger that one for you.

           Evan adds his fingers.

           Bob adds his fingers. Then he notices one last hole.

                                 BOB
                        There's one left. Come on Jamarcus.

           Jamarcus stares at it and doesn't move.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Fuck that. I already told you guys I'm not 
                        touching that shit.

                                 BOB
                        Come on man. Are you serious?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Yeah, I'm fuckin' serious. I ain't playin' witchu.

                                 EVAN
                        Well what are we gonna do about this 
                        maverick hole?

           Bob, Evan and Franklin all look at each other, their faces just inches apart. Bob 
           smiles at them, slyly.

                                 BOB
                             (dramatically)
                        Wait. I have an idea how to plug the hole.

                        What?

           We hear the sound of Bob's pants unzipping.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Aww, man, no! Come on!

                             (laughing)
                        What do you want me to do? Jamarcus isn't 
                        being a team player.
                             (to Jamarcus)
                        You see what you're making me do?

                                 EVAN
                        Jamarcus, what's the deal man? Please!

                             (dead serious)
                        No. I'm not doing it. This is some fuckin' 
                        voodoo shit. And I ain't about to trifle with it. 
                        Okay?

           This comment hangs in the air for a moment.

                                 BOB
                        Okay.

           Bob sticks his penis in the last hole and the device SURGES WITH POWER. 
           The guys lose their footing as they struggle to hold on to it and get turned 
           around when suddenly --  SHOOOOM!!!!

           A HUGE BEAM OF CONCENTRATED ENERGY shoots out of the device and 
           HITS a NEARBY COW! The cow lights up and EXPLODES!!!

                                 EVAN
                        Holy shit! My balls are tingling. Are your guys' 
                        balls tingling?

                             (sarcastic)
                        Okay, Jamarcus. We'll just stop using the 
                        coolest thing any of us have ever seen.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        No. Jamarcus is right. We should stop 
                        blowing things up.

           After a moment, Bob, Evan and Franklin all laugh.

           - SHOOM!!! They blow up a chicken.

           - SHOOM!!! They blow up a frog.

           The all look at Jamarcus.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Fine.

           - Now with Jamarcus holding the gun too... SHOOM! They blow up a pigeon.

           - CRACK! The guys SHOTGUN beers.

           - SHOOM!!! From a distance, they shoot at an old broke down tractor. After a few 
           shots, they nail it and the tractor EXPLODES.

           - CRACK! The guys SHOTGUN beers.

           - SHOOM! They shoot the gun into a pond. BOOM! Tons of water and fish rain 
           down from the sky as they dance around, celebrating.

           - CRACK! The guys SHOTGUN beers.

           - SHOOM!!! They blow the ROOF off an ABANDONED BARN. They high-five.

           - CRACK! They knock open another beer and are clearly having a great time 
           together.

           - The guys SPEED down a back road. Evan drives, feeling like an absolute 
           badass. SHOOM!!! Bob, Franklin and Jamarcus are all in the backseat, blasting 
           trees out the car window.  SHOOM!!!! SHOOM!!! SHOOM!!! They're having the 
           time of their lives, laughing. Jamarcus laughs exactly like Eddie Murphy.

           INT. DINER - LATER

           The guys sit at a table. Bob steals a quick glance at the gun hidden in Evan's 
           backpack. A WAITRESS walks by and Evan quickly covers up the bag.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        I'm telling ya, it's the motherfucking
                        government. It's always the motherfucking
                        government.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, but whose government? 9 times out of 
                        10 the Taliban's involved. The Afghanese, the 
                        Iraqis. They're the ones who are behind this. 
                        This could be a weapon of mass destruction. 
                        So yeah, I say terrorists.

           Something occurs to Franklin.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Oh fuck! Maybe this shit's from the future!! 
                        Hear me out! Some dude from the future got 
                        here, got out of his time machine to take a 
                        piss, Evan killed his ass with his car, turned 
                        him into green goo, because that's what 
                        human blood's going to turn into on account 
                        of the environment!

                                 JAMARCUS
                        I don't know, Franklin. Bob's been right a lot of 
                        the time. So my vote is definitely terrorists.

                                 EVAN
                        Time travel? Terrorists? You guys are idiots. 

           They sit in silence for a minute.

                        No, it's true. I totally agree. I think since we 
                        found it, this falls under the Neighborhood 
                        Watch's jurisdiction.

                        Fuck that! You didn't even want to shoot it. I 
                        had to have intercourse with that thing 
                        because of you. I should get to keep it. 

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Why you?

                        My place is Neighborhood Watch 
                        headquarters.

                        Yeah, after you usurped my house of being 
                        HQ. I'm taking it. Okay? I'm the president of 
                        the Neighborhood Watch, I get to keep it. 

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Who made you the president? 

                                 EVAN
                        I did! Because I'm the FOUNDER of the 
                        Neighborhood Watch, and the founder gets to 
                        choose the president. I'm keeping it!
           I/E. EVAN'S HOME - GARAGE - LATE NIGHT

           Evan stealthily covers the device with his jacket and removes it from his trunk. 
           He makes his way to the garage.

           Across the street, Evan notices PAUL's car arriving home late. Paul exits his 
           car, and they lock eyes. Paul waves at Evan. His hands tied up, Evan nods 
           hello and scurries into the garage.

           Evan hides the device in a DUSTY CABINET, and locks it.

           INT. BOB'S HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Bob is sitting in his massage chair with a laptop open and a beer in hand. He's 
           clearly still drunk. He goes to FACEBOOK and types in his daughter Chelsea's 
           username and password. He enters her Facebook page. Bob scours over 
           Chelsea's facebook page. He sees a picture of her and two other girls. One of 
           the girls has a tattoo.

                                 BOB

           Bob takes a big swig of his beer. Bob's demeanor suddenly shifts as he sees 
           a video link titled: "CHELSEA & JASON CLOSET MAKE-OUT SESH LOL OMG".

           The video is set at a high school party. A group of teens stand in front of the 
           closet, cheering and chanting the word "French!" In the video, the closet doors 
           swing open; Jason and Chelsea are making out hard.

                             (she sniffs him)
                        Are you? 

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, but... I'm definitely less drunk than you... 
                        now. I drank some water and ate a large 
                        pizza. 

                                 ABBY
                        I talked to the girls and they all agree that it's 
                        not a big deal and that we can just talk about it 
                        just like people on TV. 

                                 EVAN
                        Talk about what? 

                                 ABBY
                        That you're infertile. Samanatha said her 
                        uncle was having problems and he went to 
                        this doctor and-

                                 EVAN
                        What!?! You fucking told your friends? 

                                 ABBY
                        Yeah, but it's fine. If we don't talk about it, 
                        how're we going to-

                                 EVAN
                        I'm sorry if I don't want to talk about the fact 
                        that my dick doesn't work. Fuck. 

           Evan storms out of the house. He pulls out his cell and calls someone. 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Hey, you up to anything? I gotta get out of the 
                        house. 
           EXT. PARK - NIGHT - SOON AFTER

           At a park directly across from Evan's house, Evan sits on a bench with Bob 
           passing a bottle of whiskey back and forth. 

                                 BOB
                        Fuckin' kids, man. I'm telling you. They're the 
                        fucking worst. Such a god damn pain. And the 
                        worst part is, you can't hit them anymore. I 
                        mean, even swearing at the little fucker is 
                        frowned upon. What am I supposed to do 
                        here, you know? Not to mention the stress it 
                        puts on my marriage, which is hard enough 
                        already.  Man, I don't know how you convinced 
                        your wife not to have kids, but here's to that. 

           Bob takes a swig of whiskey.

                                 EVAN
                        Well... truth is... I didn't really convince her not 
                        to have kids, it was, kind of... you know, 
                        another reason-

                                 BOB
                        Is she your beard?

                                 EVAN
                        My beard? 

                                 BOB
                        You know, your pretend wife that you use to 
                        cover up that you're a homo. 
                             (beat)
                        And I don't mean homo in a derogatory way. I 
                        literally mean it as an abbreviation for 
                        homosexual.

                                 EVAN
                        Hah. No, that's not it... it's that, I, uh... my 
                        gun...doesn't work, per say.

                        Your gun? Oh! Your cock. Why didn't you just 
                        say cock? It's just us boys here. So... you're 
                        impotent. No biggie. I had limp noodle 
                        syndrome for a good two months once. Just 
                        pop a few viagra. It'll stiffen that wang right up. 
                        You'll be fuckin' like a champ in no time. 

                                 EVAN
                        No, no. It's not that. I can... you know... do 
                        everything, it's just... that my sperm don't work. 

                                 BOB
                        I don't get it. Like, you can get hard, but you 
                        can't jizz? 

                                 EVAN
                        No, Bob. I can jizz, it's just that my jizz doesn't 
                        do what it's supposed to. 

           Bob gives him a blank stare. 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        I'm infertile. I shoot blanks. Because of me... 
                        we can't have kids.

           Bob thinks about this. 

                                 BOB
                        Can't you get a, like, balls transplant or 
                        something?  

                                 EVAN
                        I don't think science is there yet. 

                                 BOB
                        Sheesh. Well, I wish it was. 'Cause then I 
                        could give you my balls. Lord knows I don't 
                        need 'em anymore. 

           Evan is truly touched.

                        Thanks, Bob. 

                                 BOB
                        Seriously though, if you do ever need 
                        someone's jizz... mine's particularly potent. 
                        Offer's always on the table, buddy. 

           Bob pats Evan on the back. Suddenly, they hear a noise- CRASH!!! They look 
           towards where the sound came from - EVAN'S HOUSE!!!

           INT. EVAN'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - SECONDS LATER

           Evan and Bob cautiously approach the garage. Evan nudges Bob and points 
           out that one of the garage windows has been broken. They tiptoe towards the 
           house...

                                 ABBY (O.S.)
                        EVAN?!?

                            BOB
                                                          EVAN
           AHHH!!!
                                              AHHH!!!

           Both Bob and Evan jump, terrified. They look up to see Abby leaning out her 
           bedroom window, groggy and confused. 

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        What... what's happening? 

                                 EVAN
                        Nothing! Everything's fine! Go back to bed!

                                 ABBY
                        I heard something. 

                                 EVAN
                        It was nothing! Just a raccoon. 

                                 ABBY

                        Hi! 

                                 EVAN
                        That's Bob! 

                                 BOB
                        Vice-President of the Neighborhood Watch! 
                        Pleasure to meet you Mrs. Trautwig!

           Annoyed, Abby slams the window shut.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Dude, your wife has BIG tits. Good for you. 

                                 EVAN
                        Come on!

           Evan and Bob continue towards the garage. Evan stops by the barbeque and 
           picks up a MINI FIRE EXTINGUISHER and hands Bob a small BBQ 
           PITCHFORK. Armed, they open the garage door. 

           INT. EVAN'S HOME - GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan and Bob BURST into the garage. There is a SHADOWY FIGURE in the 
           far corner of the garage. 

                                 BOB
                        There's a fuckin' dude in the corner! Get him!

           Bob HURLS the BBQ pitchfork at the Shadowy Figure. He completely misses, 
           and the BBQ pitchfork rebounds off a shelf and flies back at him and stabs into 
           his leg. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        AHH!!!

           Bob passes out. Evan sees the Shadowy Figure start moving and SPRAYS the 
           fire extinguisher towards the corner. The Shadowy Figure LEAPS over the 
           stream. Evan wildly sprays all over the garage.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Evan can barely see through the WHITE MIST as the Shadowy Figure bounds 
           from wall-to-wall inside the garage, knocking over tools, boxes, etc, causing a 
           huge mess.

           PFFT! The fire extinguisher sputters out. Evan stands there as the white mist 
           slowly dissipates.

           Evan sees movement and HURLS the fire extinguisher at it. The Shadowy 
           Figure LEAPS over it, SKITTERS across the wall and SPRINGS right over 
           Evan's head, crashing through the window.

                                 EVAN
                        Jesus Christ!

           EXT. EVAN'S HOME - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Evan runs outside just in time to catch a glimpse of the Shadowy Figure 
           bounding from roof-to-roof down the block and out of sight.

                                 EVAN
                        What the fuck was that?

           INT. EVAN'S HOME - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Evan returns to the garage. It's destroyed. He scans the room and notices the 
           WIDE-OPEN CABINET -- the doors have been ripped off the hinges and the 
           inside is empty.

                                 EVAN
                        Oh fuck me. The gun.

                        Uhhh...

           Abby sees that Bob is unconscious on the ground and a fork is imbedded in 
           his leg.

           INT. EVAN'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Evan and Abby sit on the couch talking to Sgt Bressman. Evan looks annoyed. 
           In the corner, we see Bob, who is in his underpants, cleaning and dressing his 
           own small leg wound with a first aid kit. 

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        So you heard the window break and then went 
                        to the garage to check it out and that's when 
                        Bob stabbed himself and passed out.

                                 BOB
                        Yep! 

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        And then...

                                 EVAN
                        And then I saw that it was a raccoon, and it 
                        ran away.

                                 ABBY
                        It wasn't a raccoon! I heard you fighting or 
                        struggling with someone.

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah. The raccoon. I mean... it was a 
                        particularly large and crazy raccoon. It had 
                        crazy eyes and was using its weird raccoon 
                        hands to jump around and shit.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        You didn't get bit, did ya? Those little fuckers
                        spread all sorts of diseases.

                             (to Evan)
                        So a raccoon broke the window to get into the 
                        garage?

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, must have just jumped right through it. 
                        I'm telling you, this was not a normal raccoon. 
                        I'm the first the first to admit that this was an 
                        astounding raccoon. 

           Abby looks at Evan skeptically. She knows he's lying. Bressman totally buys the 
           story. 

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        I feel like maybe I've heard of these raccoons. 

                                 EVAN
                        I think there was a Dateline about them. 

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Well, I think we have enough information here. 
                        You guys are okay and that's the important 
                        thing.  

           Bressman gets up to leave.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN (CONT’D)
                        You've had a pretty busy week. First a murder 
                        in your store, then your house is broken into? 
                        You seem to be at the center of all the action. 

           Evan leads Bressman out the door. 

                                 EVAN
                        Any progress on the Costco case? 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                             (shaking his head)
                        Ach, the Costco case. Well, you know...no. But 
                        I looked into it and turns out that most 
                        homicides go unsolved anyway, so, 
                        expectations are pretty low.

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, I'd say they couldn't be much lower.

           Evan shuts the door, then turns to find Abby staring at him.

                                 ABBY
                        What the fuck was that? 

                                 EVAN
                        What the fuck was what? 

                                 ABBY
                        You were clearly lying? 

           Bob stands up and starts putting his pants on. 

                                 BOB
                        He's not lying! 

                                 ABBY
                        Shut up, Bob! I don't know you!

                                 BOB
                        You're right. You don't. Have a good night. 

           Bob exits. Abby looks back to Evan, who's having a hard time hiding the truth. 

                                 EVAN
                        I'm not lying. 

                                 ABBY
                        Well, I don't fucking believe you. 

           Abby walks upstairs, going back to bed. Evan is left alone. 
           INT. BOB'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

           Evan paces around Bob's garage, with Bob, Franklin and Jamarcus looking on.

                                 EVAN
                        It's fucking gone, you guys. Some...THING
                        broke into my garage, and took the fucking
                        gun.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Wait, what do you mean some THING broke 
                        in?

                                 EVAN
                        I mean it was some fucking THING! Like, not 
                        human! It was parkouring all over the place. 
                        Wall to wall. I saw it scale a fucking house in 
                        like 2 seconds!

                                 BOB
                        I was unconsious, but I believe him. 

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Shit! That thing has all our finger prints in it.

                                 BOB
                        And my dick print.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Dick prints don't traditionally hold up in court. 

                                 EVAN
                        Seriously. I'm telling you guys, I think... it was 
                        an alien! Think about all the clues! Green goo, 
                        tentacles, futuristic guns and shit!

                                 JAMARCUS
                        A fucking alien? You guys are such nerds. 
                        Grown men shouldn't even be talking about 
                        aliens. And did you think for a second that 
                        maybe it's good that the gun is gone?

                        We should just walk away, happy that we 
                        didn't fucking blow ourselves up.

           This comment hangs in the air for a moment.

                                 EVAN
                        Are you crazy?! We can't just walk away from 
                        this now. If you ask me, the gun was stolen 
                        because we're onto something. Like, 
                        something big. Clearly, whoever's involved 
                        knows they can get to us. If they wanted me 
                        dead then they would've killed me. I'm a really 
                        easy mark. Which means they obviously just 
                        take us to be a bunch of pussies who are just 
                        gonna step down. But we can't do that. We 
                        gotta step it up! Are you guys ready to step it 
                        up?!

           Evan stands up, trying to motivate them.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah!

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Yeah, I suppose I could step it up.

                                 EVAN
                        How about you Jamarcus? You ready to step 
                        it up?! Think about all the pussies you'll be 
                        banging if you solve this amazing mystery. 

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Ok. Fine. I'll step up. 

                                 EVAN
                        Good. Time to split up. Time to cover some 
                        more ground. Two teams of two; both 
                        patrolling the neighborhood, keeping our eyes 
                        peeled for anything out of the ordinary, and 
                        really just hitting the streets hard.  
                             (beat)

           Evan puts his hand in. Bob does the same, as do the others.

           INT. BOB'S CAR - THAT NIGHT

           Bob and Franklin are parked. Bob takes a swig from his flask and then hands it 
           over to Franklin who takes a big swig.

                                 BOB
                        Franklin, I feel like I don't have the best read 
                        on you yet. Probably because of the age gap. 
                        For example, are you a virgin?

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Ahh, you want to get personal and shit. What 
                        the fuck do you think? I'm twenty-three years 
                        old.

                                 BOB
                        So? People don't necessarily lose it that 
                        young all the time.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Bob, I lost my virginity when I was thirteen. I've 
                        got, like, a decade's worth of fucking under my 
                        belt already.

                                 BOB
                        That's cool.
                             (beat)
                        My daughter's fifteen. You don't think she 
                        could be having sex already...

                                 BOB
                        What kind of question is that?

                                 FRANKLIN
                        A legitimate one if you want an honest answer 
                        to your question.

                                 BOB
                        Of course she's hot! She's stunning. She's my 
                        daughter.

           Franklin eyes Bob, skeptical.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Do you have a picture of her?

           Bob scrolls through his phone and shows Franklin a picture of Chelsea.

                                 FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
                        Uh, yeah, she's having sex.

           Bob snatches his phone away.

                                 BOB
                        What?! Why do you say that?

                                 FRANKLIN
                        I'm just trying to level with you, Bob. She's 
                        fuckable, so odds are, she's been fucking. I 
                        obviously can't say definitively that she has 
                        but, she has. Definitely.

                                 BOB
                        No. I don't believe this.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Well, I don't want to upset you, but as your 
                        friend you'd be delusional to think she hasn't 
                        had a dick yet.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Wait, can I see that picture again?

                        It is what it is, man.

           Bob thinks for a second.

                                 BOB
                        I need you to help me find out for sure.

           Bob starts the car and speeds off.

           INT. EVAN'S CAR - SOON AFTER

           Evan drinks a pink smoothie as he and Jamarcus patrol the neighborhood.

                                 EVAN
                        Here. So you can see better. 

           Evan hands Jamarcus a flashlight. Jamarcus turns it on and shines it out the 
           window, looking for anything suspicious. 

                                 JAMARCUS
                        So... you really think it's fuckin' aliens?

                                 EVAN
                        Well... I mean... Yeah. Yes. I actually do.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Like, straight up "take me to your leader" 
                        aliens?

                        aliens. 

                                 JAMARCUS
                        But, like, what's your plan if you do find one? 

                                 EVAN
                        Well, I guess if I found one, I'd try and catch it. I 
                        mean, Antonio de Luca was torn to shreds. 
                        Maybe there are friendly aliens in the 
                        universe, but I don't think these are them. 
                             (beat, smiles)
                        And think about it: if we caught one, we'd go 
                        down in history. First contact.

           Then, Evan's cell phone rings. He answers it.

                        Oh shit. Hang tight. We're on our way.
                             (to Jamarcus)
                        Call Bob for backup. We got a situation. 
           EXT. HUMBOLDT HIGH SCHOOL - SOON AFTER

           Bob and Franklin pull up to the HUMBOLDT HIGH SCHOOL parking lot and exit 
           the car. They walk around the school to the FOOTBALL FIELD.

           In the middle of the field, the CHEERLEADING SQUAD is practicing an 
           oversexed routine, wearing tight skimpy outfits. A GROUP OF BOYS sit on a set 
           of BLEACHERS watching, most notably, Jason.

                                 JASON (O.S.)
                        OH YEAH!!

           Bob and Franklin hide under bleachers on the opposite end.

                                 BOB
                        What is Chelsea doing? Oh big surprise, 
                        Mandy is the choreographer.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Yeah, Bob, I think ALL these girls have had 
                        sex before.
                             (to himself)
                        This is erotic as hell.

           The routine ends on a very sexy pose. Jason and his friends leave the 
           bleachers and join the cheerleaders on the field.

                                 FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
                        And those are probably the guys they're doing 
                        it with.

                                 BOB
                        Oh, that's Jason. He's the new guy. I hate this 
                        little fucker.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Yeah. That guy's fucked. These girl's have 
                        fucked. All these kids are fucking.

           Bob's phone rings.

                        Meet us other there. 

                                 BOB
                        Shit! I'm at the high school. That's all the way 
                        across town. 

                                 EVAN
                        What the fuck are you doing there? 

                                 BOB 
                        Uh...nothing. Never mind. We're on our way. 

           Bob's glares at his daughter, then begrudgingly pulls out of the parking lot. 

           EXT. MANFRED'S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Evan and Jamarcus pull up to the house. They ring the doorbell. No answer. 
           Jamarcus peers through the window.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Alright. He's not here. Let's get the fuck out of 
                        here. He is not a sexy lady. This is not what I 
                        pictured. 

                                 EVAN
                        I'll try calling him.

           Evan takes out his cell and phones Manfred. Nobody picks up.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)

                                 JAMARCUS
                        I don't hear shit all, let's go, man.

                        Shh! Shh! Listen carefully.

           Evan redials. They hear a singing cell phone.

                                 MANFRED'S CELL
                        "Do you like pina coladas, and gettin' caught

                                 EVAN
                        That way!

           Evan starts walking towards the backyard.

           EXT. MANFRED'S HOME - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           They creep into the backyard.

                                 EVAN
                        I'm gonna call it again.

           Evan presses send again and Manfred's phone rings.

                             (whispering)
                        It's coming from the backyard.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Seriously, let's go back. Please.

           Jamarcus and Evan reach the backyard where they find Manfred's body 
           completely TORN APART. The cell phone is on the ground, inches away.

           Evan freezes in horror, then lurches over and VOMITS pink VOMIT all over.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        What the fuuuuuuuuuck....

           They then hear a sound coming from the dark corner of the yard. Evan spins 
           around and shines a flashlight, illuminating a SATELLITE DISH. There's a 
           cable attached that Evan follows with his flashlight until he reaches an ALIEN 
           hunched over, chewing the cable.

           The Alien freezes, staring at Evan and Jamarcus.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                             (whispering)
                        Oh my fucking god. Are you seeing this? It's 
                        an alien. I fucking told you it was aliens.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        It fucking is. Damn.

                             (terrified)
                        What do we do? It's just leering at us. You 
                        think we can take it?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        What? Can I take it? This isn't some drunk 
                        motherfucker at a nightclub. This is a fucking
                        alien. Who knows what that thing is capable 
                        of. We should run the hell away!

                                 EVAN
                        No. Uh... I'm gonna make a move. You cover 
                        me and bash its brains in when I give the 
                        signal.

           Evan hands Jamarcus a RAKE.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        What?! No-

           As soon as Evan makes a slight step forward, the Alien's eyes widen and it 
           runs towards the SIX-FOOT FENCE, but struggles to get over it.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        It's running! It's a pussy! Let's fucking get it! 

           Psyched up, Evan gives chase through the back gate into the alley.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        Hey! You! Stop!

           EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           The Alien runs down the alley, with Evan in close pursuit. Evan backs it into a 
           dead end, and the Alien comes to a stop.

                                 EVAN
                        Oh shit.

           The Alien turns around to face Evan, SNARLING at him.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        Oh SHIT!!!

           The Alien lunges at Evan, and chases him through the alley!

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit! JAMARCUS!!!

           Evan throws GARBAGE CANS in the Alien's path, but he still gains on him. 
           Manfred's backyard is just up ahead.

           Evan HOPS THE FENCE, falling over the other side.

           EXT. MANFRED'S HOME - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Evan falls on his face. He looks up to see Jamarcus frozen in the exact same 
           position.

                                 EVAN
                        Jamarcus! What the fuck, man! Do 
                        something!

           Evan hears the Alien approaching, and frantically looks around for an object. 
           He finds a small GARDEN GNOME.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           As soon as the Alien runs through the gate, Evan -- from his knees -- heaves 
           the gnome at its face. It smacks the Alien in the side of the head, causing it to 
           fall to the ground.

           SNAP!!! The Alien's neck collides awkwardly into the side of Manfred's Satellite 
           dish -- much like the stool in Million Dollar Baby. It lays on the ground 
           motionless.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        Oh fuck. I killed it.

           Evan catches his breath, relieved. Jamarcus watches, utterly amazed. Evan 
           takes out his phone and dials. 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)

           INT. BOB'S HOME - GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob and Franklin rush in and find Evan and Jamarcus tying something 
           wrapped in a tarp to the massage chair.

                                 BOB
                        What the hell is this? Who's under that tarp?

                             (dramatically)
                        It is not a who, but a what, that is under this 
                        tarp. And before I unveil this to you, I want you 
                        to know that two age-old questions will be 
                        answered tonight. One, are we alone in this 
                        universe? And two, is Evan Trautwig always 
                        fucking right? Gentlemen, BEHOLD!

           In a grand gesture, Evan rips off the tarp to reveal the ALIEN'S limp body.

                                 BOB

                        themselves with the aaaaaaaalien!?!?

           MUSIC UP: some awesome music by N.W.A or something

           - The guys excitedly pose for numerous photos with the Alien

           - Evan puts a sombrero on the Alien and a beer in its hand

           - They hold its limp body across all four of their arms

           - Bob puts a foam #1 hand on the alien and holds its arm up. Franklin high 
           fives it.

           - Evan pretends to fuck the Alien doggie-style.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           - Bob puts his dick on the Alien's shoulder. Franklin puts his on its other 
           shoulder.

           - Evan's phone vibrates on the bar. It's Abby. Evan is too distracted to notice.

           INT. EVAN'S HOME - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           As the call goes to voicemail, Abby hangs up the phone, frustrated. She picks 
           up her laptop.

           ON SCREEN is a very sparse online BLOG open which reads: "SEX & THE 
           SUBURBS...avec Abby". Abby begins typing:

                                 ABBY (V.O.)
                        Ever since I was a little girl, I always dreamed 
                        about my wedding day. And while I dreamed 
                        about every little detail of that one day, I never 
                        once considered what would happen the day 
                        after, or the one after that. Days become 
                        years, with ups and downs. You fight. You 
                        compromise. You drift apart. One minute 
                        you're in holy matrimony, and the next, you're 
                        not much of a match at all.

           Abby down the rest of the bottle of wine.

                                 ABBY (V.O.)
                        As I sat in my office, having finished a full 
                        bottle of Merlot, I thought to myself, "is it 
                        possible for two people to live together under 
                        one roof, and keep totally separate lives?

           INT. BOB'S HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Jamarcus and Evan pose for another picture with the Alien, its arms loosely 
           hung around their shoulders.

                                 EVAN
                             (to Jamarcus)
                        Oh man, this one's gonna look hilarious.

                        SSSSSSSSSHHHRREEEEEEEE!!!

           Suddenly, The Alien frantically pushes Jamarcus and Evan off of it and sprays 
           green goo out of its mouth. The goo lands on everyone. All of them, except 
           Jamarcus, squirm and scream.

                                 EVAN
                        Oh god it's eating through my flesh!

                                 FRANKLIN
                        My face is burning off!!! My fucking face! Some 
                        got in my mouth! NOOOOO!!!

                                 BOB
                        It puked on my fucking mantle!

                                 EVAN
                        Wait...it's...it's not burning me. I, I think I'm 
                        okay.

           The Alien rises to his feet and backs up against the wall like a cornered 
           animal. It spits green goo in Evan's face again, temporarily blinding him.

                                 ALIEN
                        Shreeeeee!!!

           BAM!!! The Alien slams into Evan, sending him crashing against the wall-
           mounted television. The TV falls over.

                                 BOB
                             (staring in horror)
                        Sweet fucking god the TV!

           The Alien frantically runs around the room, searching for an exit, clawing at the 
           walls, ripping down Bob's sports paraphernalia and knocking over everything in 
           his path.

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        Fucking stop it! Calm the fuck down alien!

           CONTINUED: (2)

           The Alien hisses at the guys. Bob grabs a pool cue and starts swinging it wildly 
           at the Alien who easily evades him. The Alien grabs a GLASS FOOTBALL 
           TROPHY.

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        No. Don't. Please.

           The Alien taunts Bob and drops the trophy, shattering it.

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        YOU SON OF A BITCH!
                             (to guys)
                        Come on you guys! Fucking help!

           Franklin looks around and grabs a pool ball. He throws it, and it whizzes past 
           the Alien through the dry-wall.

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        Franklin! What the fuck!

                                 FRANKLIN
                        I don't know what to do!

           Franklin throws another pool ball. Again, it crashes through Bob's wall.

                                 BOB
                        Just stop it! Stop throwing, Franklin!

           Evan and Franklin both pick up pool cues and join Bob. The three of them 
           cautiously advance on the Alien, backing him into a corner.

                                 EVAN
                             (calmly)
                        Shhh-it's okay-shhh...

           Evan looks back and sees Jamarcus frozen in place.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                             (to Jamarcus)
                        Come on, man. Grab a cue.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        I...I can't...

           The Alien suddenly charges into Evan! The sheer power sends Evan flying 
           backward into the SINK FAUCET. Water sprays Bob in the face and all over the 
           garage.

                                 BOB
                        AHHHH!!!! Fuck!

           Bob charges at the Alien and breaks his pool cue over its back. The Alien 
           doubles over.

                                 ALIEN
                        SHHHREEEEEE!!!!

                                 BOB
                        WHAT NOW MOTHERFUCKER!!!

           Suddenly, the Alien uppercuts Bob in the testicles. The Alien kicks Bob clean 
           across the room, sending him crashing into his juke box.

           The Alien then leaps onto Evan, pinning him. Its mouth opens wide and the 
           creature bites down on Evan's shoulder.

                                 EVAN
                        AAAARRRGHHH!!!

                                 FRANKLIN
                             (clutching his nuts)
                        No! Now you'll turn into one of them!

           The Alien pulls back, revealing a nasty bite. It prepares to bite Evan again, 
           when Franklin leaps onto its back.

                                 FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
                        Gotcha!

           The Alien spins wildly to buck him off. Bob looks over at Evan who is slowly 
           getting up.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 BOB
                        Why did you bring this fucking thing to my 
                        house?!?

                                 EVAN
                        This is our headquarters, Bob. Where else 
                        would we bring him?

                                 BOB
                        Fucking anywhere else! Anywhere but here!

                                 EVAN
                        Well maybe if you hadn't been across town at 
                        the high school, you could have been part of 
                        the decision making process. 

           Bob leaps off his pool table and jumps on the alien. Together, they all manage 
           to pin the Alien. Franklin puts it in a sleeper hold.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Stop resisting! Stop resisting!!!

                                 EVAN
                             (to Jamarcus)
                        JAMARCUS!?! What the fuck? Get over here 
                        and help! This thing almost killed us and 
                        you've just stood there with your fist up your 
                        ass!!!

           The Alien stops struggling, clearly exhausted.

                                 FRANKLIN
                             (panting)
                        That's it, give up. Go to sleep.

                                 BOB
                        We should ask it questions. Find out what the 
                        fuck it's doing here.

                                 EVAN
                        It's not going to answer us, you idiot, it doesn't 
                        speak fucking English.

                        Let's see! 

           Franklin takes his arm off of the Alien's throat. They look at the Alien expectantly.

                                 ALIEN
                             (raspy alien voice)
                        ...we are already among you...

           The Alien looks in each of their faces and laughs, lingering on Jamarcus, who 
           suddenly snaps.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        NOOOO!!! SHUT UP!!!

           Jamarcus runs over and slams his foot down on the aliens crotch repeatedly - 
           STOMP! STOMP! STOMP!

                                 EVAN
                        Jesus Christ, Jamarcus. Ease off the nuts.

           STOMP! STOMP! Jamarcus keeps stomping until the Alien wheezes and 
           screams, and then goes limp. Green goo spills out its mouth.

           The guys are speechless. Jamarcus gawks at the Alien corpse, processing 
           what he's done. As they all stare at the dead Alien, its rib cage opens and its 
           internal organs spill all over Bob's carpet.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        Holy shit. Jamarcus, did you...kill him?

                                 BOB
                        YEAH! You killed that alien! Fucked him up 
                        good. That's what he gets for messing with 
                        MY home!

                                 JAMARCUS
                        You told me to do something. I just...I froze for 
                        a second there...and then...I just snapped.
                             (beat)
                        That's how I fight.

           Franklin pokes the dead alien's eye with a pool cue.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Pretty sure he's dead. Gone over to the other 
                        side.
                             (beat)
                        But just to be sure.

           Franklin stabs the Alien in the head several times with the pool cue. Bob gets 
           up, and looks around the room. His phallocentric utopia is completely 
           destroyed. He's devastated.

                                 BOB
                        Everyone get out.

                        Hold on, Bob. We've got to talk about this. I 
                        think we all heard it clearly say they are 
                        among us. We can't trust anyone.

                                 BOB

           Evan gets to his bed, exhausted. Abby is asleep. Evan gets in bed with her and 
           falls asleep. We see Abby look over at him and notices a bruise on his neck 
           and some scratches from the fight with the alien. She stares at him, 
           suspicious.

           suspicious of everyone he passes. Evan notices his old Running Group turns 
           up the street towards him. He quickly ducks behind a wall as to not be seen by 
           them. After they pass, he runs out.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Which makes me ask myself...

           - Bob, on his hands and knees, scrubs green goo off the walls and floor.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        ...if you can solve a mystery...

           - Franklin sits on a bench across from the modest HUMBOLDT POLICE 
           STATION. He stares suspiciously at Sergeant Bressman and an OFFICER 
           walking up the steps with Chinese food. Bressman suddenly stops and turns 
           around, sensing eyes on him. But the bench is now empty.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        ...can you also solve a secret? 

           - Evan jogs towards Ms. Kitchener, the woman who was watering her lawn 
           when we first met Evan.

                                 MS. KITCHENER
                        Afternoon Evan!

           Evan is startled, and quickly gives her a judging glance.

                                 EVAN
                             (suspicious)
                        Yeah. Afternoon, Ms. Kitchener.

                                 JAKE (O.S.)
                             (yelling)
                        Hey neighbor!!!

                                 EVAN
                             (spooked)
                        AAAHHH!!!

           Evan spins around to see Jake coming to spray him with the a  hose. Evan is 
           STARTLED, and instinctively SHOVES him hard, knocking him to the ground.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Stay the fuck back!

                                 JAKE
                        Ooww! Jesus! What the hell, dude? Why'd you 
                        do that? I spray you every morning! I thought 
                        you liked it!

                                 EVAN
                        Well, I don't!

           CONTINUED: (3)

           Evan frantically runs back into his house and shuts the door.  He takes a few 
           deep breathes and calms himself a bit, when suddenly, DING DONG!

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        AAAAAAAHHHH!!!

           Evan is startled again. He looks through the peephole and sees it's Sergeant 
           Bressman. He opens the door.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        Sergeant Bressman. What brings you here?

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Good news. We're done in Costco. You're free 
                        to resume business as usual.

                                 EVAN
                        Great. So the investigation's over?

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Just with that location. It's exploded outward 
                        from there though.

                                 EVAN
                        You don't say.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Oh yeah, I'm actually really getting into it. It's 
                        like an awesome puzzle! Last night, we found 
                        another body. Ripped apart, exactly like buddy 
                        from Costco. Like, identically shredded apart.

                                 EVAN
                        Wow, that's crazy. I can't even believe that.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Yup. Clearly this guy means business. Or this 
                        was the work of some fucked up copycat. But 
                        my gut tells me it's the same guy.

           Sergeant Bressman switches gears, and starts acting overly casual.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN (CONT'D)
                        So...what did you get up to last night?

                                 EVAN
                        Me? Not much. Why?

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Ah, no reason. It's actually kind of funny. As I 
                        was investigating the murder scene last night, 
                        I accidentally stepped in something. Brought 
                        a little sample of it with me.

           Sergeant Bressman reaches into the inside pocket of his coat and pulls out a 
           ZIP-LOCK BAG OF PINK VOMIT.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN (CONT'D)
                        This belong to you?

                                 EVAN
                        I literally have no idea what that is.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Well, Mr. Trautwig, it's a bag of puke. 
                        And...actually it looks strikingly similar to the 
                        type of puke that you puked at Costco the 
                        other day.
                             (smug)
                        Now, how's that for police work?

                                 EVAN
                        Well, I don't know what to tell you. It's not 
                        mine. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only guy in 
                        Humboldt county with an irritable stomach.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        An irritable stomach and an unquenchable 
                        thirst for pink smoothies?

           Bressman hands him the vomit bag.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Here. Why don't you take this sample and 
                        think about it. I got plenty more of it back at the 
                        station. You have a good day now, you hear?

           Sergeant Bressman confidently walks back to his car, leaving Evan very 
           concerned.

           I/E. COSTCO - THE NEXT DAY

           Evan, dressed in his Costco uniform, rips down POLICE TAPE and makes his 
           way to the front entrance.

           He unlocks the door and walks inside for the first time. The store is still and 
           quiet.

           He makes his way through the aisles and notices that many of the shelves are 
           emptier than they should be. The BATTERY DISPLAY CASE, in particular, is 
           almost completely empty.

                                 EVAN
                        You gotta be fucking kidding me.

           INT. COSTCO - LATER

           Evan, Bob, Jamarcus, and Franklin sit back on a row of lounge chairs, 
           suspiciously eyeing the people in the store.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Have you guys been sleeping? I haven't slept 
                        at all. Fuck I'm not dealing with this well.

                                 EVAN
                        Well, at least you don't have the "law" 
                        breathing down your neck.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Yeah, I know what that's like.

           Jamarcus looks at Evan, worried.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Don't worry, Jamarcus. I got it under control. 
                        The guy's, like, the stupidest cop I've ever met.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, I guess we should be more concerned 
                        there are fucking aliens in our town. I mean, 
                        this is insane, I have a daughter to protect.

           Evan gives Bob a pissed off look.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        And the most fucked up part is what that thing 
                        said they're "among us". What the hell does 
                        that mean?

                                 EVAN
                        Well, what if it means they're the body 
                        snatcher type aliens? If that's the case then 
                        any one of these fucking people could be an 
                        alien, for all we know. I mean, I know I'm not 
                        an alien. I know you're not an alien. But what 
                        about her?

           Evan points to a WOMAN in the produce section. She is holding a 
           GRAPEFRUIT.

                                 BOB
                        Oh my god. Look at that. It's like she's 
                        studying it cautiously. Like a new discovery. 
                        "What's this" she says, "Some sort of bizarre 
                        human-circle-fruit? Should I put it in my flavor 
                        snout?"
                             (beat)
                        And how about this guy?

           Bob points at a LITTLE BOY enjoying an ice cream from an ice cream cart. It's 
           smeared all over his face.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        I see what you're saying. Just look at the little 
                        prick.

                        The Alien hasn't even learned how to eat 
                        properly yet. So primitive. So clumsy. So 
                        dangerous.
                             (beat)
                        Oh shit.

           Franklin points down the aisle at JASON, who is walking by carrying a BIG BOX 
           OF MAGNUM CONDOMS. Bob instinctively gets up and Franklin holds him 
           back.

                                 BOB
                             (seething)
                        That motherfucker.

           Jason sees Bob and waves at him with the box of condoms, taunting him.

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        I'm gonna fucking lose it you guys. I'm gonna
                        blow a gasket.
                             (yelling at Jason)
                        There's no way your dick's that big!

           Jason smiles at Bob and nods. Bob turns back to the guys.

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        You guys don't think it can actually be that big, 
                        right?

           Evan shrugs.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Well someone's dick has to be that big. 
                        Otherwise they wouldn't even sell em.

                                 EVAN
                        He's got a good point; we sell out of those all 
                        the time.

                                 BOB
                        I swear to god, I'm gonna rip his fuckin' dick
                        off.

           Enraged, Bob storms towards Jason. Jamarcus stops him.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Just...easy Bob. Let me go talk with 
                        him...brother to brother.

           Jamarcus walks over towards Jason.

           ANGLE ON: Jamarcus and Jason

           Jamarcus goes up to Jason.

                                 JASON
                        What?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        I think you gotta lay off of Bob's daughter.

                                 JASON
                        What do you care?

           ANGLE ON: Evan, Franklin, and Bob

           They watch Jamarcus talk with Jason. Bob stares daggers at Jason.

                                 BOB
                        What is he waiting for? Deck the prick!

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        Well hey there, neighbor!

                                 EVAN
                        AHH!!!

           Evan jumps up, freaked. He, as well as Franklin and Bob, spin around to see 
           Paul. Bob returns his attention to watching Jamarcus, who has just begun a 
           conversation with Jason.

                        tell you I'm hosting a little...gathering tonight. 
                        Lots of...interesting characters should be in 
                        attendance. I think you might be into it.

           Evan looks in Paul's cart and notices he's buying a TON of BATTERIES.

                                 EVAN
                        Uhh...I'll think about it.

                                 PAUL
                        Alright! Don't think too long! Cuz next thing you 
                        know, tonight's come and gone, and you 
                        missed out on a really good time. My place at 
                        10:30pm. If you can make it, dress casual.

           Paul lightly squeezes Evan's hand and walks off.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Who the fuck was that guy?

                                 EVAN
                        My neighbor.

           Jamarcus steps back into the group.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        I think I set him straight.

                                 BOB
                        You may have just saved that kid's life.

           CONTINUED: (5)

           Evan watches Paul walking away, suspiciously. Then, something dawns on 
           him.

                                 EVAN
                        Holy shit! He's one of them!

                                 BOB
                        Who? What?

                                 EVAN
                        I'm telling you, this guy Paul is DEFINITELY 
                        one of them! I can't believe it didn't occur to 
                        me before. He was the only one who saw me 
                        stashing the gun in my garage. I'll bet you 
                        anything he broke in and took it! He's probably 
                        been spying on me this whole time.
                             (beat)
                        Oh my god! And did you see how many 
                        batteries he just bought?! What is he doing 
                        with all those?!

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Who knows? He's fucking creepy. Who calls a 
                        party a "gathering"?

                                 EVAN
                        I know, right? And he was like, super intent on 
                        me showing up. He must knows we're close 
                        to figuring out the whole mystery and he 
                        wants to have a final showdown! This is it. 
                        This is why the neighborhood watch was 
                        formed. This is our Thermopole. Our 
                        Hamburger Hill. Our Alamo. Except instead of 
                        getting by the Mexican army, we're gonna kick 
                        ass, and...live. 

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Fuckin A!

                        And if it's not aliens, maybe it'll just be a cool 
                        party. With women. Instead of this never-
                        ending sausage party we've grown to call the 
                        Neighborhood Watch. 

           INT. EVAN'S HOME - NIGHT

           Evan walks in the door, and heads straight upstairs, on a mission.

                                 ABBY
                        Evan?

           Abby follows him upstairs. She finds Evan rummaging through drawers and 
           throwing clothes on the bed. She tries to put on a happy face.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        So, how was the first day back?

                                 EVAN
                             (waves her off)
                        It was...ehhhhhhh.
                             (takes a breath)
                        You will not believe how much shit was stolen 
                        since we were closed. All the paperwork is 
                        messed up. The insurance company hasn't 
                        told us how they're paying us for all the stuff 
                        that went bad. It's a disaster. 

           Abby pauses, preparing herself.

                                 ABBY
                        Maybe we could both use a dinner out tonight, 
                        talk things through. I just feel like we haven't 
                        been on the same page lately.

           Evan opens another drawer.

                        Where is that damn balaclava? I thought it 
                        was in here.

                                 ABBY
                        Did you not just hear what I said?

                                 EVAN
                        I...I can't go for dinner tonight, hun. I'm sorry. 
                        The Neighborhood Watch is right on the 
                        precipice of something major.

           Abby shakes her head.

                                 ABBY
                        I can't keep doing this anymore.

           Evan finds the BALACLAVA.

                                 EVAN
                             (to himself)
                        Nice, there it is.
                             (to Abby)
                        Doing what?

                                 ABBY
                             (motioning to him and her)
                        This! Living totally separate lives under one 
                        roof. We're not in sync. I mean, is this enough 
                        for you?

                                 EVAN
                        Sure. Of course it is.

                                 ABBY
                        Well, it's not enough for me. I want more than 
                        this. I want to spend time together. I want a life 
                        with you.
                             (beat)
                        I want kids.

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Evan throws the balaclava across the room.

                                 EVAN
                             (defensive)
                        Well...what am I supposed to say to that? You 
                        want the only thing I can't...do. How the fuck do 
                        you think that makes me feel?

                                 ABBY
                        I'd like to know how it makes you feel! You 
                        never want to talk about it, and because of 
                        that, it's shut down our whole sex life! 

                                 EVAN
                        What? What do you mean? 

                                 ABBY
                        We never have sex! 

                                 EVAN
                        I don't have a strong sex drive! My libido is 
                        weak.... and you know that! 

                                 ABBY
                        No. Your libido was normal until exactly 
                        eighteen months ago when we found out 
                        about the infertility, and ever since then, you 
                        don't want to have sex, and I want to talk about 
                        it. Why? Does it make you feel weak? Are you 
                        insecure with your sexual prowess? You don't 
                        have to be! 

                                 EVAN
                        You know what really makes a guy feel secure 
                        with his sexual prowess? Asking him if he 
                        feels insecure with his sexual prowess! This 
                        is why I don't want to talk about it! I'm not 
                        some baby factory! I'm already late, alright. We 
                        can figure out all this shit later.

           Evan picks up his balaclava and walks out of the room.

           Abby sits down on the bed, depressed.

           EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - SOON AFTER

           The guys, wearing balaclavas, sneak around the perimeter of Paul's house, 
           keeping to the bushes, staying out of sight. They plant themselves behind a 
           LARGE BUSH near the front porch.

                                 JAMARCUS
                             (whispering)

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Someone's coming.

           A COUPLE walk up to the front door and rings the bell. Paul answers, smiles 
           and looks them up and down before holding out his hand. The man hands 
           Paul a set of keys.

                                 MAN & WOMAN
                        Caligula.

           Paul nods, and the couple enters the party.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Shit. There's gotta be like 20 people in there. 
                        And there's more coming.

           ANOTHER COUPLE hands Paul a set of keys.

           They also enter the party.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Caligula? You think that's the name of their

                        They keep handing over their keys. I bet it's 
                        some symbolic gesture. Like handing over 
                        the keys to their lives or something.

                                 BOB

                        Fine. We'll split up. Franklin, you come with 
                        me.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        But-

                                 EVAN
                        No! Franklin's not going anywhere. We're the 
                        Neighborhood Watch. We function as a team.

                                 BOB
                        Really? Because sometimes, like right now, it 
                        feels like a fucking dictatorship.

                                 EVAN
                             (sarcastic)
                        Okay. You're right, Bob, let's drop the mission 
                        and go deal with your daughter.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Bob shakes his head, pissed off.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        We can go wherever you want, AFTER the 
                        mission.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Wait. Shut up- you hear that?

           A LOW BUZZ starts emanating from the house, followed by FAINT WAILS and 
           MOANS.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        What is that?

                                 EVAN
                        Oh fuck, it's happening. Come on, we gotta 
                        get closer.

           Evan leads the guys up the side of the house, to a closer set of bushes by a 
           window. The noises grow louder -- loud buzzing and violent moans and wails. 
           In the window they see SILHOUETTES of flailing limbs, a huddled mass of 
           bodies. A loud pounding noise is heard.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        URGH!!! URGH!!! URGH!!!

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Oh god...what the fuck is happening in there? 
                        It sounds like some poor woman's being 
                        ripped apart.

           Franklin looks like he's going to puke. Bob peaks in a window.

                                 BOB
                        I can't see anyone. I just hear all these weird 
                        noises. Squishing sounds.

                                 EVAN
                        I'm going in.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 FRANKLIN
                        What?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        I'm coming with you. Someone's gotta have 
                        your back.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        I'm not.

                                 BOB
                        I'm sticking with Franklin. We work well 
                        together. 
                             (to Franklin)
                        Right, partner? 

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Uh... Yeah sure. I guess. 

                                 EVAN
                        Fine. We're going in to see what the deal is. 
                        But you guys have to stay out here and back 
                        us up. If the shit hits the fan, you guys gotta 
                        bust in and help us.

           Bob and Franklin look at each other.

                                 BOB
                        Okay. Fine.

           EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE -  CONTINUOUS

           Evan and Jamarcus walks up to the front door of Paul's house, their covert 
           operations make up wiped off. Evan takes a deep breath and knocks on the 
           door. We hear footsteps and the door creeks open. It's Paul.

                                 EVAN
                        Uh...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 PAUL
                        Well, well. I must admit, this is certainly a 
                        pleasurable surprise. I thought you were 
                        more vanilla than this. I'm glad I was wrong.

           Paul motions Evan towards him and gently hugs him.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Welcome.
                             (turns to Jamarcus)
                        And who is this mountain of a man? Any 
                        friend of Evan's is a friend of mine. Please, 
                        come in.

           Paul takes Evan and Jamarcus by the hand and leads them in.

           INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The lights are set dim and there is strange, trippy lounge music playing.

                                 EVAN
                        This is a nice place, Paul. I like the paint job.

                                 PAUL
                        Do you have any idea how long we've been 
                        watching you?

                                 EVAN
                             (shocked)
                        Really? Me?

                                 PAUL
                        Yes. You. How could we not? When I see you 
                        jog by in the morning, I always think to myself, 
                        my god, what a perfect specimen.
                             (glances at Jamarcus)
                        Two perfect specimens.

           Evan and Jamarcus look at each other, concerned. Paul stops at the top of a 
           staircase leading to the basement where music, thumping noises, and 
           moaning can be heard.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Do you gentlemen want something to drink 
                        before we...begin?

           EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Franklin has cracked open one of the back windows of the house and is 
           peeking his head in.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        It smells funky and musky in there. It's 
                        probably like an alien breeding ground or 
                        something.

           Franklin turns to see Bob pacing around.

                                 BOB
                        Fuck this. They'll be fine. Let's get out of here.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        What? We can't go! We're the backup!

                                 BOB
                        Well, I can't fucking wait around here. I have to 
                        go check on Chelsea. Come on, we're going.

           Franklin's conflicted.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        I don't know, Bob...I don't know.

           Bob starts to walk away. Then turns back.

                                 BOB
                             (disappointed)
                        You know, Franklin, I thought we had a pretty 
                        cool father-son thing going. Guess I was 
                        wrong.

           Bob walks away. After a moment, Franklin buckles.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                        Aw, come on. Don't do that.

           Franklin runs after Bob.

           INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - BASEMENT

           Evan and Jamarcus, each with a mojito in hand, follow Paul down the dark and 
           ominous stairs.

                                 PAUL
                        Ready boys? Welcome...to paradise.

           They round the corner and immediately see a WOMAN getting pounded from 
           behind, doggy-style, and loving it.

                                 WOMAN
                        UGH!!! I LOVE it!!! MORE!!! MORE!!!

           They look up and realize that this is a full-blown ORGY. There is a PODIUM in 
           the center of the room with TWENTY BUZZING VIBRATORS, a huge pile of 
           BATTERIES beside them. People start passing them around.

           Paul takes off his shirt.

                                 PAUL
                        Drop them drawers, fellas. Tonight's about 
                        freedom. Tonight's about fucking.

           Paul throws his arms up and wiggles his way out of his pants, then makes his 
           way into the ocean of bodies. Evan and Jamarcus look at each other, stunned.

                                 PAUL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Come on in, boys! The water's just right!
                             (beat, squishy noises)
                        Oh yeah! Now, we're getting into it!
                             (calling across the room)
                        Hey, what you doing over there? This dick's
                        not gonna suck itself..

           The guys awkwardly move into the orgy, standing amongst the writhing bodies.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        I'm over-whelmed...I...I don't know what this is-

           Jamarcus looks at a couple passionately making love right in front of him.

                                 GUY
                        Oh yeah! I'm inside of you!

                                 WOMAN
                        I love you!

                                 GUY
                        I'm coming!!!

                                 WOMAN
                        Come in me!

           Jamarcus' jaw drops. He looks around the room. He sees two lesbians about 
           to play with dildos.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        This is...real.

           He sees a guy wacking off while watching the lesbians, then turns and sees 
           two guys casually chatting as they lightly tug their penises.

                                 CASUAL WANKER
                        ...oh it's gonna win best picture for sure, the 
                        cinematography was unreal.

           He then sees an attractive woman having passionate sex with her lover. A tear 
           comes to Jamarcus' eye.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        I've never seen anything like this. I didn't know 
                        that people actually did this. 
                             (beat)
                        This is beautiful.

                                 EVAN
                        This is fucking gross. I guess I was wrong. 
                        Let's get the hell out of here, man.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        But...we should probably stay though, right?

                                 EVAN
                        Are you joking?

           A mildly attractive HOUSEWIFE walks up to Jamarcus and starts to pull his 
           pants down.

                                 HOUSEWIFE
                        So...would it be alright if I sucked on your 
                        penis and balls?

                                 JAMARCUS
                             (to Evan)
                        I'm gonna see how this plays out. Catch up 
                        with you later.

           Evan is stunned. Then he gets a tap on the shoulder and turns around. It's Paul 
           and the Drag Queen.

                                 PAUL
                        Ev! This is Olivia! Used to be Oliver but 
                        then...you know...Anyway, she just told me the 
                        dirtiest little secret. She wants to suck your 
                        dick while I suck her dick. What do ya say, 
                        neighbor?

           Evan turns to the Drag Queen who looks like she wants to devour him.

                                 DRAG QUEEN
                             (to Evan)
                        I'm gonna gobble you like a turkey.
                             (high-pitched Turkey impression)
                        Gobble! Gobble! Gobble!

           He pats Jamarcus on the back.

                                 EVAN
                        You're on your own, buddy.

           CONTINUED: (3)

           Evan hightails it out of there. He looks back to see the Housewife blowing 
           Jamarcus.

           Paul shrugs, then starts blowing the Drag Queen.

           EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan bursts out the front door. He walks along the perimeter of the house 
           looking for Bob and Franklin.

                                 EVAN
                        Bob? Franklin? Where the fuck are you guys?

           Evan stops, realizing where they've gone.

                        Cocksuckers.

           I/E. MANDY'S HOUSE - SOON AFTER

           Bob and Franklin arrive at Mandy's. Franklin pulls Bob back.

                        Wait, what are we doing once we're in there?

                                 BOB
                        Don't worry about that. Just follow my lead.

           Bob puts on his ski mask. With all his strength, Bob tries to kick the front door 
           down. But it doesn't budge. Slightly defeated, he rings the door bell. A drunk 
           teenage girl MANDY answers the door.

                                 MANDY
                        Oh my god! AHHHHHH!!!!

           Bob pushes Mandy aside and forces his way inside.

                                 BOB
                        WHERE THE FUCK IS CHELSEA!?! WHERE 
                        IS SHE? TELL ME, YOU SKANK!!!

           All the party-goers are stunned. Bob points at a SKINNY YOUNG KID.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        You! Where's Chelsea?

                                 SKINNY YOUNG KID
                        Don't hurt me, oh my god.

                                 BOB
                        I'll hurt you bad if you don't answer my 
                        question.

           The Skinny kid frantically scans the room.

                                 SKINNY YOUNG KID
                        There!

           Bob swings around to see Chelsea in the kitchen flirting with JASON. Rage in 
           his eyes, Bob storms into the kitchen. Franklin follows.

                                 BOB
                        You! Get your damn hands off of her!

                                 CHELSEA
                        Dad?! 

                                 BOB
                             (to Franklin)
                        Get her out of here!

           Frightened, Franklin does as he is told. He heads towards Chelsea and tries to 
           pick her up.

                                 CHELSEA
                        GET OFF ME!!!

           Jason steps up to protect her and Bob gets in his face.

                                 BOB
                        What? What are you gonna do about it?

           Bob and Jason are now nose-to-nose. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 JASON
                        Stop breathing on me.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah...that's what I thought.

           Suddenly, Jason viciously HEAD-BUTTS Bob, sending him reeling to the floor.

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        Ahh!!!

                                 PARTYGOERS
                        YEAH!!!

           Bob's nose gushes blood. Jason leans over him.

                                 JASON
                        Ouch. That looks like a real gusher
                             (whispers to Bob)
                        -that's my nickname for your daughter, by the 
                        way.

           Jason walks away, laughing to himself.

                                 BOB
                        Must...kill...child...

           Bob pulls himself up and grabs a LAMP, and hurls it at Jason's back. 
           Instinctively, Jason LEAPS over it, pushes off the wall and RAMS into Bob. Bob 
           flies out the front window, onto the lawn.

                                 JASON
                        Man...I'm fuckin' outta here. 

           Jason runs out the back door.

           EXT. MANDY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Franklin and Chelsea stand over Bob, who lies hurt on the front lawn.

                        I can't believe you! You have no respect for 
                        me!

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, yeah.

                                 CHELSEA
                        I'm moving out!

                                 BOB
                        Then I'm moving in. To wherever you go. 
                        Because I'm your father and you can't run 
                        away from that. You're literally made up of little 
                        bits of me. Even when you're alone, you're 
                        not...you're with me.

           Then, they see Evan approaching. 

                                 EVAN
                        I can't believe you guys actually came here?! 
                        You were supposed to be our back-up

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Bob made me come here.

                                 EVAN
                             (re. Bob)
                        What happened to you?

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Oh. Jason kicked the shit out of him. What 
                        happened at Paul's? Were there aliens? 
                        Where's Jamarcus?

                                 EVAN
                        Uh, he decided to stay. It turned out that it 
                        wasn't aliens and it was actually just a... um... 
                        giant orgy.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Fuck! I knew I should have stayed.

                        Wait... let me get this straight. You're pissed at 
                        us for leaving a party that turned out to be 
                        nothing? 

                                 EVAN
                        I'm not pissed about the party, Bob. It's the 
                        principle. You abandoned the team.

                                 BOB
                        Oh, you are a piece of-

                                 CHELSEA
                        Dad, you're humiliating me in front of-

                             (to Chelsea)
                        YOU! HOME! NOW!

           Terrified, Chelsea runs towards home. Bob gets to his feet.

                                 EVAN
                        Well, great job using the Neighborhood Watch 
                        so you can spy on your poor daughter and be 
                        even more embarrassing and overbearing. 
                        That sounds to me like the motivations of a 
                        selfish asshole. You have a kid and you don't 
                        even appreciate her. You're a terrible father. 

                                 BOB
                             (enraged)
                        What the fuck do you know about being a 
                        father? You can't even have kids! 

           Evan is extremely hurt, and his anguish segues to rage. 

                                 EVAN
                        YOU SON OF A BITCH!!!

                                 BOB
                        Fuck you. I'm done with you, and I'm done with 
                        the Neigborhood Watch. I quit.

           Bob walks away and turns back.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        The boy's coming with me! Franklin! GIT!

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Um...

                                 BOB
                        GIT!!!

           Franklin shrugs at Evan and runs over to join Bob.

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        And that leaves you...all alone.

           Evan shakes his head, angry. He walks off in the other direction.

           INT. EVAN'S HOME - BEDROOM - LATER

           Feeling dejected, Evan walks upstairs to find Abby zipping up a suitcase.

                                 EVAN
                        Wh- what are you doing?

           Abby pulls the handle out of the suitcase and starts walking out of the room.

                                 ABBY
                        What does it look like?

           Evan follows after her.

                                 EVAN
                        Wait. Let's talk about it.

                                 ABBY
                        I've already tried talking to you about it and you 
                        didn't give a shit.

                                 EVAN
                        I do give a shit! I give plenty of shits!

                        Look, I've tried, Evan. And you keep choosing 
                        your Neighborhood Watch over me. So, hey, 
                        I'm making your life easier. You can spend all 
                        your time with them now. You don't have to 
                        placate me.

           Abby makes her way for the front door. As she opens the door, she hears Evan 
           start crying. She turns around to see a broken man.

                                 EVAN
                             (through sobs)
                        I know...you're right. I haven't been there. I 
                        failed. I feel like I've failed you as a man. And 
                        when I found out that my testicles weren't 
                        producing functional sperm, I felt like I failed 
                        myself as a man. And every time we had sex... 
                        that's all I could think of. 

           Abby sees how genuine Evan is being... and can't help to be a bit moved. 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        ....And the more I think about it,  I think that's 
                        why I started all these clubs and groups and 
                        stuff in the last year. Because... I wanted to 
                        have... a legacy. I wanted to be able to lead by 
                        example. I wanted to have... a family. 

           Evan breaks down harder than before.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        I'm sorry...I'm really sorry...I love you so 
                        much...

           Abby puts down her suitcase and hugs him.

                                 ABBY
                        Evan...it means so much to me to hear this... 
                        not knowing what you were thinking, it was 
                        just, it was killing me. We need to seriously 
                        work on communicating better.

           Evan nods his head and sniffles in her arms.

                        You're right. You're right and I love you.

                        Abby. I'm done with Neighborhood Watch. No 
                        more groups. No more sports pools. I'm 
                        100% committed to you. You're my new 
                        obsession. We're gonna figure out how to 
                        have kids. 

           They look each other in the eye, and as they're about to kiss- DING DONG!

           Evan reluctantly opens the door to see Jamarcus standing there, absolutely 
           glowing.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        Jamarcus? What's going on?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        I...I don't even know where to start. I gotta tell 
                        you something. We gotta get the guys 
                        together.

                                 EVAN
                        I don't think so, man. You missed a lot last 
                        night. The Watch is over.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        No, man. Trust me, it's not. You gotta come 
                        with.

           Evan looks at Abby, torn.

           INT. BOB'S HOUSE - GARAGE - SOON AFTER

           Evan is seated across from Bob and Franklin, avoiding eye contact with Bob. 
           Jamarcus stands in front of them.

                                 BOB

                        I'm Abby. Hey. I didn't ask to come. Evan 
                        insisted. So...blame him.

                                 BOB
                        Oh, I do!

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Nice to meet you.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Guys, please! I have something to say.
                             (takes a deep breath)
                        Last night...my life changed. I was in a room 
                        full of humans; humans who were exploding 
                        with this unyielding will to live. Sharing their 
                        life force. Cleveland steamers, strawberry 
                        shortcakes, Jamaican junk baskets; we did 
                        so many nameable and unnameable acts of 
                        affection. It was love.
                             (beat)
                        I'd read about it. Love, that is. I was briefed on 
                        it, but I never really understood it. Until now.
                             (beat)
                        I did it all. And I want to do it again. And again 
                        and again.

                                 ABBY
                             (whispering to Evan)
                        What's he talking about? What the hell do you 
                        guys do here?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Guys, for the first time, I get it. I get it, and my 
                        people were wrong. Humans are beautiful, 
                        affectionate creatures, and I want to be one 
                        with you all.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           The guys stare at Jamarcus, very confused.

                                 BOB
                        We're not gay, Jamarcus.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        You're my friends, and I can honestly say I've 
                        never had a friend before. My people don't 
                        associate with each other like you. In my 
                        culture, we're all just nameless drones with 
                        no personality, no emotion.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Are you talking about black people?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        I consider you my best friends, and that's why 
                        I have to do this. I'm not like you. And I'll prove 
                        it.

           Jamarcus reaches into his pant pocket.

                                 BOB
                        Jamarcus! Can I say it any plainer? We're not 
                        gay!

           Jamarcus pulls out a knife.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Oh shit! He's flipped. He's a cutter. A fuckin' 
                        cutter.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        No, I'm-

           Jamarcus cuts the palm of his hand and green goo oozes out.

                                 JAMARCUS (CONT'D)
                        I'm an alien.

           Evan, Bob, and Franklin stare in shock. Abby clutches Evan's arm. Jamarcus 
           holds out his hand.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        It's okay.

           He looks at the goo in his hand.

                                 JAMARCUS (CONT'D)
                        Touch my goo.

           Bob slowly gets up, looks back at the other guys, and touches Jamarcus' goo. 
           He swirls his fingers around in Jamarcus' hand and then rubs his fingers 
           together. He smells it. His eyes go wide.

                                 BOB
                             (quietly to Jamarcus)
                        ...it feels like cum...

           Jamarcus smiles and nods. Bob turns back to Evan and Franklin, holding up 
           his goo-covered fingers.

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        IT FEELS LIKE CUM! His goo feels like CUM! 
                        HE'S A FUCKING ALIEN!

           Abby turns to Evan.

                                 ABBY
                        What the fuck is this? 

                                 EVAN
                        Oh yeah...uh... I guess I forgot to mention this. 
                        I'm still working on my communicating. It's 
                        new to me, but... we realized that our 
                        neighborhood is being taken over by aliens.  

                                 ABBY
                        Wow... that's...that's...

                                 EVAN
                        Horrifying? 

                                 ABBY
                        Exciting! 
           INT. BOB'S HOUSE - GARAGE - SOON AFTER

           Evan, Bob, Franklin and Abby sip coffees, and Jamarcus drinks a beer, as he 
           regales them with his tale.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        My planet was a harsh place to grow up.

           - We see a vast, technologically advanced planet that has millions of slaves 
           constructing massive buildings.

                                 JAMARCUS (CONT'D)
                        We're born in batches, with no father or 
                        mother to speak of. Just inseminated eggs, 
                        born into worker, warrior, or scholar class.

           - We see young Jamarcus being selected for warrior class at a young age.

                                 JAMARCUS (CONT'D)
                        We are creatures without emotions. Love and 
                        friendship, unknown concepts.

           - We see young Jamarcus kill a fellow classmate in a school training seminar.

                                 JAMARCUS (CONT'D)
                        Eventually I joined the army. I was sent to 
                        Earth with an Invasion Preparation Unit. Our 
                        job was to infiltrate human society and learn 
                        how best to defeat you...but our ship crashed.

           - A SPACESHIP crash lands in the woods outside of Humboldt. A large group 
           of ALIENS flood out, scrambling to gather parts of their destroyed ship.

                                 JAMARCUS (CONT'D)
                        These types of missions usually take a few 
                        days. But much of our equipment was 
                        destroyed and we had to move underground.

           - We see aliens in their underground base, building a massive satellite out of 
           random parts.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 JAMARCUS (CONT'D)
                        We've been trapped on Earth for six months 
                        now. Our human assimilation devices have 
                        been having serious complications.

           - We see a human tied up next to an ALIEN. They connected by a series of 
           wires. The wires short circuit and the human is killed.

                                 JAMARCUS (CONT'D)
                        Only recently have we been able to 
                        successfully initiate the process. We had a 
                        break through - black people. The melanin 
                        levels in their skin is more compatible with 
                        our DNA. 

           - We see an ALIEN enter a room with a terrified BLACK GUY. The camera looks 
           away and we hear screams, then return to see the black guy now has an alien 
           inside him. Jamarcus.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Oh god! That's disgusting. You ate the guy?

           Jamarcus shrugs.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        No. That's barbaric. Let's just say I harvested 
                        his outer shell and assumed control of all his 
                        vital organs...then, after I was assigned an 
                        alias and backstory, that of a divorced, 
                        sexually inclined middle class African 
                        American, I began my new mission.

           - Jamarcus climbs a ladder and comes out of a manhole.

           - He walks down an empty street; there's no one around. He hears some 
           cheering and walks towards it.

           - Jamarcus buys a ticket to a football game.

           - We see Jamarcus in the football stadium watching Evan give his speech from 
           earlier about forming the neighborhood watch.

                        I'm sorry I lied to you guys. I literally had no 
                        compassion when I met you. I felt no emotion. 
                        But my time amongst you, struggling as a 
                        black human man in the suburbs of your 
                        America, I've learnt more about compassion 
                        and myself than I ever knew possible. I learnt 
                        what it means to be human. And that's what I 
                        want to be. Human.

                                 BOB
                        Well too fuckin' bad, alien.

                                 BOB
                        Please what, alien? Why the fuck would we 
                        ever listen to anything you ever say again? 
                        You've been lying to us this whole time. 
                             (to Evan, Franklin, Abby)
                        I say we kill it! Kill it and show his alien 
                        flunkies that we humans will kill anything; we 
                        don't give a fuck.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Bob...take it easy.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Listen, I understand why you'd have issues 
                        with me. But I want to prove it to you. By saving 
                        you.

                                 EVAN
                        From what?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        I wasn't joking. My people came here to study 
                        you for an invasion. We've been gathering 
                        supplies for months now to construct a 
                        satellite system. We're close. Once that's fully 
                        functional, more of us will come.

                        But I don't want them to simply take over your 
                        planet and harvest all the precious metals 
                        and raw material until Earth is nothing more 
                        than a barren shithole like we've done so 
                        many times before. Pluto. Fuckin', Neptune. 
                        Don't even get me started on Mercury.

                                 EVAN
                        Isn't Neptune made of gas?

                        And last I checked with command, that 
                        satellite is literally hours away from being 
                        operational. When Costco closed down, they 
                        had free run of the place and got all the 
                        supplies they needed to finish.  

                                 EVAN
                        Well, so...what do we do about it?

                                 JAMARCUS
                        We need to destroy the satellite. It's not gonna
                        be-

           BEEP! BEEP! A muffled beeping sound is heard.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        What was that? 

           Evan and Bob take out their cell phones to check to see if they got a message. 
           Jamarcus' eyes go wide.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Bob. What did you do with the alien body?

           Bob looks towards the freezer. Jamarcus runs over and whips open the freezer 
           door. Crammed inside is the FROZEN CORPSE of the Alien. BEEP! BEEP! 
           BEEP! A red light is beeping from within it's chest.

                                 BOB
                        What? I was going to tell you guys. I wasn't 
                        hiding anything. I was just trying to preserve it 
                        so we could sell it later. I'm talking a couple 
                        hunny-thow here.

           BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Get back! It's gonna self destruct! 

           Jamarcus pulls Abby and Evan back as the beeping reaches a crescendo and 
           the alien body bursts into flames until there is nothing left but ash. 

                                 JAMARCUS (CONT’D)
                        No! No! Damnit. We have the get the fuck out 
                        of here! They've been listening to his whole 
                        conversation! They know everything!

           Outside the window, the bushes start to move.

           THUD! THUD! The guys are startled by the sound of heavy movement on the 
           roof.

                        Oh no...it's too late.

           RIPPP!!! The sound of twisted metal. The garage door is punctured. Jamarcus 
           turns to the guys.

                                 JAMARCUS (CONT'D)
                        Get out of here! I'll hold them off!

           The garage door is ripped off its hinges, and THREE ALIENS charge in. Bob 
           and Franklin run for the door. Evan grabs Abby and they all rush inside.

                                 ABBY
                        AHHH! Why did you bring me here?!

                                 EVAN
                        I was trying to include you!

           Jamarcus tries fighting the Aliens off but they overpower him, dragging him out 
           of the garage. The Aliens throw Jamarcus in the back of a pick-up truck and 
           speed off.

           INT. BOB'S HOUSE - GARAGE

           Bob peeks inside, then enters. Evan, Abby and Franklin follow behind him.

                                 ABBY
                             (breathing heavily)
                        Oh my god. My heart's never beat this fast 
                        before.

           Bob heads to the bar, pours a shot and hands it to Abby.

                                 BOB
                        Here. This'll calm your nerves.

           Abby downs the shot. Bob swigs from the bottle. 

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        Shit. I feel bad. If I hadn't kept that alien corpse 
                        a secret, Jamarcus wouldn't have been taken.

                                 EVAN
                        I can't believe this! We lost Jamarcus and 
                        there's no way to beat the aliens now! Fuck! 

                                 ABBY
                        Guys! Don't give up! Did Carrie give up when 
                        Mr. Big forgot their anniversary? Or did 
                        Miranda let Carrie go to Paris without telling 
                        her it was wrong? Did Charlotte let Carrie 
                        lose her apartment? No! She gave Carrie her 
                        engagement ring for a down payment! 

                                 BOB

                        Episode of what? What the fuck is she talking 
                        about?

                             (continuing speech)
                        Do you guys know why? Because fashions 
                        come and go, but true friendship NEVER 
                        goes out of style! 

           The guys are inspired. 

                                 EVAN
                        Okay. Let's find him. 

                                 BOB
                        How? We have no idea where they're taking 
                        him? 

                                 ABBY
                        My guess is their spaceship.

                        Oh, good, that narrows it down. Let's just hop 
                        into your Tercel and head to their alien 
                        spaceship. Why don't I just Mapquest "Alien 
                        Spaceship." I'm sure it'll come up. 

                                 ABBY
                        Come on, guys! We just have to think. What 
                        do we know? Jamarcus said they have a 
                        base underground. That's a starting point.

                                 EVAN
                        Okay, so there's an underground base 
                        somewhere.

           The guys think about it. Franklin sits up in his chair.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Well, it's probably somewhere big, right? I 
                        picture it being big. 

                                 ABBY
                        Yeah! What else did Jamarcus say? They've 
                        been here for six months; they've been 
                        gathering supplies.

                                 EVAN
                        Okay...um...

           The guys all rack their brains. It's clear they've got nothing. Something occurs to 
           Abby. She gets really excited.

                                 ABBY
                        Evan, when did you launch your anti-
                        shoplifting campaign at Costco?

                                 EVAN
                        I don't know. About 5 months ago.

                                 ABBY
                        And how many shoplifters have you actually 
                        caught in that time?

                                 EVAN
                             (ashamed)
                        None. I came close once. I detained a kid for 
                        a few hours and he almost cracked, but then 
                        his mother showed up.
                             (beat)
                        I got in a lot of trouble for that.

                                 ABBY
                        And you said that when you went back to the 
                        store after it was shut down, way more stuff 
                        had been taken, right?

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah...

                                 ABBY
                        And why do you think that is?

                             (frustrated)
                        I don't know. Nothing's sacred to these 
                        fucking shoplifters.

                                 ABBY
                        Evan, you realize who the ultimate shoplifter 
                        is...the person who never has to leave the 
                        store.

           The guys don't get it. 

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Because they're living in a secret base 
                        underneath it! Holy shit you guys!

           Evan shakes his head, in shock.

                        when Antonio De Luca was murdered. And 
                        there was all that green goo there!

                        There was? Holy shit. I didn't even know that 
                        and I figure it out. You guys suck at this. 

                                 EVAN
                        So... what do we do? 

                                 BOB
                        I say we bust in there and show em what 
                        happens when you fuck with a member of the 
                        Watch.

           Bob opens up a locked drawer and reveals a stockpile of ASSAULT RIFLES 
           and AMMO.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Holy shit dude. Why do you have all these?

           Bob SLAMS a clip into an M-16 with a grenade launcher on it.

                        Fuck yeah. 

           Abby takes the gun, and then locks eyes with Evan. They look deeply into each 
           other's eyes, their love rekindled. They cock their guns.

           INT. EVAN'S CAR - SOON AFTER

           Everyone gets in the car, duffel bag of guns in tow. They speed off with Abby at 
           the wheel.

                        So, like, what's the plan? We're just going in

                        No! For the last time, fuck them! We're the

           They turn around to see an UNMARKED POLICE CAR tailing them, Bressman 
           at the wheel.

                        guys out. Then I'll really lose him.

           Abby FISHTAILS around a corner and pulls into a small alley. 

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Get out! Go! Go! 

           All the guys hop out. Evan looks back at Abby. 

                                 EVAN
                        You're so fucking hot right now.

                        Go kill me a fucking alien.

           Evan and Abby passionately open-mouth kiss. Bob and Franklin look at each 
           other, impressed.

           Mid-kiss, Abby jerks the wheel and swerves away, pulling a crazy maneuver. 
           Evan, Bob, and Franklin watch in awe as she jumps back on to the road, 
           SCREECHES loudly, and peels off. A second later, Bressman comes flying 
           around the corner, and speeds past the guys, hot on Abby's tail.

           EXT. COSTCO - SOON AFTER

           The guys, guns in hand, stealthily make their way across the empty parking lot. 
           Franklin, carrying the large duffel bag, lags a bit behind. Evan leads them 
           around the side of the building, over to the loading dock. Before they enter, 
           Evan turns back to Bob.

                                 EVAN
                        Bob, are you sure you wanna do this? You 
                        have a daughter to think about.

                        I, uh... I really regret what I said to you. 

                                 EVAN
                        Me too, man. 

           Evan smiles at Bob, he forgives him. Evan and Bob bump guns. Franklin 
           catches up, out of breath. Evan takes out his keys and unlocks the back door of 
           the Costco, the other guys covering his back with their guns.

           INT. COSTCO - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob, Evan and Franklin slowly make their way through the dark Costco, guns 
           raised.

                                 EVAN
                        The drains under the freezer. That's the only 
                        conceivable way to get underground.

           Evan makes a military style hand motion, implying for the others to follow him. 
           They turn into the freezer, open the door, and enter.

           INT. FREEZER - CONTINUOUS

           They cautiously enter. Evan points to a drain on the far side of the freezer.

                                 EVAN
                        There it is.

           Evan crouches down and tries to move the drain cover. It is unusually light and 
           easily comes off, revealing a tunnel and a ladder. Evan nods at Bob and 
           Franklin and descends into the hole. Bob follows, and then Franklin.

           INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           Evan, Bob, and Franklin descend down a dark tunnel.

           INT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Abby, energized beyond belief, weaves in and out of traffic with Bressman trying 
           to keep up with her.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           They reach a quieter street and Bressman keeps trying to pass her. But Abby 
           keeps blocking his way.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Oh, fuck this!

           Enraged, Bressman slams on his accelerator and pulls up alongside Abby on 
           the SIDEWALK, hitting over mailbox after mailbox. He jerks the wheel and his 
           bumper knocks Abby's back bumper, sending her spinning to a stop.

           Bressman exits his vehicle, gun drawn. He runs up to the driver's window, 
           pointing it.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN (CONT'D)
                        Hands up, lady! 

           Then Bressman notices it's Abby.

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN (CONT'D)
                        What? Mrs. Trautwig?

                                 ABBY
                        You can call me Abby. 

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Holy shit! You are like the most badass driver 
                        ever. But why didn't you stop? 

                                 ABBY
                        Well, I didn't hear any siren.

                             (gritting his teeth)
                        Fuck. You're right, huh? Our station doesn't 
                        have the budget for the undercover cars to 
                        have sirens... which means you didn't do 
                        anything illegal, I guess. 

                                 ABBY
                        Yeah, I just thought some crazy guy was trying 
                        to run me off the road.

                        fucking shady. 

           Bressman opens her car door and begins to cuff Abby. 

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN (CONT’D)
                        And you're gonna tell me where the fuck your 
                        husband is! You know why? Because he's 
                        wanted, for murder. I finally solved the puzzle. 
                        It spells E-V-A-N. 

                                 ABBY
                        I have no idea where my husband is, and 
                        even if I did, I wouldn't say a thing.

           Bressman thinks hard. 

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Damn, well I guess I've been stumped. You 
                        are so much smarter than me, but I suppose I 
                        should have known that, after all, you're 
                        married to the manager of COSTCO.

                             (beat)
                        You're coming with me. And in case I was 
                        being too subtle and sarcastic, we're going to 
                        Costco. 

           Bressman takes the handcuffed Abby and puts her in the back of his car. He 
           gets in the driver's seat and starts to pull out.

           INT. ALIEN BASE - MOMENTS LATER

           A hatch slowly opens and Evan, Bob, and Franklin enter.

                                 BOB
                        Stinks like alien down here.

           Evan cocks his gun.

                                 EVAN
                        We see anything alive that isn't Jamarcus, 
                        blast it to hell.

           They slowly traverse down the dark scary alien corridor. They hear chatter and 
           Evan motions for them to slow down. Evan slowly creeps forward and looks 
           around he corner of a nearby wall. Inside the next room is a bunch of aliens 
           eating in their mess hall. They wait until a moment when no alien seems to be 
           looking, and quickly crawl across the floor. They sneak down the hall and Evan 
           peers into the next room. Inside he sees a black man tied to a table.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                             (whispering)
                        Jamarcus is in here!

           The guys gather together and sneak into the room. Inside is a young BLACK 
           GUY who is NOT Jamarcus. They untie the man and loosen the gag over his 
           mouth. There are 3 other young black guys tied up.

                                 BLACK GUY
                        Oh god! Get us out of here! They'll be back 
                        soon.

                                 BLACK GUY
                        South Carolina Varsity football. Defensive 
                        tackle. These fuckin' monsters gassed our 
                        team bus and kidnapped us. They killed 
                        anyone who wasn't black. What the fuck is 
                        going on?

           Bob tosses each football player a gun.
           INT. ALIEN BASE - CONTINUOUS

           They make their way down the hall, now with the four football players following 
           them, guns drawn.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jamarcus is tied upside down. An Alien is interrogating him, yelling things at 
           him in his alien tongue. Jamarcus responds in the same language. The alien 
           ZAPS Jamarcus in the crotch with a cattle prod-like instrument.

           From Jamarcus' P.O.V. we see him swing back and forth and see the doors to 
           the room open. His eyes go wide as he sees Evan, Bob, Franklin, and the 
           football players sneak up behind the alien. Jamarcus starts talking loudly to 
           distract him.

                                 EVAN
                        NOW!!!

           Evan charges, and the Alien knocks him across the room. Bob, Franklin, the 
           Football Players jump on the Alien. At first, they drag him the ground, but the 
           alien quickly over-powers the humans, hurling them across the room and 
           easily smacking them down.

                                 JAMARCUS
                             (weak)
                        ...the dick...

                                 EVAN
                        I know, man. We saw. They'll pay for zapping 
                        your dick. I swear.

                                 BOB
                        You fuckin' alien fuck!!!

           Bob aims a gun at the alien's head. BOOM! He blows a hole clean through its 
           head, but the alien charges at him still.

                                 JAMARCUS
                             (weak)
                        Our brains are in our dicks. You gotta shoot 
                        him there.

           CONTINUED:

           Bob frantically aims at the alien's dick. BOOM! He empties the chamber into the 
           alien's dick. The alien drops to the ground, dead. Bob is amazed.

                                 BOB
                        Hah! Yeah!!!

           A moment of relief. Then, Franklin notices ANOTHER ALIEN sneaking through 
           the door and charging directly at Bob. Franklin jumps forward and desperately 
           aims.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        BOB!!!

           BLAM! Franklin blasts off a shot that whizzes between Bob's legs, shredding 
           his pants just below his balls, and perfectly hits the alien in the dick, killing it 
           instantly.

           Bob looks at the dead alien then back at Franklin.

                                 BOB
                        You little fucking angel.

           Evan and Bob start helping Jamarcus out of his bonds. They have to help 
           Jamarcus walk because he is in such bad shape.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        You guys...you came back for me.

                                 EVAN
                        Of course we did. Even if you're an alien, 
                        you're still part of the neighborhood watch. 
                        Now lets get the fuck out of here.

           INT. ALIEN BASE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           They cautiously proceed down the hallway, when they come to a large room 
           that holds a GIANT MAKE-SHIFT SATELLITE DISH. A dozen ALIENS are 
           welding SPARE METAL PARTS and COSTCO APPLIANCES into it.

           Jamarcus looks at a bunch of alien symbols counting down. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Holy shit! We've only got a few minutes before 
                        they send the signal. 
                             (beat)
                        We have to destroy it.

           Suddenly, a BLARING ALARM goes off and RED LIGHTS start flashing 
           everywhere. An alien voice comes in over a P.A:

                                 ALIEN VOICE (O.S.)
                             (over the P.A.)
                             SHREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Oh shit.

           The guys make a run for it. The loud thud of alien feet is heard behind them. 
           Everyone cocks their guns. They all take aim. The stomping gets louder. They 
           tensely prepare as...a single small alien rounds the corner! BLAM! BLAM! 
           BLAM! BLAM! They all fire at its crotch in terror. They keep shooting as they walk 
           up on the alien and unload on its crotch, then finally stop.

           Another two aliens round the corner and one of them leaps onto one of the 
           football players and bites his head clean off.

                                 FOOTBALL PLAYER 3
                        OH MY FUCKING GOD!!! He ate Will's head! 
                        He ate his fuckin'-

           BAM! The alien kicks Football Player 3 and sends him flying into the wall, killing 
           him. The guys blast the other two aliens in the dicks.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Fuck. How many more of these things are 
                        there?!

                                 JAMARCUS
                        I don't know, about a hundred and twenty.

                                 FRANKLIN

                        There's only one way up to Costco. But they'll 
                        be waiting for us.

                                 EVAN
                        There's more than one way up. Trust me.

           INT. COSTCO - EMPLOYEE BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           We see a toilet in a large bathroom stall. The toilet starts SHAKING a little bit. 
           Then more violently. It suddenly is hoisted up in the air by a PAIR OF HANDS 
           emerging from the floor beneath it. The toilet is tossed aside and then Evan's 
           head pokes through the hole.

                                 EVAN
                        Booyah.

           He starts to wiggle his way through the hole.

           INT. COSTCO - BACK OF THE STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan, followed by Jamarcus, Bob, Franklin and the two football players, all 
           holding guns, emerge from the employee bathroom in the back of the Costco.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Well that was fucking gross.

                                 BOB
                        Shhh... There could be aliens anywhere.

           They round a corner to see DOZENS OF ALIENS gathering near the front 
           entrance of the Costco, weapons in hand (the same weapons that the 
           Neighborhood watch found earlier).

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Shit. They're blocking the front. What the fuck 
                        do we do?

           They peek around the corner. There is a LARGE FORKLIFT parked by the front 
           entrance, behind an army of Aliens. Evan sees that they are in the BBQ section 
           and there are hundreds of PROPANE TANKS all around them.

                        You guys turn these propane tanks on; fill this 
                        mother with gas. I'll get the forklift, we'll bust 
                        through these walls, and then blow this place 
                        to shit. The satellite. The aliens. All of it.

                                 BOB
                        How are you gonna get the forklift? It's on the 
                        other side of the store?

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah...on the other side of MY store.

           INT. COSTCO - MOMENTS LATER

           IN SLOW MOTION: WE SEE Evan running towards a wall of Aliens. A few turn 
           and notice him, raising their Alien weapons. Evan keeps running. Just as the 
           Aliens start to BLAST off some shots, Evan darts to the left and LEAPS, landing 
           on one of the giant sliding ladders that line the aisles of the store.

           The ladder WHIPS down an aisle, Evan climbing it as it does so. He reaches 
           the top of the shelf, where there is a crate of WHISKEY. He grabs a bottle, 
           uncorks with his teeth, shoves a sock in the spout, lights it, and hurls at the 
           crowd of Aliens below. It EXPLODES, lighting a group of them on fire! Several 
           Aliens shoot at Evan, and he LEAPS off the top of the shelves, landing in a giant 
           CRATE of toilet paper as he narrowly avoids incineration.

                                 EVAN
                             (re: toilet paper)
                        Thank god that shipment came in.

           He gets up and sprints down an aisle, some Aliens hot on his trail!
           INT. COSTCO - BBQ AISLE - CONTINUOUS

           Bob, Franklin, Jamarcus and the Football Players covertly move through the 
           store. They turn a corner at the BBQ aisle where they spread out and begin 
           turning on the PROPANE TANKS. Tss! Tss! Tss!

           Suddenly, the two remaining Football Players are RIPPED APART! Bob turns 
           around to see Jason standing menacingly behind the Football Players bodies, 
           covered in their blood.

                                 JASON
                        Looks like you're gonna need a new 
                        quarterback. And a wide receiver.

                                 BOB
                        You motherfucker!

           Jason smirks as he reaches into his satchel and pulls out an ALIEN GUN. Bob 
           freezes in his tracks.

                                 JASON
                        Don't you mean...daughterfucker?

           INT. COSTCO - CONTINUOUS

           Evan dashes down the aisle, the aliens right behind him. He DIVES through an 
           opening in the aisle, and barrel-rolls into the adjacent aisle. He quickly springs 
           up and runs over to the FORKLIFT. Evan hops in and turns the ignition. He 
           turns the forklift around, and drives forward, plowing through the aisles! An 
           alien jumps onto the forklift. Evan takes out his gun and shoots the alien right 
           in the dick. Evan continues along his war path.

           INT. COSTCO - BBQ AISLE - CONTINUOUS

           Bob starts taunting Jason.

                                 BOB
                        Oh. I see. You need your fancy alien gun to 
                        take us on? How about you put it down and try 
                        fighting like a fucking man for once?

           Jason smirks and puts the Alien weapon back in his satchel.

                        I don't need this to fuck you up, Bob. I think you 
                        already know that.

                                 BOB
                        Round two, asshole.

           Bob and Jason charge at each other! Jason body-checks Bob, sending him 
           flying down the aisle and crashing into a BBQ. Jamarcus steps up to Jason.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        You wanna try that shit on someone from your 
                        own planet?

                                 JASON
                        Oh, I'd love to, traitor. You're a shame to our 
                        species. I wish your egg had never hatched!

                                 JAMARCUS
                        But it did! SHREEEEEEE!!!

                                 JASON
                        SHREEEEEE!!!

           They're about to go at it, when-

                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        Stop!

           They look back to see Bob, in great pain, picking himself up off the ground.

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        I want the pleasure of killing this alien fuck
                        myself.

           Jason leaps down the aisle and lands on top of Bob, pinning him. Bob 
           struggles to reach a BBQ fork and upon grabbing it, he jams it into Jason's foot!

                                 JASON
                        FUUUUCK!

                        Fuck yeah! Oh yeah! Yes! Fuck you!

           Bob grabs the strap of Jason's satchel and rips it over Jason's head. The Alien 
           gun falls out of the satchel. Bob rips the BBQ fork out of Jason's foot and RAMS 
           it in Jason's other foot.

                                 JASON
                        Oh, fuck!

           Jason YANKS the fork out and charges at Bob. Bob charges at Jason, and they 
           violently collide in mid-air. They start rolling down the aisle, trading shot for 
           shot. Bob feels nothing.

                                 BOB
                        You may be a super strong alien. But you 
                        failed to realize something, on my 
                        planet...when you fuck MY daughter, you DIE!!

           Bob grabs Jason's dick.

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                             (imitating alien)
                        SHREEEEE!!!

           He RIPS Jason's dick off with his bare hand. Jason moans and breathes his 
           last. Bob picks up Jason's penis and tacks it to a wall.

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        Magnum, my ass. I only needed one hand for 
                        that shit.

           Bob spits on Jason's dead body then picks up the alien gun.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        That was fucking badASS, Bob!

           Evan suddenly arrives on the forklift, covered in green goo.

                                 EVAN
                        Quick! Get on! They're blocking the front 
                        entrance. Our only chance is the back! Hurry!

           Bob, Franklin and Jamarcus climb onto the back. They speed off down the 
           aisle, towards the BACK EXIT. 

                                 FRANKLIN
                        We're almost there! 

           Suddenly, the back doors SWING open, revealing Sgt. Bressman, and EIGHT 
           other armed cops. Their cop car is parked, blocking the path, with Abby in the 
           back seat.  

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN (O.S.)
                        FREEZE!!! STOP THE FORKLIFT!

                                 EVAN
                        No!!! Get the fuck out of the way! You're gonna
                        get run over!

           Evan sees that Abby is in the car which in their path, and he SLAMS the breaks. 
           The forklift screeches to a halt.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        Don't shoot! There's propane behind us! Abby, 
                        are you-

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        I said don't fucking move! You're all under 
                        arrest for the murder of Manfred Salisbury and 
                        Antonio De Luca, breaking and entering,

                        In other words, I'm the fucking man. Now 
                        interlock your fingers behind your head and 
                        get on your knees!

                                 EVAN
                        Bressman, you don't understand-

                                 SERGEANT BRESSMAN
                        Oh right, I don't understand anything. Cuz I'm 
                        just a dumb cop, right? Well, this dumb cop 
                        just solved the whole fucking-

           GOOSH!!! Out of nowhere, an ALIEN lands on top of one of the  OFFICER'S 
           HEADS. It claws the Officer's eyes out.

                                 OFFICER
                        AHHH!!! MY EYES!!!

                        WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?!?!?!

           The Alien is about to pounce on Bressman when Franklin pulls up his gun and 
           shoots! BAM! Right in the Alien's dick. The Alien falls at Bressman's quivering 
           feet.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        An alien. And there's more where that came 
                        from. Lock and load, officers. We've got some 
                        killing to do. Just follow my lead.

                                 BRESSMAN
                        Anything you say, man! 
                             (to his men)
                        Do whatever the kid says!

           Suddenly, a WILD PACK OF ALIENS converge on the back exit, leaping off 
           shelves and charging.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        SHOOT 'EM IN THE DICK!!!

           Bressman and the Officers follow the order and take aim at the dicks. Franklin 
           deftly leads a charge -- ducking, rolling, shooting...killing. Bressman watches in 
           awe.

                                 FRANKLIN (CONT’D)
                        Don't just watch me! SHOOT 'EM IN THE 
                        FUCKIN' DICK!!!

           It's chaos. Bullets whizzing by. Beams of energy destroying the store. Officers 
           being ripped apart by Aliens left and right. Everyone is in the crossfire.
           INT. COSTCO - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan and Abby shoot Aliens side by side, in MR. AND MRS. SMITH FASHION. 
           They manage to hop back on the Forklift and ride it down the aisle. As Evan 
           drives, Abby unloads round after round on the aliens.

           Bob, Franklin, Jamarcus, and Bressman jump on. They speed down the aisle 
           towards the shelf-lined walls at the FRONT ENTRANCE. A WILD PACK of 
           ALIENS chases after them.

                                 EVAN
                        Hold on!!!!

           Evan CRASHES the forklift through the wall of the Costco. Debris from the 
           HUGE shelves rains down behind them, sealing up the hole. They drive out 
           into the parking lot of the Costco and Evan stops.

           Behind them, dozens of aliens are violently tearing at the debris blocking their 
           path, trying to break through.

                        unloaded 400 rounds in there.

                                 EVAN
                        Oh. Right. Well how are we gonna blow it up?

                        I got one better.

           Bob reaches into Jason's satchel and pulls out the Alien gun.

                        Evan, will you do the honors?

           Evan fills the remaining holes and the gun COMES TO LIFE, lights emanating 
           from it.

                        There goes the neighborhood.

           SHOOM! A giant beam of concentrated energy shoots out, and hits the debris.

           BOOM! The gas ignites and the whole Costco gets blown to fucking shit. 
           UNDERGROUND, we see the satellite dish getting blown to bits. The 
           explosion sends the guys flying across the parking lot!

           EXT. COSTCO - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Confused and disoriented, Jamarcus slowly comes to in the bed of the truck. 
           As he looks to the GIANT CRATER where Costco once stood, a look of 
           melancholy washes over him. But then he looks to his friends, all moaning on 
           their respective windshields. He manages a smile.

                        ...each one of us from different backgrounds, 
                        even different worlds.

           They all start walking out of the parking lot, leaving the smoldering mess 
           behind them.

                                 ABBY (V.O.)
                        But in spite of our differences, the common 
                        bond running between us is far greater...

           They all embrace each other in victory.

           END MONTAGE:

           - ABBY sits at her desk, passionately writing her blog. The words flow out of 
           her. EVAN sits nearby, looking at the Employment Section of the classifieds.

                                 ABBY (V.O.)
                        We are all looking for our own form of 
                        happiness. For some, that can come through 
                        recognition...

           - FRANKLIN, dressed in a policeman's uniform, stands proudly in a community 
           center as Sergeant Bressman pins a medal on his lapel and hands him a 
           badge.

                                 ABBY (V.O.)
                        For others, it comes through growth as an 
                        individual...

           - BOB sits in his newly renovated garage, scouring Chelsea's Facebook. But 
           when he finds her holding hands with a NEW BOY, he resists the urge to freak 
           out and softly closes his laptop. He takes a sip of scotch and raises his glass 
           to a WALL-MOUNTED STUFFED ALIEN (one of the dead ones from Costco)

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ABBY (V.O.)
                        And our strange new friend began his new life 
                        on a new world. He wasn't mourning for the 
                        planet and people he left behind...

           - JAMARCUS walks up the front steps of a house carrying a bottle of Shiraz. He 
           excitedly rings the doorbell and quickly does a breath-check.

                                 ABBY (V.O.)
                        He was looking forward to the new planet and 
                        people he was starting to embrace.

           The door opens a crack. A GREASY MAN in a bathrobe pokes his head out and 
           looks to Jamarcus, expectantly.

                                 JAMARCUS
                        Jamaican Junk Basket.

           The Greasy Man swings the door open revealing an even greasier orgy. The 
           Greasy Man gestures for Jamarcus to enter. Jamarcus hands the Greasy Man 
           the bottle of Shiraz and smiles from ear to ear, as he joins the party.

                                 ABBY (V.O.)
                        So then I realized, sometimes you have to 
                        leave your home...

           - We see EVAN and ABBY walk out of an Adoption Clinic. They are carrying a 
           beautiful AFRICAN-AMERICAN BABY BOY.

                                 ABBY (V.O.)
                        ....to appreciate how great it truly is. 

                                 THE END
