           EXT. LOGGING CAMP -- NIGHT

           A sea of grey barked trees stretch skyward into the darkness 
           of the night. Harsh halogen work lights illuminate the woods. 

           A piercing SHRIEK cuts through the night air as the blade of 
           a powerful chainsaw rips into the hardened wood of a tree.  

           JESSE NOLAND, early thirties, removes the saw from the trunk 
           as the tree falls to the forest floor below with a deafening 
           CRASH.

           Jesse wipes beads of sweat from his forehead as he cuts the 
           engine on his saw and places it by his side. Removing his 
           protective earmuffs, he glances over his shoulder.

           Another chainsaw lies unattended on the snow covered ground. 
           Beside it rests a lit flashlight.

           Jesse looks around confused.

                                 JESSE
                        Riggs?

           SNAP. A twig breaks in the consuming darkness just outside 
           the range of the work lights. Jesse spins toward the sound. 
           All senses on alert. 

           CRACK. Closer this time. Jesse forces a nervous laugh.

                                 JESSE (CONT'D)
                        Riggs, you out there?

           No answer. Jesse’s forced smile quickly fades. 

           An AGONIZED SCREAM pierces through the night air from deep 
           inside the woods. Jesse spins toward the sound.

                                 JESSE (CONT'D)
                        Riggs?!

           As quickly as the pained cry began, it is CUT SILENT.

                                 JESSE (CONT'D)
                        RIGGS?!

           No response. A deafening silence drifts through the trees.

           CRASH. Something large and fast slams into the work lights 
           mounted on a portable stand. The lights sway and fall, 
           smashing to the ground in a splash of sparks. Darkness 
           swallows Jesse and his work site. 

           The sounds of Jesse’s panicked breathing can be heard through 
           the darkness as he fumbles for his flashlight. He finds it, 
           clicking it on. 
           Frozen in terror, he forces his muscles to work. He 
           frantically scans the dark trees with his light. Terror.

           He reaches for his walkie-talkie. It’s not there. His 
           flashlight searches the work site before landing on the 
           walkie. It sits on a stump across the newly created clearing. 

           Before Jesse can take a step, the sound of movement cuts 
           through the darkness. He freezes in fear, not brave enough to 
           pull his eyes or flashlight away from that walkie. 

           The movement charges closer and closer before -- SOMETHING 
           DASHES THROUGH JESSE’S FLASHLIGHT BEAM. We barely miss it, 
           appearing as a blur running into the night. 

           Jesse’s eyes widen. Every cell in his body tenses. He saw it.

           He slowly bends his knees, lowering his trembling hand toward 
           the handle of his chainsaw.

           Behind him, the sound of a furious predator rushes forward at 
           a blinding speed. Before he can react, it is upon him.

           Jesse’s fleeting GRUNT from the fatal impact is all that is 
           heard as his flashlight drops to the cold dirt below. 

           Jesse is gone without a trace or a sound.

           His glowing flashlight lies alone in the now empty clearing 
           as silence once again fills the dark woods.

                                                         FADE OUT:

           LEGEND: "Laytonsville, Maryland. 1984. Based on true events.”

           EXT.  COW PASTURE NEAR TREE LINE -- DAY

           Cows graze in a flat field surrounded by a black plank fence.

           SHERIFF PAUL SHIELDS stands with an old man, TOM PETERSON, 
           outside the fence. Paul is in his early-forties with eyes 
           that show a rare inner strength. He wears a tan uniform 
           shirt, jacket and jeans. A revolver hangs from his belt.

                                 PAUL
                        I don't see any tire tracks Tom. It 
                        rained yesterday. A truck would've 
                        left some tracks in the mud.

                                 TOM
                        I had 23 cattle yesterday, and I 
                        only got 22 today. I ain't no 
                        sheriff but best I figure that 
                        means one's missing!

           Paul ignores the comment. He looks around the dirt.
           DONNY SAUNDERS, a dark haired sheriff's deputy in his late 
           twenties, inspects the fence line about twenty feet away. 
           Donny exudes confidence and optimism, or maybe just naivety. 
           He talks with a hint of a Brooklyn accent.

                                 DONNY
                        The fence is kinda low over here. 
                        You think it could've jumped it?

                                 TOM
                        I've been raisin' cattle on this 
                        land for 35 years, and I've never 
                        seen a cow jump loose without 
                        taking a section of fence out with 
                        'em.

                                 PAUL
                        It just seems odd that someone 
                        would go through all the trouble 
                        just to steal one cow, Tom.  It 
                        would take a couple of guys and a 
                        trailer.

           The deputy approaches.

                                 DONNY
                        The fences were closed?

                                 TOM
                        And tied. I'm not an idiot.

           Tom looks back and forth between Paul and Donny.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        So that's it? I'm just out 900 
                        pounds worth of beef?

           Beat.

                                 PAUL
                        I wish I had more I could do for 
                        you Tom, I really do. But I'm just 
                        not seeing anything here.

                                 TOM
                        I'm seeing one missing cow! That's 
                        what I'm seeing...

           Paul and the Donny open the doors to their white squad car.

           The nearby tree line CREAKS from a slight breeze.

                                 PAUL
                        We'll keep an eye out Tom. You let 
                        us know if you see anyone out here.
           Tom turns and walks toward his rusted truck.

                                 TOM
                        If I lose another cow I be coming 
                        out to your house.

           Paul smiles.

                                 PAUL
                        Let us know Tom.

           Far from satisfied, the old man nods and gives a weak wave.

           Paul and Donny shut the car doors as Paul starts the engine 
           and backs onto the paved highway. Donny forces a smile at the 
           old man through the windshield.

                                 DONNY
                        He left that fence open.

                                 PAUL
                        Yep.

           Paul puts the car in gear and pulls away.

           EXT. RANCH STYLE HOUSE -- DAY

           Paul's squad car slows to stop in front of a nice red bricked 
           one story house. ADAM, a small boy of 8, stares expectantly 
           out the front glass door.

           As Paul and Donny emerge from either side of the car, Adam 
           exits the house, yelling over his shoulder.  He carries a 
           blue backpack on his back.

                                 ADAM
                        Dad's here!

           Paul rubs Adam's hair as passes him on the way to the house.

                                 PAUL
                        Hey pal.

           Paul stops mid-step and cautiously watches Adam as he nears 
           the street.

           As the screen door swings, a voice comes from inside the 
           house.

                                 SUSAN
                        Adam, wait!

           SUSAN SHIELDS emerges, catching the screen door the instant 
           before it latches, a piece of paper in her hand. Susan is a 
           natural beauty. She wears khaki pants, a button up blouse, 
           and not a drop of makeup.  She doesn't need it.
                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        H-

           Adam is already to the car, throwing his backpack through the 
           door. Susan sees Paul approaching her.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        Hey...

                                 PAUL
                        Hey.

                                 SUSAN
                        He forgot his homework.

           She hands the paper to Paul.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        Subtraction.

           Paul nods as he looks at the paper.

                                 PAUL
                        Your mom's car's gone.

                                 SUSAN
                        She's gone to Florida. One of those 
                        senior bus trips.

           She gives a weak smile.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        She was excited.

                                 PAUL
                        You're here alone?

                                 SUSAN
                        I'll be fine.

           AT THE CAR 

           Adam sits on the hood next to Donny.

                                 ADAM
                        So New York's a big city, right?

                                 DONNY
                        Pretty big.

                                 ADAM
                        And noisy?

                                 DONNY
                        ...and noisy.
                                 ADAM
                        Why'd you leave?

                                 DONNY
                        It's too big, and too noisy.

           Adam smiles.

                                 ADAM
                        We were supposed to go last summer.

           Donny's smile fades slightly. He looks around uncomfortably 
           before noticing a cartoon baseball player on Adam’s shirt.

                                 DONNY
                        So you like baseball, huh?

           ON THE PORCH

           Paul and Susan continue to speak on the steps.

                                 SUSAN
                        I got a call from Adam's teacher. 
                        She wants to have a conference with 
                        us. We should both probably be 
                        there.

                                 PAUL
                        Sure.

           Susan hesitates awkwardly for a moment.

                                 SUSAN
                        It's Monday. At 3:45, 1 think... 
                        I'll let you know.

                                 PAUL
                        Sure. I'll be there.

           Susan nervously spins her wedding band on her finger.

                                 SUSAN
                        I've been talking to someone.

           Beat. Paul stiffens.

                                 PAUL
                        Okay...

                                 SUSAN
                        Every Tuesday I drive to Richmond. 
                        It's really helped me. If you ever 
                        wanted to go together...

                                 PAUL
                        I'm fine Susan.
           He has trouble looking her in the eye.

                                 SUSAN
                        ...because I asked if it would be 
                        okay.

                                 PAUL
                        I didn't leave Susan... I'll drop 
                        him back off tomorrow.

           Susan nods. Sadness covers her face. 

           Paul backs toward the squad car as Donny lifts Adam off of 
           the hood and sets him on the ground.

           Susan takes a disappointed breath as she forces a smile and 
           waves to Adam.

                                 SUSAN
                        Have fun baby!  Be safe!

           Adam waves to his mom as he climbs into the rear of the car. 

           INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT

           Adam stands on a plastic stool at the kitchen sink. He washes 
           a dinner plate with a small yellow sponge.

           Paul removes dirty plates from the table and puts them in the 
           sink. He nearly drops a salt shaker as he balances several 
           cups and plates on one arm.

                                 ADAM
                        I don’t want to go to school 
                        tomorrow.

                                 PAUL
                        Why not?

           Adam doesn’t answer. Paul gets it.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Is somebody picking on you?

                                 ADAM
                        Josh Wiley told everyone I run like 
                        a girl in gym today...

                                 PAUL
                        Josh Wiley. Josh Wiley's brother's 
                        been in the 8th grade for 3 years 
                        and he's making fun of you?

                                 ADAM
                        His brother's been in the 8th grade 
                        for 3 years?!
                                 PAUL
                        What? No. No, don't tell anybody 
                        that... You don’t run like a girl.

           Paul takes a beat.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Do you like gym class?

           Adam nods.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Do you have fun with your friends?

           He nods again.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Then who cares what Josh Wiley has 
                        to say about it?

           Adam smiles. Paul looks down at one of the dishes.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        You missed a spot.

           He flips the plate over.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        -you missed a side!

           Paul smiles at Adam, but Adam stares straight ahead. A window 
           is directly in front of him. He stares through the glass at 
           the darkness that envelopes a line of trees just beyond the 
           backyard.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Are you alright?

           Adam stares ahead. Eerily still.

                                 ADAM
                        Someone's in the backyard...

           Paul leans in front of the dark window, peering into the 
           darkness.

           EXT. BACKYARD NEAR TREE LINE -- NIGHT

           The flimsy screen door CLANGS as Paul exits the back of the 
           house. He wears a jacket and shudders at the cold. His breath 
           puffs out in front of him with every exhale. Paul cautiously 
           moves through the back yard.

           Adam stands at the kitchen window, peering out into the dark 
           night. He breathes heavy. Fear shows on his face. 
           Paul sees nothing as he nears the trees. He stops a few feet 
           short of the woods... he stares and listens.

           The branches CREAK and GROAN as the light wind glides through 
           the trees. The quiet RUSTLE of dead leaves can barely be 
           heard. Paul looks up and down the tree line in both 
           directions. Nothing.

           Paul takes a step toward the house. The moment he turns his 
           back on the woods, the CRACK of a large branch cuts through 
           the night. Paul quickly spins toward the trees.

                                 PAUL
                        Hello?

           Silence. Paul swallows hard as his breathing quickens. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        This is Sheriff Shields. If there's 
                        anybody in there you need to come 
                        on out right now...

           Paul's eyes scan the darkened trees as they sway in the 
           breeze.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        You're not in any trouble, I just 
                        need to know if someone is out 
                        there.

           Nothing.

           Paul slowly turns from the trees and begins to make his way 
           back to the house.

           As he opens the back screen door, another branch CRACKS. This 
           one deeper into the woods.  Paul eyes the trees and finally 
           steps back into the house.

           INT. CHILD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

           Paul carries Adam into a brightly painted room lit only by a 
           small plastic night light. Adam is asleep, wearing long 
           sleeved pajamas. Paul lifts Adam onto the top bunk of a red 
           metal bunk bed.

           Adam slowly rolls onto his side, settling in. Paul grabs the 
           covers and pulls them over his son. He rests his hand on 
           Adam's head.

           Paul looks at him for a moment before turning to leave the 
           room. He picks up some clothing off the floor on his way out.

           Adam lies sleeping in the top bunk of two. The lower bunk 
           lies empty. Its sheets are made neatly, unslept in.
           EXT. TREE LINE -- NIGHT

           The Shields’ TWO STORY HOME is barely visible from inside the 
           woods. Darkness drapes the trees, the backyard and the house. 
           All is still.

           Slowly, small flakes begin to fall. A veil of white. 
           Snowfall.

           INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING

           The bright morning sun floods through the kitchen window.  A 
           freshly fallen blanket of snow has covered the back yard.

           Paul sips from a mug of coffee as he pours milk into a white 
           porcelain bowl. He already wears his uniform shirt and jeans.

           Adam sits at the kitchen table eating a bowl of colorful 
           cereal. He still wears his pajamas. He stares at a cartoon 
           maze on the back of the box.

           Paul carries his bowl and mug from the counter to the table, 
           sitting down across from Adam.

           Adam slides Paul the box of cereal and continues eating. Paul 
           glances at the box before pouring some of the multicolored 
           pellets into his bowl.

                                 ADAM
                        Mom never buys me this cereal.

           Paul looks at Adam, and then picks up the box.

                                 PAUL
                        She doesn't?

                                 ADAM
                        She says it isn't healthy.

           Paul scrutinizes the front of the box.

                                 PAUL
                        There's fruit in it. Fruit's good 
                        for you.

                                 ADAM
                        I don't think it counts when the 
                        fruit is made out of marshmallow.

           Paul puts the box down.

                                 PAUL
                           (sarcastically)
                        I think I have some granola in the 
                        cabinet.
           Adam wraps his arm around his cereal, pulling it closer.

           Both continue to eat their cereal in silence. Their spoons 
           CLANK against their bowls.

                                 ADAM
                        When can mom come home?

           Paul stops eating.

           Adam looks at him as serious as an eight year old boy can. 
           Paul sets down his spoon. He thinks.

                                 PAUL
                        That's a tough question pal...

           Adam stares at Paul as he waits for an answer.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Um, Mom decided to stay with 
                        grandma on her own, she can come 
                        back whenever she wants.

                                 ADAM
                        She says you don't want her to.

           Paul gives a pained smile.

                                 PAUL
                        Well, I think what mom meant...

           He plans his words.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Is that there are some things that 
                        we both need to figure out...

                                 ADAM
                        Like what?

           Paul shifts uncomfortably. Adam stares intently.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Is it because of Tim?

                                 PAUL
                        No! I don't want you to think that.

           Paul speaks with a sudden seriousness.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Do you understand? It's not because 
                        of Timothy. Okay?

           Adam nods "yes".
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Okay?

                                 ADAM
                        Okay.

           The moment is broken by a LOUD KNOCK at the back door. Donny 
           enters wearing his tan deputy uniform. He looks shaken.

           Paul takes notice to Donny's expression as he closes the door 
           behind him.

                                 PAUL
                        Donny...

           Donny looks expectantly at Paul.

                                 DONNY
                        So what do you think?

           Paul returns a blank look.

           Adam stops eating turns in his chair toward Donny. Donny 
           looks stunned.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        You...you haven't been outside?

           Paul's gaze moves from Donny to the back door.

           EXT. BACKYARD NEAR TREE LINE -- MORNING

           Paul and Donny exit the back door of the house. Donny closes 
           the door behind him as Paul moves into the yard.

           A freshly fallen, two inch blanket of snow covers the ground, 
           the trees and the house.

           As Paul steps into the backyard, he looks around curiously. 
           Then he sees it.

           Paul's eyes stare at the snow covered ground about fifteen 
           feet into the yard. Slowly he steps forward, followed closely 
           by Donny. They both look bewildered.

                                 PAUL
                        What is this?

           Pressed into the white powder is a set of tracks. HOOFPRINTS. 
           Spaced evenly. One in front of the other.

                                 DONNY
                        I have no idea... I woke up an hour 
                        ago and saw them.
           Paul stands over the tracks. He looks to his left and right. 
           They travel around the side of the house, across the yard and 
           seemingly through the fence on the other side.

           He kneels down close to the tracks. Each print is nearly five 
           inches wide. The spacing of the steps is like that of a 
           human.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        They're hoofprints...like, um, like 
                        a horse’s...

           His brow furrows.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        But...

                                 PAUL
                        The spacing is wrong.

           Donny nods.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        One in front of the other...on two 
                        legs.

                                 DONNY
                        How is that possible?

           Paul looks down the trail of prints.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        What's going on here, boss?

           Paul runs his fingertip around the inside of one of the 
           prints in the tightly packed snow.

                                 PAUL
                        I don't know. But we need to find 
                        out very quickly.

           He rises to his feet and looks to the sky. A light flurry of 
           snowflakes has started to fall. Paul catches one on his hand.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Nature’s going to hide the 
                        evidence...

           EXT. SIDE YARD -- CONTINUOUS

           Paul leads the way as he and Donny follow the trail of prints 
           around the side of the Shield's home. They move past the air 
           conditioner, past a shrub, and both slow to a stop.

           Paul stares at the snow with an almost sickened look on his 
           face. Donny steps up beside him. Both look at the tracks.
                                 PAUL
                        They were looking in our windows.

           THE HOOFPRINTS LEAD UP TO A GLASS PANED WINDOW. Several 
           indentations mark the ground below. They stop there.

                                 DONNY
                        Three or four other houses have the 
                        same thing. They go up to windows 
                        or door and just stop... Whatever 
                        happened, took time, right? They 
                        just don't seem like they were in a 
                        big hur-

           Donny suddenly stop talking. Paul stares blankly over Donny's 
           shoulder. He isn't paying attention.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        What?

           Donny turns around, following Paul's sight line over his 
           shoulder.

           As the tracks lead away from the Shields' window, they 
           approach the neighboring house. Without warning, the tracks 
           stop. Feet from the side of the solid wall.

           From above it is clear that the tracks do not stop. The fresh 
           sheet of snow covering the neighboring roof has been 
           disturbed by a TRAIL OF PRINTS. Large hoof prints.

           The trail continues on the other side of the house without 
           losing pace.

           Paul and Donny both stare at the roof from far below.

                                 PAUL
                        And these go all the way to your 
                        apartment?

           Beat.

                                 DONNY
                        They go all the way through town...

           Paul pulls his eyes from the roof to Donny. They exchange 
           concerned looks.

           INT. HALLWAY -- MORNING

           Paul enters the hallway. He stops and opens a narrow door. A 
           closet.

           Donny moves into the doorframe of the kitchen behind Paul.
           Paul thumbs through an abundance of jackets and coats that 
           protrude from the closet, both male and female.

                                 PAUL
                        There's a camera in the top left 
                        drawer.

           Donny nods, but hangs in the door.

                                 DONNY
                        What do you think it is?

           Beat. Paul continues to rummage through the closet.

                                 PAUL
                        I don't know.

           Donny nods nervously. He turns, scanning the kitchen with his 
           eyes. He moves to a drawer, opening it. He pulls out a small 
           silver camera.

           Paul pulls a heavy DRAB GREEN coat from a hanger. He stuffs 
           his arms into the sleeves as he moves to the glass front 
           door. He stands, peering outside.

           Outside several neighbors curiously stare at the tracks that 
           run through their front yards. Many begin to walk down the 
           street, following the disturbing prints.

           Adam bounds down the stairs, now changed from his pajamas. He 
           stops at the bottom step, gazing out the front door. He sees 
           the commotion outside.

           A small Pomeranian, SAMMY, runs into the foyer and circles 
           Adam's feet.

                                 ADAM
                        What's going on?

           Paul turns to Adam.

                                 PAUL
                        You're going to ride to school with 
                        Evan's mom today. You got your 
                        homework?

           Still staring out the front door, Adam slowly moves toward 
           the kitchen.

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah...

                                 PAUL
                        Get it together and we'll drop you 
                        over there.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Mom will pick you up after school. 
                        Donny, you find the camera?

           INT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

           Donny begins to close the kitchen drawer when something 
           inside catches his eye -- the edge of a photograph peeks out 
           from under an unorganized pile in the back of the drawer. 

           The image of Paul’s smiling face can be seen. 

           Donny pulls the pile of photos to the front of the drawer. 
           The images come into view in parts and pieces as Donny pushes 
           the photos around with his fingers. 

           Photos of a birthday party. Susan’s face appears next to 
           Paul’s as they embrace and smile at the camera. Another photo 
           shows Adam eating a plate full of cake and ice cream.

           The one of the last photos shows a small, six year old boy, 
           TIMOTHY, seated at the head of a table in front of the 
           birthday cake. He wears a cone party hat and smiles. Susan 
           and Paul each have a hand on the boy's shoulder. Happiness.

           Donny quickly buries the photos and closes the draw.

                                 DONNY
                        Got it.

           He hurries out of the kitchen.

           INT. SQUAD CAR -- DAY

           Paul and Donny slowly drive down a residential street. Both 
           stare out the passenger side, watching the tracks progress 
           through the snow.

           Outside, a zombie-like procession of people in robes, pajamas 
           and coats follow the tracks as snowflakes gently fall around 
           them. They progress down the sidewalk before rounding the 
           corner of a house.

           Paul slows the car to a stop along the curb. He leans 
           forward, looking past Donny.

           In between two small houses, a group of about 30 people have 
           gathered.  They stand on either side of the prints that 
           disappear into the dark wall of trees that back the house.

           EXT. TREE LINE -- DAY

           The white snow CRUNCHES beneath Paul and Donny's feet as they 
           make their way toward the edge of the trees. They both wear 
           thick coats and snow boots.

           The crowd of people notice Paul and Donny. The edge of the 
           group parts, revealing the focus of their attention.
           The hoofprints approach the edge of the shadowy woods and 
           continue on into the dense trees. 

           Paul and Donny slowly move into the center of the group. 
           Their eyes move from the marked snow to the top of the trees.

                                 MAN 1
                           (unnerved)
                        What's goin' on sheriff?

           Paul turns to the group.

                                 PAUL
                        Did anybody see who did this?

           A man of about 30 with a five o'clock shadow, JIM, speaks.

                                 JIM
                        Who?

           Donny begins snapping photos of the tracks.

                                 PAUL
                        Someone had to have done this late 
                        last night.  Did anyone see 
                        anything or hear anything?

           A small woman in a bath robe and snow boots speaks up.

                                 WOMAN 1
                        Dogs went crazy about three 
                        o'clock.  Just jumped up and 
                        started barkin'.

           Paul nods.

                                 PAUL
                        Okay.

                                 JIM
                        These tracks went up to my 
                        daughter's window.

           Paul thinks for a moment.

                                 PAUL
                        Anyone else?

                                 MAN 2
                           (nervous)
                        The roof... I heard something on 
                        the roof.  I just remembered.  I 
                        thought it was the wind knocking 
                        the antennae around.
                                 PAUL
                        Okay...

                                 JIM
                        How is this okay?  I wanna know 
                        what the hell did this!

                                 PAUL
                        But the important thing in this 
                        situation is to remain calm.

                                 JIM
                        Whatever made these damn tracks 
                        jumped right over my eight foot 
                        fence without so much as missin' a 
                        step. How exactly am I supposed to 
                        stay calm?

                                 PAUL
                        We just have to follow through on 
                        this, Jim.  But we don't know 
                        what's going on yet.

           The group continues to look at the woods with concern. With 
           fear.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        We're probably just looking for 
                        some prankster.  One of the boys in 
                        town.  Or maybe it's an 
                        animal...maybe it's hurt.

           Paul turns back to the trees.

                                 WOMAN
                        What are they sheriff?

                                 MAN 1
                        They're obviously tracks!

                                 JIM
                        From what then Charles? Huh? What 
                        the hell causes tracks like that?

                                 MAN 2
                        Sheriff. You'd better find out what 
                        did this.

           Paul raises his hands, trying to calm the crowd.

                                 PAUL
                        Alright...

           They quiet.
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Alright. I don't know any more than 
                        you do right now. But we're going 
                        to figure this out. Okay?

           Several nod nervously.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Did anybody see anything last 
                        night? Anyone in your yards, at 
                        your windows?

           The crowd remains silent. No one answers.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Alright. Has anybody gone into the 
                        woods? Has anybody followed the 
                        tracks further than this?

           The people looks around nervously. No one speaks. Jim shakes 
           his head slightly.  They're afraid.

                                 MAN 2
                        We figured we'd wait for you to do 
                        that sheriff...

           Paul slowly turns back to the woods, to the branches that 
           hang disturbingly still. The tracks forge directly into the 
           grey barked trees. He takes a cold breath.

                                 MAN 2 (CONT'D)
                        Whatever did it could still be out 
                        there.

           EXT. DEEP WOODS -- MORNING

           Paul and Donny break through the thick trees. They walk alone 
           down a snow covered incline. Donny braces himself on a small 
           tree as he nearly loses his footing.

           At the bottom of the small hill, Paul looks to the ground. 
           The tracks continue. Their spacing occasionally changes down 
           hills and around trees.

                                 PAUL
                        They're speeding up.

           Donny steps up beside him, slightly out of breath.

                                 DONNY
                        Huh?

           Paul points to the snow.
                                 PAUL
                        The prints are getting farther 
                        apart. It was running.

           Donny stares at the snow. He thinks.

                                 DONNY
                        From what?

           Beat. Paul doesn't respond.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        ...us?

           Paul sends Donny a look of concern. Maybe.

           Donny presses forward once again, following the trail as it 
           continues into a small clearing just ahead.

           Something catches Paul's eye. He stops. A broken twig. It 
           hangs waist high from the trunk of a tree. The embedded 
           prints pass just underneath where it would have protruded.

           Paul pulls the twig from the tree, bringing it to his eyes.  
           FUR.  A small clump of dark brown strands hangs from the 
           splintered wood at one end.  Paul grazes his finger over the 
           fibers as they dance in the breeze.

                                 DONNY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Hey boss...

           Paul looks to Donny, who stands in the center of the small 
           clearing about 40 feet away. Donny stares at the snow 
           intently, not looking to Paul as he speaks.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        You...uh...you need to take a look 
                        at this.

           Donny stares down at the snow. As Paul steps up beside him, 
           Donny looks straight into the sky above as Paul looks to the 
           snow in front of him.

           The tracks emerge from the woods and progress into the center 
           of the untouched clearing where Paul and Donny stand. Without 
           warning they simply stop. The last print looks no different 
           than the countless before it.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        They're gone...

           Looking down on the clearing we can see Paul and Donny 
           standing in confusion alongside the trail of hoofprints that 
           lead nowhere.
           INT. PAUL'S OFFICE -- DAY

           Paul sits behind his desk. Stress in his eyes. He holds a 
           telephone to his ear as he leans forward. His elbow rests on 
           the dark laminate desktop next to a coffee mug. 

           His office is modest. An off white filing cabinet sits in the 
           corner.

           A single window reveals the snow covered ground outside.

                                 PAUL
                           (into phone)
                        I don't understand it either. 
                        That's why I called you.

           He listens.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        And nothing's been reported in the 
                        last few hours anywhere else in the 
                        area?

           Donny enters the office. He notices Paul on the phone and 
           quietly closes the door behind him. He takes a seat in a 
           chair against the wall.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        They were tracks... two legs like a 
                        bear or a person... I don't know. I 
                        don't even know what kind of 
                        animals walk on two legs.

           He listens.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Right. They look like hooves. Like 
                        you'd see on a horse... about the 
                        same size.

           He listens.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Okay, well do you have any idea of 
                        what I'm looking at here?  Does 
                        it... does it sound like anything 
                        that would be in the area? Should I 
                        be warning my people not to go near 
                        the woods?

           He sighs. He rubs his eyes with his hand.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Alright. I'll do that, and I'd 
                        appreciate it if you'd keep an eye 
                        out as well. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Whatever did this has got people a 
                        little spooked... A little bit of 
                        an explanation would go a long way.

           He listens.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Right. I appreciate your help. 
                        Thanks.

           Paul hangs up the phone. Frustration covers his face.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Forest Department doesn't have any 
                        idea what it could be... They've 
                        never heard of an animal that can 
                        walk on its hind legs for that far.

           He takes notice to Donny's condition. Donny breathes heavy 
           and his head is dampened by sweat.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        What happened to you?

                                 DONNY
                        I just chased Mrs. Faulkner's 
                        poodle for half a mile. She let it 
                        out last night because it wouldn't 
                        stop barkin', right?

           Paul nods.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        Well, the worthless little rat gets 
                        away from her. I get a call about 
                        an hour ago tellin' me the dog has 
                        been spotted outside Ruth's Diner.

                                 PAUL
                        Did you catch it?

           Donny nods unhappily.

                                 DONNY
                        I don't know who enjoyed it more, 
                        the poodle or the crowd supportive 
                        fans watchin' me try to find a 
                        white poodle in half a foot of 
                        snow.

           Paul smiles.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        Seven dogs got out last night. At 
                        least that's how many owners called 
                        in before I headed out.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        Mrs.  Faulkner's is the only one 
                        that's shown up so far.

           Paul looks stunned.

                                 PAUL
                        All last night?

                                 DONNY
                        Some at the south end of town, some 
                        in the north. Most of 'em just 
                        broke through the fences. Something 
                        scared them to death...

                                 PAUL
                        Well whoever is responsible for all 
                        this is going to have a lot to 
                        answer for.

                                 DONNY
                        You think it was a person?

                                 PAUL
                        You heard the phone call, Donny. 
                        There's no two legged animal that 
                        leaves tracks like that.

                                 DONNY
                        I'll be honest boss. I don't know 
                        what to think.

           Donny lowers his voice despite being in a sealed office.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        I mean...they disappeared into thin 
                        air.

           Beat.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        How does a person do that?

           Paul shakes his head slowly.

                                 PAUL
                        I don't know Donny. I'm not saying 
                        I have it all figured out. How does 
                        a person leave three miles of fake 
                        hoofprints without any other trace?  
                        I don't know. But I'm afraid 
                        someone's having some fun with us, 
                        trying to get people riled up... 
                        Adam saw something in the woods 
                        last night before it started 
                        snowing... So I went out there.
                                 DONNY
                        What'd you see?

                                 PAUL
                        I didn't see anything. With the 
                        woods and all, it was too dark. But 
                        there was something in the trees. 
                        Movement, branches snapping. It 
                        didn't sound small... it could have 
                        been a person.

           Donny nods slowly.

                                 DONNY
                        Right.

           Paul rises from his chair.

                                 PAUL
                        Don't let it get to you. That's 
                        exactly what whoever did this 
                        wants.

           Paul moves to the door. He grabs his coat from the back of a 
           chair and begins putting it on.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Hopefully this will all just blow 
                        over.

           Donny nods again as he moves to follow Paul out the door.

                                 DONNY
                        Right.

           INT. GROCERY AISLE -- DAY

           Paul stands in narrow grocery aisle. He stares at a wall of 
           cereal. A box of grain cereal rests on one shelf. A colorful 
           box of marshmallow fruit cereal sits on the shelf directly 
           below it.

           Paul frowns before grabbing the grain cereal and tossing it 
           into his shopping cart.

           PASTOR LAWRENCE MOORE rounds the corner into the aisle just 
           as Paul nears the same corner. Seeing the approaching 
           conversation, Paul stiffens uncomfortably.

                                 PASTOR
                        Paul! How are you doing this 
                        morning?

           Paul speaks in minimal detail. Nothing to further the 
           conversation. 
                                 PAUL
                        Pastor Moore. Just fine, yourself?

           The Pastor nods while perusing the cereal selection.

                                 PASTOR
                        Quite a little mystery we seem to 
                        have woken up to.

                                 PAUL
                        Nothing mysterious about a good 
                        prank.

           The Pastor smiles before changing the subject.

                                 PASTOR
                        Haven’t seen you in church in a few 
                        weeks.

           There it is. Paul tightens. The Pastor takes a beat. 

                                 PASTOR (CONT'D)
                        There’s no weakness in mourning, 
                        Paul.

           Beat. The Pastor lets the words hang in the air. 

                                 PASTOR (CONT'D)
                        I just want you to know that 
                        turning to someone bigger than 
                        yourself doesn’t show weakness... 
                        it shows wisdom in knowing where to 
                        find strength... and we’re here in 
                        case you need us. 

           Paul nods.

                                 PAUL
                        ...until then?

           The Pastor gestures toward the front of the store.

                                 PASTOR 
                        People seem a little nervous right 
                        now. But they’ll follow you to the 
                        ends of the earth if you ask ‘em 
                        to. Just let ‘em know you’re 
                        leading them in the right 
                        direction. 

           INT. GROCERY AISLE -- DAY

           Paul steps up to one of three cash registers in the small 
           town grocery store. He begins unloading his items onto the 
           black conveyer belt.
           ETHEL LERNER, a short round woman, joins the line behind 
           Paul. She nervously watches him.

           Paul looks from her to the young female CASHIER in front of 
           him. She too looks uneasy as she slowly picks up one of 
           Paul's items.

           As Paul glances around the checkout area. Four or five more 
           customers all look to Paul expectantly.

                                 PAUL
                        Is everyone alright?

           Ethel speaks with a raspy Southern accent.

                                 ETHEL
                        What's going on Sheriff?

           Paul smiles as he scans the people with his eyes.

                                 PAUL
                        We're trying to figure that out, 
                        Ethel...

                                 ETHEL
                        Well, what are we supposed to do 
                        till then? What are we supposed to 
                        think?

                                 PAUL
                        You don't have to do anything. 
                        We're working on it.

           Paul turns back to the cashier.

                                 CASHIER
                        What if it comes back?

           Paul looks surprised at her sudden input.

                                 CASHIER (CONT'D)
                        Whatever left those tracks. What if 
                        it comes back?

           Paul smiles at her before talking to the group.

                                 PAUL
                        Alright, I think everyone just 
                        needs to take a breath. The Forest 
                        Department tells me there is no 
                        animal that leaves tracks like the 
                        ones we found in our yards this 
                        morning. There isn't an animal that 
                        walks on two hoofed feet.

           Beat.
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Which means we're probably just 
                        dealing with a creative prankster 
                        with too much time on his hands.

           The crowd visibly calms a bit. Pastor Moore steps into the 
           back of the line as Paul speaks. He listens from afar.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I'm not saying you shouldn't be 
                        careful. Lock up your doors tonight 
                        if you want to... But let's not 
                        overreact. There's no reason to be 
                        scared.

           He smiles. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Let's not make this any more fun 
                        for whoever did this than it 
                        already is, okay?

           The shoppers slowly go back to their transactions as the 
           Cashier rings in Paul's items. 

           EXT. GROCERY PARKING LOT -- DAY

           The sun is out. Icicles hang from the roof of the small 
           shopping center. Paul carries his groceries through the 
           parking lot. Piles of plowed snow lie along the curbs.

           Paul unlocks the door to his white squad car. He puts his car 
           keys in his teeth while opening the rear door. He tosses the 
           grocery bags into the back seat.

           As Paul has his head inside the car, a large early model red 
           pickup truck pulls up behind him. EARL LERNER, a middle aged 
           man wearing a camouflaged hat, hangs his head out the driver 
           side window.

           Paul backs his head out the car and turns to Earl.

                                 EARL
                        How's it goin' there Sheriff?

                                 PAUL
                        Hey Earl. It's going alright. I 
                        just saw Ethel there in the store.

                                 EARL
                        Yeah, she's all riled up over these 
                        hoofprints. They got her a little 
                        scared.

           Earl looks at the store, then back to Paul.
                                 EARL (CONT'D)
                        That's why I pulled over here 
                        actually.

           Paul shuts the rear door. He pays attention to Earl's serious 
           tone.

                                 PAUL
                        What's on your mind Earl?

                                 EARL
                        You haven't figured it out yet have 
                        ya?

                                 PAUL
                        Not yet.

                                 EARL
                        You been out in the woods recently, 
                        into the trees?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. Donny and I went out pretty 
                        deep this morning.  We-

           He thinks better of it.  No details.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Is there something going on?

                                 EARL
                        I bet you didn't see a single 
                        animal, did you? Not a bird. 
                        Nothin'.

           Paul thinks back for a moment. Earl's right.

                                 PAUL
                        It is still winter, Earl. Birds 
                        migrate. Animals hibernate...

                                 EARL
                        I'm a hunter, Sheriff.  You know 
                        that. Been one all my life.

           Paul nods softly.

                                 EARL (CONT'D)
                        It's deer season and for the last 
                        two weeks I haven't seen so much as 
                        one deer within five miles of this 
                        town. Not even a single tree 
                        squirrel. I ain't never seen 
                        anything like it.

           Paul looks to the tree line that always seems to be near.
                                 EARL (CONT'D)
                        I wouldn't have even brought it up.  
                        But with these tracks and 
                        everything, I thought you might 
                        wanna know...

                                 PAUL
                        What would cause something like 
                        that? There being no animals?

                                 EARL
                        Hard to say, but animals can sense 
                        things, Sheriff. When they sense a 
                        threat, they normally don't hang 
                        around.

                                 PAUL
                        A threat? So you think an animal 
                        left those tracks?

                                 EARL
                        They don't look like any animal 
                        tracks I ever saw... but like I 
                        said, with all that's goin' on, I 
                        thought you might wanna know...

           Paul nods thoughtfully.

                                 EARL (CONT'D)
                        Take it easy sheriff. We're all 
                        still prayin' for ya...

           Paul forces a pained smile and nods.

           Earl's big red truck pulls away leaving Paul standing next to 
           his squad car. Paul again looks to the woods. The trees seem 
           to swallow the light into their darkness.

           EXT. SUSAN'S DRIVEWAY -- DUSK

           The evening breeze blows across the snow covered driveway.

           Adam rolls two basketball sized ball of snow to the base of 
           an incomplete snowman. His gloved hands pack snow onto the 
           ball.

           Paul and Susan sit on a picnic table, watching Adam play.

                                 SUSAN
                        Adam says the kids at school are 
                        saying it's the devil.

                                 PAUL
                        Did they scare him?
                                 SUSAN
                        No. He's smarter than that.

           Paul nods as he looks back to Adam on the driveway.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        It's been six months Paul. You said 
                        you needed some time and I 
                        understood that. You said you 
                        needed space and I gave you space. 
                        I didn't understand it, but I gave 
                        it to you...

           Paul stares ahead. His jaw tightens.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        But I need to know where you are. 
                        If... if you're closer or farther 
                        away. Because it's not fair. It's 
                        not fair to us and it's not fair to 
                        Adam.

           Beat. Paul continues to stares ahead into space.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        Where are you, Paul?

           He thinks before turning to her.

                                 PAUL
                        I have no idea.

                                 SUSAN
                        Do you even care?

                                 PAUL
                        Does it matter?

           Susan grimaces slightly. She looks at Adam as she speaks.

                                 SUSAN
                        He looks up to you more than you 
                        know.

           Paul looks to the ground. He immediately looks uncomfortable.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        Do you know what he sees when he 
                        looks at you?  His daddy, who 
                        protects people. Who makes them 
                        feel safe... The same man I still 
                        see... even if you don't.

           Paul's mouth hangs open but no words come out.
                                 ADAM
                        Dad, it’s too heavy.

           Adam struggles to lift the large snowball from the ground. 

                                 PAUL
                        Just a second, buddy.

           Adam strains to lift the snowball. His gloved hands slip, 
           causing him to tumble over the ball and into the snow. 

           The tension breaks as Paul and Susan both smile at Adam, who 
           laughs from within the snow bank. Susan turns back to Paul. 
           She looks in his eyes for a moment.

                                 SUSAN
                        I'll get his stuff.

           She rises from the bench.

           EXT. PAUL'S DRIVEWAY -- EVENING

           Paul's squad car pulls into the small concrete driveway. As 
           the car swings toward the garage, its headlights illuminate 
           the dark expanse of trees behind the house.

           INT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           Paul sits behind the wheel. Adam reads a colorful comic book 
           in the passenger seat. 

           As Paul gazes through the windshield, the headlight beams 
           cross the tree line. The lights reflect of off trees and 
           bushes, and...something else.

           Paul jerks the car to a stop. The lights land on a small area 
           of the tree line. Behind a thicket of thin trees there is a 
           large dark shape. Not a tree. Almost human, with an awkwardly 
           slouched posture. Five feet tall, maybe six.

           Paul stares at the shape through the fogging windshield.

                                 ADAM
                        What are we doing?

           The dark brown shape seems to remain still as the surrounding 
           trees sway in the breeze.

           It moves. Very slightly. Like a person shifting weight from 
           one foot to the other.

                                 PAUL
                        Do you see that?

           Adam now sits completely upright in his seat. His widened 
           eyes focus on the shape. He barely nods.
           The shape turns and steps behind a thin grey tree.  Its 
           movement is smooth and sudden as its form disappears into the 
           darkened woods.

           Paul's eyes widen and he quickly unbuckles his seat belt. 
           Adam presses into his seat in fear.

           EXT. PAUL'S DRIVEWAY -- EVENING

           Paul flings open the driver side door of his car. He 
           scrambles out of the vehicle, attempting to keep his footing.

                                 PAUL
                        Stay in the car and lock your door!

           He slams the driver side door shut and bolts toward the 
           woods. Paul unclips his holster and pulls his gun as he runs 
           toward the trees.

           The headlights lights illuminate the trees as Paul draws 
           near. His shadow makes the trees seem alive with movement.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (yelling)
                        You! In the trees! Stop!

           Paul ducks headlong into the trees.

           EXT. WOODS -- CONTINUOUS

           Paul bounds into the woods. Darkness and stillness surround 
           him. He stops, breathing heavy. His breath clouds the air. 

           A disturbing calm floats through the trees.

           SNAP. Branches break in the nearby trees. Paul instantly 
           bolts toward the sound.

                                 PAUL
                        Laytonsville Sheriff's Department! 
                        Stop where you are!

           Paul stumbles his way through near darkness. Fear courses 
           through his veins. 

           He stops again, frantically searching the surrounding 
           darkness.

           He slows his breathing. Listens.

           CREAKING. The branches high above GROAN under their own 
           weight, interrupting the absolute silence of the woods.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        This is Sheriff Paul Shields.
           Silence.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        You need to come out right now. 
                        Before you get yourself into any 
                        more trouble. I can take a joke... 
                        You just need to come out now.

           No answer. 

           Paul slowly lowers his gun and sighs. He turns back to the 
           house and his now distant headlights.

           MOVEMENT. From above. Something large in the top of the 
           trees. Large branches CRASH together.

           Paul spins toward the sound. His pulse races. 

           CLAWING. The sound descends a distant tree. Like a knife 
           scratching across bark. It slowly lowers to the ground.  

           HOLLOW THUDS. Something hits the ground and begins to run. 
           The sound of breaking branches and fast heavy footsteps 
           disappears into the deep forest.

           Confusion covers Paul's face as his prey escapes him at a 
           speed and power he could never match.

           Paul slowly backs toward the yard before turning and walking.

           EXT. PAUL'S DRIVEWAY -- EVENING

           Paul moves through the back yard as he places his gun back in 
           his holster. The motion light on the rear of the house 
           triggers on.

           Paul rounds the back of the house. He sees the car and stops. 
           Panic covers his face. He dashes toward the vehicle.

           The door of the squad car hangs open. The seat passenger seat 
           is empty. Adam is gone.

                                 PAUL
                        Adam?!

           Paul spins wildly, lost in panic.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Adam?!

           He brings his hands to his forehead.

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        Dad?

           Paul frantically turns toward the sound of Adam's voice.
           Adam stands inside the house. He nervously peers out the 
           wooden door which leads into the kitchen.

           Emotion floods over Paul's face as he runs to Adam, who looks 
           surprised by his father's reaction. Paul kneels and wraps his 
           arms around Adam's small body, pulling him close.

           Paul closes his eyes in relief as he squeezes. Suddenly, 
           concern strikes him. He looks Adam over.

                                 PAUL
                        Are you ok?

                                 ADAM
                        I heard something outside the car 
                        and I got scared...

                                 PAUL
                        Are you hurt?

                                 ADAM
                        No.

           Tears seep from Paul’s eyes. Adam's more frightened by his 
           father's reaction than what occurred.

                                 PAUL
                        I'm so sorry!

           He holds Adam's face in his hands and stares him in the eyes.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I'm so sorry...Never again.  I'll 
                        never let anything happen to you, 
                        do you understand?

           Adam stares into his father's eyes. Confused. 

                                 ADAM
                           (weakly)
                        Okay...

           Huddled against the wooden kitchen door Paul holds onto Adam 
           with all his might. The room is dark, lit only by a small 
           light over the kitchen sink. The sound of a small ticking 
           wall clock fills the otherwise silent room.

           Outside the kitchen window the ever present woods stand. 
           Motionless. The blue moonlight casts a glow upon the 
           colorless branches that hide what lies in the darkness just 
           beyond.

           INT. LAW OFFICE -- DAY

           ROGER LANKINS, a well groomed man in a black suit sits behind 
           a dark stained wood desk.
           The walls of the office are covered in matching wood 
           paneling.

           Roger holds a stack of bound papers in his hand. He surveys 
           them one last time before opening the stack and facing it 
           toward the front of the desk.

                                 ROGER
                        We just need to get both of your 
                        signatures here. We don't have to 
                        have both. But it certainly helps 
                        to make things go smoother.

           He points with his finger toward the bottom of a page.

                                 ROGER (CONT'D)
                        After that we can negotiate 
                        property. The house, cars, that 
                        sort of thing.

                                 PAUL
                        I don't want any of it.

           Paul sits in front of the large desk in one of two brown 
           leather chairs. He wears an olive green sheriff issue 
           windbreaker. His face rests in his hand as he leans against 
           the back of the chair.

           His attorney stares back at him for a moment. He speaks with 
           concern.

                                 ROGER
                        You know, Paul. I'm not a marriage 
                        counselor. In fact, I couldn't be 
                        any less of one. But I do remember 
                        something from high school...

           Paul stares at Roger with no emotion as he speaks.

                                 ROGER (CONT'D)
                        I had a friend who fell in love 
                        with a girl. They were perfect 
                        together. They said they were gonna 
                        get married.  And as angry as it 
                        made her father, they did. Right 
                        out of high school.

           Paul swallows hard as he listens.

                                 ROGER (CONT'D)
                        They were happy for a long time. 
                        It's like they were made for each 
                        other... Then something really bad 
                        happened. An accident.

           Paul breaks.
                                 PAUL
                        Roger...

                                 ROGER
                        Then something even worse happened. 
                        My friend blamed himself. But there 
                        was nothing he could do... not a 
                        thing. Then I got a call I never 
                        wanted to get... and I'm doing 
                        something I never wanted to do. Not 
                        for him.

                                 PAUL
                        Roger.

           Roger doesn't stop.

                                 ROGER
                        And I could tell him that it wasn't 
                        his fault. That this world isn't 
                        fair to the best of us.  That it 
                        tries to take away that strength 
                        that makes us feel right. It tries 
                        to make us lose trust in 
                        ourselves...

                                 PAUL
                        Roger, I know you're trying to 
                        help...

                                 ROGER
                        But you don't want to hear it. I 
                        know that. That's why I came in on 
                        a weekend and drew up the papers.

           Roger closes the stack of papers, places them into a green 
           folder and slides them across the desk. Paul stares at them 
           for a moment before finally lifting them off the wood.

           Paul stands and pauses.

                                 PAUL
                        You said you know me.

           No answer. Pain shines in Paul’s eyes. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        But you weren't there, were you?

           Roger doesn’t know what to say. He looks helplessly after 
           Paul, who turns and moves to the door. Paul pauses in the 
           door frame, slightly lifting the papers.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (re: papers)
                        Thanks Roger.
           Paul leaves the office and shuts the door behind him. Roger 
           Lankins sits in silence as the door latches.

           EXT. MRS. BARRET'S YARD -- DAY

           Donny stands precariously on the top of a aluminum extendable 
           ladder. It rest against the roof of a small grey stoned 
           house.

           Donny wobbles unsteadily as he peers onto the roof.

                                 MRS. BARRET
                        Can I offer you some hot cocoa?

           MRS. BARRET, a fragile old woman with wispy grey hair stands 
           at the foot of the ladder. She stands with a cane but has the 
           eyes of a young woman. She holds a grey cat in one arm.

                                 DONNY
                        No, thank you. I don't...I don't 
                        see a ball Mrs. Barret.

                                 MRS. BARRET
                        What's that?

           Donny looks down her and almost loses his balance again.

                                 DONNY
                        The ball you said the kids threw up 
                        here... I, uh, I don't see a ball.

           Mrs. Barret raises her eyebrows in overly dramatic surprise.

                                 MRS. BARRET
                        Oh! Well, I must have been 
                        mistaken.

           Donny clutches to the gutter for dear life.

                                 DONNY
                        Ok! I'm not too jolly on heights. 
                        So, I'm comin' down.

           Donny quickly, but carefully, descends the ladder.

                                 MRS. BARRET
                        I'm so sorry. I could have sworn I 
                        saw those boys throw a ball up 
                        there.

           Donny looks relieved just be alive.

                                 DONNY
                        That's okay. No big deal. Should I 
                        take the ladder back to the garage?
                                 MRS. BARRET
                        No, that's alright. I have a boy 
                        who shovels the walk. He can get it 
                        for me.

           Donny nods.

                                 DONNY
                        Sure.

                                 MRS. BARRET
                        So I hear you’re new to 
                        Laytonsville...

                                 DONNY
                        Yes ma'am. That's right.

                                 MRS. BARRET
                        And how are you liking it?

                                 DONNY
                        It's a little different than I'm 
                        used to. But it's definitely a good 
                        kinda different.

                                 MRS. BARRET
                        Yes, it certainly has character.

           Beat. She sets down the grey cat.

                                 MRS. BARRET (CONT'D)
                        Have they told you about these 
                        woods, yet? The history of this 
                        place?

                                 DONNY
                        These woods?

           The old woman smiles knowingly.

                                 MRS. BARRET
                        I didn't think so. Not exactly 
                        something you put in the brochure, 
                        I suppose.

           Donny looks intrigued.

                                 MRS. BARRET (CONT'D)
                        The Indians had a story about this 
                        place, you know? These woods, and 
                        about what lived in them.

           Donny listens.
                                 MRS. BARRET (CONT'D)
                        Before the white men came, they say 
                        the Indians lived in peace with a 
                        creature that roamed the trees.

           A soft wind blows through the ever present tree line. 
           Branches seem to come alive as they sway gently.

                                 MRS. BARRET (CONT'D)
                        But when the Europeans came... they 
                        didn't respect the creature or its 
                        significance. They didn't 
                        understand this place like the 
                        natives. Until one night it came 
                        for them. It took entire families. 
                        Men, women and children.

           Donny grimaces.

                                 MRS. BARRET (CONT'D)
                        They later said it was a bear 
                        attack. But what else could you 
                        say?

                                 DONNY
                        Were there any witnesses?

           He realizes how he sounds.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        In the story, I mean...

                                 MRS. BARRET
                        Oh sure, neighbors who woke up to 
                        the screaming or family members who 
                        were lucky enough to find place to 
                        hide.

           Donny nods slowly. He listens intently.

                                 MRS. BARRET (CONT'D)
                        Since then there’ve been stories of 
                        witches in these woods, spirits in 
                        the darkness. Stories of people 
                        vanishing...What some people called 
                        the wood devil, a creature that can 
                        simply disappear into the side of a 
                        tree trunk...

           Donny nervously glances to the nearby tree line.

                                 MRS. BARRET (CONT'D)
                        But the Indians called it "the 
                        Windago."  Of course, most people 
                        around here don't believe those old 
                        stories...
           Donny looks unnerved.

                                 DONNY
                        Do you?...Believe the stories?

           Mrs. Barret looks at the sky thoughtfully.

                                 MRS. BARRET
                        When I was a little girl... a 
                        schoolmate of mine went missing. 
                        They said he'd been hiking alone 
                        out there. They searched for 
                        days... Until one morning they 
                        found him... his body was in a tree 
                        some thirty feet off the ground. 
                        They said it was the witch. Do I 
                        believe it?  I believe it enough to 
                        stay out of those woods... And 
                        after those hoofprints, I believe 
                        it enough to be locking my doors... 
                        I'd be careful Deputy Saunders. 
                        Wouldn't want to see you up in some 
                        tree, especially since you aren't 
                        too jolly on heights.

           Donny's face tightens. The old woman smiles politely.

                                 MRS. BARRET (CONT'D)
                        Are you sure I can't interest you 
                        in any hot cocoa?

           INT. SQUAD CAR -- DAY

           Paul drives down the two lane highway leading into 
           Laytonsville. The divorce papers lie in a green envelope on 
           the seat beside him. 

           Just beyond the “Welcome to Laytonsville, Maryland” sign sits 
           the Laytonsville Methodist Church, an old, grey stone 
           building with two large red double doors and a black roof. 

           As Paul nears the church, the large doors open and church 
           members begins trickling out their morning service.

           Paul slows the car to a stop and watches from a safe 
           distance. 

           His jaw tightens as he watches the people of Laytonsville 
           spill onto the sidewalk. They laugh and talk as a community. 
           Paul sits alone in his car.

           Donny, part of the congregation, spots Paul. He waves as he 
           walks to the car. Paul rolls down his window.

                                 DONNY 
                        So how was Baltimore?
                                 PAUL
                        It was fine. Just took care of some 
                        business...

           Donny reaches the car and leans against it.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        ...with the state. Dropped off some 
                        paperwork for the state.

                                 DONNY
                        I need to talk to you actually.

           Paul looks guilty.

                                 PAUL
                        I was seeing my attorney.

                                 DONNY
                        What?

                                 PAUL
                        I lied. I wasn't doing paperwork 
                        for the state. I was visiting my 
                        attorney.

           Beat. They look at one another. An awkward silence hangs in 
           the air.

                                 DONNY
                        You gonna tell me any more?

                                 PAUL
                        No.

                                 DONNY
                        Alright.

                                 PAUL
                        I'm sorry I lied.

           Donny takes notice to Paul's odd behavior.

                                 DONNY
                        Don't worry about it.

           A odd sound slowly rises. Quiet at first. Growing louder. 
           Like a DISTANT WATERFALL. Donny hears it first. He turns to 
           the nearby woods that lie just beyond the church.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        Do you hear that?

           DISTANT FLUTTERING. AIR RUSHING. The sounds grow louder and 
           closer. More intense.
           Paul opens his door and slowly climbs from the car. Listening 
           and staring at the treetops as the sound approaches. 

           The churchgoers have frozen in place. A concerned hush 
           settles over them as they nervously stare toward the woods.

           BIRDS. Thousands upon thousands of birds burst into vision 
           over the top of the curtain of trees.

           The sound is nearly deafening as the birds fill the sky.

           They fly out of the woods, crossing directly over the small 
           church.

           The children and parents stare in awe as the cloud of birds 
           crosses overhead.

                                 PAUL
                        What is going on around here?

           The cloud of birds nearly blot out the sun then, just as 
           suddenly as they appeared, the flow of black birds ceases. A 
           few straggle behind.

           EXT. MAIN STREET -- CONTINUOUS

           The tremendous flock makes it way over the town of 
           Laytonsville. Its numbers too high to count.

           People stop on the sidewalks and stare at the migrating 
           animals. Drivers pull over to watch through their 
           windshields.

           Not one bird lands.

           INT. DINER -- DAY

           Paul and Donny sit at a small table against the wall of a 
           cramped, outdated diner. One frazzled waitress works the 
           entire restaurant, weaving around tables and patrons.

           Two sandwiches sit in front of Donny and Paul. Paul takes a 
           drink from a coffee mug as Donny loads pack after pack of 
           sugar into his.

                                 DONNY
                        I've never seen anything like 
                        that...

           Paul shakes his head. Neither has he.

                                 PAUL
                        Earl Lerner came up to me the other 
                        day.

           He sets down his coffee mug.
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        He hunts around here.

           Donny nods.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        He says he's noticed something odd 
                        the last few weeks.

                                 DONNY
                        Tell Earl to join the club, huh?

                                 PAUL
                        He says the wildlife's gone. The 
                        deer, the squirrels, the birds.

                                 DONNY
                        Well I think the birds are back.

           Paul shakes his head.

                                 PAUL
                        I don't think so. They weren't 
                        coming back. They were leaving... 
                        It's closer to spring than fall, 
                        birds should be flying North. Those 
                        birds were flying South.

           Donny looks confused.

                                 DONNY
                        What would make them do that?

                                 PAUL
                        Earl said animals sometimes leave 
                        an area if they sense a threat. 
                        Maybe a new predator they aren't 
                        willing to risk being around.

                                 DONNY
                        Maybe those birds know something we 
                        don't.

                                 PAUL
                        Maybe.

                                 DONNY
                        I, uh, I was over at Mrs. Barret's 
                        place this afternoon. While you 
                        were in town.

           Beat.  Donny clears his throat.
                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        She uh, she mentioned some stories. 
                        Some theories about what might be 
                        goin' on...

           Paul knows where he is going.

                                 PAUL
                        Those are just stories, Donny. 
                        Ghost stories. It's make believe. 
                        They've been telling stories like 
                        that for years.

           Donny nods.

                                 DONNY
                        Right... but what if they're not. 
                        What if there is something wrong 
                        about these woods? What if 
                        something is out there?

                                 PAUL
                        What did she tell you?

           Donny looks embarrassed to mention it.

                                 DONNY
                        She said people think these woods 
                        are haunted. That the Indians knew 
                        about a creature.

                                 PAUL
                        You think there is a monster in the 
                        woods, Donny?

                                 DONNY
                        No! It’s just...

           He leans in and speaks in a hushed tone.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        It’s just that those stories she 
                        was telling me sounded a lot like 
                        what's been going on around here 
                        lately.  Noises in the trees. 
                        Freakin' hoofprints on the ground. 
                        People showin' up missin'... I 
                        don't know...

           Beat.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        She mentioned a little boy when she 
                        was growing up.  He was up hiking 
                        in the woods and went missing. They 
                        couldn't find him until-
                                 PAUL
                        -until they found the body in a 
                        tree.

           Donny nods.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        This area has a lot of history and 
                        a lot of folklore. And when all of 
                        that history isn't written down or 
                        some of it gets forgotten, people 
                        fill in the gaps.

           Donny listens intently.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        They make up stories. Stories about 
                        witches and devils and hauntings...

                                 DONNY
                        I just think it's worth thinking 
                        about. In the absence of any other 
                        ideas...

           He has a point.

                                 PAUL
                        I'll keep it in mind.

           Donny nods a "thank you".

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        That boy she mentioned?

                                 DONNY
                        Yeah.

                                 PAUL
                        When they found the body in the top 
                        of those trees... they only found 
                        the skin.

           Donny recoils.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        That little boy was murdered. No 
                        monsters needed.

           Paul looks to his plate.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Bad things happen because people 
                        let them happen, Donny. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        And when people let them happen, 
                        they try to blame it on things they 
                        can't explain. Witches, monsters, 
                        fate... Somebody is always 
                        responsible.

           Beat.  Donny softly nods.  He takes a drink of his coffee.

           INT. DELI COUNTER -- DAY

           Paul hands his ticket and a twenty dollar bill to the 
           waitress working the register.

           A man approaches. He wears a long sleeve denim shirt and 
           jeans, RON JENKINS.

                                 RON
                        Sheriff...

                                 PAUL
                        Ron, how's it going?

           Ron nods in response. Paul looks to Donny.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I don't know if you've had a chance 
                        to meet Donny Saunders. He's our 
                        new deputy.

                                 RON
                        First deputy we've ever had in 
                        Laytonsville. Ain't that right?

                                 PAUL
                        Town's growing.

                                 RON
                        Right.

           Donny wipes his hand on his shirt, then extends it to Ron. 
           They shake.

                                 PAUL
                        This is Ron, he breeds horses here 
                        in town.

                                 RON
                        The finest horses in the state of 
                        Maryland.

           Paul nods and smiles.

                                 RON (CONT'D)
                        That's actually the reason I 
                        tracked you down. Can I get you 
                        boys to look at something when you 
                        finish up here?
           Ron's polite smile has now changed to a look of concern. Paul 
           nods.

                                 PAUL
                        Sure.

           EXT. HORSE BARN -- DAY

           Ron rounds the corner of a wooden horse barn. Its wood has 
           greyed from exposure. Paul and Donny follow closely behind. 

           The small, stone church sits at the bottom of the hill, less 
           than a mile away. Paul catches himself eying the church 
           uneasily as he rounds the corner.

                                 RON
                        Past few days the horses have been 
                        real uneasy. Jumping around in the 
                        stalls like they's scared to 
                        death... they normally act that way 
                        before a big storm rolls in. But 
                        that don't last more than a few 
                        hours then they calm back down. I 
                        couldn't for the life of me figure 
                        it out... till last night.

           Beat. They continue walking.

                                 DONNY
                        What happened last night?

                                 RON
                        About 3 o'clock I woke up to the 
                        sound of something bangin' on the 
                        side of this horse barn. Just 
                        beating the livin' hell out of it. 
                        I heard it all the way from the 
                        house.

           He points to a two story farm house at the top of the hill. 
           Over a hundred yards away.

                                 PAUL
                        Did you see anyone out here Ron?

                                 RON
                        Well, once I figured out where the 
                        banging was coming from I ran out 
                        here. Fired a rifle into the air 
                        tryin' to run 'em off...

           The three men reach the large wooden sliding door to the 
           barn. They stop.
                                 RON (CONT'D)
                        This is what I found when I came 
                        down...

           Paul inspects the door as he steps closer.

           The large wooden door has been beaten severely. Several 
           boards have cracks and holes left behind. The door itself 
           hangs weakly off of its bent track.

           The sliding steel bolt, which latches the door closed, is 
           badly bent. It has been hit with enormous force, leaving the 
           wood surrounding the lock cracked and weakened.

           Paul runs his hands over the surface of the door. He slowly 
           turns to Ron who watches from a few feet away.

                                 PAUL
                        And this door wasn't like this?

           Ron shakes his head "No".

                                 RON
                        Then I noticed the mud.

           Paul and Donny look to the ground.

                                 RON (CONT'D)
                        The tracks.

           LARGE HOOFPRINTS cover the mud at the base of the door. They 
           appear around the corner and approach the door repeatedly.

                                 PAUL
                        Ron, this is a horse barn.

                                 RON
                        I shoed all the horses last week...  
                        and these tracks ain't got any 
                        shoes...

           Paul kneels to the tracks. Ron's right.

           He looks to the scarred structure as he slowly rises to his 
           feet. Donny sends him a look that says, "you still think I'm 
           crazy?"

           INT. SHIELD’S HOME - FOYER -- EVENING

           Keys can be heard in the lock of the Shield's large front 
           door. After a moment the dead bolt clicks and the door opens.

           Paul enters the foyer of his home, still wearing his green 
           jacket. He carries the green folder, containing the divorce 
           papers, under his arm. 
           The house is dark except for the light beaming in through the 
           rear windows. There is no sound within the home. It's 
           lifeless. Paul is all alone in every sense of the word.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM -- EVENING

           Paul doesn't bother to turn on the lights as he enters. 
           Noticing the flashing red light on the answering machine, he 
           moves across the room and presses the PLAY button.

                                 SUSAN (V.0.)
                        Hi Paul. It's me...

           Paul recognizes Susan's voice and cringes slightly. It hurts 
           to hear her voice.

                                 SUSAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I wanted to thank you for taking 
                        Adam last night, the council met 
                        late and... well, just, thank you.

           Paul moves to the queen sized bed as Susan's gentle voice 
           continues to fill the air. He sits.

                                 SUSAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Oh, and we have that teacher's 
                        conference tomorrow.

           She realizes how she sounds.

                                 SUSAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Sorry, I know you probably know 
                        that. Anyway, thank you for your 
                        help yesterday. I...I love you.

           Susan pauses, almost as if waiting for an answer.

                                 SUSAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Bye.

           The answering machine CLICKS, rewinding its tape.

           Paul stares ahead at the picture frame which rests on his 
           dresser. Paul, Susan, Timothy, and Adam all appear gathered 
           around one another, embracing. They smile as if nothing in 
           the world is wrong.

           Paul pulls the green legal folder from beneath his arm. He 
           stares at it for a moment. Standing from the bed, Paul lifts 
           the edge of the mattress just far enough to slide the folder 
           between it and the box springs.

           INT. SQUAD CAR -- DUSK

           Paul drives through town. The buildings reflect off his 
           windshield.
           Houses pass by Paul's windows. The white snow contrasts 
           against the darkening evening sky.

           He stares ahead with distant eyes. He drives in silence. The 
           weight of stress and frustration covers his face. 

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- EVENING

           Paul and Susan sit side by side in small plastic chairs. They 
           sit in front of a metal framed desk within a brightly lit 
           classroom. Poorly drawn artwork scatters a back wall. Small 
           individual desks fill the room in neatly aligned rows.

           MRS. POPLAR, a woman in her mid forties, sits behind the 
           desk. She wears a large collared black pantsuit.

           She stares at Paul and Susan, moving her eyes back and forth 
           between them disapprovingly. Both Paul and Susan sit in 
           silence, looking at her in expectant confusion.

                                 SUSAN
                        I'm still a little confused about 
                        why we're here...

                                 MRS. POPLAR
                        We are very conscious of our 
                        students' behavior when they are at 
                        school.

           Paul and Susan still lean forward, waiting.

                                 MRS. POPLAR (CONT'D)
                        Not just in the classroom, but in 
                        the hallways, during lunch and, in 
                        Adam's case, on the playground.

           Paul raises his eyebrows.

                                 PAUL
                        Adam did something on the 
                        playground?

           Mrs. Poplar continues on her small speech.

                                 MRS. POPLAR 
                        When children pick up a new word 
                        they tend to say it constantly. It 
                        only gets worse when they learn 
                        that we don't want them to say that 
                        word.

                                 SUSAN
                        Adam said something offensive?
           Mrs. Poplar straightens her back uncomfortably. Finally she 
           grabs a small square of paper and scribbles something on it. 
           She slides it across the desk.

           Paul lifts the small piece of paper -- he furrows his brow 
           like someone who knows they need to look upset.

           Mrs. Poplar looks as if she is offended by even being in the 
           room.

           Susan tries to read Paul's face as he hands her the paper. 
           She stifles a laugh. Paul sends her a panicked look that says 
           "Don't laugh.”

           Susan hides her mouth with her hand as she begins to silently 
           laugh. Seeing Susan breaking, Paul too begins to laugh under 
           his breath. His eyes water.

           Mrs. Poplar looks shocked.

                                 MRS. POPLAR
                        Mr. and Mrs. Shields.

           Susan looks up from the floor. She uncovers her mouth just 
           long enough to speak.

                                 SUSAN
                        "Fart"?

           Paul continues to snicker. He looks to Susan's eyes and 
           continues to laugh.

           Mrs. Poplar looks indignant.

                                 MRS. POPLAR
                        I assure you this is no laughing 
                        matter.

           Paul covers his smile with his hand.

                                 PAUL 
                        I'm sorry.

                                 SUSAN
                        We're very sorry.

                                 MRS. POPLAR
                        Adam accused Billy Long of 
                        "farting" on the playground on 
                        Tuesday, now all the children are 
                        saying it. We can't get them to 
                        stop.

           Paul immediate stifles another laugh.
                                 MRS. POPLAR (CONT'D)
                        But as I can see, apparently some 
                        people don't view this as quiet the 
                        serious matter that it is.

           Susan finally collects herself.

                                 SUSAN
                        We do. We do. It's just... we'll 
                        talk to him. We apologize, it won't 
                        happen again.

           Mrs. Poplar nods is skeptical satisfaction as she looks to a 
           piece of paper on her desk.

                                 MRS. POPLAR
                        There is one other thing. And I 
                        understand if you don't wish to 
                        discuss it...

                                 PAUL
                        What is that?

                                 MRS. POPLAR
                        Did Adam receive any counseling 
                        after what happened last summer?  
                        With his brother’s drowning?

           Beat. The air deflates from the room. Paul and Susan sit 
           still. No more laughs.

                                 SUSAN
                        He did.

                                 PAUL
                        Why?

                                 MRS. POPLAR
                        It's just that when he refers to 
                        Timothy... he always seems to use 
                        present tense.  "Timothy is...", 
                        "Timothy can..." I wasn't sure if 
                        you were aware of that. I thought 
                        if not, I'd bring it to your 
                        attention.

           Susan tries to hold back her protective anger.

                                 SUSAN
                        Is there something wrong with that?

                                 MRS. POPLAR
                        Well, it just seems unhealthy... To 
                        be referring to someone who is 
                        deceased in such a way.
                                 PAUL
                        I don't see how that's a problem.

                                 SUSAN
                        Or how that's your business.

                                 MRS. POPLAR
                        I know that you two have become 
                        separated, and more times than not 
                        it is the children that get 
                        neglected...

                                 SUSAN
                        Timothy is his brother! And my 
                        child can refer to his brother 
                        however the hell he likes!

                                 MRS. POPLAR
                        I beg your pardon!

                                 SUSAN
                        And don't you tell us how to raise 
                        our child! Do you understand me?

                                 MRS. POPLAR
                        Mrs. Shields, I assure you that-

                                 SUSAN
                        Do you understand me?!

           A tear runs down Susan's face as her eyes burn a hole into 
           Mrs. Poplar. 

           Mrs. Poplar breathes in deeply through her nose. She nods.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY -- EVENING

           Paul and Susan emerge from the classroom doorway into a 
           darkened hallway. Light comes from the windows at either end 
           of the hall. A custodian pushes a wide cloth broom.

           Susan immediately breaks down. She turns and buries her head 
           on Paul's shoulder.

           He stands rigidly, giving nothing back. Distant. No emotion. 

           Susan lifts her head from Paul’s shoulder and looks into his 
           eyes. He stares back with a cold fear. Closed off. 

           Susan nods softly to herself as she turns and walks away. 
           Paul stands alone in his self-made isolation.
           EXT. TREE LINE -- DUSK

           The glowing orange sun slowly descends in the evening sky.  
           It dips behind the dark curtain of trees towering high above 
           the ground. Darkness swallows the town of Laytonsville.

           INT. LIBRARY -- NIGHT

           Paul approaches the librarian, NORA TAYLOR, 50s, who sits 
           behind the only desk in the small, cramped town library. She 
           smiles warmly as he approaches.

                                 NORA
                        Sheriff Shields! How’s that copy of  
                        The Talisman treating you?

           Paul smiles.

                                 PAUL
                        Had to set it down. Reality is 
                        strange enough on its own these 
                        days. You mind if I take a look at 
                        the town record microfilm? Some 
                        research.

                                 NORA
                        Burnin’ the midnight oil, huh?

           She smiles and places some keys on the desk.

                                 NORA (CONT'D)
                        Just lock up when your done.

           INT. MICROFILM ROOM -- NIGHT

           Paul sits before a glowing microfilm machine inside the 
           darkened room. A small desk lamp and the glow from the 
           projected screen are all that light the room.

           He turns the controls as the machine WHIRLS to life. Black 
           and white documents blur across the screen. Paul slows the 
           machine to a stop.

           A page of text appears on the screen. “LAYTONSVILLE DEATH 
           RECORD: 1800-1820.” Paul scans through the information. 

           His gaze lands on several key phrases:

           "...DISAPPEARANCES IN THE SPRING OF 1814"

           "...DRAGGED FROM THEIR HOMES"

           "...BODIES WERE NEVER FOUND"

           "...FAMILIES NEVER SEEN AGAIN"
           Paul hastily flips open a large book on the desk beside him. 
           The top of the page reads "FOLKLORE IN SOUTHWESTERN 
           MARYLAND".

           He traces his finger down the text until it lands on: “1814 - 
           LAYTONSVILLE, MARYLAND.”

           The last paragraph on the page draws him in.

           "...TRACKS FOUND AT THE EDGE OF TOWN."

           "...LARGE TWO LEGGED HOOFPRINTS."

           Paul swallows hard. His wall of disbelief begins to crumble. 

           "...SIMILAR TO A HORSE OR DONKEY..."

           "...TWO LEGS..."

           "INDIAN LEGEND OF THE MURDEROUS WINDAGO"

           Paul stares at the book in the light of the glowing 
           microfilm. The word "WINDAGO" stares back at him.

           Paul reaches into his chest pocket and removes a photograph 
           of two of the hoofprints in the snow, taken by Donny days 
           before. Paul’s eyes dance. Could it be?

           He rubs his eyes before gathering a handful of papers 
           together and standing.

           The small desk lamp still illuminates the room as he powers 
           down the microfilm machine and leaves.

           INT. SQUAD CAR -- NIGHT

           The green glow of the indicator lights on the dash highlight 
           Paul’s face as he drives in silence.

           Through the side windows all is black. Through the windshield 
           the headlights can be seen cutting the darkness of the two 
           lane highway.

           Trees line the road on either side, straying no more than ten 
           feet from the edge of the pavement. They streak past a silver 
           blurs to Paul’s eyes.

           As Paul stares through the windshield and into the night, 
           something becomes visible. A large mound lies in the middle 
           of the road.

           Paul brings the car to a crawl as he draws closer. The 
           cruiser's headlights shine on the object. A DEAD DEER. Its 
           brown fur twinges in the wind.

           Paul lifts his walkie-talkie from the passenger seat.
                                 PAUL
                           (into radio)
                        Donny, do you still have your radio 
                        on?

           A moment of silence before his walkie-talkie squawks.

                                 DONNY
                           (over radio)
                        Yeah, boss.

                                 PAUL
                           (into radio)
                        I'm clearing a deer from the 
                        highway. We're going to have to 
                        pick it up tomorrow some time.

                                 DONNY
                           (over radio)
                        Maybe it died of loneliness...

           Paul stares ahead.

                                 PAUL
                           (into radio)
                        Maybe.

           Paul sighs heavily before opening his door and climbing out.

           EXT. ISOLATED HIGHWAY -- NIGHT

           The dead deer's fur shines in the bright directional light of 
           the car's headlights as Paul slowly approaches.  He carries a 
           large metal Maglight.

           Nearing the fallen deer, Paul slows. Something isn't right. 
           As the far side of the deer comes into view, a large amount 
           of blood is visible.

           The deer's underside has been gashed open with razor sharp 
           cuts. Inside portions of the animal spill onto the pavement. 
           Its neck and legs lie broken and disjointed.

                                 PAUL
                        Donny?

           Paul looks down at the animal in shocked disgust, shining his 
           flashlight over its body. The deer’s lifeless, black eye 
           stares back at Paul from the cold pavement.

                                 DONNY
                           (over radio)
                        Yeah, boss?

           MOVEMENT. In the trees. In the darkness.
           Paul turns toward the sea of black that surrounds him. He 
           raises his flashlight, aiming it toward the tree line nearest 
           to his car door.

                                 PAUL
                           (whispering)
                        Donny, I think there's something in 
                        the trees...

           Paul shields his eyes from the overpowering headlights that 
           blind him to what lies in the darkness. He can see nothing.

                                 DONNY
                           (over radio)
                        What's that?

           Paul slowly lowers his radio from his mouth. He CLICKS it 
           off. He takes a cautious step toward the trees.

           TWIGS SNAP.  From the other side of the road.  The sounds are 
           all around him.  It's fast.  Paul freezes mid-breath.

           He stares into the trees.  Darkness covers all but the first 
           layer of branches.  The hallow blackness CREAKS in the 
           silence.

           Without warning a RUSH OF MOVEMENT cuts through branches, 
           leaves, and brush. The sound bursts from the woods toward the 
           road. Toward Paul.

           Paul's eyes widen in fear as he hears the sound grow closer. 
           He frantically shines his light toward the noise.

           The sound of breaking twigs ceases as the SOUND OF CLOPS on 
           the cement fill the air. Hooves.

           The hooves run across the cold paved road. Paul spins toward 
           the sound, staggering backward in shock. 

           A THIN DARK FIGURE slices through the blinding headlights, 
           casting a passing shadow across Paul.

           The figure is silhouetted against the lights. It is almost 
           impossible to see. It has two thin legs. They move lightning 
           fast and with a graceful stride. Each step creates the 
           pounding impact of hoof against concrete.

           It crosses to the other side of the road. The sounds of its 
           movement enters the woods. Then stops. It didn't go deep. 
           It's watching...

           Paul stands frozen. He swallows hard. He doesn't blink. He 
           barely breathes.
           Slowly he begins to take cautious steps toward the car. No 
           sudden movements. His eyes remained locked on the trees. Only 
           darkness stares back at him.

           INT. CAR -- NIGHT

           Approaching the driver side door, Paul eases it open. He 
           quickly slides into the seat, slamming the car door shut.

           Paul lifts a walkie-talkie from the seat and brings it to his 
           mouth. Before he can press the button to speak, he looks out 
           the windshield and freezes. His jaw hangs.

           The deer is gone. A splattered pool of blood is all that 
           remains where the animals once lay. No blood trail. No 
           explanation. The dead animal simply disappeared.

           Paul leans forward. His eyes dance, confused. He presses his 
           forehead against the windshield, looking skyward out of the 
           car. Bare tree tops stand motionless. The star filled night 
           sky peeks through in small gaps.

           Paul falls back in his seat. Whatever it was, it's gone now.

           EXT. DONNY'S DOORSTEP -- NIGHT

           Donny opens the front door to his apartment.  From inside, he 
           stares straight ahead, confusion covers his face.

           Paul stands before him in the cold night air.

                                 DONNY
                        Hey.

           Paul looks at the ground distantly before looking up.

                                 PAUL
                        Hi...

                                 DONNY
                        Did you take care of that deer?

           Paul slowly shakes his head "No".

           INT. DONNY'S DEN -- NIGHT

           Paul sits on a outdated brown chair in the center of Donny's 
           apartment. The place is small and poorly decorated. The 
           nicest piece of furniture is the medium sized TV.

           Donny leans against a doorway.

                                 PAUL
                        I think we're thinking about this 
                        the wrong way...
                                 DONNY
                        Okay.

                                 PAUL
                        Are all the animals locked up?

           Donny nods.

                                 DONNY
                        Yeah.

                                 PAUL
                        You talked to Tom Peterson? His 
                        cattle are inside?

                                 DONNY
                        He said something about us being 
                        incompetent, but yeah, he only has 
                        a handful right now. I checked. 
                        Every horse and livestock in the 
                        area is locked away. What's going 
                        on?

           Paul stares distantly at a spot on the floor.

                                 PAUL
                        I think that deer was old... All 
                        the other deer are gone. But this 
                        one wasn't. 

           He convinces himself as he continues to talk.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        It looked older. Maybe it couldn't 
                        keep up.  Maybe they all left it 
                        behind... If that's the case. And 
                        all the livestock are locked away, 
                        it should be out of food.

                                 DONNY
                        What should be out of food?

           Paul finally looks to Donny.

                                 PAUL
                        Tom Peterson's missing cow. We 
                        thought he’d left the fence open. 
                        That may not be right... I looked 
                        into some of what you heard from 
                        Mrs. Barret.

           Donny squints, interested.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I'm not saying it's all accurate. 
                        But maybe there is something to it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Maybe there is something going on 
                        that can't be easily explained...

                                 DONNY
                        I think you're right. And I've been 
                        doing some thinkin' about this.

           Donny eagerly sits down across from Paul.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        A few years ago, I heard on TV that 
                        they caught some giant fish off the 
                        coast of Taiwan, or somewhere. 
                        Thing was as ugly as sin.

           Paul isn't seeing the connection.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        The point is, they thought this 
                        fish had been extinct for millions 
                        of years. It was supposed to be 
                        prehistoric. But, BAM! There one 
                        is, right under our noses the whole 
                        time. What if what we've got here 
                        is somethin' just like that?

           Paul slowly nods.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        Maybe the Indians were smarter than 
                        us or maybe there were just more 
                        back then. But what if this thing 
                        we're after has been here all along 
                        and we're just now findin' out 
                        about it?

           Paul listens intently.

                                 PAUL
                        So why would it show up now?

                                 DONNY
                        They said that fish came up because 
                        of its food supply moved.  
                        Migrated... Maybe it's hungry.

           EXT. WOODS -- EVENING

           Deep in the woods. Alone. All is silent and grey.

           A large silhouette form lumbers across the forest floor. Low, 
           snow covered branches obscure its details. 

           Tall, but hunched in posture. Long legs. Dark fur. The fog of 
           its breath catches the moonlight in plumes as it steps 
           through the trees. It moves with power and grace.  
           As quickly as it appeared, it disappears. The sound of its 
           movement through the twigs and branches slowly fades.

           INT. CAR -- DAY

           Houses move by outside the windows of the squad car. Paul and 
           Donny sit in silence except for the hum of the engine.

           Donny glances to Paul, almost nervous.

                                 DONNY
                        Why haven't you asked me yet?

           Paul sends Donny a confused look.

                                 PAUL
                        Asked you what?

                                 DONNY
                        The question you should have asked 
                        me when I was interviewed. Why a 
                        guy born and raised in New York 
                        would decide to up and move to what 
                        most people would consider the 
                        middle of nowhere.

                                 PAUL
                        You got shot, Donny. That's reason 
                        enough for me.

           Beat. Donny waits for more.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I know what it's like to have 
                        people look at you with pity. To 
                        have people tell you "it wasn't not 
                        your fault", like that makes things 
                        better.

           Paul stares straight ahead as he speaks.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I know what it feels like to get 
                        sympathy over something that eats 
                        you alive, Donny. I don't need to 
                        know anything else.

                                 DONNY
                        Are you a praying man?

           Paul looks uncomfortable. Donny shrugs.
                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        I wasn't. Until I was lying on the 
                        gurney lookin' at the sky, hearing 
                        people tell me I'm not going to 
                        die.

           Donny looks to Paul.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        I asked God. I said, "Why? Why did 
                        you let this happen?" I had a girl, 
                        I was movin' up in the force. So 
                        "why?" I asked.

           Paul stares intensely through the windshield.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        And I think I know why... Because I 
                        wasn't where I was supposed to be.

           Paul isn’t buying it,

                                 PAUL
                        Is this where you are supposed to 
                        be Donny? Is this where you think 
                        God told you to be?

                                 DONNY
                        We've all got a purpose. Ours is to 
                        protect people, right?

           Paul doesn't answer.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        Maybe I'm supposed to protect 
                        somebody here...

           Donny gets an idea.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        Or maybe you're supposed to protect 
                        me.

           SQUAWK. Paul's CB radio comes to live.

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        Forest station 12 to Laytonsville 
                        Sheriff Department. Do you copy?

           Paul brings the handset to his mouth.

                                 PAUL
                        This is Sheriff Shields.
                                 FOREST RANGER
                        Sheriff, I've been trying to reach 
                        you by phone for the past hour. 
                        We've got a bit of a situation. 
                        Some campers went missing last 
                        night.

                                 PAUL
                        Where were they last seen?

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        We'll we've found their campsite 
                        and... well, we figured you'd 
                        better take a look at it before we 
                        do anything.

           Donny sends Paul a concerned look.

                                 FOREST RANGER (CONT'D)
                        How close are you to Leed's Bluff?

                                 PAUL
                        Not far. We'll be there in less 
                        than five minutes.

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        Copy that Sheriff. We'll see you 
                        here...

           Paul places the handset back into its place on the dash.

                                 DONNY
                        What's goin' on there?

                                 PAUL
                        Probably nothing. People from the 
                        city like to come out here to feel 
                        like they're roughing it.

           Donny nods.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Every now and then one of them 
                        drinks too much and gets lost. We 
                        normally find them the next day 
                        after they sober up and find their 
                        way back...

           Donny nods again. Beat. They ride in silence.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Maybe you’re supposed to protect 
                        them.

           Donny smiles.
                                 DONNY
                        Maybe.

           EXT. CAMP SITE -- DAY

           Paul and Donny follow closely behind a heavyset, brown haired 
           FOREST RANGER. They follow him down a small incline.

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        The best we can figure at this 
                        point is a bear attack... There is 
                        no sign of the men, but their 
                        campsite's been ripped all to hell.

           Donny speaks up from the rear.

                                 DONNY
                        You said it was a bear attack. 
                        What, uh, what makes ya think that?

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        No, I said I thought it was a bear. 
                        And, well, have a look for 
                        yourselves.

           Paul, Donny and the Ranger step into a snow covered clearing.

           A mangled green tent hangs in shreds. Sleeping bags and three 
           backpacks lie scattered in torn pieces around the site.

           Paul approaches the tent, which has been shredded with sharp 
           precision. He lifts a long strip of the tent with his hand.

                        We figure the boys mighta' run off 
                        when they saw the bear. Ya know, 
                        scared of it.

                                 PAUL
                        But you doubt whether it was a 
                        bear.

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        Well, there's some oddities about 
                        the whole situation, which is why I 
                        figured you'd better have a look.

                                 PAUL
                        Oddities.

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        Yeah... that for example.

           He points to a tall slender tree. Paul's eyes travel up the 
           trunk until he sees it. FOUR DEEP SCRATCHES have been carved 
           into the trunk. Claw marks.
           Donny slowly steps between the two men as they all look at 
           the deep gashes in the grey trunk.

                                 DONNY
                        Claw marks?

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        Looks that a' way. 'Cept that's a 
                        foot or two higher than any bear in 
                        this area could reach without 
                        climbing.  And they're out of 
                        season.  It would take one early 
                        risin' bear to do something like 
                        this.

           Paul's face shows concern.

                                 PAUL
                        Any other ideas what could have 
                        done something like this?

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        Haven't the foggiest...

                                 PAUL
                        Any tracks?

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        Not that I could find, it got 
                        pretty cold last night. Ground gets 
                        too hard.

           Donny nods.

                                 FOREST RANGER (CONT'D)
                        Probably nothin' right?  Like I 
                        said, we just figured it would be 
                        best to let you boys know about 
                        this. Just in case.

           Paul steps toward the tree as Donny looks to the Ranger and 
           shakes his hand.

                                 DONNY
                        Thank you. We appreciate it.

                                 PAUL
                        Is there any forest work going on 
                        around here?

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        Yeah, I think they opened a lumber 
                        camp 'bout 40 miles north of here 
                        earlier this month. Pretty decent 
                        sized operation. Think that has 
                        somethin' to do with this?
           Paul shakes his head and smiles.

                                 PAUL
                        Probably not.

           The ranger turns to walk away. He stops and turns back.

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        If anything else turns up, we'll 
                        let ya know.

           Paul looks to the tree tops.

                                 PAUL
                        Thanks...

           INT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

           Paul and Susan sit at opposite ends of a small table in the 
           center of a darkly lit steakhouse. Adam sits midway between 
           them. An empty chair sits across from him.

           Paul looks uncomfortable in his skin. He and Susan each have 
           a steak. Adam works on an impressive burger. He smiles back 
           and forth between his parents.

                                 PAUL
                        Tell Mom about gym class today.

           Adam looks excited.

                                 ADAM
                        I hit three shots in basketball.

           Susan raises his eyebrows in dramatic surprise.

                                 SUSAN
                        You did?!

                                 ADAM
                        One was really far back. Like the 
                        free throw line. 

                                 PAUL
                        ...and how many shots did Josh 
                        Wiley hit?

                                 ADAM
                        Zero.

                                 PAUL
                        Zero!

           Susan fights a smile through a stern look as Paul smiles at 
           Adam.
                                 SUSAN
                        Well... I am very impressed. I 
                        think we might have to order some 
                        ice cream to celebrate!

           Adam’s eyes light up. He looks to Paul, who smiles.

                                 PAUL
                        I think so.

           Paul looks to Susan. They lock eyes for a fleeting moment.

                                 ADAM
                        What did Mrs. Poplar say yesterday?

                                 SUSAN
                        That's a brave subject.

           She takes a bite.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        She said you aren't watching any 
                        more of those cartoons your dad 
                        lets you watch.

                                 PAUL
                        I don't know what you're talking 
                        about...

           Beat. Adam looks upset.

                                 ADAM
                        Why can't I watch them anymore?

           Susan smile victoriously at Paul who drops his fork in 
           exaggerated frustration at Adam.

           Adam stirs at his food.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Mom, when are we going home?

                                 SUSAN
                        After dinner, but I do need to run 
                        by the store on the way.

                                 ADAM
                        I meant home with Dad...

           Susan and Paul stop eating. Susan looks at Paul to gauge his 
           reaction.

                                 SUSAN
                        Let's not talk about that right 
                        now, okay?
           She smiles. Adam looks pleadingly at both his parents.

                                 ADAM
                        Why not?

                                 SUSAN
                        Adam...

                                 PAUL
                        Just eat your dinner.

           Beat. Adam doesn't move.

                                 ADAM
                        I don't want everyone to be sad 
                        anymore.

           Susan pains a smile.

                                 SUSAN
                        Who's sad? Everyone’s happy 
                        tonight!

                                 ADAM
                        I see you crying sometimes. You 
                        always pretend like you weren't. 
                        But I see you.

                                 PAUL
                           (sternly)
                        Adam.

                                 ADAM
                        Do you still love each other?

           Susan looks up at Paul.

                                 SUSAN
                        Sweetie, I don't think-

                                 PAUL
                        Yes.

           Susan looks to Paul. Surprised.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        But sometimes it's harder than 
                        that.

           Beat. Susan looks back to her food.

           The Shields family slowly resumes their meal in silence.
           INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

           Adam sits in on the floor front of the television set. He 
           laughs out loud at the flashing cartoon on the screen. His 
           small Pomeranian lies on the floor beside him.

           Paul enters carrying a filled trash bag. He stops and watches 
           the television for a moment.

           On screen, a cartoon cat is being chased by a cartoon dog. 
           The cat visibly passes gas. The dog pursuing him turns green 
           in the face, stiffens, then topples over.

           Paul furrows his brow as his picks up the remote from the 
           coffee table.

                                 PAUL
                        Are you trying to get me in 
                        trouble?

           Paul changes the channel from the cartoons to a regional news 
           broadcast. Adam sighs in frustration. Paul leaves the den, 
           walking into the kitchen.

           On screen a woman news anchor speak with a colorful graphic 
           of several trees over her shoulder.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        ...the sudden influx of wildlife 
                        into the Washington D.C. area all 
                        seems to have come from the dense 
                        forests to the north.

           A MAP appears on screen. Large arrows indicate the wildlife 
           movement from the north. Laytonsville appears near the top of 
           the map as a small dot indicating its location.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (CONT'D)
                        Local zoologists from the 
                        University of Maryland continue to 
                        be baffled by the apparent 
                        unexplained migration of several 
                        species from their homes.

           Adam turns from the television in disinterest. He leaves the 
           room, the screen still on.

           EXT. BACKYARD NEAR TREE LINE -- NIGHT

           Paul exits the back door carrying two large trash bags. He 
           lifts the lid of the dumpster and tosses both bags inside.

           He stops halfway to the door and turns to the woods lining 
           his back yard. The house's floodlight casts a series of stark 
           shadows over the trees.
           Paul stares. His eyes look to the treetops.

           SNAP. A twig cracks. Deep in the woods.

           Paul hears it. He freezes. Listens.

           POP. SNAP. Growing closer. The sound moves quickly and more 
           intense as it nears the treeline.

           Paul reaches to the pistol on his hip. He unsnaps the holster 
           quietly. He slowly inches toward the woods.

           HEAVY FOOTSTEPS echo through the trees. It draws close. Mere 
           feet from the light. From being seen.

           Paul raises his weapon as the sound bursts from the trees.

           A MAN.  He stumbles from the woods.  He staggers in 
           exhaustion. His young face is covered with mud and scratches.

           Paul lowers his gun in surprise as the man runs toward him. 
           The man grabs Paul by the shoulders as he struggles to stand.

                                 YOUNG CAMPER
                        Please!

                                 PAUL
                        Are you alright?

           Panic covers the man's face.

                                 YOUNG CAMPER
                        We have to hide!

           Paul turns his gaze to the dark veil of trees, then back to 
           the camper.

                                 YOUNG CAMPER (CONT'D)
                        Run!!

           INT. SHERIFF'S STATION BREAK ROOM -- DAY

           The Young Camper sits in a small metal chair across a table 
           from Paul.

           The room in which they sit appears to be more of a break room 
           than anything else. A microwave rests on the counter.  A 
           refrigerator sits in the corner.

           The camper stares at the table in front of him, his face 
           drained of all expression.

                                 YOUNG CAMPER
                        I left the tent at about two in the 
                        morning to use the bathroom.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 YOUNG CAMPER (CONT'D)
                        When I left, both Ryan and Steve 
                        were asleep. 

                                 PAUL
                        What happened then?

                                 YOUNG CAMPER
                        I was outside the camp. Cause 
                        that's what they say to do, you 
                        know? Then I heard something. It 
                        was quiet at first. Like it was far 
                        away.

           He looks up at Paul.  His eyes reflect fear.

                                 YOUNG CAMPER (CONT'D)
                        But then it started getting closer.

                                 PAUL
                        It?

                                 YOUNG CAMPER
                        Something running through the 
                        trees.  Branches breaking. I 
                        froze... then I heard them 
                        screaming.  In pain.  They were 
                        screaming in pain.  I could hear 
                        them fighting with it.  The tent 
                        being torn.  And I ran.  I ran like 
                        a coward.

           He looks sick with himself.

                                 YOUNG CAMPER (CONT'D)
                        I wandered around all day. Until it 
                        got dark again. I was afraid 
                        whatever came the first night would 
                        find me this time. Then I saw your 
                        light.  On the back of your 
                        house...

                                 PAUL
                        You heard noises. Did you see 
                        anything?

                                 YOUNG CAMPER
                        No. It was too dark. The fire had 
                        already gone out.

           Paul speaks in a comforting tone.

                                 PAUL
                        The Forest Department started 
                        searching for your friends this 
                        morning.
                                 YOUNG CAMPER
                        Don't bother... They're already 
                        dead.

           INT. SHERIFF'S STATION -- DAY

           Paul and Donny stand in the hallway on either side of a 
           closed door. The Young Camper still sits in the next room, 
           visible through a window. He has calmed but looks exhausted.

                                 DONNY
                        The other two haven't turned up?

                                 PAUL
                        They could walk out of the trees 
                        later today for all we know.

                                 DONNY
                        What he's saying sounds like-

                                 PAUL
                        I know.

           Beat.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I've been thinking... Assuming 
                        there is some sort of animal. An 
                        animal in these woods that's never 
                        been discovered. I wondered how 
                        that could be possible. How could 
                        something like that go unnoticed 
                        for so long?

           Donny looks interested.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        But if it's been here as long as 
                        your prehistoric fish, maybe it 
                        could have evolved over time. 
                        Adapted to its surroundings. What 
                        if it learned how to hide? How to 
                        run?  What if it was smart enough 
                        to know that we're a threat? To 
                        learn how to fight us in safety 
                        before it fights us head on? Maybe 
                        it was smart enough to avoid us 
                        until it had no choice.

                                 DONNY
                        That would be a very dangerous 
                        animal.

           Paul looks back to the Young Camper.
                                 PAUL
                        Yes it would.

           EXT. SUSAN'S DRIVEWAY -- DAY

           Donny stands with his head under the hood of Susan's minivan. 
           Susan stands off to the side.

                                 SUSAN
                        Thank you again for doing this, 
                        Donny.

           Donny pulls a broken belt from the van.

                                 DONNY
                        Not a problem at all. Just needed a 
                        new fan belt.

           He tosses the belt into the trash.

                                 SUSAN
                        I saw you at church the other day, 
                        but you were across the way.

                                 DONNY
                        Yeah, I meant to say “hi,” but Paul 
                        was just rollin’ in from Baltimore 
                        when we let out.

                                 SUSAN
                        Baltimore?

                                 DONNY
                        Yeah.  Something about a lawyer.  
                        I'm sure you know all about it.

           Susan thinks.  It hits her.  The lawyer.  Pain.  She forces a 
           smile.

                                 SUSAN
                           (lying)
                        Oh yeah.  The lawyer. Right.

           Donny slams the hood closed, blows heat into his hands and 
           turns to Susan.

                                 DONNY
                        But, yeah.  She should run fine.  
                        Let me know if you have any other 
                        problems with it.

           Susan stares distantly for a moment.  She's miles away before 
           she snaps back to the moment.

                                 SUSAN
                        Thank you Donny.
           Donny sees the pained look on her face. He suddenly gets it. 
           She didn’t know about the lawyer visit.

                                 DONNY
                        -I'm an idiot.

           Susan shakes her head and smiles painfully.

                                 SUSAN
                        No, it's okay.

                                 DONNY
                        I'm sorry.

           Donny doesn't know what else to say.  Susan's eyes sadden.

                                 SUSAN
                        No. I think I know where I'm at 
                        now...

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM -- DAY

           Paul sits on the corner of the large bed. A bedside lamp 
           illuminates the room. Paul's divorce papers lie on his lap, 
           still in their large green folder. 

           Slowly Paul thumbs through the pages of the packet. He runs 
           his fingers down the page, feeling the texture of the print.

           A small green adhesive flag points to a line appropriated for 
           a signature. It glares at him from the page.

           He reaches to the bed beside him, grabbing a silver pen. 

           The pen approaches the page with reluctance.

                                 ADAM
                        Dad?

           Paul jumps suddenly. He quickly closes the folder and turns 
           to look over his shoulder.

           Adam stands in the doorway, holding onto the door frame with 
           one hand.

                                 PAUL
                        Hey pal!

           Paul places the closed folder on the floor at his feet.

                                 ADAM
                        Donny's here...

           Paul looks surprised by the news. He nods.
                                 PAUL
                        Okay.

           INT. FOYER -- DAY

           Paul descends the staircase leading into the foyer. Donny 
           stands at the base of the stairs. He eagerly looks up.

                                 DONNY
                        Do you have a map?

           Paul stops at the bottom of the stairs.

                                 PAUL
                        Yes.

           INT. KITCHEN -- DAY

           Paul unrolls a large map across the oak kitchen table. 
           Laytonsville and the areas surrounding it can be seen in 
           relatively high detail.

                                 DONNY
                        I'd just come back from Susan's 
                        when we got a call from Don Lofton, 
                        the sheriff up in Woodsboro.

           Donny points to Woodsboro on the map. It lies about 20 miles 
           northwest of Laytonsville.

                                 PAUL
                        How is she?

                                 DONNY
                        Huh?

                                 PAUL
                        Susan.

                                 DONNY
                        She's fine. Car's running now. 
                        Anyway, he tells me he's been 
                        meanin' to call us. Seems last week 
                        they had what he thought was a 
                        cattle thief come through town. 
                        Cows disappearin' out of their 
                        fences.

           Paul raises his eyebrows.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        He was callin' to warn us that they 
                        we should keep an eye out.

                                 PAUL
                        A week late. That was nice.
                                 DONNY
                        Anyway. Woodsboro is up here.

           Donny points to Woodsboro.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        And we're south east.

           Donny points to Laytonsville.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        So I figured if what took their 
                        cattle is the same thing that's 
                        around here, like at old man 
                        Peterson's. Maybe it just passed 
                        through Woodsboro. But why is it 
                        moving?  So I asked if anything 
                        unusual is going on to the north, 
                        that would cause this thing to head 
                        south.

           Donny points to a point in the forest north of Woodsboro.

                                 PAUL
                        The lumber camp...

           Donny traces his finger along an invisible line that goes 
           from the lumber camp to Woodsboro to Laytonsville.

                                 DONNY
                        The forest work. They flushed it 
                        out right toward us.

           Paul looks at the map.

                                 PAUL
                        There's no more forest to the 
                        south.

                                 DONNY
                        It's trapped...

                                 PAUL
                        That's a very bad thing.

           The telephone hanging on the kitchen wall RINGS.

                                 DONNY
                        I would think so, yes.

           Paul answers the phone as Donny hovers over the map.

                                 PAUL 
                        Hello?
           Paul listens. He looks concerned.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Sure, Earl. Stay put. We’ll be 
                        right over. 

           INT. SQUAD CAR -- NIGHT

           Paul pilots the car down the dark, winding. He glances to the 
           backseat. Adam sleeps with his head against the window. Donny 
           and Paul speak in hushed voices. 

                                 DONNY 
                        Earl Lerner? The guy with a bigger 
                        arsenal than the US Marine Corp... 
                        and he sounded nervous.

                                 PAUL
                        Yes he did.

           Donny laughs as he jokes.

                                 DONNY
                        This is all making me feel really 
                        good. Guy could take out an 
                        invading army from his front porch 
                        and we’re comin’ to save the day.

           Donny laughs again. Paul stares through the windshield. In 
           his own world.

                                 PAUL 
                        When are you going to ask me?

           Donny looks up.

                                 DONNY
                        Ask you what?

                                 PAUL
                        Timothy. My son. You haven’t asked 
                        me how it happened. And I doubt 
                        anyone’s told you...

           Donny’s smile fades. He doesn’t know what to say.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        He was playing in the yard by 
                        himself.  A basketball goal we got 
                        him for his birthday.  A small one.  
                        Susan had taken Adam to a friend's 
                        house. I was working on the roof.  
                        I made him play in the side yard so 
                        I could see him.  I took my eyes 
                        off of him for less than a 
                        minute...
           Paul pauses. Donny doesn't move.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        We had a small plastic pool in the 
                        side yard.  I had filled it up 
                        earlier and forgotten to empty it.  
                        I noticed that it got quiet.  I 
                        didn't hear his ball anymore.  When 
                        I looked down he was lying in the 
                        pool.  Facedown.  They think he 
                        slipped on the bottom and hit his 
                        head.

           Donny winces.

                                 DONNY
                        I'm sorry, Paul.

                                 PAUL
                        My five year old son died because I 
                        was too busy installing television 
                        antennae on my house to watch him.  
                        To protect him. 

           Beat.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        And the worst part about it, nobody 
                        except me acts like they know that. 

           Paul looks to Donny, who has no response.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        You asked if I was a praying man. 
                        The day it happened I asked God for 
                        two things: to forgive me for not 
                        taking care of my little boy and to 
                        keep me from ruining anyone else's 
                        life more than I already have.

           Paul stares back to the road.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Don't pity me, Donny. I haven't 
                        earned it... but you deserve to 
                        know who your working with.

           Donny turns back to the road as they ride in silence.

           INT. LERNER’S FOYER -- NIGHT

           Earl Learner swings the large wooden front door open. Paul, 
           Adam and Donny stand outside, behind the screen door. Earl 
           doesn't smile.
                                 EARL
                        Sheriff.

                                 PAUL
                        Earl.

           INT. LERNER’S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

           A television against the wall displays the doppler radar from 
           a regional news station. A bright red storm front moves 
           across the map.

                                 WEATHER MAN (O.S.)
                        ...with the wintry storm expected 
                        to settle over the area by tomorrow 
                        night. Expect widespread road 
                        closures through the mountain 
                        passes as we’re expecting heavy 
                        snowfall in the rural areas 
                        surrounding Fountain Mills, 
                        Laytonsville and Woodsboro.

           Donny sits on the couch facing the television as Paul takes 
           seat beside him. Earl MUTES the television as Donny makes 
           conversation.

                                 DONNY
                        Sounds like we’re in for a storm...

           Earl doesn’t respond as he approaches the television and 
           inserts a VHS tape into the VCR. Concern covers his face.

           Ethel Lerner stands, worried, against the far wall in a 
           nightgown and rollers. She bends down to Adam’s level.

                                 ETHEL
                        Adam baby, why don’t you come in 
                        here with me and we’ll find you 
                        somethin’ to eat.

           Adam looks to Paul, who nods as Ethel takes Adam by the 
           shoulder and leads him into the kitchen. 

                                 EARL
                        I have a camera I put out in the 
                        woods from time to time.  It's made 
                        for deer hunters. Runs on 
                        batteries. If a deer goes by in the 
                        middle of the night, that camera 
                        will see it and start recording on 
                        tape. It helps for knowin' if an 
                        area is populated.

           Paul nods. He knows what’s coming. 
                                 PAUL
                        But this is not footage of a deer.

           Earl shakes his head nervously.

                                 EARL
                        I found the camera lying on the 
                        ground this morning. And I think 
                        you oughta take a look.

           He presses "play" on the VCR and takes a seat in a nearby 
           armchair.

           The TV screen fills with snow before an image finally appears 
           on the screen. A small wooded clearing. The trees appear 
           STARK WHITE in the grainy, colorless image. The darkness 
           appears pitch black.

                                 EARL (CONT'D)
                        It recorded over three hours last 
                        night. I couldn't figure out what 
                        kept settin' it off.

                                 PAUL
                        What am I looking for Earl?

                                 EARL
                        You'll know it when you see it...

           Paul and Donny stare intently at the screen. Branches sway 
           softly. All else is still. Lifeless.

           Paul slowly leans in closer. Looking for anything unusual in 
           the image. Just trees. All is calm.

           Something massive crosses in front of the camera and fills 
           the screen. Too close to see what it was.

           Paul and Donny jump in their seats, startled.

           The image tilts plummets to the ground, shaking with the 
           impact. The picture comes to a rest at an angle. Clumps of 
           snow, inches from the lens, come into focus. All else blurs.

                                 DONNY
                        How 'bout a little warning?!

           Earl ignores him. He stares at the screen.

                                 PAUL
                        That could have just been a deer 
                        Earl.

                                 EARL
                        That's what I figured...till I 
                        looked at the photos.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EARL (CONT'D)
                        Whatever it was knocked the tape 
                        out, but it still takes 35mm 
                        pictures. I got ‘em back just 
                        before I called.

           Earl pulls several large prints from his jacket.  He places 
           them on the table. 

           Paul and Donny lean over the prints.

           The first page shows the blurry camera's perspective from its 
           position on the ground.  The trees appear only as blurry grey 
           images, but still identifiable.

                                 EARL (CONT'D)
                        Here's the first... and the second.

           Earl removes the first print.  The second image comes into 
           view.  The tree line remains blurry in the background.

           A BLURRY, THIN STALK, maybe four inches thick, protrudes from 
           behind the trunk of a tree.  Earl point to the spot.

                                 EARL (CONT'D)
                        There it is.  Now look at the next 
                        one.

           Earl reveals the third photo. From the blurry trees emerges a 
           FIGURE.  The think stalk, now clearly a leg, has taken a step 
           from behind the tree.

           Paul and Donny's eyes widen in shock. Earl breathes deeply.

           Though out of focus, vague detals can be seen: It is tall. 
           Maybe six feet. It walks on two strong, thin legs. Large 
           powerful arms hang down. It steps in a slumped forward 
           position. Not apelike. But not human. Like nothing we’ve ever 
           seen.

           Earl flips the page again.  Nothing but trees.  With that, it 
           disappears into the darkness of the night.

           Paul and Donny sit in stunned silence.

                                 EARL (CONT'D)
                        Ethel didn’t want me to leave after 
                        seein’ the pictures. So what do ya 
                        think?

           Beat. Paul can barely form words.

                                 PAUL
                        Can- can I see the third one again?

                                 DONNY
                        Yes, I would also like to see the 
                        third one again.
           INT. SQUAD CAR -- NIGHT

           Paul, Adam and Donny ride in the squad car. Paul and Donny 
           each stare straight ahead.

                                 ADAM
                        What was on the video tape?

           Silence. Donny opens his mouth to answer. He reconsiders.  

           Paul acts as if he didn’t hear the question.

           INT. SHIELD’S FOYER -- NIGHT

           Paul, Adam and Donny enter through the front door, shedding 
           their coats. Paul places his pistol in an entrance table 
           drawer.

                                 PAUL
                        First door on the left, Donny. 

           Donny gives nods as he moves down the hall into a doorway. 
           Paul pats Adam on the back, sending him toward the stairs.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Head for bed, pal.

           EXT. SHIELD’S SIDE YARD -- NIGHT

           CREATURE POV: A RASPY BREATHING courses through the night air 
           as a lumbering perspective emerges from the thick brush. The 
           glowing light of the Shields’ home comes into view in the 
           near distance.

           INT. SHIELD’S FOYER -- NIGHT

           Adam's small Pomeranian runs past Paul and begins BARKING 
           wildly at the front door. He growls and yaps loudly.

           Paul watches the dog curiously as Adam stops midway up the 
           stairs, staring at the commotion. The dog’s hair stands on 
           end as it barks furiously at the front door.

                                 ADAM
                        Sammy!

           Sammy runs protectively to Adam, who sits on the stairs and 
           tries to calm him. The dog GROWLS intensely at the door. 

           Paul looks from Adam and Sammy back to the front door.

           INT. BATHROOM -- NIGHT

           Donny washes his hands in the small bathroom sink. Behind him 
           a ground floor window is blackened by the night. 
           A RUSH OF MOVEMENT bolts past the outside of the window. 
           Something large. Too fast to see. Donny didn’t notice.

           INT. SHIELD’S FOYER -- NIGHT

           BOOM. The exterior dining room wall next to Paul shakes from 
           a powerful impact. 

           Paul and Adam jump in terror. Adam runs to hide behind Paul.

           Donny hurriedly emerges from the bathroom as the dog barks 
           wildly at the wall.

                                 DONNY
                        What the hell was that?

           Paul takes a cautious step toward the wall.

                                 PAUL
                        I have no idea...

           Paul steps toward the wall.  He leans his ear toward it.  
           Listening. An unnerving silence broken by --

           A SHATTERING WINDOW in the far end of the house. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (urgent whisper)
                        The bathroom!

           Paul bolts toward Adam and Donny in the central hallway, 
           steering them toward the bathroom.

           Paul stops halfway down the hall. His gun. In the drawer by 
           the front door. Before he can move toward it -- 

           SLAM! A tremendous impact rattles the large door. Paul 
           freezes. He looks to the drawer mere feet from the front 
           door. Too risky.

           INT. BATHROOM -- NIGHT

           Paul hurries Adam and Donny into the bathroom. The small dog 
           scurries in behind them, terrified.

           Paul shuts the door behind them. He flips off the light just 
           in time to hear the thunderous CRASH of the front door giving 
           in.

                                 PAUL
                           (whispering)
                        It’s in the house...

           Paul, Donny and Adam all breathe with short, panicked breaths 
           as they crouch against the far wall. Adam hugs close to Paul 
           in the blue moonlight of the nearby window.
                                 DONNY 
                        The dog...

           Donny stares uneasily at the dog. It cowers against Adam’s 
           leg. Quiet...for now. 

           HEAVY HOOF CLOPS on the wood floor of the foyer. It draws 
           closer.

           Paul looks to Donny’s hip. He’s not wearing his gun either. 
           Paul cringes. They’re defenseless.

           The sound of HOOVES grow louder.

           IN THE HALL

           The tip of a RAZOR SHARP CLAW drags across the surface of a 
           hallway table mere feet from the bathroom door. 

           CLOSE ON -- two huge hooves step powerfully across the wood.

           INSIDE THE BATHROOM

           Paul tenses. The hoof clops stop just outside the thin 
           bathroom door.

           HUFF. Like a horse exhaling its powerful breathing can be 
           heard through the door.

           Paul and Donny look to the small dog. Any sound and they’re 
           dead. The dog looks up at them nervously. Almost as if he 
           gets it. 

           CLOP. CLOP. The hoof steps resume and progress past the door. 

           The clumsy sounds of furniture and glassware being knocked to 
           the floor fill the house from the direction of the kitchen. 

           The hoof steps slowly fade, circling through the house and 
           back to the front door before exiting the way they came. 

           Paul and Donny exhale a tense breath and lean against the 
           wall in relief.

           EXT. SHIELDS’ SIDE YARD -- MORNING

           The sun slowly rises over the snow covered treetops. The 
           clear, winter sky grows brighter with each passing moment.

           A blanket of yellow sunlight drapes across the side of the 
           Shields’ home. 

           INT. BATHROOM -- MORNING

           Bright morning sunlight floods in through the window. It hits 
           Paul in the eyes, waking him.
           A TELEPHONE RINGS from the kitchen. Paul slowly stirs, 
           turning his head from the light.

           He sits on the floor against the bathroom wall. Adam sits, 
           asleep, under Paul’s arm. They slept in the bathroom last 
           night. Paul sits up uncomfortably, looking toward the tub. 

           Donny sits up from within the bathtub, rubbing his stiff 
           neck. He still wears his clothes from the previous night. 

           Paul rises slowly and follows the sound of the telephone out 
           of the bathroom. 

           INT. HALLWAY -- MORNING

           Paul walks toward the kitchen. Donny and Adam follow behind, 
           groggily surveying the damage from the night before. 

           Tables and chairs lie on their sides in the kitchen at the 
           far end of the hall. The front door hangs open. 

           Donny crouches down, bringing the surface of the hallway 
           table to eye level. He runs his finger along the deep scratch 
           left by the razor sharp claw.

           Paul can be heard answering the phone in the kitchen.

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                           (into phone)
                        Hello?

           Donny looks to the floor. Large muddy hoof prints trace down 
           the hallway and into the kitchen.

                                 PAUL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                           (into phone)
                        Yes.

           Donny pushes around pieces of a broken vase with his boot.

                                 PAUL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                           (into phone)
                        We’ll be right there.

           Paul reenters the hallway walking quickly.

                                 DONNY
                        What's goin' on?

           Paul throws on his jacket. Adam steps out of the way.

                                 PAUL
                        We have to go.

           Paul grabs Donny’s jacket from the bathroom and tosses it to 
           him.
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        They found the other campers.

           EXT. TREE LINE -- DAY

           A snowflake. Then another. A light flurry begins to fall as 
           Paul and Donny approach the tree line. Their squad car sits 
           along the highway behind them.

           Solemn, the Forest Ranger waits at the edge of the woods as 
           they approach. 

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        It's this way fellas...

           He steps into the trees. Paul and Donny follow.

           EXT. DEEP WOODS -- DAY

           Paul and Donny step through the trees as the Ranger comes to 
           a stop. Paul shivers against the cold wind that slices 
           through the trees. Nothing in the area appears unusual. 
           Confused, he looks to the Ranger for an explanation.

           Donny looks skyward and his jaw drops.

                                 DONNY
                        Oh my God...

           Careful to keep his eyes down, the Ranger motions skyward 
           with his head. Paul slowly turns and raises his gaze to the 
           treetops. His face pales at what he sees.

           Hanging from a branch high above the forest floor is what is 
           left of the BODY OF A MAN. Silhouetted against the bright 
           sky, barely more than skin remains of the mutilated body.

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        The other's over there.

           Paul pulls his eyes from the tree to the Ranger, who points 
           over his own shoulder to another tree.  ANOTHER BODY.  The 
           limp skin drapes over a branch.  A shred of t-shirt flaps in 
           the wind, caught on a nearby twig.

           The Ranger stares off into the trees. He can't look.

                                 FOREST RANGER (CONT'D)
                        We found it this mornin'.  Looks 
                        like nothin' more than the skin.  
                        Two separate victims.  We figured 
                        it had to be those boy that went 
                        missin'.  God knows how they got up 
                        there.

           Paul's eyes dance.  Donny speaks in a hushed tone.
                                 DONNY
                           (whispering)
                        Just like the boy from the story...

           He realizes something.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                           (whispering)
                        This thing has nowhere else to go.

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        What kinda sick monster could do 
                        somethin' like that?

           Donny looks to the Ranger.

                                 DONNY
                        You have no idea.

                                 PAUL
                        As soon as the coroner gets them 
                        down you need to get your men out 
                        of the woods.

           The Ranger looks startled.

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        Why?

                                 PAUL
                        Whatever did that is still in these 
                        trees.

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        What do ya mean "whatever"?  If 
                        you're thinking this is a bear like 
                        we talked about-

                                 PAUL
                        Windago.

           The sheriff squints.  He laughs but stops himself when he 
           sees Paul isn't joking.  He looks to Donny, who doesn't smile 
           either.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        You've heard the stories?

           He looks to the tree before looking back to Paul in sudden 
           fear.  He nods softly.

           Paul looks to the surrounding woods.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        ...and it doesn't seem to have any 
                        trouble finding us.
                                 FOREST RANGER
                        I'll get them out of here as soon 
                        as I can.

                                 PAUL
                        Before dark.

           The Ranger nods as he backs toward a group of Rangers that 
           stand nearby.

                                 FOREST RANGER
                        Yeah.  Sure thing.

           He means it.

           Paul turns back to Donny.

                                 PAUL
                        Roads through the gap are nearly 
                        snowed over already. No chance of 
                        getting everyone out.

                                 DONNY
                        That storm comin’ in tonight ain’t 
                        gonna make it any easier. How long 
                        will it take for them plow?

                                 PAUL
                        Assuming the storm’s passed by 
                        morning, the forest department will 
                        clear them at sunrise. 

           The implication hits them both. They’re trapped. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        We have to get everybody in this 
                        town together before nightfall.  
                        This thing isn't leaving. We can't 
                        risk someone getting attacked 
                        tonight in their home.  And we 
                        don't have the manpower...

           Donny nods.  He understands.

                                 DONNY
                        Lock down before dark. Where at?

           Paul thinks.

                                 PAUL
                        In the church. It has lights.  This 
                        thing doesn't like to be seen. 
                        Lights might run it away if it 
                        finds us. The church can easily be 
                        locked down from the inside... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        It’s stone. It could hold if it 
                        came down to it... It has to.

                                 DONNY
                        What do we tell people?

                                 PAUL
                        The truth.

           Donny looks unsure of it himself.

                                 DONNY
                        The truth... Tell them it’s a 
                        Windago?

           Paul looks back in contemplation. The gravity of the 
           situation washes over him.

           EXT. MAIN STREET -- DAY

           Thick snowfall descends from overcast clouds. As evening 
           falls on Laytonsville, a heavy blanket of snow covers all 
           that is in sight. A chilling wind swirls snow between 
           buildings and over cars. 

           Thick overcast clouds drape a blanket of grey over the earth 
           below. As evening falls on Laytonsville, a chilling breeze 
           blows through the main street. 

           A snowflake. Then another. A light flurry begins to fall.

           American flags along the street begin to stir in the moving 
           air. A page of newspaper tumbles down the sidewalk.

           INT. SUSAN'S KITCHEN -- DAY

           Susan rushes through the kitchen, packing three meals in 
           brown paper bags. Paul stands against the wall as Adam enters 
           wearing his backpack and looking confused.

                                 SUSAN
                        Did you pack your toothbrush baby?

           Adam nods, still looking confused.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        How bad is this Paul?

           Paul hesitates.

                                 PAUL
                        Everything will be alright... It's 
                        just a precaution.

           Susan looks into his eyes for a moment before turning to 
           Adam. She hands him a brown sack meal.
                                 SUSAN
                        Are we ready?

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah.

           She ushers Adam past Paul and out the door into the WHISTLING 
           wind and snowfall. She locks eyes with Paul as she walks 
           past. Worry reflects in her eyes.

                                 SUSAN
                        You've never been a good liar, 
                        Paul...

           He looks away. She's right.

           EXT. CHURCH YARD -- EVENING

           Paul stands outside the large double doors of Laytonsville 
           Methodist Church. Large shuttered windows line the side of 
           the grey stone building. A cross adorns the roof high above.

           The snowfall builds, falling in thick curtains, clinging to 
           every surface.

           Several families approach Paul, who stands along the small 
           sidewalk leading to the entrance. Donny moves through 
           quickly, carrying a handful of chains.

           Anxiety hangs over Ron Jenkins, the horse rancher, who 
           approaches with his wife and children. 

                                 RON
                        Is it true what Donny said?  About 
                        something coming out of the trees? 

           Paul nods. Ron looks inside to his young family. Truly 
           concerned.

                                 RON (CONT'D)
                        You keep an eye on ‘em for me, 
                        Sheriff.

           Paul grimaces. Ron isn’t staying.

                                 PAUL
                        I can’t recommend enough that you 
                        stay, Ron. I’ve seen what can 
                        happen-

           Ron nods in understanding.

                                 RON
                        Those horses are our livelihood, 
                        Sheriff. They’re all we’ve got... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RON (CONT'D)
                        and I’ve gotta protect that. 
                        There’s nobody else I’d trust.

           There will be no convincing Ron. Paul shakes his hand and 
           nods understandably. Ron backs toward his truck parked 
           alongside the road.

           Donny pulls closed one of the large shutters that hinge on 
           either side of each stained glass window. It CREAKS as it 
           swings and SLAMS closed. 

           Paul steps up as Donny wraps a chain over the latch that 
           binds the shutters. 

                                 DONNY
                        Everyone here yet?

           Paul looks at his watch.

                                 PAUL
                        No. Ten more minutes. That's all we 
                        can afford.

           Donny picks up his pace.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I put three rifles in the pastor's 
                        office. Under the desk. It’s big. 
                        Rifle rounds stand a better 
                        chance... if it comes to it.

           Donny stops for a moment. He quietly nods. Paul looks 
           nervously to the sky.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        It's getting dark.

           Donny follows Paul’s gaze toward the sky. An ominous wall of 
           dark clouds approaches from the west. The fierce storm bears 
           down on Laytonsville. 

           INT. CHURCH -- EVENING

           Paul makes his way down the center aisle of the church. Pews 
           line either side of him as he moves over the wood planked 
           floor. People have gathered in their seats, many have 
           sleeping bags and pillows. All look concerned.

           As Paul nears the front of the church, he spots Susan and 
           Adam seated on the end of a pew. Adam looks around nervously.

           Paul kneels down at the pew. Eye level with Adam.

                                 PAUL
                        How are you doing pal?
                                 ADAM
                        Okay.

                                 PAUL
                        Don't be scared. I won't let 
                        anything happen to you.  I promise. 
                        Understand? 

           Adam nods. Paul smiles. He stands and walks toward the 
           pulpit.

           Paul passes Tom, the old cattle rancher, as he walks.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Are your cattle locked up Tom?

                                 TOM
                        A lot better than we are... What in 
                        the hell are we hidin' from?

           Paul runs onto the stage, stopping in front of the pulpit. He 
           faces the crowd. The room slowly quiets.

                                 PAUL
                           (speaking to crowd)
                        Alright everyone. In just a minute 
                        I'll tell you all everything I 
                        know. This should only be for 
                        tonight.  Until we know it's 
                        safe... It's good that you all 
                        came.

           Paul looks across the crowd.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Donny is locking down the shutters 
                        outside. If we can get a few people 
                        to give him a hand, that would 
                        help. Everything's going to be 
                        okay. We're in a safe place. 

           Paul looks to the large doors at the rear of the church, then 
           down to Pastor Moore standing on the floor.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (To pastor)
                        We're going to need to barricade 
                        those doors.

           The Pastor looks to the doors, then back to Paul. The 
           seriousness of Paul's intentions hits him. He nods fearfully.
           EXT. CHURCH YARD -- EVENING

           The sky has grown darker. The snow and wind have grown 
           stronger. Night crawls across the church yard. The trees 
           behind the church all but surrender to the darkness as they 
           sway in the heavy gusts of wind.

           Donny and another MAN, 40s, struggle to close a large shutter 
           against the violent air pressure. The snow stings their faces 
           as the shutter SLAMS. They yell over the wind.

                                 MAN
                        Need any more help?

                                 DONNY
                        We’re good. Head inside. She isn’t 
                        going to let up out here!

           Paul moves up beside them and throws the latch down, locking 
           the shutters together. Donny wraps a chain over the latch.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        That's the last one.

           Heavy snowfall shrouds the trees as the bend and CREAK.  
           Branches POP as they crash into one another.

                                 PAUL
                        Alright. Get inside and turn off 
                        the lights.

           Paul looks into the darkness.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Let’s not attract any more 
                        attention than we have to... 

           Donny and the other man quickly move toward the front side of 
           the building.

           Paul stares into the woods with the small church to his back.  
           The sole beacon of hope, the lights on the outside of the 
           building go dark. He takes a deep breath, shielding the 
           pelting snow before jogging toward the doors.

           INT. CHURCH -- NIGHT

           A large wooden beam drops into metal brackets across the 
           church's double doors. Like the doors of an ancient castle.

           No light penetrates the dark stained glass windows.

           Donny stands in the back of the church, he brushes his hands 
           on his pants. He nods to Paul.
           Paul stands behind the pulpit at the front of the small 
           church. The people gathered inside now fill almost every 
           seat. They all look to Paul expectantly. Trustingly.

                                 PAUL 
                        You all know about the tracks that 
                        were found going through town this 
                        week, the hoofprints... and most of 
                        you have probably heard about the 
                        young men that we found today.

           The room remains deafeningly silent.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        These two events... were connected. 
                        The same thing that left those 
                        tracks through our yards on Tuesday 
                        morning, attacked and killed those 
                        campers. We’re certain of that. 

           Several in the crowd look shocked.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        A lot of people have long believed 
                        that something lived in these woods 
                        to our north. The Indians had 
                        stories of a creature in this area. 
                        They called it a "Windago."

           Several in the crowd nod fearfully.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        It's beginning to look as if these 
                        stories weren't just stories. There 
                        is something out there. Something 
                        that has been in hiding... until 
                        now. And I didn't want to alarm 
                        anyone until I knew for sure... and 
                        now I do.

           They hang on his every word.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Three weeks ago they opened a 
                        logging camp about 40 miles north. 
                        Deep woods.  We think it pushed the 
                        creature south. With the animals on 
                        the run, it's been looking for 
                        food.

           Beat.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        And it found us...
           The people grow uneasy. Children look to their parents with 
           fear in their eyes. Paul speaks louder to overpower the 
           murmur. Tense concern rings in his voice. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        It's strong. It's fast, and it's 
                        smart. This is not just a ghost 
                        story anymore. This is real... and 
                        we’re going to make it through 
                        together. 

           He has everyone's focus.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        We’ve barricaded the doors and 
                        windows to keep anything out. We'll 
                        keep the building locked down until 
                        morning. 

                                 RICHARD
                           (from second row)
                        How many nights do we have to stay 
                        here?

                                 PAUL
                        That's a good question.  In the 
                        morning everyone needs to pack up.  
                        We'll leave town until the people 
                        who take care of this type of thing 
                        can do just that.

           Richard nods and takes a deep breath. 

                                 MAN 1 
                           (from back)
                        How long will that take?

                                 PAUL
                        The Forest Department has been made 
                        aware of the situation. Once the 
                        roads clear tomorrow morning 
                        they'll have Rangers crawling all 
                        over these woods to hunt this thing 
                        down.

                                 MAN 2
                        How many Rangers?

                                 PAUL
                        Dozens...

           The gravity of so large a number settles over the crowd. This 
           is a serious threat.
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Again, they are aware of the 
                        situation we face.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        We just have to make it through the 
                        night. And we will.

                                 MAN 2
                        How do we know this thing won't 
                        just find us all here, trapped like 
                        a bunch of damn rats?

           Paul won't lie.

                                 PAUL
                        That's possible.

                                 MAN
                        So what the hell are we doing here?

           Paul doesn't hesitate. He speaks with absolute certainty.

                                 PAUL
                        Because this is where we are 
                        supposed to be.  And there's no 
                        better place to be.  When that 
                        morning sun breaks through the 
                        trees... you'll be safe.

           Paul looks the man right in the eyes.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        You'll be safe.

           The man stares back.  He nods softly.  He's convinced.

           Paul scans the crowd with his eyes. They all look to him. 
           They look frightened. Scared. Paul doesn't. He is solid.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Tomorrow we be here sooner than you 
                        know.

           INT. CHURCH HALLWAY -- NIGHT

           Susan walks down a small darkened hallway in the front of the 
           church. Her chestnut hair has been pulled back into a pony 
           tail. She carries several blank pieces of paper in her hands.

           Paul enters the other end of the small hall. They stop and 
           face one another. The light from the sanctuary bounces around 
           the corner, casting a soft light into the hallway.

           Paul looks to both ends of the hall casually. They are alone. 
           Susan gives a smile.
                                 SUSAN
                        Hi.

                                 PAUL
                        Hi.

           Susan holds up the pieces of paper.

                                 SUSAN
                        Adam's bored. He wants to draw. I 
                        think he's just excited to get to 
                        stay up.

           Paul smiles.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        You were good in there.

                                 PAUL
                        Thank you.

                                 SUSAN
                        I'm serious Paul. Those people out 
                        there are terrified. But they all 
                        believe the same thing, that you 
                        will protect them. That no matter 
                        how bad things get, they can 
                        believe in you.

           Susan focuses on Paul's eyes. Paul stares back into hers.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        It wasn't your fault, Paul.

           Paul immediately breaks eye contact. His eyes begin to flood 
           slightly. He can't look at her for more than an instant.

                                 PAUL
                        Don't...

           A tear rolls down Susan's cheek.

                                 SUSAN 
                        He loved you too much. Timothy 
                        wouldn't want you to be sad... 

           Paul's eyes flood with emotion.

                                 PAUL
                        I should have been there with 
                        him... I should have been where I 
                        could get to him.

           He looks her in the eyes for what seems like the first time.
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I'm sorry.

           Susan’s eyes plead with him. 

                                 SUSAN
                        I still need you. You don't think I 
                        do, but I do.

           Paul doesn’t respond. Pain in his eyes. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        Have you seen all those people out 
                        there? Have you looked in their 
                        eyes? They trust you. They believe 
                        in you.  

           Paul looks away, not buying it.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        They are all scared senseless, but 
                        with you in the room... they think 
                        everything will be alright. They 
                        know everything will be alright. 
                        That's who you are Paul. We all 
                        know it.

                                 PAUL
                        What if you're wrong?

           Susan grabs Paul's face in her hands. She forces him to look 
           directly into her eyes.

                                 SUSAN
                           (certain)
                        I’m not.

           Paul looks at Susan with a reluctant warmth. 

           Susan extends her hand at waist height and holds it open for 
           Paul to take. Tears still wet her face.

           Paul looks down and sees it. He slowly reaches over with his 
           hand and takes Susan's. She leans her head into his chest as 
           they stand together in the dim light.

           INT. CHURCH -- EVENING

           Mrs. Barret sits alone on the end of a pew, her hands folded 
           in her lap. Donny takes a seat beside her as she smiles.

                                 MRS. BARRET
                        Donny Saunders. Two meetings in one 
                        week, I’m beginning to think you’re 
                        putting the moves on me.
           Donny laughs before a nervous apprehension drapes over him.

                                 DONNY
                        You know what’s going on.

           Mrs. Barret’s smile fades slightly.

                                 MRS. BARRET
                        I’ve just been around long enough 
                        to know that understanding the past 
                        is more than a little helpful in 
                        understanding the present.

                                 DONNY
                        You said the natives knew this 
                        thing, this creature, had a 
                        significance. 

           Mrs. Barret smiles and nods softly as she recollects.

                                 MRS. BARRET
                        About 30 years ago, lightning 
                        struck a tree and started a 
                        terrible fire out past the Bluff. 
                        Burned for days. They brought water 
                        trucks from all over the state 
                        trying to put out those flames. But 
                        try as they might, they couldn’t do 
                        it.

           Donny looks lost.

                                 MRS. BARRET (CONT'D)
                        Flames burnt for days before they 
                        simply stopped. Rain came and did 
                        what hundreds of men and their 
                        equipment couldn’t do. Acres upon 
                        acres were destroyed. Trees burnt 
                        to the ground. And do you know what 
                        happened after that? To all that 
                        scorched earth? 

           Donny shakes his head.

                                 MRS. BARRET (CONT'D)
                        It grew back stronger than ever. 
                        That fire burnt up all the weeds 
                        and undergrowth chokin’ out new 
                        trees. A cleansing fire. 

           Donny’s eyes land on Paul, who follows Susan into the 
           sanctuary. Mrs. Barret continues.

                                 MRS. BARRET (CONT'D)
                        The Indians understood that. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MRS. BARRET (CONT'D)
                        Sometimes we have to fight the 
                        flames to get rid of those 
                        weaknesses and failures that 
                        otherwise would just hang around, 
                        choking out the good things in 
                        life... 

                                 DONNY
                        Like a test?

                                 MRS. BARRET
                        I like to think of situations like 
                        this more like a chance to defeat 
                        your demons... for redemption. 

           Across the room, Paul stands at a distance and watches Susan 
           hand Adam some paper and a pen for him to draw. He looks at 
           his family longingly, but remains distant.

                                 MRS. BARRET (CONT'D)
                        But I’m just some old woman, what 
                        do I know?

                                 DONNY
                        I think you know a lot more than 
                        you let on.

           Donny looks back to Mrs. Barret. 

                                 MRS. BARRET
                        History’s one big circle Donny, 
                        sometimes things just look a little 
                        different when they come back 
                        around.

           Donny looks back across the room, as Paul is grabbed by a 
           concerned woman. He allows himself to be pulled away from 
           Susan and Adam. Susan looks up just in time to see Paul 
           stepping away. Hurt reflects in her eyes. 

           EXT. CHURCH YARD -- EVENING

           Gusting wind rips through the church yard. The flag atop a 
           tall metal flag pole in front of the church flaps violently 
           in the wind.  The long metal chain TINGS repeatedly against 
           the cold steel.

           Deep snow piles around the church, covering every inch of 
           earth. It sticks to the surface of the stone building, 
           glazing it in white. 

           INT. CHURCH -- NIGHT

           Donny and Paul sit on the edge of the stage. 
           Many of the people sleep uncomfortably in the pews as the 
           raging wind HOWLS outside. A small circle of children wearing 
           cartoon pajamas lay asleep in sleeping bags on the floor. 

           Susan and Adam lie on the floor nearby. Asleep.

                                 PAUL
                        Beginning to think “the middle of 
                        nowhere” isn't the place for you?

                                 DONNY
                        We'll see how this goes then I'll 
                        get back to ya.

           INT. RON JENKINS’ PICKUP TRUCK -- NIGHT

           Ron Jenkins sits behind the wheel of his lifeless pickup 
           truck. The moonlight pouring into the darkened cab 
           illuminates a rifle lying across the seat beside him.

           As the wind beats against the truck, Ron stares through the 
           windshield, his breath clouding out in front of him in the 
           unheated cab. He keeps a watchful eye on his horse barn 
           roughly twenty yards away.

           He rubs fatigue from his eyes as he reaches for a thermos in 
           the seat beside him. He bumps it with his hand, knocking it 
           into the floorboard.

                                 RON
                        Damn it...

           He lies in the seat, reaching to the floor. He grabs the 
           thermos, rising back to his seated position behind the wheel.

           A CLOUD OF FOG on the glass of the passenger side window. The 
           recent breath of something on the other side of the glass. It 
           slowly fades in the cold air. 

           Ron sees the glass. Fear floods over his face. He looks to 
           the barn through the veil of wind and snow. 

           Something large and brown strides around the corner. Ron 
           barely catches a glimpse. Terror pierces through him.

           Ron slams his hand onto the HORN, blaring it into the night.

           INT. CHURCH -- NIGHT

           The sound of the horn from Ron’s truck less than a mile away 
           catches everyone’s attention. People turn toward the windows. 
           Those awake hurriedly wake those asleep. 

           Paul and Donny jump down from the stage and run toward the 
           commotion. Paul leads the way, gently pushing his way through 
           the crowd that has pressed together.
           Paul approaches a window and tilts his head, peering through 
           the small crack between the shutters.

           In the distance, Ron’s truck slips in and out of view through 
           the blinding storm. Its high beams come on as the horn 
           blaring continues. 

           People within the church become vocally frightened. 

           A look of determination covers Paul’s face as he back away 
           from the window. He turns to see Donny in his path, shaking 
           his head.

           EXT. HORSE BARN -- NIGHT

           Ron forces the door open against the gusting wind and climbs 
           from the truck. He raises the rifle as he quickly moves 
           toward the barn. He struggles to see through the snow slicing 
           across his face. 

           BANG! Ron fires a warning shot into the night sky. 

           INT. CHURCH -- NIGHT

           Donny stands in Paul’s way. Paul hears the shot.

                                 PAUL
                        We’ve got to do something.

                                 DONNY
                        Goin’ out there is only gonna get 
                        you killed. 

           Paul tries to step past him. Donny steps into his path. He 
           isn’t letting this happen. He speaks in hushed urgency. 

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        You told that man we’d protect his 
                        family. That’s the only thing you 
                        need to do. And how are we gonna do 
                        that if you end up in the top of 
                        some tree?

           Paul looks to Ron’s family. They fearfully peer out a window.  
           He sighs and runs his hand over his face. Donny’s right. 

           Several people huddle against the shuttered windows, trying 
           to see out. Others sit fearfully in the center of the room. 

           People makes space as Paul and Donny angle their view between 
           the shutter cracks. 

           Movement can be seen beside the barn. Too far to see details.
           EXT. HORSE BARN -- NIGHT

           Ron presses against the wind as he approaches the barn.

           SCRATCHES. Claws on the far side of the barn. The sliding 
           barn doors RATTLE violently just out of sight. 

           Ron stops a few feet from the corner. He tightens his grip on 
           his rifle. His breathing quickens.

           Panic in his eyes, Ron locks up. His hands shake. He takes a 
           retreating step toward his truck, away from the barn.

           CRUNCH. From the darkness just behind his truck’s headlights. 
           The sound of a hoof step in hard-packed snow. 

           Ron’s eyes dance in frantic fear. He raises his rifle and 
           frantically swings it from the truck to the barn and back. 

           TICK. A quiet, but distinct sound reaches Ron’s ears. He 
           freezes. No idea where it came from. 

           Unseen to Ron, a large, fur covered figure peers down over 
           the edge of the barn roof. Before Ron notices, IT LUNGES --

           INT. CHURCH -- NIGHT

           POP. POP. The distant sounds of the final shots from Ron’s 
           rifle reach the church. An AGONIZED SCREAM. Then silence.

           EXT. HORSE BARN -- NIGHT

           Ron runs frantically through the snow. He clutches a shoulder 
           soaked with blood as he bolts through the open field.

           Behind him, the creature bursts from the darkness in pursuit. 
           Six feet tall. Long legs. Powerful arms. The definition of 
           ferocious. Its fur sheens in patches of moonlight as it runs. 

           It gains on Ron in an instant.  

           SLICE. Its claws slash across Ron’s back as it strides past.

           Ron’s lifeless body falls to the ground, staining the white 
           snow with a blanket of scarlet. 

           INT. CHURCH -- NIGHT

           People retract from the windows in saddened horror. Panic 
           begins to set in. One Man speaks over the others. 

                                 MAN
                        We’ve got to get out of here!

           Paul jumps in, not letting this take root.
                                 PAUL
                        There is no better place to be than 
                        right here. I promise you that.

           The man lowers his voice to a frantic hush.

                                 MAN
                        That thing’s right outside that 
                        wall!

           Paul doesn’t miss a step.

                                 PAUL
                        And we are right here!

           He locks eyes with the crowd.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Together. No matter what. 

           The Man calms as people protectively hug close to their 
           families. 

           SLAM. An impact from the front wall of the church echoes 
           through the building. People jump in startled fear as they  
           spin toward the intense sound.

           Donny steps up beside Paul. Both stare at the front wall.

                                 DONNY
                        Boss...

           The people slowly press toward the back of the room.

           Susan and Adam step to Paul's side. Susan wraps one arm 
           around Paul as he places an arm on her shoulder.

           Donny steps forward, toward the sound. He waits.

           SLAM. Another impact. The impact is followed by a scratching 
           sound near the height of the ceiling.

                                 PAUL 
                           (to himself)
                        It's climbing.

           Donny stands at the foot of the stage. He stares straight up.

           THUDS from the roof. The entire room looks up. The small 
           children hug close to their parents.

           Paul walks over to the Pastor, who stares at the ceiling.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        The metal door on the side of the 
                        building.  By your office.
           The Pastor pulls his gaze from the sky.

                                 PASTOR
                        It's locked.

           More THUDS on the roof.

                                 PAUL
                        Do you have the key?

           The Pastor fishes around in his pocket.

                                 PASTOR
                        Here. Here you go.

           Paul places the key in his shirt pocket and moves away from 
           the group to Donny.

                                 DONNY
                        Maybe it will leave. Like at your 
                        house...

           Scratches and thuds move toward the rear of the church's 
           roof.

                                 PAUL
                        I don't think so.

           Donny looks to Paul.

                                 DONNY
                        Why not?

                                 PAUL
                        It wasn't hungry...and we just took 
                        the rest of its meal out of that 
                        tree.

           The movement stops. You could hear a pin drop inside the 
           church.

           A PIERCING, ANIMALISTIC SHRIEK cuts through the night. 
           Several people inside cover their ears.

           EXT. CHURCH TREE LINE -- NIGHT

           In the distance, the outline of the hunched creature stands 
           atop the church roof as its SHRIEK pierces the wintry air. 
           The powerful predator paces, searching the rooftop for a way 
           into the structure.

           INT. CHURCH -- NIGHT

           THUDS and SCRATCHES continue overhead. Then stop. Silence.
           Light scratches come from the shutters of a side window. 
           Several women scream and gasp.

           The shutter violently moves against the chains. Everyone 
           presses toward the opposite side of the church.

           Another SHRIEK pierces through the church.  Then nothing.

           An ominous silence hangs in the air. The shutter stops 
           moving. The room stands motionless. All is still.

           SLAM. The two large barricaded doors recoil from an impact.

           A shockwave moves through the crowd. They all press backward.

           Paul and Donny cut their way through the crowd toward the 
           doors.

           SLAM. The doors rock against the wood beam securing it.

           Paul and Donny stop mere feet from the doors.

                                 DONNY
                        It'll hold right?

           SLAM. Another impact shakes the building.

           Paul sends Donny a look that is unsure at best. He turns to 
           the crowd as the doors are rocked once again.

           The people look panicked.

                                 PAUL
                        We're alright. Everything's going 
                        to be okay.

           SLAM.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Everyone to move to the center of 
                        the room. Stay away from the 
                        windows.

           Beat.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        It'll be alright.

           His eyes land on Susan's. She smiles softly through the fear. 
           She trusts him.

           SLAM. Paul turns back to Donny.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Turn on the outside lights. We can 
                        stop trying to hide.
                                 DONNY
                        Think it'll scare it off?

           Paul looks at the doors.

                                 PAUL
                        No. I don’t...

           Another powerful SLAM hits the door. Each impact seems to 
           loosen up the two reinforced doors.

           Donny breathes deep before turning and jogging toward the 
           rear of the church. Paul stands staring at the doors as Donny 
           disappears through the crowd.

           The doors give with each resounding collision. The metal 
           brackets holding the beam in place are loosening from the 
           door.  It's weakening.

           EXT. CHURCH -- NIGHT

           The large lights mounted on the corners of the church flash 
           on. They create a halo of light in the falling snow that 
           shrouds the building.

           INT. CHURCH -- CONTINUOUS

           Paul still stares at the doors. Donny, Susan and Adam join 
           him as they all gaze at the crippled barrier. Everyone in the 
           room inches forward in amazement.

           The outdoor lights glow from underneath the doors. Two thing 
           shadows dance in the light. Its legs. They move in step with 
           each slam to the door.

           Paul feels Susan and Adam beside him. He holds his arm in 
           front of them protectively.

           SLAM. The bolts holding the brackets weaken more.

                                 PAUL
                           (to Donny)
                        The box in the office. Go get it 
                        ready...

           Donny realizes what he wants. The gun. He backs away slowly.

                                 DONNY
                        Yeah. Okay...

           Paul takes Susan's hand in his. He faces her.

                                 SUSAN
                        What are you doing?
                                 PAUL
                        Those doors aren't going to hold.

           Susan's eyes widen.

                                 SUSAN
                        No! No, it'll be okay!  That's what 
                        you said, remember?  The doors will 
                        hold.  It'll-

                                 PAUL
                        I love you.

           Tears roll down Susan's face. She nods understandably.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Thank you for not giving up. For 
                        being better than I’ve ever 
                        deserved or earned...

           Susan shakes her head softly. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I had the best thing in the world 
                        and I almost threw it away. I love 
                        you...

           Beat. Susan cries. Paul's eyes redden.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I'll always love you.

                                 SUSAN
                        I love you too.

           Donny jogs back up beside Paul.

                                 DONNY
                        It's... it's ready.

           Paul kneels down in front of Adam.

                                 PAUL
                        Give me a hug pal.

           Adam hugs Paul with a bit of confusion.

                                 ADAM
                        Where are you going?

           Paul pulls back.

                                 PAUL
                        I've gotta take care of you and 
                        your mom, okay?  Everything's gonna 
                        be fine.
           Paul swallows hard.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Look after her while I'm gone, 
                        okay?

           Adam nods. Paul rises to his feet. He looks to Susan who 
           painfully smiles through her tears. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I’m going to earn it...

           She flinches and nods. She understands.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (to Donny)
                        Okay.

           He turns and disappears into the crowd. Donny follows behind.

           INT. CHURCH HALLWAY REAR -- NIGHT

           Paul and Donny stand nearly in the dark against a steel door. 
           Paul holds a rifle in his hand. He places a magazine into the 
           gun and slides the bolt forward. Loaded.

           The distant POUNDING of the doors echoes throughout.

                                 PAUL
                        Don't open those doors. No matter 
                        what you hear. Do you understand? 
                        Unless I say it's clear.

           Donny nods.

                                 DONNY
                        Yeah...

                                 PAUL
                        If I... if you don't hear from me, 
                        and it's those doors don't hold... 
                        these families need you-

                                 DONNY
                        I'll fire everything I've got.

           Paul nods.  Donny speaks with waivered certainty.

                                 DONNY (CONT'D)
                        I'll see ya in a minute boss.

           Paul slings the gun over his shoulder and reaches into his 
           shirt pocket. He removes the key and places it in the lock. 
           Slowly he turns it. Quietly.
           He eases the metal door open, preventing the wind from 
           catching it. A gust of snow swirls inside.

           EXT. CHURCH BACKYARD -- CONTINUOUS

           Paul slides through the doorway. He eases it closed until it 
           latches.

           He brings the rifle around his body until it rests in his 
           hands. His shoulder against the stone wall, he begins to 
           slowly edge toward the rear corner of the building. The wind 
           whips through the trees and against the church. 

           Paul slowly leans his head around the corner. The line of 
           shuttered windows runs down the length of the building.

           The rhythmic POUNDING of the doors from the front of the 
           church pulses into Paul’s ears. 

           Paul tucks the rifle under his arm and moves alongside the 
           small church. The exterior lights of the building shine down 
           on him as he nears the front.

           SLAM. Another hit. The doors sound more and more unstable.

           SLAM. Paul inches closer to the front of the building. He is 
           mere feet from the corner.

           INT. CHURCH -- CONTINUOUS

           The citizens of Laytonsville stand with their eyes glued to 
           the doors, which appear beaten and crippled.

           SLAM. The doors give more and more.

           Silence. The pounding stops. No more noise comes from 
           outside.

           Donny, Adam and Susan hold their breaths. They wait.

           EXT. CHURCH YARD -- CONTINUOUS

           Paul presses against the front corner of the building. He 
           takes one final breath and swallows.

           He swings around the corner, raising his rifle to his face.

           Nothing. The bright lights shine on the empty front door. 
           Fresh hoofprints mar the otherwise untouched snow. 

           Paul quickly scans the darkness with his eyes. He moves to 
           the front door.

           Deep cracks run down the two tall doors. 
           Branches and twigs snap in the trees. In the darkness just 
           outside of the range of the bright lights. Leaves rustle.

           INT. CHURCH -- CONTINUOUS

           Susan and Adam stare at the door. Their faces clouded in 
           fear.

           EXT. CHURCH YARD -- CONTINUOUS

           Paul takes a cautious step toward the trees. Then another. He 
           aims the rifle into the darkness. He can see nothing but the 
           first layer of thicket illuminated by the church lights.

           FROM INSIDE THE TREES, we see Paul approaching. His rifle 
           moves with his eyes as he searches the darkness.

           He enters the woods. The darkness nearly swallows him.

           TWIG SNAP. Paul swings his gun toward the sound and fires. 
           The bullet soars into the darkness and into the night. Miss.

           Paul quickly lowers his gun and pulls back the bolt. 
           MOVEMENT. It runs through the invisible trees as Paul slams 
           the bolt forward again.

           Backlit by the lights of the church, a hunched silhouette 
           runs behind Paul. Paul turns takes aim toward the creature.

           It stands, partially behind the trunk of a tree. The edge of 
           its brown fur glows around the silhouette from the lights 
           behind it. Its fur is raised. It stares at Paul.

           He has a shot, but the church is directly behind the 
           creature. Hit or miss, firing might send the bullet into the 
           building.

           As if sensing Paul's reluctance, the creature charges. It 
           crashes through the branches that hang in its way.

                                 PAUL
                           (to himself)
                        No...

           Paul barely has time to react before the creature is upon 
           him. He attempts to roll behind a tree.

           Barely moving out of the way, Paul loses the grip on his 
           rifle.  CRACK.  It makes contact with the creature as it 
           strides past.  The gun tumbles into the darkness.

           The rifle's gone.  He stumbles around the opposite side of 
           the tree and bolts toward the church. Branches slice across 
           his face as he runs.
           Behind him comes the sound of a raging beast. It is quickly 
           gaining.

           EXT. CHURCH YARD -- CONTINUOUS

           Paul bursts out of the trees. He runs toward the church's 
           doors with every fiber of his being.

           The creature emerges from the woods and into the light. We 
           see it clearly and directly for the first time.

           Its fur is thick and dark. Its legs are strong, but narrow at 
           the ankles. Its arms are long, hanging near its knees. Heavy 
           claws protrude from its apelike hands. Its body is thick. Its 
           long face snarls, revealing large, blood stained teeth. Its 
           fierce, yellow eyes shine in the light.

           It charges, back hunched, after Paul.  Paul sprints across 
           the sidewalk and reaches to his belt.  His pistol.

           The creature is nearly on top of him and Paul leaps toward 
           the doors.  He rotates in the air.

           The creature lunges for the kill.  Paul's back slams full 
           force into the wooden doors.  His pistol aims at the beast 
           from his stomach.

           The creature's claws are a fraction of an inch from sinking 
           into Paul's flesh.

           POP.  A flash.  A pained SHRIEK.  A mass of fur soars over 
           Paul's head as he falls to the ground.  The creature's head 
           collides with the door above him, rattling the entire church.

           INT. CHURCH -- CONTINUOUS

           The collision shakes the large wooden doors from the outside.  
           Everyone in the room holds their collective breaths.  No 
           sound from outside.

           EXT. CHURCH YARD -- CONTINUOUS

           Paul flops onto the concrete, gun in hand.  The large beast 
           lies nearly on top of him.  Its body motionless and crumpled 
           against the doorway.

           Paul breathes heavy. He stares at the monstrous animal from 
           his contorted position on the pavement. Blood slowly pools 
           under the creature. It lies still. Dead.

           As if nature itself calms, the wind and snow begin to lessen.

           Paul tosses his pistol into the dirt and lifts the creature's 
           powerful arm off of his legs.
                                 PAUL
                           (speaking to the door)
                        Donny.

           He breathes heavily.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Open the doors...

           INT. CHURCH -- CONTINUOUS

           Susan exhales an emotional breath.  Relief covers his face.  
           She pulls Adam close to her side.  He still looks frightened.

                                 SUSAN
                        He's okay.

           Donny rushes to the two large doors.

                                 DONNY
                        Give me a hand here!

           Another man steps from the group. He and Donny lift the 
           weakened beam from across the crippled doors. It falls to the 
           ground as the people slowly crowd around the exit.

           Donny pulls against one of the massive doors. It GROANS open. 
           Cold air rushes in. 

           The dead creature slumps onto the floor of the church. Its 
           yellow eyes stare lifelessly across the room.

           The people gasp and recoil.

           Susan sees Paul. He stands on the sidewalk.  Scratches and 
           mud cover his face and arms.

           EXT. CHURCH YARD -- CONTINUOUS

           Susan rushes past Donny. Past the fallen creature. She runs 
           to Paul.

           They embrace. He holds her tight. Closing his eyes, he rests 
           his face on her hair.

           She pulls back. She looks him over.

                                 SUSAN
                        Are you okay?

           He nods.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah...

           She takes his face in her hands, looking deep into his eyes.
                                 SUSAN
                        Are you with me now?

           He smiles.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah.

           He looks to the crowd.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (to crowd)
                        Everything's fine.

           The once violent storm now remains as nothing more than a 
           serene snowfall.

           The citizens of Laytonsville nervously make their way through 
           the door and over the dead creature. Adam exits with Donny.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Hey buddy!

           Adam runs and hugs his father.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Are you okay?

           Adam still squeezes his father. He nods into his shoulder.

           Paul smiles as Earl Lerner approaches him, glancing back at 
           the lifeless animal on the ground.

                                 EARL
                        Sheriff, can I talk to you?

           Paul releases Adam and stands. He walks to the side with 
           Earl. He smiles at him. Earl looks concerned

                                 PAUL
                        What is it Earl?

                                 EARL
                        It's just that... what we saw in 
                        that video and the pictures. And I 
                        could be wrong... but I coulda 
                        sworn what we saw was taller than 
                        this... taller than this by at 
                        least a foot.

           Paul's smile fades as he looks back at the beast.

           Earl walks back to the body and crouches down over it. He 
           looks worried.
                                 EARL (CONT'D)
                        I could be wrong...

           Paul squints in disbelief.

                                 ADAM
                        Dad.

           Paul turns to Adam, who stares at the trees in fear.

                                 SUSAN
                           (whispering)
                        Paul...

           Paul turns his gaze to Susan. She stares at the crowd of 
           people, who still stand near the door. Paul quickly follows 
           her eyes.

           The entire group stands frozen, all looking toward something 
           near the treeline behind Paul, Susan and Adam. Donny stands 
           in the front of the group. He swallows hard.

           Earl, too, now stares at the trees.

           Paul looks back to Susan and Adam as he slowly turns around, 
           toward the direction the crowd stares.

           Tall. Ferocious. A LARGER BEAST stands about twenty feet in 
           front of Paul, Susan and Adam. Its shoulders is wider. Its 
           head larger. 

           Its eyes look over the crowd. Then it sees it. The other 
           creature lying in a heap in the church doorway. The larger 
           beast seems to focus in on the dead one.

           The beast SHRIEKS an ear piercing shriek of sorrow and anger.  
           Its large teeth glint in the light. The crowd shakes from the 
           sound, but no one moves.

                                 DONNY
                           (whispering)
                        There were two...

           Paul, Susan and Adam stand exposed. The rest of the crowd 
           stands helplessly on the opposite side of the sidewalk.

           Paul slowly brings his hand to his holster. Its empty. His 
           gun lies in the dirt near the door...an eternity away.

           The creature hunches forward as if about to rush.

                                 PAUL
                           (whispering)
                        Donny...
           Donny sees Paul's empty holster. Slowly he moves his hand to 
           his. He finds it. He gently UNSNAPS his holster.

           The beast instantly turns its head toward the sound.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (Whispering)
                        Stop!

           Donny's hand freezes. The crowd of people behind him hold 
           their collective breaths.

           Again the creature turns its furious stare back to Paul. Back 
           to Susan. Back to Adam.

           Paul slowly looks behind him to his wife and child.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Step backwards slowly.

           They do. They both take one painfully slow step toward the 
           church doors.

           The creature lowers its head. It snarls its teeth.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (whispering)
                        Stop!

           Susan and Adam instantly freeze.

           Paul looks back to them. Fear covers their faces. Susan's 
           eyes show pure terror. Paul slowly turns his head back to the 
           creature. Its fur stands on end.

           Paul makes his decision.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (whispering)
                        Donny.

           Donny turns his eyes, not his head, toward Paul.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (whispering)
                        When I tell you...

           Donny looks down to his gun. He looks back to Paul nervously.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (yelling)
                        Right here!

           Paul throws both arms into the air high above his head. He 
           quickly steps to his left. Away from his family. Away from 
           the crowd.
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (screaming)
                        You won't hurt them!

           The beast instantly bobs its head in surprise. It turns its 
           entire attention toward Paul. It hunches its back and lowers 
           its head.

           Paul's voice cracks with emotion.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (screaming)
                        Come on! Right here! Right here.

           Donny looks on nervously. His hand still hangs over the gun. 
           He doesn't move an inch.

           The beast emits another powerful SHRIEK. The sound cuts 
           through the night like a knife.

           The powerful animal instantly lunges forward. It moves with 
           blinding speed.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (screaming)
                        ME!

           Its claws slice through the air as it closes in on Paul. It 
           bends its legs for its final attack.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (yelling)
                        Now!

           Donny pulls his pistol from its holster. He raises it. No 
           time to aim.

           Paul closes his eyes. His arms outstretch beside him.

           POP. POP. POP. Then darkness.

           Paul slowly opens his eyes. The creature stands five feet in 
           front of him. It takes a staggered step forward. It looks at 
           Paul with an animal intensity. It grunts and exhales through 
           its nose.

           Its arms fall limp. It struggles to hold its head up. Blood 
           gushes from its neck and ribs.

           Its legs give way. It falls to the ground.

           Paul lowers his arms. The beast lies on its back, staring 
           into the night sky. It breathes heavy. Then slowly. Then not 
           at all.  Dead.
           Paul turns to Adam and Susan. Tears of appreciation stream 
           down Susan’s face. 

           Paul walks to his family. He wraps his arms around his wife 
           and child. Susan cries in relief. Adam buries his face into 
           Paul's stomach and squeezes him with both arms.

           Paul looks to Earl Lerner, who glances up from the second 
           dead animal. Earl nods. That was the one.

           Paul exhales a breath he's been holding for months. Standing 
           in front of the small stone church, he holds onto his family 
           with all of his being.

           EXT. MAIN STREET -- DAWN

           Laytonsville awakens as the warm sun peeks over the treetops. 
           Yellow sunlight grows across the buildings. Cars and trucks 
           make their way through the snow plowed street. 

           Storekeepers and residents shovel snow from their sidewalks. 
           The sign on the diner door reads “OPEN.”

           Peaceful.

           INT. FOYER -- DAWN

           The Shield's large front door swings open. Paul, Susan and 
           Adam all enter. Paul hits the light as he closes the door.  
           He and Susan stand in the entrance.

                                 SUSAN
                           (to Adam)
                        Get ready for bed baby.

           Adam nods and begins running up the stairs. He stops.

                                 ADAM
                        Are there any more monsters?

           Paul smiles.

                                 PAUL
                        No. Everything's okay now.

           Adam seems satisfied as he turns and runs up the stairs.

           Paul turns back to Susan.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        You think I should go back out and 
                        help?
                                 SUSAN
                        I think the Forest Department and 
                        National Guard can handle it from 
                        here.

           He smiles and nods. A genuine smile.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        There you are...

           She smiles at him playfully.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        Mind if I stay over?

           Paul raises his eyebrows and smiles.

                                 PAUL
                        What you your mother think?

           Susan grins.

                                 SUSAN
                        Oh, she's out of town! She doesn't 
                        have to know...

           Paul laughs as he wraps his arms around Susan.

           Susan rests her head on her husband's shoulder. She looks 
           safe. Secure. Together they look complete.

                                                         FADE OUT:
