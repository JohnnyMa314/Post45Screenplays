           EXT. WHEAT FIELD - DAY - 1865

           A GRAY WOLF hovering on the perimeter of a dead wheat field.  
           Paw prints in the snow.

           EXT. HOG PEN - DAY

           SWINE in a pine lumber pen, ugly as hell and squealing.  With 
           no refuge from the cold, they are almost dead.  EDMUND HORN 
           JR. is in the pen with them, pouring cornmeal into the side 
           of an oak trough as the few healthy swine race up to him.

           Edmund is just over twenty, his clothes hanging off his thin 
           frame and his eyes dark and desperate, sunken deep into his 
           face.  It does not take him long to spot the wolf at the 
           forest’s edge, an unwelcome visitor only several yards off.

           INT. EDMUND'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Edmund enters a room with two wood frame beds and a cracked 
           dresser.  He finds his rifle case under the bed and opens it, 
           looking down at his father’s dusty HAWKEN .54 CAL RIFLE.

           EXT. TREES - DAY

           Squatting, Edmund’s eyes move with the wolf, back and forth, 
           his rifle balanced across his knee.  He digs in his pockets 
           and extracts the black powder measure, pouring it down the 
           muzzle of the gun.

           Edmund pinches a lead ball tightly between his fingertips, 
           but, before he can load the gun, he drops it, and the ball 
           disappears into the snow.

                                 EDMUND
                        Damn...damn.

           He digs in desperation for the bullet when he spots...

           A FIGURE, one hundred yards in the distance, silhouetted 
           under a sprawling oak tree. A man in a black winter coat and 
           broad-brimmed planter’s hat working like a bumblebee.  He is 
           slapping at the frozen ground with the back end of a shovel.

           It is the first person Edmund has set eyes on in a month.  
           There is no instinct in Edmund to call out to the man.  He 
           takes a slow and careful aim on the figure with his rifle, 
           watching him through the sight.
           Now the hogs are squealing in the distance.  Edmund can see 
           that, in the time that he lost his focus, the wolf has gained 
           confidence and ground, moving toward the pen.

           With a desperate reach, Edmund’s fingers find the lead bullet 
           on the ground.  He picks up the rifle and drops the wet ball 
           down into the muzzle, packing it roughly with the ramrod and 
           drawing it to full-cock.

           Edmund takes a bead on the wolf, and, with his numb hands 
           shaking, pulls the trigger...

           Click.  Then a hard sizzle as the powder ignites...

           BAM!  A burst of flame and black smoke as the gun backfires, 
           collapsing Edmund onto his back.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - THAT MOMENT

           FOREST/MOUNTAIN/SUNLIGHT and the silence of an Oregon winter 
           broken by the rippling thunder of a gunshot.

           EXT. TREES - DAY

           The gray wolf is gone.  Nothing but a dark line of pine 
           trees.  The figure under the sprawling oak is gone as well.  
           Every living thing has been scared off.

           Edmund has not noticed.  He is on his back on the ground, his 
           broken rifle mere feet away.  His wounded right hand 
           clutching the side of his face.  Black powder and red blood 
           coloring the snow.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CAMPSITE - DAY

           The remnants of a skirmish deep in the mountain woods.  
           Bloody arms and legs belonging to dead bodies are obscured by 
           the forest trees.

           WILLIAM “RED” BAKER, a large redhead suited in a bloodstained 
           Union Infantry jacket, pushes his way through the camp.

                                 RED BAKER
                             (calling out)
                        Fiddler...Fiddler.

           He finds two men under a pine, one crouching and the other 
           lying against the trunk.  The crouched man is bathed in the 
           shadow of the tall tree, his face concealed.  This man is 
           FIDDLER JOHN GOOD.
                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        What is it?

                                 RED BAKER
                        Sounded like what might have been 
                        gunfire.  Down the mountain.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        When?

                                 RED BAKER
                        A moment ago.  I heard it and came 
                        right over here and told you.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Wasn’t him.

           Red Baker finds this answer satisfying enough to leave the 
           two men in peace.

           The man lying under the tree, HARDWICK, is whimpering now.  
           He is old and bare-chested with dried blood across his 
           stomach, but it is too dark to see his wound.

                                 HARDWICK
                        Please.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Colonel, you are, at this moment,  
                        faced with an inevitability.  You 
                        are dying.  You will die on this 
                        mountain.  The time and the manner 
                        are, as of right now, uncertain, 
                        but die you must, and it must be 
                        here.  My Green River hunting knife 
                        is lodged in your gut.

           Hardwick is not looking at the man crouched over him, but, 
           rather, a girl lingering at her horse in the background.  She 
           is watching the exchange from afar.  Her name is EMILY MOORE.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Blood is coming out of your fat 
                        stomach and pouring into the 
                        ground.  Mixing with the earth.  
                        The scent from your blood and your 
                        insides will saturate these woods.  
                        I can hear the wolves circling now.  
                        Waiting for us to leave so they can 
                        have at you without interruption.

                                 HARDWICK
                             (struggling)
                        What do you want?
                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Was this all of your men?  Will 
                        there be any other Infantry units 
                        coming through this part of the 
                        mountain?

                                 HARDWICK
                        No.

           Fiddler John takes the man at his word.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        I’m looking for a man.  A 
                        gravedigger.  Toothless and  
                        wretched.  Smells of shit.  Came 
                        through here probably within the 
                        last two nights.  Goes by the name 
                        ‘Burial Perry’.

                                 HARDWICK
                        No.  No one come through this way.

           Blood is coming up in Hardwick’s mouth now, and he can barely 
           talk.  Fiddler John is visibly disappointed and gets up, 
           walking away.  Leaving the man to die.

           Emily, still watching from a distance, steps quietly over to 
           the dying man.  He looks at her with an empty stare.

                                 HARDWICK (CONT’D)
                        Please.

           Emily maneuvers silently, removing a Paterson Colt revolver 
           from the hip holster of an UNOBSERVANT GUNMAN and quickly 
           aims and pulls the trigger. 

           BAM!  The gunfire echoes through the woods and, in the blink 
           of an eye, Emily has five pistols pointed at her.

           Fiddler John emerges from the crowd of men, unarmed, and, 
           calmly, holds his hand out to Emily.  Light breaks the canopy 
           of trees and we can finally see his face, fierce and 
           murderous.  She hands him back the Paterson Colt.

           He looks over at Hardwick, now dead and limp on the ground.  
           No more pain in his eyes.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                             (to Emily)
                        Next time you’re dead.

           He walks away from her.
           INT. SUPPLY CELLAR - LATER

           Edmund’s scarred hand shoved into a bucket of water.  The 
           water turns red.

                                 EDMUND (V.O.)
                        Southern Willamette Outpost Log 
                        Entry 516.  First week of the New 
                        Year, Sixty-Five.

           Edmund, kneeling in a corner of the dark supply cellar, pulls 
           the cork out of a bottle of whiskey and reads quickly from 
           Charles Dulles’ “ACCIDENTS AND EMERGENCIES: A MANUAL” by the 
           light of an oil lamp.  

           The page marked “GUNSHOT WOUNDS” is propped open and marked 
           with dried blood.

           Edmund takes a long pull from the whiskey bottle and then 
           tips the remainder onto his hand, the liquor pouring into the 
           water bucket below.

                                 EDMUND (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        A different set of handwriting 
                        here.  At the end.  A different 
                        handwriting, as this should be my 
                        first and my last entry into these 
                        records.

           A canister of hartshorn.  Edmund applies the white powder as 
           best he can onto his wounds, tears running down his face.

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

           Edmund, with his wounds poorly dressed, sitting in a rocking 
           chair.  He has a vague look, defeated, puffing a cigarette.

                                 EDMUND (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Major General Edmund James Horn, 
                        retired Pinkerton detective and US 
                        army officer, deceased.  Four weeks 
                        I could guess.  Pneumonia.  Buried 
                        on this spot by his only son, 
                        Edmund Horn Jr.

           A WHITE CROSS in the snowy ground at the side of the 
           farmhouse.  

                                 EDMUND (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The ground was almost too frozen to 
                        dig into.

           Edmund watching the trees.  Unending isolation.
           INT. SUPPLY CELLAR - NIGHT

           Edmund is carrying oak barrels into the cellar from the 
           outside trapdoor.

                                 EDMUND (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Outpost will be abandoned within 
                        the appropriate amount of time, a 
                        day or two at most, as conditions 
                        have become too harsh.  In keeping 
                        with original caretaker’s intent, 
                        all supplies will be kept here, 
                        ready and available, for Union 
                        officer or soldier in need or any 
                        member of the agency.

           Edmund looses his footing on the wet stairs and the last 
           barrel topples, brine and meat pouring out onto the dirt 
           floor of the cellar.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Edmund returns the broken rifle back to its case.

                                 EDMUND (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I have decided to leave the logbook 
                        here as well.

           He draws an “X” with the blood from his finger on the top of 
           the pine case and pushes it back under the bed.

                                 EDMUND (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I could never presume that anyone 
                        will read it, but I will keep it 
                        here.  Before starting off.  As a 
                        marker.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Edmund is writing in a journal at his father’s desk, dipping 
           his steel pen into a small ink vial.

                                 EDMUND (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        E.H. Junior.

           CLOSE ON EDMUND’S SIGNATURE.  Scribbled on the page.

           He turns the book to the front, reading by candlelight:  
           “SOUTHERN WILLAMETTE PASS PINKERTON OUTPOST LOG: MAJ. GEN. 
           EDMUND JAMES HORN”.  He reads his father’s name, and then he 
           returns the journal to a drawer in the desk.
           INT. BEDROOM - MIDNIGHT

           A NOISE inside the house.  Edmund’s eyes pop open.  He keeps 
           himself motionless on the bed, listening in the dark.

           Now the hogs in the pen outside are SQUEALING.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MIDNIGHT

           Edmund tiptoes into the front room, peering out the window 
           through the ragged curtains.  He can see the hogs disturbed 
           and pacing in the pen.

           Edmund cranks up the oil lamp, and he spots a long planter’s 
           hat sitting on the dinner table.

                                 PERRY (O.S.)
                        Put the goddamn light out!

           Edmund starts, turning about to see a figure in the corner of 
           the room.

                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                        Said put that thing out, boy.  
                        ‘Less you want us both killed.

           Hiding in the shadow only feet away is BURIAL PERRY.  Perry 
           moves by Edmund and lowers the flame in the lamp, sending the 
           room into darkness.  He does not linger beside Edmund, but 
           races by him again, glancing in the doorway of each room.

                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                        Where you keepin’ the garmits, boy?  
                        Come out with it.

                                 EDMUND
                        I...

           This old man was the figure standing under the oak tree only 
           this morning.  His overlarge black coat is full of holes and 
           tears and cinched by a gun holster.  Edmund can see that the 
           man has not one tooth in his entire mouth.

                                 PERRY
                        Wait now...hold it.  First things 
                        are gonna be first.  We can’t get 
                        outta order.  Sit down.

           The man is agitated.  He moves quickly back into a dark 
           corner of the room.
                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                        I ain’t gonna do nuthin’ to ya’, 
                        boy.

                                 EDMUND
                        I don’t have any money for you 
                        here.

                                 PERRY
                        Okay...that’s what they call a 
                        ‘assumption’.  Over here now.

           Edmund turns to see Perry has a gun on him.

                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                        Bring that chair this way.  Over 
                        here.

           Edmund seats himself in the corner of the room, and Perry 
           moves behind him.

           Perry has a leather haversack slung across his front, and he 
           reaches in and finds a measure of thick rope.  He ties up 
           Edmund in the wooden chair, his hands behind his back and his 
           legs together.

                                 EDMUND
                        You told me you weren’t gonna do 
                        nothing to me.

                                 PERRY
                        You’re goddamn right.  You’ll be 
                        safe with me.  I’m a bunny rabbit.

           Perry moves across the room and brings back an oil lamp.

                                 EDMUND
                        You got no cause to tie me up.

                                 PERRY
                        I don’t want no harm to come to 
                        ya’.  Me neither.

           Perry grabs a handful of Edmund’s hair and wrenches Edmund’s 
           head back.  Edmund can feel the old man looking into his 
           mouth, and he can smell his awful breath.

                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                        Where’s mommy and daddy?

           Edmund gags.  He can’t answer.
                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                        I saw this camp about a hundred 
                        yards off.  Conducted what it was.  
                        ‘Outpost’ I said to myself.  Like 
                        an oasis.  Right in the middle of 
                        fuck nowhere.

           Perry has his dirty hand inside Edmund’s mouth, feeling his 
           teeth for fillings.

                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                        Nuthin’.  I figurd.  No mountain 
                        boy’s got any real valuables.  Got 
                        no means.  Always checkin’ though.

           He lets Edmund go, and Edmund cannot help but spit on the 
           ground.

                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                        Garmits, boy.

           INT. BEDROOM - MIDNIGHT

           Perry is perched up on Edmund’s bed, shuffling through 
           clothes in the dresser.  He takes them out and sizes them up.

                                 PERRY
                        These clothes are too fuckin’ big.

           He finally comes upon on a black Chesterfield coat.

                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                        Oh my...

           Perry removes his overcoat and holster and puts on the 
           Chesterfield.

                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                        Now this is warmth I tell you what.  
                        Look at you, boy.  Dressin’ up like 
                        a goddamn lawman.

                                 EDMUND
                        That’s my father’s coat.

           Edmund, tied up, can see the rifle case under the bed where 
           Perry is seated.

                                 PERRY
                        Well, he ain’t gonna mind.
                                 EDMUND
                        He’ll mind when he comes back and I 
                        tell him what happened to all his 
                        clothes.

                                 PERRY
                        You go right ahead, boy.  It ain’t 
                        your daddy I’m afraid of.

           Perry finds a pair of old Wellington boots as well and puts 
           them on.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MIDNIGHT

           Perry, a dandy in his new garments, moves to the cellar 
           trapdoor.

                                 EDMUND
                        Hold on.

           Perry stops.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        Hold on now.  You can’t leave me 
                        like this.

                                 PERRY
                        You’ll be alright, boy.  Your 
                        daddy’ll find ya when he comes 
                        back.

           Perry opens the trapdoor and makes it halfway down the steps.

                                 EDMUND
                        I lied.  No one’s gonna find me.  
                        It’s just me here.  I don’t mind 
                        you taking those clothes or any 
                        bread or liquor you need.  But you 
                        can’t leave me like this.  Tied up 
                        in this chair.

                                 PERRY
                        You’ll be sweet then?

           Edmund does not respond.  He feels helpless now, more than 
           ever.  Perry walks over and begins to untie him.

                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                        You look trustworthy enough.  
                             (mumbles to himself)
                        Can’t leave him here all tied up.  
                        Middle of fuck nowhere.  That’s a 
                        goddamn death sentence.
           Edmund wiggles his hands loose and begins rubbing his burned 
           wrists.

                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                        Now, we’re friendly, right?  Let’s 
                        load up Belle.

           Perry moves quickly over to the trapdoor and disappears.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Belle is an old Morgan horse, worn-down and tired, tied up 
           outside the house to the same hitching post as Edmund’s mare.

           Perry pushes open the cellar door and climbs outside into the 
           cold air.  His arms are bursting with supplies taken from the 
           outpost, and he begins to load up the pommel bags.  Edmund is 
           in tow.

                                 PERRY
                        I heard a gunshot this morning, so 
                        they’re close by.  Won’t be more 
                        ‘an two days at most fore er come 
                        an army of men into these woods.

           Edmund’s eyes catch Perry’s crude branding on his horse.  A 
           horrible-looking “P” burned into Belle’s hide.

                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        Two days is plenty of time, though.  
                        Should be plenty enough.

           Perry unties Belle and mounts her.

                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                        Listen, boy.  It goes without me 
                        speaking it that you ain’t seen me.  
                        We ain’t crossed paths.  The 
                        Fiddler’s comin’ this way.  More 
                        ‘an anything, I can feel him.

           Perry turns to face the black line of trees as a gust of 
           freezing wind comes through the clearing.

                                 PERRY (CONT’D)
                        He’s on his way now.  He don’t 
                        sleep, so I can’t neither.
                             (Looks down at Edmund)
                        You don’t talk much, do ya boy?

                                 EDMUND
                        I’m listening.
                                 PERRY
                        I can respect that.  The best I can 
                        wish you now is that the rain 
                        comin’ my way don’t fall on you 
                        none.  But nuthin is guaranteed.

           Perry gives him a wide, toothless grin and pulls the reins, 
           making his way into the darkness of the surrounding woods.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT

           Riders on horseback traveling through a passage in the 
           mountain, their torches casting long shadows behind them.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE CAMPSITE - NIGHT

           Red Baker is crouched and watching the long line of torches 
           moving a mile below.  He sits with TEN CHARLEY, part Mexican, 
           part Cherokee, and dressed half in an under-sized Union 
           infantry uniform.

                                 RED BAKER
                        It looks like ghost light.

                                 CHARLEY
                        What do you think?

                                 RED BAKER
                        Home Guard.

                                 CHARLEY
                        We’re too far north.  That’s what 
                        Fiddler said.

                                 RED BAKER
                        What about you then?

           Charley can see Fiddler John watching the light as well only 
           a few yards away.

                                 CHARLEY
                        Maybe a patrol.  Maybe the Colonel 
                        was lying and it’s a second outfit.  
                        Don’t look like it though.  Looks 
                        more disorganized.

                                 RED BAKER
                        Sure.
                                 CHARLEY
                        Either way.  They ain’t on our 
                        trail.  They’re movin’ away from 
                        us.

           Red Baker turns around.  There is a dark tent set up only 
           feet away.

                                 CHARLEY (CONT’D)
                        After tonight, we should be alone 
                        through this pass until we find 
                        him.  Then it’s a day and a half’s 
                        travel to Stevens.

                                 RED BAKER
                        He sure is takin’ his sweet time.

           Charley turns to the tent as well.

           INT. CALVIN ED’S TENT - NIGHT

           CALVIN ED, short and sweaty-faced, is kneeling over Emily on 
           a field cot.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        I swear you do look beautiful.  
                        With the moonlight.  The moonlight 
                        off the tent.
                             (laughs)
                        I’m no good with vocabulary.

                                 EMILY
                        Thank you, C.E.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        Come on then.  Let’s have another.

                                 EMILY
                        We’ve been in here all night.  The 
                        other boys are gonna want their 
                        turn.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        They don’t mind.  You know they 
                        don’t know you like I do.  You and 
                        me.  We understand each other.

           He crawls on top of her.  Emily’s body is shaking.

                                 EMILY
                             (afraid)
                        The Fiddler’s gonna be in.
                                 CALVIN ED
                        Hush up now.  Tell me again how 
                        much you love me.

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Edmund’s empty bedroom.  Edmund’s rifle case is sitting on 
           his bed.  Open and empty.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Edmund slowly wakes up.  He is sitting at the dinner table 
           with his head down and his hands clutching the rifle.  He 
           lifts his head, looks out through the window, and sees the 
           white cross in the side yard.

           He gets up and takes the journal out of the desk drawer, 
           reading his father’s handwriting.

                                 MAJ. GEN. HORN (V.O.)
                        There was a silver-blue fox I 
                        killed near the Snake River.  Shot 
                        him.  Skinned him.  Dressed his 
                        hide with salt.  I will give it to 
                        Edmund and spread it on the floor 
                        so that when he gets up in the 
                        morning he can put his feet on it.

           A cloud has passed over the farmhouse turning the room dark, 
           and Edmund’s eye turns to the bright front window where he 
           can see out across the cold morning, the dead wheat field and 
           the forest beyond.

           Looking back at him from a hundred yards in the distance is a  
           single, sprawling oak tree.  Dirty snow around the bottom of 
           the trunk.

           EXT. OAK TREE - DAY

           Edmund unmounts his horse and ties her to the trunk of the 
           tree.  He squats over the burial spot.

                                 EDMUND
                             (to his horse)
                        What do you think?

           He grabs the shovel he loaded and starts his work.
           EXT. OAK TREE - LATER

           The metal of the shovel piercing into the hard ground.  After 
           only a moment, he unearths two satchels covered in dirt and 
           lays them out.

           A loud SQUAWK.  Edmund looks up to see an enormous black crow 
           sitting in the branches above him.  He surveys the area.  No 
           other sign of life as far as the eye can see.

           He brushes away the dirt and the satchels are CONFEDERATE 
           ARMY KNAPSACKS.  The Confederate flag, officer insignia, and 
           regiment number stitched and pressed in the corner of each 
           bag.

           He opens the first knapsack and finds: TWENTY DRAWSTRING 
           LEATHER POUCHES.  A MATCHBOX.  A KNIFE WRAPPED IN CLOTH.  

           Edmund unwraps the knife from the dirty cloth.  Dried blood 
           on the blade and the handle.

           The matchbox has the word “Perry” scribbled on top of it, 
           and, inside, teeth.  Each one with a gold filling and blood 
           on the root where it was, undoubtedly, torn out.

           Every pouch is closed with a drawstring and has block 
           printing pressed into the dark leather that reads “PROPERTY 
           OF OROFINO CREEK MINES”.  Edmund opens the first one...

           GOLD.  He does not react to it at first.  The coins are 
           dirty.  Gold Double Eagles.  Lady Liberty and a twenty dollar 
           marking on the front of each coin.  Probably fifty coins in 
           each pouch.  A gift from the dead Gold Rush.

           Edmund opens another.  The same.  He catches his breath.  The 
           second knapsack.  He opens it.  Nothing but Orofino Creek 
           pouches this time.  Four times as many as the first knapsack.

                                 EDMUND
                        Thank you.

           Another piercing SQUAWK.  

           Edmund ties up the two open pouches just as they were.  He 
           moves the second knapsack with the heavier load to the side 
           and works on the first. He puts the knife back and the 
           matchbox.

           He throws this first sack back into the hole in the ground 
           and starts to shovel dirt into the hole with his hands.
                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                             (to his horse)
                        Let’s keep this one between you and 
                        me.

           He is working on his hands and knees.  The second Confederate 
           knapsack is lying in the snow at his feet.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The coins from the knapsack are spread irresponsibly across 
           Edmund’s dinner table.  Edmund is slouched in the corner of 
           the room.

           There are two DAGUERREOTYPE PORTRAITS hung on the front wall 
           in old frames...

           The first, a bust-length shot of Edmund’s FATHER in a dark 
           suit.  Sober.  Prosperous.

           The second, a shot of Edmund’s MOTHER, calm and serene.

           Edmund looks up at her from the ground.  She looks back 
           through the dirty glass.

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           Edmund is on horseback deep in the woods.  Sunlight and snow 
           cannot even break the canopy of the trees. He travels slowly 
           along a narrow path.

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DUSK

           Edmund is digging in a spot hidden between two pines where 
           the ground is soft.

           He leaves his shovel and finds the Confederate knapsack 
           stored on his horse.  He looks in the knapsack.  EMPTY.  He 
           throws it into the hole in the ground.

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

           Edmund is laying down beside a small fire in the cold.  The 
           smoke from the fire rises through the trees and disappears.

           GUNFIRE.  Edmund bolts upright.  One or more MEN are YELLING.  
           More GUNFIRE.
           It seems to be coming from all around him.  Commotion in 
           every direction.  The forest is so dense here that he cannot 
           see a thing.  

           He quickly puts out the fire.

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - MORNING

           By morning Edmund is already gone, but he has not covered his 
           tracks very well.  The fire has become a black pock mark in 
           the earth, and his shovel is still sitting propped up against 
           one of the pines.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Fiddler John and his men sit on horseback in front of 
           Edmund’s farmhouse.

                                 CHARLEY
                        Don’t look deserted.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Sure ain’t.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

           Fiddler John silhouetted in the open doorway of the house.  
           He inspects the room, noticing the desk in the corner.

           The Fiddler opens all the drawers in the desk and comes upon 
           The Outpost Log.  He turns quickly through the pages.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Fiddler John opens the bedroom door, looking into the empty 
           room.

           EXT. RIVER - DAY

           A DEAD HORSE in the shallow riverbed.  Slumped on its side, 
           it’s a broken mass in the freezing water.  Blood still 
           running with the current.

           Edmund has caught sight of it and stopped on his route back 
           home.  He dismounts and approaches the horse in the river.  
           He runs his fingers along three bullet holes in the neck and 
           head.
           Looking upstream, he sees a second HORSE.  Lying dead on the 
           forest floor.  He moves back out of the river and spots the 
           branded “P” on its back.

                                 EDMUND
                        Belle...

           Belle has similar gunshot wounds, but she is also ripped 
           open.  Bloody.  Her stomach and side have been taken apart.  

           Edmund tries to steady himself but cannot, and he throws up 
           on his hands and knees beside the horse.

           A GARTER SNAKE is moving slowly around the neck of the horse 
           and off onto the ground toward the bushes nearby.  Edmund 
           watches the snake.

           In the distance, obscured by the trees, Edmund can see a pack 
           of GRAY WOLVES circling their prey.  They have been scared 
           off for a moment, but it will not last long.

           Now, the garter snake is slithering around something else 
           near the bushes.  Only after Edmund has taken his attention 
           away from the wolves does he see that it is a FOOT.

           EXT. BUSHES - DAY

           Edmund crawls quickly over on his hands and knees, everything 
           about the situation telling him that it is Perry.

           A BOOT.  A LEG.  He tears the bushes aside.

           EMILY.  Unconscious.  He brushes her hair back and puts his 
           hand against her nose and mouth feeling for breath.

           Bruised around her face and forehead, she is dressed not like 
           a lady, but in men’s pants and shirt with a long riding coat.

           Edmund tosses the snake away and lifts his head to see the 
           gray wolves circling.

           EXT. FOREST EDGE - DAY

           Edmund is squatting at the forest’s edge, watching the new 
           visitors at his farmhouse through the trees.  He is staying 
           out of sight and silent, his horse tied up behind him with 
           Emily on its back.

           VIEW ON THE FARMHOUSE:  They have set up THREE A-FRAME TENTS 
           off of the front yard in the field.  It only looks to be 
           three or four men.  Smoke rising from a fire near one of the 
           tents.  Edmund can hear them laughing and carrying on.
           EXT. CAMP - DAY

           Ten Charley is adjusting the cavalry bridle on his horse when 
           he sees Edmund ride out into the clearing and dismount.

           Charley opens his coat and slides his hand over his revolver.

                                 CHARLEY
                        ‘Lo there, boy.

           Edmund nods, but continues to lead his horse by the reins 
           towards the hitching post.  Charley catches sight of the 
           girl.

                                 CHARLEY (CONT’D)
                        John!

           Fiddler John unfolds himself from inside the first tent and 
           approaches.  He has a sharp, fierce look that takes Edmund 
           off guard.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                             (eyes on Edmund)
                        You’re a Horn?  The junior one?

                                 EDMUND
                        Yes, sir.  Edmund.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Edmund, then.  We’ve been expecting 
                        you.

           Fiddler John smiles and shakes his hand.  Edmund spots his 
           Union dress as an officer’s, wearing a dark blue greatcoat 
           with epaulettes and an eagle insignia.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Colonel John Good.  Company G, Camp 
                        Watson.  This is Charley.  Where is 
                        your warden, son?

                                 EDMUND
                        In the ground, Colonel.  At the 
                        side of the yard.

           The Fiddler turns his head, taking note of TWO GRAVES WITH 
           WHITE CROSSES at the side of the yard.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        My condolences.

                                 EDMUND
                        Colonel, I was out by the riverbed 
                        and...
                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Yes.  We know this woman.  Let’s 
                        get her inside.  Charley...

                                 CHARLEY
                        Yes, sir.

           Edmund and Charley move to the horse and hoist the girl down.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

           Ten Charley and Edmund move through the front door carrying 
           the unconscious girl between them.

           As they pass the dinner table, Edmund unknowingly steps on a 
           small pouch on the ground that reads “OROFINO CREEK MINES”.  
           No one notices as the pouch gets wedged deep between the 
           floorboards, only showing a small corner.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           The two men move into the bedroom.

                                 CHARLEY
                        Lay her down here.  Easy.

           Charley and Edmund lay the girl across Edmund’s bed.

                                 CHARLEY (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me.

           Charley moves by Edmund to the head of the bed, examining the 
           patient.

                                 CHARLEY (CONT’D)
                        I saw the Franklin in the front 
                        room there?

                                 EDMUND
                        Yes, sir.

                                 CHARLEY
                        Would you do me a favor and put on 
                        some coffee for the Colonel?

           Edmund pauses near the door.

                                 CHARLEY (CONT’D)
                             (turning)
                        If you would be kind enough.
           Edmund nods, and, turning to the door, almost runs face first 
           into Calvin Ed, who is standing sheepishly in the doorway.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        Need my help in here?

           Calvin Ed’s eyes are locked on the girl.

                                 CHARLEY
                        No.  Go help Baker with the 
                        prisoner.

           Calvin Ed gives Edmund a hard look and exits.  

           As he moves away, Edmund notices his rifle case on the 
           dresser.  Open and empty.  They have already been inside the 
           house.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Edmund has a pot of coffee brewing on the cast-iron stove 
           when he sees Charley emerge alone from the bedroom and move 
           out the front door.

           Edmund watches through the window as Charley confers quietly 
           with Fiddler John by the tents.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Fiddler John is perched casually on a camp chair, blacking 
           his cavalry boots.  Edmund appears in the front doorway with 
           the coffee.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Edmund!

           The Fiddler motions for Edmund to come over to him.  Edmund 
           hands him a coffee cup and takes a seat.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Coffee?

                                 EDMUND
                        The closest we get to it.  Parched 
                        peas and some wheat.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Any coffee beans in it?
                                 EDMUND
                        Some.  Arbuckle’s.  We don’t have 
                        much left here, Colonel.  Will the 
                        girl be alright?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        She’ll be fine, Edmund.  I’m sure 
                        you’ve noticed that we have your 
                        firearm as well.  I apologize.  
                        This is just one of our normal 
                        safety precautions.  Hopefully, it 
                        won’t inconvenience you too much.  
                        No sense having any accidents or 
                        misunderstandings.

                                 EDMUND
                        It’s broken, so, no matter.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Is it?  I’ll have C.E. look at it.

           In the background, just beyond the Fiddler, Edmund can see 
           the shorter soldier (Calvin Ed) hoisted up on a chair TYING A 
           NOOSE TO A TREE.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Soon as the man feels a little more 
                        able, of course.  Rattlesnake bit 
                        through his cavalry boot only just 
                        last night. Put its hooks right 
                        into his left foot and the damn 
                        thing would just not let go.  
                        Diligent creature, the serpent.  
                        Continued upkeep and maintenances 
                        on one’s shoewear, Edmund.  Most 
                        important thing a man can teach 
                        himself, living out in the Lord’s 
                        far reaches.

                                 EDMUND
                        Colonel...

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Edmund, we have what you might call 
                        a delicate situation on our hands.  
                        I wouldn’t dare worry you with all 
                        the vile details, but, suffice it 
                        to say, we have a prisoner under 
                        our guard right now who needs 
                        dealing with.  He is a dangerous 
                        man.  A thief.  As you and I both 
                        know, a thief can be just as 
                        poisonous as the most vicious 
                        killer.
           Fiddler John smiles widely as Edmund’s eyes turn to the camp.  
           Charley and Red Baker are pulling Perry out of a tent.  His 
           hands and feet are tied.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Of course, you would not have to be 
                        bothered by any of this, Edmund, 
                        except that it’s over a day’s 
                        travel out of this pass through the 
                        mountain to Fort Stevens, and I 
                        deem the matter more urgent than 
                        that type of travel will allow.  Do 
                        you understand?

                                 EDMUND
                        Yes, sir.

           The soldiers remove Perry’s hat and put his balding head 
           through the noose.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        I can only hope that you might be 
                        kind enough to grace us with your 
                        hospitality and allow us camp in 
                        this field for the time allotted to 
                        clear up this simple 
                        misunderstanding.

                                 EDMUND
                        Of course, sir.

           Edmund can see Charley turn to them from the temporary 
           gallows they have set up across the yard.

                                 CHARLEY
                        Colonel!

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                             (keeping his eyes on 
                              Edmund)
                        Yes, Charley?

                                 CHARLEY
                        We’re all ready.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Thank you.
                             (to Edmund)
                        Please join us, Edmund.
           EXT. TREE - DAY

           Fiddler John and Edmund approach the party waiting for them 
           under the tree.  Perry is standing precariously on a wooden 
           chair with his head in the noose.

           Only now does Edmund see that none of the uniforms fit the 
           men.  The Union dress on each soldier is either too big 
           around the chest and legs or too small around the arms and 
           neck.

           Perry sees Edmund walking towards him.

                                 PERRY
                        Boy!  Boy!  Thank Jesus!  Tell the 
                        Fiddler I had nuthin with me!  
                        Nuthin on me at all!  Tell em!

           Fiddler John ignores the old man’s pleas.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                             (pointing out Calvin Ed)
                        Edmund, this is C.E. Caldwell from 
                        El Paso.

                                 CALVIN ED
                             (to Edmund)
                        Calvin Ed.

           Edmund shakes the soldier’s hand.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                             (pointing out Red Baker)
                        And this here is William Red Baker.

                                 RED BAKER
                        Nice to meet you, Edmund.

                                 EDMUND
                        You too.

           Edmund shakes the man’s hand, looking up at his forehead 
           where he has an almost-healed yet conspicuous bullethole 
           wound.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        And you’ve met Charley.

           Charley nods at Edmund.
                                 PERRY
                        Well, boy, now that you’ve met 
                        everyone and we’re all cordial and 
                        mannerly would ya be so kind as to 
                        tell these men...

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                             (to Perry)
                        We heard you Perry.  Please don’t 
                        interrupt me again.

           Perry’s mouth closes.  Waiting.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (to Edmund)
                        You’ve seen this man before?

                                 EDMUND
                        Yes, sir.  Two nights ago I found 
                        him inside my house.

                                 PERRY
                        Tell em what it was I’m doin boy!  
                        I’m just lookin’ fer food and 
                        spirits!  I swear, Fiddler!  
                        Flathead has what you lookin fer!

                                 EDMUND
                             (to Fiddler John)
                        He’s not lying, Colonel.  He didn’t 
                        have anything with him.  Nothing 
                        that I saw.  He was just in need of 
                        some bread and some water.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        And he took nothing from you?

           Edmund is not sure which way he should go.

                                 EDMUND
                        That black Chesterfield he has on.  
                        That was my father’s.

                                 PERRY
                        Wait, please...

           Before he can finish, Fiddler John walks over and kicks the 
           chair out from under the old man.  

           PERRY FALLS BUT HIS NECK DOES NOT BREAK.  HE TWISTS AND GAGS.
                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                             (to Edmund)
                        This man hanging from your oak tree 
                        is ‘Burial’ Perry Parker.  I know 
                        him very well, and I am not very 
                        fond of him.

           Everyone is watching Perry die except Fiddler John.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I met him a long time ago in 
                        Lawrence, Kansas.  Digging in the 
                        ditches for bodies.  He’s a grave 
                        robber and a thief.  Vile and 
                        wretched.  He has something that 
                        belongs to me, and I want it back.  
                        He wouldn’t have the item on him.  
                        It would be buried.  Deep in these 
                        woods.

                                 PERRY
                             (strangled gasps)
                        Okay!  Okay!  Please!

           Fiddler John gives the old man hanging from the tree a hard 
           look and reaches out his hand.  Red Baker hands him a 
           revolver.  The Fiddler takes a careful aim and squeezes...

           BAM!  The bullet sails just over Perry’s head and cuts the 
           rope in half.  Perry collapses in a mass on the ground.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                             (hands back the revolver)
                        Thank you, Red.

           Fiddler John motions to Charley, who grabs a handful of 
           Perry’s hair and drags him off to the tents.  The other two 
           soldiers follow.  Fiddler John turns to Edmund.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry that you had to see that.  
                        It was not very pleasant.

           Edmund watches Perry as he is dragged off.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I hope that you will forgive us the 
                        intrusion on you.  It looks like, 
                        in the least, we will be here 
                        overnight.  My men are happy enough 
                        to eat outside at the tents 
                        tonight, so we will be of no bother 
                        to you.
                                 EDMUND
                        No.  No, I’ll have supper ready for 
                        your men in the house.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Thank you, Edmund.

           Fiddler John turns and moves back to the camp.  Edmund’s eyes 
           are fixed on the broken noose lying at his feet in the snow.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

           Edmund, pacing back and forth, watches through the window as 
           Perry leads the soldiers to the sprawling oak tree just 
           beyond the wheat field.

                                 EDMUND
                        Don’t do it, Perry.

           EXT. OAK TREE - THAT MOMENT

           The four soldiers are on horseback, and Perry is on foot.  He 
           is tied by the hands to the last rider.

                                 PERRY
                        This is it, Fiddler.  This is where 
                        it was.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                             (to Calvin Ed)
                        Untie him and give him the shovel.

           Calvin Ed dismounts and throws the shovel hard at Perry.

                                 PERRY
                             (to all the soldiers)
                        What about Belle?  What about my 
                        girl?

                                 CHARLEY
                        Was that your horse?

                                 PERRY
                        Yes, sir.

                                 CHARLEY
                        Last I saw she was fixin’ to be 
                        dinner for a pack of wolves.

           Perry almost drops the shovel.  Tears are glinting in his 
           eyes.
                                 PERRY
                        Now, why’d you go an do that?  My 
                        poor Belle.  She weren’t such a bad 
                        girl.  Never did no one no harm...

           Fiddler John cocks his pistol.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Dig.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Edmund watching on pins and needles.

           EDMUND’S VIEW:  Perry is digging and, after only a moment, 
           draws one dirt-covered knapsack from the ground.  He pauses, 
           and then he starts to dig deeper.

           EXT. OAK TREE - THAT MOMENT

           Calvin Ed is on the ground looking inside the Confederate 
           knapsack.

                                 CALVIN ED
                             (to Fiddler John)
                        Looks to be about a quarter of it.  
                        Maybe less.
                             (holding up the matchbox)
                        Some teeth.

                                 PERRY
                             (digging feverishly)
                        It was all here.  I swear it.  I 
                        swear that it was.

           Charley sidles his horse up to Fiddler John.

                                 CHARLEY
                        What do you think?

           Fiddler John dismounts.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Edmund, watching, knows what is coming before the victim 
           does.

           EDMUND’S VIEW:  Perry climbs out of the hole toward the 
           Fiddler.  He kneels in front of him, begging.
           Fiddler John has his pistol drawn.  Perry, in a last ditch 
           effort, points in the direction of the farmhouse.  Pleading.  
           Sweat pouring down his face.  Putting all the blame on the 
           only other person that he can think of.

           Fiddler John does not look in Edmund’s direction.  He aims 
           his gun at Perry’s head and, calm as day, pulls the trigger.

           BAM!  White smoke.  The thunder of the gunshot echoing 
           through the clearing.  Perry crumbles to the ground.

           Edmund can hear the hogs in the pen start to SQUEAL again.

           EXT. WHEAT FIELD - DAY

           Fiddler John and Charley are making their way back to the 
           camp when they spot Edmund walking out toward them.  The 
           three figures meet on the horizon, two on horseback, one on 
           foot.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Edmund.  There’s nothing for you 
                        back that way.  You come along with 
                        us.

                                 EDMUND
                        Yes, sir.  Your business is your 
                        business.  But that man over there 
                        layin’ face down in the snow still 
                        has some things that belong to me.

                                 CHARLEY
                        Red’ll get ‘em for you.

                                 EDMUND
                        Yes, sir.  But I’d just as soon get 
                        them myself.  Thank you.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Alright, Edmund.  You go on.

           Edmund makes his way past the soldiers.

           EXT. OAK TREE - DAY

           Red Baker and Calvin Ed, the designated gravediggers, are 
           already knee deep in the ground when Edmund arrives.

                                 RED BAKER
                        Come to give us a hand, kid?  The 
                        ground’s almost frozen solid.
                                 EDMUND
                        Winter ‘round here is not a good 
                        time for a man to meet his end.  
                        You end up with no place to put 
                        him.

           Edmund moves over to Perry’s dead body.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        He’s gotta get in the ground quick, 
                        though.  The stink is gonna bring 
                        the wolves.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        The Colonel know you’re here?

           Edmund turns Perry’s body over.  The life is gone from his 
           eyes.  A bullet hole over his right eye.  Blood still pouring 
           out into the snow.  

           The soldiers can see it on Edmund’s face.

                                 RED BAKER
                        First one you seen, kid?

                                 EDMUND
                        No.

           Edmund regains himself and removes the Chesterfield coat and 
           Wellington boots that Perry had on him.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        It ain’t proper to bury a man in no 
                        footwear whatsoever.  Man’s gotta 
                        have the things he needs going 
                        across.

                                 EDMUND
                        These belong to me.  I wasn’t the 
                        one decided to shoot him.

           Edmund moves away from the burial site and the soldiers and 
           looks out across the trees and the mountain beyond.

           He feels around in the coat pocket and takes out a handful of 
           a woman’s torn brown hair.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Calvin Ed is standing in the open doorway of the dark room.  
           His eyes are locked on Emily asleep in the bed.

           Emily stirs.
                                 FIDDLER JOHN (O.S.)
                        C.E.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

           Calvin Ed turns from the bedroom to see the other men taking 
           their places at the dinner table.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        She’s stirrin’.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Good.  I’ll have Charley look at 
                        her after dinner.  Reckon she’ll 
                        just sleep through the night.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        She’s tossin’ about now, Fiddler.

           Calvin Ed has forgotten his place.  He slinks out of the 
           doorway and closes the door.  Edmund brings the plates to the 
           table.  Cornmeal with strips of salt pork.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Thank you, Edmund.

                                 RED BAKER
                        Thanks, kid.

           Edmund sits at the table with the four soldiers.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Edmund, seeing as you’ve been kind 
                        enough to take us into your home 
                        this evening, out of the cold, I 
                        thought you’d like to do us the 
                        honor of saying Grace before the 
                        meal.

                                 EDMUND
                        How do you mean?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        A blessing for the food.

                                 EDMUND
                        I’m afraid I don’t know any, sir.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        You don’t have to have anything 
                        prepared, Edmund.
                                 EDMUND
                        I know a prayer my father used to 
                        say in the late evening when it was 
                        just the two of us.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Let’s have it then.

           Edmund looks around as the men wait in silence.

                                 EDMUND
                        Give us the strength tonight, Good 
                        Lord, to set the world at naught so 
                        that we might make a cry to thee in 
                        this hour of our country’s need.  
                        Deal not with us according to our 
                        sins or our misdeeds, but stretch 
                        forth your right hand and be our 
                        defense.  Have pity on our brothers 
                        who are in arms against the 
                        authority of the land, and allow 
                        them to see the error of their 
                        ways.  And last, allow us to bear 
                        the weight of grief for those we 
                        knew and loved, as well as those we 
                        did not know, who have passed on 
                        into the unknown, who we will 
                        remember always in our silences and 
                        in our dreams.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Amen.

                                 ALL SOLDIERS
                        Amen.

           Red Baker gets up from the table and brings back a whiskey 
           bottle with glasses.

                                 RED BAKER
                        Goddamn, I’m gonna need a drink 
                        after that one.

                                 CALVIN ED
                             (grabs a glass)
                        Right over here.

                                 RED BAKER
                             (handing Edmund a glass)
                        Here you are kid.  Drink up.

           Fiddler John watches as Edmund throws back the liquor.
                                 RED BAKER (CONT’D)
                        You sound like a true-blooded 
                        Federalist sympathizer.  Pity on 
                        our such and so forth.  Up in arms 
                        against the authority of the land 
                        or whatever the fuck it was.

                                 EDMUND
                        I got no such leanings, sir.  
                        Either way.  

                                 RED BAKER
                        Is that right?

                                 EDMUND
                        I don’t pretend to know anything 
                        more than I do.  The war won’t 
                        reach the Pass.  We’re too remote.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        You’re wrong, Edmund.  The war has 
                        reached you.  Here we are.   
                        Sitting at your suppertable.

                                 EDMUND
                        So you are, Colonel.

           Red Baker pours the men more whiskey.

                                 CALVIN ED
                             (to Edmund)
                        Those two white crosses out the 
                        side yard.  I ain’t never seen no 
                        one but Mexicans signify their dead 
                        thataway.

                                 CHARLEY
                             (looks at Calvin Ed)
                        What the hell did I tell you about 
                        that?

                                 CALVIN ED
                        I just ain’t never seen it.  That’s 
                        all I’m sayin’.

                                 EDMUND
                        My father passed and I put him in 
                        the ground same way I saw him do 
                        with my mother.  Didn’t put much 
                        thought to it.
                                 CALVIN ED
                        Your daddy brought you all the way 
                        out here deep into the mountain to 
                        engage in swine husbandry?  Don’t 
                        make much sense.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Every man follows his own path.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        Should be a path that makes a 
                        little bit of sense though.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Calvin Ed.  That whiskey’s gone and 
                        dissolved your etiquette.

           Calvin Ed’s smile disappears.

                                 EDMUND
                        My father was an operative under 
                        Allan Pinkerton.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Is that so?

                                 EDMUND
                        We set up this outpost after his 
                        retiring.  I suppose he just wanted 
                        to stay of some use.  Can’t say 
                        that a soul ever came by though.

                                 RED BAKER
                             (to Edmund)
                        I saw those gray wolves you was 
                        talkin’ about, kid.  Few more than 
                        I wanted to count.  They look like 
                        they’re ready to come up and knock 
                        on the door.

                                 CHARLEY
                        You gotta move the hogs.  They’re 
                        dying anyway.

                                 EDMUND
                        I got no place for them.  Half of 
                        them got pneumonia.  I’m leaving 
                        this place anyhow.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        We’re you going, Edmund?

                                 EDMUND
                        California, sir.
                                 RED BAKER
                        Oh, think twice on that one.  
                        California’s population is made up 
                        entirely of cocksuckers.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        The gold rush is dead, Edmund.  I 
                        guess you hadn’t heard.

                                 EDMUND
                        I’m not interested in gold, sir.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        No?

                                 EDMUND
                             (beat)
                        No, sir.  My father told me about 
                        San Francisco and all the ships 
                        that come in from the Far East.

                                 CHARLEY
                        The boy is lookin’ to travel, 
                        Colonel.

                                 RED BAKER
                        You gotta be careful of diddlin’ 
                        those Orient cooches, Edmund.  They 
                        got the cholera.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        You can’t get no cholera diddlin’ 
                        no yellow quim.

                                 RED BAKER
                        Surely can.

                                 EDMUND
                        It’d only take a few days to kill 
                        and drain the hogs, pack up what I 
                        need and can sell and get out.  
                        That was as far as I had planned 
                        out.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Well, we’ll help you the best we 
                        can, Edmund.  I don’t reckon I’d 
                        like to be stuck out here by my 
                        lonesome neither.  Nothing to do 
                        but count the stars in the night 
                        sky.

                                 EDMUND
                        Yes, sir.
                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        We’ll be outta your fields soon 
                        enough and you can be on your way, 
                        but, in the meantime, we were 
                        hoping you could join us tomorrow 
                        on an expedition.

                                 EDMUND
                        Sir?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        We got business out in these woods 
                        that should take most of the 
                        morning and afternoon, and you know 
                        this area better than any of us.  
                        We would be in debt to you if you 
                        could render us your services for 
                        the day.

                                 EDMUND
                        Of course, sir.

           Edmund can sense that this is not a request.

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Edmund, sleep deprived, is hunched on a chair over the bed.  
           Emily stirs again.  He can hear the soldiers rustling out in 
           the front yard.

           EXT. GRAVES - MORNING

           Fiddler John is standing in a silent vigil over the two 
           graves at the side of the house.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Charley and Red Baker are at the front of the house saddling 
           up three of the horses.  Smoke is still rising from a 
           recently quit fire near the tents.  Fiddler John makes his 
           way toward them.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        We all ready to go?

                                 CHARLEY
                        All but the boy.  His horse isn’t 
                        saddled up, and I haven’t seen him.
           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Edmund watches with bloodshot eyes as the girl stirs awake.

                                 EMILY
                        Who are you?

           Edmund can only find time to open his mouth.

                                 CHARLEY (O.S.)
                        Edmund!  Let’s get going!

           Edmund fixes his hat and overcoat and heads to the door.

                                 EDMUND
                             (turning back to Emily)
                        Glad to see you’re feeling better.

           He leaves and shuts the door.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Edmund moves to his horse and mounts her, joining the 
           Fiddler, Charley, and Red Baker.  The three soldiers have 
           their WINCHESTER RIFLES out.

                                 RED BAKER
                             (to Edmund)
                        You all set to move out?

                                 EDMUND
                        Where’s C.E.?

                                 RED BAKER
                        Stayin’ behind.  He’s gotta put an 
                        indigo poultice on his foot and 
                        keep off it.  Fer the bite.

                                 EDMUND
                        Still bothering him?

                                 RED BAKER
                        Rattlesnake ain’t a jokester.  He 
                        puts his teeth into you and then 
                        commits to it.  Come on now.

           Edmund turns to the camp as Calvin Ed emerges from one of the 
           tents, shirtless, just waking up.  Charley lets out a 
           WHISTLE, and the four horsemen disappear into the trees.
           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           The four men are traveling slowly along a forest path with 
           Edmund bringing up the rear.

           The Fiddler, at the front, turns to Charley and holsters his 
           rifle.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        You go on ahead.

           The Fiddler slows his horse and waits for Edmund to catch up, 
           moving himself up alongside the boy.

                                 EDMUND
                        Howdy, Colonel.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        You’re wearin’ a worried look this 
                        morning.

                                 EDMUND
                        Am I?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        You’re farmhouse is gonna be just 
                        fine.  I got Calvin Ed lookin’ 
                        after it.

                                 EDMUND
                        I’m worried about the wolves comin’ 
                        in.  And I didn’t put the feed in 
                        the pen this morning.  There’s 
                        plenty of work that’s waitin’ for 
                        me.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        How much do you know about 
                        tracking?  Did your daddy ever 
                        teach you anything?

                                 EDMUND
                        I can’t say that I know much, sir.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        I’m not surprised.  I’ve rarely met 
                        too many white men that are at all 
                        adept at it.  I was just thinkin’ 
                        since your daddy was a Pinkerton.

                                 EDMUND
                        He never showed me those ways.
                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        For one reason or another, it’s a 
                        difficult skill to be expert in, 
                        unless your an Indian or a Mexican, 
                        like Ten Charley up there.  He’s 
                        both.  They’re just raised with it.

                                 EDMUND
                        Yes, sir.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Keep your eyes to the ground.  If 
                        you’re trailing a man on horseback, 
                        as was our Perry, you’ll do best in 
                        the soft ground.

           Edmund watches the ground below.  Looking for signs.  Not 
           Perry’s, but his own.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Tracking a man on hard or rocky 
                        ground can be trouble.  Fresh 
                        tracks’ll show wet where the ground 
                        has been turned up.  After time in 
                        the sun, they’ll dry.  You can tell 
                        how old they are by the bends of 
                        the grass and the moisture around 
                        the print.  Our worry now is the 
                        snow.  It’s been two days now, and 
                        the snow will have covered most of 
                        his trail.  Best we can do is to 
                        start where we found him.  Go from 
                        there.

                                 EDMUND
                        Yes, sir.

           The Fiddler pushes on ahead of him, conferring with Charley 
           at the front.

           As they move, Edmund sees the wolves through the trees in the 
           distance moving in the opposite direction toward the house.  
           He looks up, panicked, and sees Red Baker watching as well.  
           Red clings to his Winchester.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Emily Moore is waking up in a room that she does not 
           recognize.  She looks around and her eyes land on:

           CALVIN ED.  Leaning quietly against the wall, watching her.  
           He has a sawed-off, hammerless Colt SHOTGUN beside him on the 
           dresser.
                                 CALVIN ED
                        Morning Emily.

           EXT. MUDDY PASSAGE - DAY

           Fiddler John is off his horse, kneeling on the ground over a 
           set of hoofprints.  Ten Charley stands over him.

                                 CHARLEY
                        This horse was at a run.  Here.  
                        The gate of the right hoof.  About 
                        eight feet apart.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Yeah, that’s Belle.  He was moving 
                        fast through this clearing.

           Fiddler John looks out across the trees in the low fog as Red 
           Baker and Edmund arrive on the scene.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        The second set over there is from a 
                        different horse.  Smaller, and 
                        mostly likely a little earlier.

                                 EDMUND
                        Those could’ve been mine.

           The soldiers turn to Edmund.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        I was round this way the day 
                        before.  And coming back is when I 
                        found your girl.

                                 CHARLEY
                        Out hunting?

                                 EDMUND
                        I didn’t have my rifle.  Stayed 
                        overnight near the river but the 
                        salmon weren’t running.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                             (to the soldiers)
                        Two sets of tracks here.  My guess 
                        is the spot we’re looking for is 
                        gonna be through this clearing near 
                        the river where Charley came up on 
                        him.  Red, you and Edmund plant 
                        yourselves here and start combing 
                        the ground at the edge of these 
                        pine.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Charley and I are gonna head down 
                        towards the river.  We’ll be back 
                        within the hour.  Perry leaves a 
                        trail behind him like a slug.

                                 RED BAKER
                        We’re on it, Colonel.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                             (to Charley)
                        Alright.  Let’s go.

           Fiddler John mounts his horse, and the two men ride off 
           through the trees.  

           Red Baker dismounts and motions to Edmund.

                                 RED BAKER
                        I doubt we’re gonna find anything, 
                        kid.  He just wants us out of the 
                        way for a time.  That’s alright by 
                        me.

           Edmund approaches Red on his horse.

                                 EDMUND
                        You saw them.  I know you saw them.

                                 RED BAKER
                        What are you going on about?

                                 EDMUND
                        I got a pack of wolves moving 
                        toward my pen right now.  I gotta 
                        get back.

                                 RED BAKER
                        Colonel told us to stay put.

                                 EDMUND
                        You saw them.  I know you did.

           Red Baker directs his rifle at Edmund.

                                 RED BAKER
                        Colonel told us to stay put.  You 
                        come down here with me.  C.E. is 
                        lookin’ after your place.
                                 EDMUND
                        It ain’t his burden.  It’s mine.  I 
                        don’t know what business you men 
                        have out here, but it’s got nothing 
                        to do with me.  Let me have your 
                        rifle.

           Red Baker grips his Winchester.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        Your rifle.  I need it.

           Edmund reaches out his hand, but he gets no help.  He turns 
           his horse quickly and rides off in the opposite direction.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Edmund ties his horse up to the hitching post.  Inside the 
           farmhouse, he can hear CREAKING.

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY

           Charley is leaning over the ashes of an old fire, partially 
           concealed by the snow.  This was Edmund’s fire only two 
           nights before.

           Fiddler John has his eyes on something entirely different.  A 
           twin set of pine trees with the earth around them overturned.  
           A shovel leaning against the trees.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

           Edmund follows the MUFFLED NOISES inside to the bedroom.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Edmund, quiet as a mouse, opens the door.  Only feet in front 
           of him, Calvin Ed is on top of Emily, sweating and heaving.

           Emily sees Edmund in the doorway and gives him a wide-eyed, 
           panicked look.  

           Without thinking, Edmund rushes over to the bed and HURLS 
           CALVIN ED ONTO THE FLOOR.  Calvin Ed crashes into the wall.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        What the fuck?

           Calvin Ed tries to get his bearings as Emily covers herself 
           with the blanket.
                                 EDMUND
                             (to Emily)
                        You alright?

                                 CALVIN ED
                        What’s going on?  What the fuck are 
                        you doing, kid?

                                 EDMUND
                             (to Calvin Ed)
                        Hold on now...hold on.

           Calvin Ed laughs and starts to climb back onto the bed.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        What’s the matter with you?  Get 
                        outta the room!

           Edmund crawls on top of Calvin Ed like a spider and PUNCHES 
           HIM, spraying blood onto the floor.

                                 EDMUND
                        I said hold on!
                             (to Emily)
                        You come out here with me...

           Emily looks at him, shocked.  She’s not going anywhere.

           Edmund sees the shotgun on the dresser and turns to pick it 
           up, but, in an instant, Calvin Ed is on him.  The man is 
           twice Edmund’s build and meaner than hell.

           CALVIN ED LANDS A PUNCH...in the face. 

           THEN ANOTHER...in the chest.  

           The sound of ribs cracking.  Edmund falls to the floor.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        Don’t you know anything about 
                        civilized society, boy?  Never 
                        interrupt a man in the middle of a 
                        screw.

           Calvin Ed picks Edmund up and THROWS HIM INTO THE NEXT ROOM.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Edmund lands hard on the ground next to the table, spitting 
           up blood onto the floor and realizing that this may have been 
           a bad idea.
                                 EDMUND
                        Wait...wait.

           Calvin Ed is on top of him again, swinging.  Edmund is like a 
           wet sack.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        I guess you still haven’t realized 
                        who we are.  That cunt in there 
                        belongs to us.

           Calvin Ed picks up Edmund and DRAGS HIM OUT THE FRONT DOOR.

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - THAT MOMENT

           Edmund topples over face-first into the snow.

           Calvin Ed lungs at him again but whirls back around as Emily 
           SLAMS THE FRONT DOOR AND LOCKS IT.

                                 CALVIN ED
                             (pounding on the door)
                        Aww, honey!  Emily!  Come on now!

           Calvin Ed cannot make the wooden door move. He walks back to 
           Edmund and leans over him.

                                 CALVIN ED (CONT’D)
                        See?  You’re making me lose my hard-
                        on.  Let’s see if you can’t help me 
                        get it back.

           Calvin Ed moves past Edmund toward the tents.

           INT. CALVIN ED’S TENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Calvin Ed enters the tent and picks up his REMINGTON 
           REVOLVER, swinging open the cylinder.  It is fully loaded.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Calvin Ed appears out of the tent with the firearm.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        Truthfully, Edmund, I don’t give a 
                        fuck what the Fiddler says about 
                        you.  No one has ever laid a hand 
                        on me and kept the hand...

           He trails off.  Edmund is gone.  Just the stains of blood in 
           the snow where he was curled up on the ground.  
           The cellar trapdoor SLAMS SHUT.

           INT. SUPPLY CELLAR - THAT MOMENT

           Edmund locks the outside trapdoor and climbs up to the inside 
           of the house.

           INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Edmund flings himself into the bedroom and freezes.  Emily is 
           in the opposite corner of the room.  She has a small 
           DERRINGER pointed at him and a crazed, fearful look in her 
           eyes.  Edmund puts his hands up.

           In the front room, they can hear Calvin Ed POUNDING on the 
           front door.

                                 EMILY
                        Who are you?

           Edmund sees the sawed-off shotgun sitting only two feet away 
           from him.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        I said who are you?  Why are you 
                        makin’ trouble?  He’s gonna kill us 
                        both now.

                                 EDMUND
                        Hold on..hold on.

           Very slowly, Edmund picks up the shotgun and moves out of the 
           room.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Calvin Ed is still pounding on the door as Edmund enters.

                                 CALVIN ED (O.S.)
                        Edmund!  Edmund!  It’s just you and 
                        me here!  Where are you gonna go?

           Calvin Ed is KICKING the door now.

                                 CALVIN ED (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Emily!  Emily, honey, I’m coming!

           The KICKING is getting more severe.
           EXT. FRONT PORCH - THAT MOMENT

           Calvin Ed, fed up, draws his rifle and aims it at the door.

           BAM!  A bullet rips through the wood...

           BAM!  Another...

           INT. FRONT ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Inside, Edmund sidles himself up to the door, watching the 
           two holes of light coming through the wood.  Calvin Ed is 
           going to break through any second...

           BAM!  Gunfire putting another hole into the wood...

                                 CALVIN ED (O.S.)
                        Alright now!  I’m coming in!

           Edmund turns and sees Emily standing across the room.  She is 
           like a deer frozen in headlights.

           The wood SPLINTERS, and Calvin Ed’s boot comes crashing 
           through the front door...

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - THAT MOMENT

           Calvin Ed is trying to balance himself with his left foot 
           through the wooden door.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        Fuck...fuck!

           INT. FRONT ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Calvin Ed’s black boot stuck in the door...

           Edmund turns to Emily.  She shakes her head at him, pleading.  
           Edmund turns his head away from the door, covering his eyes 
           with one hand and pointing the shotgun with the other...

           BAM!  THE SHOTGUN BLAST TEARS CALVIN ED’S FOOT INTO PIECES.  
           Blood and bone showering the room...

           Edmund drops the shotgun and rolls over.  He can hear Emily 
           SCREAMING inside and Calvin Ed SCREAMING outside...

           A THUD, as Calvin Ed’s body drops to the ground...

           BAM!  BAM!  BAM!  Three bullets from outside rip through the 
           front door.  Emily heaves herself back into the bedroom.
           EXT. FRONT PORCH - THAT MOMENT

           Calvin Ed screaming in pain on the ground.  He continues to 
           dry fire his revolver.

           He anchors himself and finally rips his foot loose from the 
           door.  There is nothing left but blood.  He WAILS.

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY

           Charley, covered in dirt, hurls the empty Confederate 
           knapsack out of the hole he is standing in.

                                 CHARLEY
                        Empty.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        I can see that.

                                 CHARLEY
                        Think it was Perry or the boy?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Can’t say.  How about we ask him?

           INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

           Edmund is curled up by the mangled front door.  Smoke is 
           still rising near the hole in the door, but the screaming has 
           stopped.

           He picks himself up and listens...

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY

           Edmund, opening the front door, looks down at the stain of 
           blood on the porch.  Calvin Ed is not there.  His eyes follow 
           a blood trail around the porch to the side yard.

           Edmund crawls, following the trail, and finds Calvin Ed 
           dragging himself off the porch on his stomach.  He can hear 
           the soft sounds of Calvin Ed crying.

           Edmund lays himself down on his back and closes his eyes.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Edmund opens his eyes, coming out of the darkness.  The blood 
           on his face has dried up and his eyes are swollen.
           A few feet from him, Calvin Ed is passed out on the ground.

           Through his swollen eyes, Edmund can see the three soldiers 
           appear out of the forest on horseback.  They are blurry in 
           the bright sunlight.

           All three of the soldiers stop in dead silence at the sight 
           before them.  Edmund closes his eyes again.  Darkness.

           EXT. TREE - LATER

           Fiddler John is loading his revolver, sitting in a chair 
           under a tree.  Emily is sitting below him on the ground.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        You understand what it is I’m 
                        asking you?

                                 EMILY
                        Yes, Fiddler.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        I’m not asking you about any of 
                        this shit.

                                 EMILY
                        No.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        So you understand?

                                 EMILY
                        Yes.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        I’m not mad at you, sweetheart.

                                 EMILY
                        I know, Fiddler.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        So?

                                 EMILY
                        I was riding alongside Red.  He was 
                        looking after me.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        I know about that.

                                 EMILY
                        You and Charley went up ahead.  
                        Like always.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMILY (CONT'D)
                        Red and I heard the gunfire from a 
                        distance.  It was dark.  The horses 
                        got all rattled up.  In a blink, 
                        C.E. was on after you two.  Red 
                        went up after him.  Yelled for me 
                        to come with him.  But I had 
                        trouble crossin’ the river in all 
                        that black and darkness.  My Lucy 
                        wouldn’t do it.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Then what?

                                 EMILY
                        Then he found me in the middle of 
                        the riverbed.  Recognized me I 
                        guess.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Recognized you across the river in 
                        the dead of night?

                                 EMILY
                        I reckon it ain’t hard to spot the 
                        woman in a band of guerillas.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        You know I don’t care for that 
                        word.

                                 EMILY
                        I know, Fiddler.  I’m sorry.  He 
                        dropped Lucy in the middle of the 
                        riverbed there.  I was lucky it was 
                        shallow enough, but it was freezin’ 
                        cold.  He drug me out.  Don’t know 
                        what he was plannin’ on doin’.  He 
                        left his horse at the side.  That’s 
                        when Charley found us.  Put bullets 
                        in his mare because I guess that’s 
                        what first he saw.  I went to the 
                        ground and I guess I don’t remember 
                        too much after.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        After his horse went down, it took 
                        us nearly an hour to find him.  
                        Snuck off into the night.  That’s 
                        why what I’m askin’ is so 
                        important.

                                 EMILY
                        Yes, Fiddler.
                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Did he say anything to you?

                                 EMILY
                        No, Fiddler.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Did he have the militia bags on 
                        him?

                                 EMILY
                        I think so.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        He did or he didn’t have the bags?

                                 EMILY
                        He did.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        How many did he have?

                                 EMILY
                        It was dark, John.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        How many did he have?  One or two?

                                 EMILY
                             (lies)
                        He had them both.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        He had two Confederate militia 
                        bags?

                                 EMILY
                        Yes.  He had two.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        On his horse?

                                 EMILY
                        No.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        On his person then?

                                 EMILY
                        Yes.

           Fiddler John’s expression breaks into a warm smile.
                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Alright, sweetheart.  Go on back in 
                        the house and get some rest.

                                 EMILY
                        Thank you, Fiddler.

           Fiddler John lights the cigarette he has been rolling and 
           watches her move back toward the camp.

           EXT. CAMP - DAY

           Red Baker has his rifle trained on Edmund.  Seated, they both 
           watch as Emily walks by the camp toward the house.

           She passes behind Red and looks at Edmund.  Edmund reads it 
           as a warning.

           INT. CALVIN ED’S TENT - DAY

           Fiddler John enters the tent.  It looks more like a crude 
           operating room with Charley leaning over Calvin Ed cutting 
           off pieces of burned boot leather from his leg.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        Fuck.

                                 CHARLEY
                        Hold still.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        Don’t take off my leg, Charley.

                                 CHARLEY
                        I won’t.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        Fiddler, tell Charley he don’t need 
                        to take off my leg.

           Calvin Ed is nearly to the point of delirium.  Tears stream 
           down his face.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        We ain’t got the saw to take your 
                        leg off so quit crying.  Eventually 
                        it’ll have to go though, if the 
                        gangrene gets it.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        It won’t Fiddler.  I promise.
                                 CHARLEY
                        Keep quiet.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                             (to Charley)
                        How is it?

                                 CHARLEY
                        Lotta boot leather burned into his 
                        leg above the stump.  Lotta blood.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        I can see that.

                                 CHARLEY
                        We’re gonna need to take off just 
                        above the ankle at least.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Looks like it’s mostly gone anyway.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        Fuck.  Fuck, it’s all mangled.  
                        That fuckin’ piece of shit.

           Charley pours a measure of ground gunpowder onto a cloth and 
           presses it down into the wound.

                                 CALVIN ED (CONT’D)
                        You gonna kill ‘em for me, Fiddler?  
                        Bring his body in here so I can 
                        see.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Shutup.
                             (to Charley)
                        What about you?  What do you think?

                                 CHARLEY
                        The boy’s got the gold.  I didn’t 
                        think so before, but now I do.  
                        Plain as day.  He buried that 
                        knapsack out in the woods because 
                        he didn’t reckon on us finding it.  
                        Panicked and left us when we got on 
                        the trail.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        You think so?

                                 CHARLEY
                        Yes, sir.
                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Then where is it, Charley?

           Charley puts pressure on the wound and Calvin Ed cries out.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        We went through that entire house 
                        before the boy showed up.  I see no 
                        places it’s been buried or hung.  
                        It ain’t up in no goddamn tree.  So 
                        let me know if you’ve seen it.  
                        That way we can get out of this 
                        fucking place.

           Calvin Ed is screaming and crying now.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (to Calvin Ed)
                        Give me your Winchester.

           Calvin Ed looks up, perplexed.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        You gonna kill ‘em now?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Give me your Winchester.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        There.  Over by the blankets.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Cartridges?

                                 CALVIN ED
                        Over here.

           Fiddler John takes the rifle and the cartridges.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                             (to Calvin Ed)
                        Your leg is gonna come off or it’s 
                        not.  Either way, you got no foot 
                        at the bottom of it.  You’re no use 
                        to me anymore.

           He stops before leaving the tent and looks at Charley.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        The whore is lying to me.  I want 
                        to know why.

           He leaves.
           EXT. CAMP - DAY

           Red Baker is aiming his rifle at Edmund.

                                 EDMUND
                        How’d you get that bullet hole in 
                        your head?

           Red watches Fiddler John leave the tent and move away from 
           them.

                                 RED BAKER
                        Was in Lawrence.  Few years back.  
                        Jayhawkers came through, raiding my 
                        house.  Put a ball through my 
                        temple here.  Took my daughter.  I 
                        musta been layin’ on the ground for 
                        hours in blood ‘til I was found.

                                 EDMUND
                        What happened to your daughter?

           No answer.  The two men watch as Fiddler John moves in their 
           direction carrying a heavy bundle wrapped in white, ragged 
           cloth.

                                 RED BAKER
                        You shoulda stayed put like I told 
                        you.

                                 EDMUND
                        What regiment did you say you were 
                        in again?

           Red Baker gives Edmund a wide smile.  Fiddler John arrives.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Red, there’s no need to point a 
                        rifle at an unarmed boy.

                                 RED BAKER
                             (relaxing his weapon)
                        Yes, sir.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Go on and help Charley.  They’re 
                        gonna need some whiskey from the 
                        cellar.

           Red Baker gets up moves back to the house.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (to Edmund)
                        You.  Come with me.
           EXT. HILLS - DAY

           Fiddler John and Edmund are crouching under a grove of pine 
           trees that look out onto rolling hills.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Beautiful country.  I reckon you 
                        don’t have it as bad out here as 
                        you think you do.

                                 EDMUND
                        It’s hard to relate.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        I suppose it is.

           Fiddler John lays out the heavy bundle on the ground before 
           them.  Inside the cloth lay a number of RIFLES and polished 
           REVOLVERS.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Here they are.

           Fiddler John takes out a rolled cigarette and lights it.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Tobacco?

                                 EDMUND
                        No, sir.  What’s the armory for?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        I rounded these up from my men.  
                        Here it is, Edmund.

           Fiddler John picks out Edmund’s HAWKEN RIFLE and studies it.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Your Hawken St. Louis fifty-four 
                        caliber.  Muzzle-loading.  Owned by 
                        Major General Edmund Horn, U.S. 
                        Army officer and Pinkerton 
                        operative.  Passed on to his boy.  
                        We fixed it up for you.

           Fiddler John aims the rifle out over the hills.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I ain’t seen a muzzle-loader like 
                        this in about five years.  It’s 
                        something.  I applaud you for 
                        trying to kill any sort of animal 
                        with it.  It’s a good thing you 
                        never tried to used it on any men.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Bullet would’ve blow clear past 
                        them by a blind country mile, and 
                        you would’ve been left helpless 
                        trying to reload the damn thing.

                                 EDMUND
                        I’ve never been much with a 
                        firearm.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Is that right?

           Edmund has no response.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I can’t say you’ve put me in an 
                        easy situation here, Edmund.  
                        There’s trouble now with my men 
                        about what you’ve done.

                                 EDMUND
                        I figured as much.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Do you think your actions, upon 
                        looking back, may have been a hair 
                        drastic?

                                 EDMUND
                        You weren’t there.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        She’s a whore, Edmund.  She was 
                        rendering her services.  That’s 
                        what she does.  That’s why she’s 
                        here.  For Calvin Ed to expect 
                        that, well, that’s a hell of a 
                        reason for a man to lose his leg.

                                 EDMUND
                        I didn’t know.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        That’s why we’re still sitting 
                        here.

           Fiddler John holds out the rifle to Edmund.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Here.  This is yours.

           Edmund takes it and sets it down.  The Fiddler picks out a 
           second rifle.
                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Now, this one.  This is a Sharp’s 
                        Model ‘59 with a slanting breech.  
                        Feel it.

           Fiddler John hands Edmund the rifle.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Take an aim out there at the top of 
                        the hill.  Through the site.  Feel 
                        its weight?  More meanness to it.  
                        More commitment.  No gumming up the 
                        muzzle.  This is a single shot, but 
                        accurate as you need.  These are 
                        the shells here.  Fifty-two 
                        caliber.

           The Fiddler loads the rifle for Edmund and hands it back.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Now, you bring it back to full-cock 
                        and pull the trigger.

           BAM!  Edmund fires the rifle across the hills.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You can feel the metal in your 
                        teeth.

           Fiddler John takes the rifle back, loads it again, and takes 
           an aim at the same spot.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        If I’m completely truthful with 
                        you, I can’t say that I mind too 
                        much about Calvin Ed.  He’s an ill-
                        mannered boy.  Got a rudeness in 
                        him that I don’t take to.  No real 
                        spirit or spine.

                                 EDMUND
                        Did you kill those soldiers?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        What soldiers?

                                 EDMUND
                        Those Union soldiers whose uniforms 
                        your men are wearing.

           Fiddler John hands Edmund another rifle.
                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        The Model ‘55 half-stock Colt.  Put 
                        your eye to the sighting scope 
                        there at the top.

           The rifle has a long sighting scope fixed to the top that 
           Edmund looks through.  He can see the hills closer through 
           the dirty glass.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        This one’s for the sharpshooter.  
                        Like Berdan.  Wolves wouldn’t 
                        really be a problem for you 
                        anymore.  Your arm of vengeance 
                        reaches a little further out.

                                 EDMUND
                        Yes, sir.

           Fiddler John takes the Colt rifle from Edmund and picks out 
           one last one for him.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Now, finally, this one is my 
                        favorite.  This is the Yellow Boy.

           Fiddler John hands Edmund a long, beautiful rifle with a 
           brass receiver.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        It’s a Winchester and you can put 
                        fifteen cartridges in it.  If 
                        you’re anything like me, you can 
                        unload every cartridge in about 
                        fifteen seconds as well.  Every 
                        rifle too will put a different 
                        sound in your ear.  This one 
                        ruptures the bullet different than 
                        the Colt.  Different attitude.  
                        It’s good to learn the sound.  It’s 
                        the easiest way to tell what the 
                        other man is using.

                                 EDMUND
                        Is it loaded?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        It is.

           BAM!  BAM!  Edmund fires the gun, cocks it, fires it again, 
           cocks it again.
                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        We are both orphans, you and I.  We 
                        both need the same things.  The Red 
                        Paint Chiricahua attacked my family 
                        on the road to Silver City when I 
                        was only five years old.  My father 
                        and mother were both killed and 
                        scalped.  They were arrogant and 
                        foolish and had contempt for the 
                        Red Paints.  They underestimated 
                        them.  The Chiricahua took me in 
                        and I learned tracking and hunting 
                        from them.  Lived with them for 
                        many years.   Then, when I was old 
                        enough, I left the Red Paints and 
                        came back with men and rifles and 
                        killed the ones who took me.  I 
                        hung them from the tree branches 
                        like swine and let the blood drain 
                        from their throats down into the 
                        earth.  This was the way it was 
                        destined to be.

           Edmund puts the gun down, listening.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I am sorry to have fed you lies.   
                        We are no Union soldiers.  I’ve 
                        never belonged to any army, Union 
                        or Confederate.  Nor do any of my 
                        men. I don’t at once sidle up to 
                        either camp, but, I guess, if I had 
                        to make a choice, it would be the 
                        confederate state.  I don’t like 
                        the terms bushwacker or jayhawker.  
                        Guerilla or militia.  I am not part 
                        of any organization.  I am just a 
                        Christian man.  We are all here 
                        frontiersmen.  You and I.

           Fiddler John grabs the rifle Edmund is holding and puts it 
           away.  He reaches out for a revolver and hands it to Edmund.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        This one is for you.  Two pounds.

                                 EDMUND
                        This is for me?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        You come with us or you make your 
                        own way down to California.  Either 
                        way, keep it on you.  See how that 
                        nickel shines in the sunlight.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT'D)
                        It don’t break apart, but the 
                        cylinder comes down out of the 
                        side.  Like that.  Six rounds.

           Edmund tries it on.  Loads and fires.  BAM!  Out across the 
           field.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        For your hospitality.

                                 EDMUND
                        I can’t accept this.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        You can.  I assure you we have no 
                        shortage in our camp.

                                 EDMUND
                        Thank you, sir.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Thank you.

           The Fiddler stands up and looks out, putting his back to 
           Edmund.  Edmund holds the revolver in his tight grip.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You left your shovel out in the 
                        woods.

                                 EDMUND
                        Sir?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        You left your shovel.  Leaning up 
                        against a pine out in the woods.  
                        Charley found it.

                                 EDMUND
                             (thinking quick)
                        I ain’t seen it since Perry came by 
                        that night.  I think he put it in 
                        his sack and rode off.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Is that right?

                                 EDMUND
                        I didn’t pay it any mind.  Haven’t 
                        needed it since my father’s 
                        passing.
                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Well, we got it back for you.  So 
                        now you can dig all you want.  
                        Let’s get back.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Edmund is on his knees throwing up into what you might call a 
           toilet, but what is, in reality, a circular hole cut into a 
           wooden bench that drops down into the dirt.

           EXT. CAMP - DAY

           Charley is crouched at the end of the camp when Fiddler John 
           comes up behind him.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        What’s got your eye?

                                 CHARLEY
                        There.

           Charley points out a pair of wolves at the forest edge.

                                 CHARLEY (CONT’D)
                        How’d it go?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        I used to have a keener eye for 
                        this kind of thing.

                                 CHARLEY
                        You still do.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        He’s scared, but that doesn’t mean 
                        much.

                                 CHARLEY
                        You’re thinking he’ll come with us?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        If he wants.

           Fiddler John looks out closer at the pacing wolves.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        What is it they’re up to?

                                 CHARLEY
                        They’re waiting.
           Fiddler John gets up to leave.

                                 CHARLEY (CONT’D)
                        What if it ends up the kid took the 
                        money? 

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Then I can’t say I won’t be a 
                        little disappointed.

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY

           Red Baker is repairing Edmund’s front door.  He has a wooden 
           plank cut to fit just over the hole, and he is hammering away 
           when Emily tries to move through the door.

                                 RED BAKER
                        What are you up to then?

                                 EMILY
                        Fiddler asked me to give a special 
                        present to the boy.  As a reward 
                        for being so damn brave and all.

                                 RED BAKER
                        Is that right?

                                 EMILY
                        Uh-huh.

                                 RED BAKER
                        Well, shit.  Edmund doesn’t know 
                        what he’s in for.

           Emily moves inside the house as Red Baker laughs to himself.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Edmund is standing alone by the bed, shuffling through the 
           dresser drawers.

           His hands fall upon his father’s badge hidden among the 
           clothes.  It reads “PINKERTON NATIONAL DETECTIVE AGENCY:  WE 
           NEVER SLEEP”.  He moves it around in his hands, lost in 
           thought.

           The door opens and Emily appears silhouetted in the doorway.

                                 EMILY
                        There’s my brave man.

           She moves into the room.
           INT. FRONT ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Red Baker, kneeling beside the door, smiles to himself as he 
           watches Emily strut into the bedroom, locking the door.

           INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Emily moves up close to Edmund.

                                 EMILY
                        The Fiddler sent me in.  Says you 
                        deserve a good time.

                                 EDMUND
                        Well, I....

                                 EMILY
                        There’s no talking your way outta 
                        this one.  You are in for it.  Come 
                        on.  Let’s move over to the bed.

           Emily takes him by the hand and they sit on the bed.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        What’s you name again, boy?

                                 EDMUND
                        Edmund.

                                 EMILY
                        Edmund.  I’m Emily.

           She offers her hand and he naively shakes it.  She laughs.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you lay yourself down 
                        here on the bed.

           Edmund cannot find the words to object as the woman gently 
           pushes him down on the bed and climbs on top of him.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Here we are.  Ain’t this a little 
                        better?

                                 EDMUND
                        Yes, ma’am.

           Edmund notices that she has a nervousness in her voice, and 
           she continually glances at the door.
                                 EMILY
                        Edmund, darling, will that lock 
                        hold?

                                 EDMUND
                        What?

                                 EMILY
                        The lock on the bedroom door.  Will 
                        it hold?

                                 EDMUND
                        I believe it will.

                                 EMILY
                        We don’t have to make a lot of 
                        noise, but a little bit here and 
                        there.  As long as Red saw me come 
                        in here with you.

                                 EDMUND
                        I don’t understand.

                                 EMILY
                        I’m saying we have to make a little 
                        noise otherwise they’ll know 
                        something is up and we’re both in 
                        trouble.

                                 EDMUND
                        If you’ve put us in a bad spot...

                                 EMILY
                        It would do best right now if you 
                        just listen.

           Emily lowers her voice.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        You have no idea what these men are 
                        really like.  I can only assume 
                        you’ve already figured out they 
                        ain’t soldiers unless you’re really 
                        slow.  I’ve ridden with them since 
                        Missouri, and I’ve seen things that 
                        could only be called the Devil’s 
                        work.  They ain’t bushwhackers.  
                        They ain’t part of no war except 
                        their own.  They’ve watched men die 
                        on both sides and then they come in 
                        like vultures taking what they 
                        want.  They took me from my family 
                        before they killed ‘em.  Every one 
                        of ‘em.  My baby sister.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        My mommy and my daddy.  The only 
                        way I survive day to day is by 
                        giving ‘em what they want.

           Edmund tries to get up from the bed, but she holds him down.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Now you’ve got something they want, 
                        and we both know what it is.  It’s 
                        the only way out of this mess.  
                        You’re trapped and so am I.

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - THAT MOMENT

           Red Baker is hammering in the nails when he hits his thumb 
           and cries out.  The nails scatter across the floor.

           INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Emily continues speaking in desperate whispers.

                                 EMILY
                        You have the gold.  I think I’m the 
                        only one who knows for sure, but I 
                        can tell the Fiddler is stewing on 
                        it.  The only reason you’re alive 
                        right now is because they don’t 
                        know where you’re hiding it, and, 
                        when they figure that out, you’ll 
                        be lucky if they just kill you.

                                 EDMUND
                        You’ve got the wrong idea.

                                 EMILY
                        I lied for you.  I don’t know why I 
                        did it.  I don’t know whether what 
                        you did for me was brave or done 
                        out of fear.  Don’t matter.  I got 
                        away briefly and saw Perry before 
                        they caught him.  He told me where 
                        he buried those coins.  He trusted 
                        me.  I don’t know why.  I overheard 
                        Charley say they found only one.  
                        They found the other empty sack out 
                        in the woods.  I don’t have to 
                        think too hard to guess that you 
                        dug up the second satchel and are 
                        holding on to what was inside.

                                 EDMUND
                        What made him trust you?
                                 EMILY
                        I’m a prisoner just like he was.  
                        Just like you are.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Red Baker is on his hands and knees picking up the nails.  He 
           finds one of the nails stuck on an object protruding out of 
           the floorboards.

           He picks up the object, knowing instantly what it is...

           A brown, drawstring pouch with the words “OROFINO CREEK 
           MINES” pressed into the leather.

           INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Edmund is confessing.

                                 EDMUND
                        It’s in the supply cellar.

                                 EMILY
                        All of it?  In one place?

                                 EDMUND
                        I put it deep in an oak casket with 
                        the meat and salt from one of the 
                        hogs.  The meat’s gone bad.  I 
                        thought the smell would put ‘em off 
                        before they even looked in it.

                                 EMILY
                        Edmund.

           Edmund looks up into Emily’s eyes.  He can see she’s been 
           through hell and back.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        We have to kill them all.

                                 EDMUND
                        We can’t.

                                 EMILY
                        We have to kill them all tonight.

                                 EDMUND
                        How?
                                 EMILY
                        It’s only gonna be another day 
                        before all of our options are gone.  
                        Even if we get away, they tracked 
                        Perry within a few days.  If the 
                        Fiddler is on your trail, he don’t 
                        sleep.  He barely even eats.  It 
                        gets under his skin.  Those guns on 
                        the dresser.  They’re yours?

                                 EDMUND
                        I’ve got the rifle and the 
                        Remington.

                                 EMILY
                        Where do you hide them?

                                 EDMUND
                        Under the bed.

                                 EMILY
                        Load up the rifle and put it under 
                        the bed.  Load up the pistol.  Put 
                        it in the dresser so you can get to 
                        it easy.  I got the Derringer.  
                        They don’t know I have it.
                             (thinks to herself)
                        That ain’t gonna do it.  We need to 
                        get more.  
                             (to Edmund)
                        At dinner tonight, say you gotta 
                        check on the hogs.  Excuse 
                        yourself, and make your way down to 
                        Charley’s tent.  He’s got a 
                        Winchester in there by his bed.  
                        Get it and put it somewhere safe.

                                 EDMUND
                        I can put it in the pen.  In the 
                        trough.  It’ll be dark enough that 
                        you can’t see.

                                 EMILY
                        Alright.  But you can’t take too 
                        long.

           Edmund stops himself.  A feeling of dread pushes in on him.

                                 EDMUND
                        I can’t do it.

                                 EMILY
                        What do you mean?
                                 EDMUND
                        I can’t do it.  Not tonight.  I 
                        gotta have time.

                                 EMILY
                        You’re scared.  So am I.  There’s 
                        no time.

                                 EDMUND
                             (panic)
                        There’s time.  I can’t do it 
                        tonight.

                                 EMILY
                        You have to.  This is it.

           Emily gets herself up, straightens her dress, and moves to 
           the door.

                                 EDMUND
                        Wait...

           But she’s gone, closing the door behind her.

           Edmund hands work quickly, loading up the Hawken rifle and 
           hiding the case under the bed.

           EXT. OAK TREE - DUSK

           A gray wolf is digging with its paws into the earth, moving 
           deeper and deeper into Perry’s grave.  It can smell the dead 
           body below.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - DUSK

           A drawer is opened in Edmund’s desk.  Inside the drawer, the 
           Outpost Log of Major General Horn.  

           A hand reaches in and takes it.

           EXT. HOG PEN - DUSK

           Edmund is on his knees again in the hog pen.  He tips the 
           pinewood trough over and the water comes pouring out into the 
           ground.  The hogs, barely moving now, hardly take notice.
           INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

           Edmund enters to find Fiddler John and Red Baker seated at 
           the dinnertable.  Fiddler John has his feet up reading, and 
           Red is rolling tobacco into cigarette paper.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Might be time to give it up.

                                 EDMUND
                        What’s that?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        I said might be time to give it up.  
                        That pen’s got nothing but half-
                        dead swine in it.

                                 EDMUND
                        Oh.  Most of them got the fever 
                        now.

                                 RED BAKER
                        Kill the ones ain’t got the fever.  
                        We’ll help you carve ‘em up.

                                 EDMUND
                        Thank you.

                                 RED BAKER
                        It’ll make things quicker for when 
                        we’re ready to leave.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        We’re not leaving yet.

           Edmund tries to move by the men to the kitchen.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Did you show Red your new 
                        Remington?

                                 EDMUND
                        No, sir.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Why don’t you go get it so he can 
                        have a look.

                                 EDMUND
                        Alright.
           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Edmund enters and removes his revolver from the dresser 
           drawer, hidden among the socks and underwear.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

           Fiddler John reaches out his hand as Edmund comes back in, 
           and Edmund hands him the revolver.  

           Fiddler John swings the cylinder open.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Already loaded I see.

                                 RED BAKER
                        Let’s have it here.

           Red grabs the revolver off of Fiddler John.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                             (to Edmund)
                        Did you see the job Red did with 
                        your door after you fucked it all 
                        up?

                                 EDMUND
                        I did.
                             (to Red Baker)
                        Thank you for undoing the damage.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                             (to Emily)
                        Emily!

           Emily emerges from the kitchen behind the Fiddler.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you take Red here into 
                        the bedroom.  Show him the benefits 
                        of a job well done.

                                 RED BAKER
                        Well, that sounds just fine to me.

                                 EMILY
                        Fiddler, the stew’s boiling up on 
                        the stove.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        That stew’ll keep for the time 
                        being.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT'D)
                        That is, unless you’re cunny’s too 
                        sore out and bruised from bouncing 
                        around with the boy all afternoon.

                                 EMILY
                        No, Fiddler.

           Emily takes Red’s hand.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Come on then, honey.

                                 RED BAKER
                        Girl is ready to go.  I like that.

           Red takes the gun with him into the bedroom with Emily and 
           closes the door.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Edmund, come and sit down with me.  
                        Misery loves company, and all my 
                        men are otherwise engaged.

           Edmund takes a seat across from the man.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (reading out loud)
                        Outpost will be abandoned within 
                        the appropriate amount of time, a 
                        day or two at most, as conditions 
                        have become too harsh.  In keeping 
                        with original caretaker’s intent...  
                        So on and so forth...I could never 
                        presume that anyone will read it, 
                        but I will keep it here.  Before 
                        starting off.
                             (to Edmund)
                        Very poetic.  When was it you wrote 
                        it?

                                 EDMUND
                        Two nights before the last one.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        After Perry showed up then?

                                 EDMUND
                        Before, sir.

           Edmund cannot help but hear the MOANS from the bedroom.  
           Outside the house, Calvin Ed has woken up and is CRYING 
           again.
                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Wish that boy would shut up.
                             (looks at the logbook)
                        This looks to be your only entry 
                        here.  I take it the handwriting 
                        through the rest is your daddy’s?

                                 EDMUND
                        Said it was for historical 
                        purposes.  For the Pinkertons.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Fucking Pinkertons.  Miserable 
                        sodomites.  Bad trackers and worse 
                        with the rifle.

           Edmund winces at the Fiddler’s change in temperament.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I once seen a Pinkerton hang from a 
                        noose out on the border near 
                        Minnesota.  He tore up and raped 
                        this little Sioux girl.  Not but 9 
                        years of age.  They ain’t no 
                        saints, that lot.  Just as fuckin’ 
                        evil as the rest.  But they got a 
                        false front, which I cannot oblige.
                             (to Edmund)
                        You don’t mind me lookin’ through 
                        this then?

                                 EDMUND
                        I’m gonna go check on the stew.

           Edmund passes Fiddler John and moves into the kitchen.  The 
           Fiddler listens to the moans in the next room.  

           Fiddler John’s eyes find the daguerreotypes on the front 
           wall.  Edmund’s father and mother are staring at him.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        I say at least it was a girl and 
                        not some little fuck Sioux tadpole.  
                        You never know.  That’s why it’s 
                        good to keep the whore.

           THE PICTURE ON THE WALL: Edmund’s mother.  Staring out from 
           the glass.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Gotta keep your dick pointed in the 
                        right direction.
           Fiddler John takes a long look at the picture of Edmund’s 
           mother.  He sifts through the journal, listening to the cries 
           and moans of his men all around him.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (singing to himself)
                        A prayer for the Father,
                        A good man, tried and true.
                        May he be warm gentle,
                        And forgive the sins you do.
                        A prayer for the Mother...

           He trails off.  His eyes scan a page near the front of the 
           journal written by Edmund’s father.

           VIEW ON THE PAGE:  Scribbled words from the entry jump out 
           and grab him.  “HIS MOTHER”.  “CHILDBIRTH”.  “SAN FRANCISCO”.  
           “DIED”.

           Fiddler John stops.  His eyes goes dead and cold.  Edmund’s 
           mother is staring at him through the glass.  Motionless.

           Whispering the answer to him from the past.

           INT. CALVIN ED’S TENT - NIGHT

           Calvin Ed is passed out alone in his tent.  There is a 
           distant CLATTER of noise from the farmhouse.

           EXT. GRAVES - NIGHT

           Blood in a water bucket.  A hand brings a rag down into the 
           water and out again.  Emily is cleaning underneath her dress 
           in front of the two graves.

           Edmund appears from the porch, dumping out a pot of grease 
           into the snow.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (O.S.)
                        Emily!  Let’s go!

           Emily drops the rag into the bucket and walks by Edmund.

                                 EMILY
                        They know.

           She moves through the front door into the house.
           INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

           Dinner is ready.  Fiddler John, Charley, and Red Baker are 
           sitting and talking by the table when Emily appears.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        There you are.  Serve out the stew 
                        and then you can take yours and go 
                        look after C.E. in the tent.

                                 EMILY
                        Yes, Fiddler.

           She brings the stew from the kitchen and doles it out.

                                 CHARLEY
                        Where’s the boy?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        He’s coming.

                                 RED BAKER
                        That girl’s got a new trick every 
                        time I’m with her.  Always a 
                        surprise, I tell you.

                                 CHARLEY
                        Is that right?

                                 RED BAKER
                        You just gotta know how to bring it 
                        out of her like I do.

           Charley looks up as Edmund appears in the doorway.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Edmund.  Come here.  Beside me.

           Edmund takes his place as Emily takes her bowl and walks 
           outside to the camp.

                                 EDMUND
                        Emily not eating with us tonight?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        The dinner table is not for whores, 
                        Edmund.

                                 EDMUND
                        This is my dinner table.  It’s not 
                        your place to say who eats here and 
                        who don’t.
           Silence in the room.  Fiddler John’s face breaks open into a 
           wide smile.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        That’s your prerogative, Edmund.  
                        If you will allow, I just want to 
                        say a simple grace and then we’ll 
                        call her back in.

                                 EDMUND
                        Go on then.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Let’s all join hands for the 
                        blessing.

           All of the men, including Edmund, join hands at the table.  
           Fiddler John grabs Edmund, not by the hand, but by the wrist.  
           The Fiddler takes a fierce hold on him.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Good.
                             (bows his head)
                        Be with us tonight, oh Lord, as we 
                        suffer and sin. Every man alone 
                        under your judgment.  We can only 
                        beg your mercy and await the 
                        punishments you have in store.  We 
                        know that we can never ask for true 
                        forgiveness.

           Edmund’s wrist feels like it is going to break under the grip 
           of Fiddler John’s hand.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Whether we be Dysmas or Gestas, the 
                        two thieves crucified on either 
                        side of Jesus on the cross, one 
                        begging for repentance, the other 
                        full of only ridicule and vileness, 
                        we know that we will all be 
                        punished.  We suffer equally and 
                        die.  No man can be washed of his 
                        sins, and no sin can be left 
                        unpunished.  We will hold true to 
                        that tonight.  Amen.

                                 EVERYONE IN UNISON
                        Amen.

           THEN IT HAPPENS ALL AT ONCE.  Every hand breaks free except 
           Edmund’s, still held by the wrist.  Fiddler John, in one 
           move, SLAMS EDMUND’S HAND DOWN ONTO THE TABLE, TAKES HIS 
           DINNER KNIFE, AND STABS EDMUND THROUGH THE HAND.
           CHAOS.  Edmund falls out of his chair, SCREAMING, the knife 
           in his left hand through the dinner table.  Blood pouring out 
           through the table to the ground below.

           Fiddler John JUMPS UP ONTO THE TABLE, crouching over the 
           screaming boy.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        WHY WOULD YOU STEAL FROM ME EDMUND?  
                        HOW DID YOU POSSIBLY THINK YOU 
                        COULD GET AWAY WITH IT?

           Edmund falls to the floor.  He clings to his wounded hand.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        ARE YOU LISTENING, BOY?

           Fiddler John yanks the knife out of his hand, and Edmund 
           collapses fully on to the ground. 

           Fiddler John jumps off the table and straddles him.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        LET NO SIN GO UNPUNISHED!  LIKE HIS 
                        COCKSUCKER FATHER!  ALL LIES AND 
                        DECEIT THIS BOY!

           The Fiddler grabs Edmund by the hair and lifts his head up.  
           Edmund is on the verge of passing out.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        CAN YOU HEAR ME, SON?  ARE YOU 
                        LISTENING?  YOU ARE A THIEF AND A 
                        LIAR.  A SINNER.  I AM THE LORD’S 
                        RIGHT HAND.  BRINGING HIS 
                        RETRIBUTION DOWN UPON YOU!

           Fiddler John looks up at his men, who have backed against the 
           wall.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Charley.

           No answer.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Charley!

                                 CHARLEY
                        Yes, Fiddler?
                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Go grab the shovel and dig up what 
                        is rightfully mine.  Then bring it 
                        here.  Inside.

                                 CHARLEY
                        Fiddler?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        What’s the matter, Charley?  What?  
                        Don’t you know where it is?  Don’t 
                        you know where he hid it?

           The Fiddler is laughing now, looking down at his victim.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Haven’t you figured it out?  It’s 
                        been here the whole time!  Just 
                        right outside!  Under my fucking 
                        nose!

           He leaps up off of Edmund and grabs the photograph of 
           Edmund’s mother off of the wall, painting the dirty glass 
           with her boy’s blood.

           Fiddler John hops back on top of Edmund and breaks open the 
           picture, ripping the paper out and SHOVING IT IN EDMUND’S 
           MOUTH.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Go take a look at his poor old 
                        momma’s grave!  
                             (to Edmund)
                        She ain’t there though, is she 
                        Edmund?  Never fucking was!

           Charley and Red Baker exit.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Very clever, you little fuck!  Died 
                        in childbirth in fucking San 
                        Francisco!  Very fucking clever!

           EXT. CALVIN ED’S TENT - NIGHT

           Emily can hear the yelling and watches as Red Baker and 
           Charley grab shovels and move to the side of the yard.
           EXT. GRAVES - NIGHT

           A shovel hauling frozen dirt out of the ground.  Charley is 
           working only by moonlight, digging deeper and deeper into the 
           grave.

           Edmund is sitting on the porch watching the dig.  Dried blood 
           on his face and his left hand turning shades of black.  Red 
           Baker is sitting with him, a rifle pointed in his face.

                                 RED BAKER
                        You and me, we’ve been here before.

           Fiddler John is standing alone in the dark.  He has his back 
           to all of them, looking out across the trees and the snow.

           Emily comes out of Calvin Ed’s tent and approaches the 
           Fiddler.

                                 EMILY
                        Fiddler?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        What is it?

                                 EMILY
                        You got no further cause to harm 
                        that boy.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Is that so?

                                 EMILY
                        I heard the screaming in there.  
                        I’ve ridden with you long enough.  
                        The world would just as well stay 
                        the same if, once you get what you 
                        want, we ride outta here.  On our 
                        way.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Are you coming along then?

           Emily stops.

                                 EMILY
                        Aren’t I?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        You get back in that tent and do 
                        what I told you to.  I’ll deal with 
                        you later.

           Emily slinks away back where she came from.
                                 CHARLEY
                        Fiddler!

           Charley raises an oak barrel with his hands out of the earth 
           and hurls it out into the snow.  He cracks it open with his 
           shovel.  

           Meat and salt pour out of the barrel.  Charley covers his 
           nose, sifting through the contents.

           And there it is.  Pay dirt.  Over eighty leather pouches pour 
           out.  Charley looks in them.  Gold Double Eagles.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        You got them?

                                 CHARLEY
                        I got them, alright.  We’re all 
                        set.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Good.
                             (to Red Baker)
                        Take him inside.  We leave at first 
                        light.

           Red Baker sets his rifle aside and grabs a handful of 
           Edmund’s hair.  As Red is dragging him screaming into the 
           house, Edmund can see the Fiddler move toward the grave, 
           putting his hands on the white cross.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

           Red Baker throws Edmund by the hair into the center of the 
           room.  Fiddler John appears silhouetted in the doorway 
           holding the large, wooden cross in his hands.

           He moves swiftly over to Edmund and raises the cross, 
           STRIKING HIM OVER THE HEAD AND KNOCKING HIM UNCONSCIOUS.

           INT. CHARLEY’S TENT - NIGHT

           Red Baker and Charley are perched on their beds, trading 
           shots of whiskey between them.

                                 RED BAKER
                        I ain’t seen him like this in a 
                        long time.

                                 CHARLEY
                        Remember the family in Fort Worth?  
                        The son?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLEY (CONT'D)
                        We snuck on up into that house.  
                        Fiddler and I did away quick with 
                        the mother and the father.  The two 
                        sisters made a wretch of noise.  
                        Fiddler went up to the boy’s room, 
                        and the boy was sitting there, wide 
                        awake.  Sittin’ up.  Said he knew 
                        the Fiddler was coming.  Knew his 
                        name.  Knew my name too.

           Red Baker takes another shot of whiskey and lays himself down 
           across the bed.

                                 RED BAKER
                        No shit?

                                 CHARLEY
                        Then it was.  Fiddler picked the 
                        boy up from the bed and put his 
                        long arms around him.  Set him down 
                        on his knee.  I sat there in the 
                        corner.  Fiddler made him look up 
                        at the night sky and name the stars 
                        while he took his knife and opened 
                        up the boy’s throat.  Blood pouring 
                        out over all those expensive 
                        bedsheets.

                                 RED BAKER
                        My Lord.

                                 CHARLEY
                        He was a wreck.  Hitting the booze 
                        day and night.  I guess eventually 
                        we just left it alone.  I can’t 
                        even remember why we did it.  
                        Wasn’t nothing in the house.

                                 RED BAKER
                        The Fiddler took a shine to this 
                        boy.

                                 CHARLEY
                        He did.

                                 RED BAKER
                        Said he was coming with us.  Right 
                        up until I showed him that leather 
                        pouch.
           INT. CALVIN ED’S TENT - NIGHT

           Two bodies lay still in the darkness.  Emily is lying on the 
           ground, listening, her eyes wide open.  She can hear Charley 
           and Red Baker talking in the tent beside them.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - DAWN

           Darkness.  Edmund slowly opens his swollen eyes.  He is 
           cowering in the corner.  Fiddler John is sitting on the 
           dinner table before him, looking down.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Are you awake then?

                                 EDMUND
                        Huh?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        I said ‘are you awake’?

           Fiddler John takes a long pull from a bottle of whiskey.

                                 EDMUND
                        You’re gonna kill me?

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Yes.

                                 EDMUND
                        What’s stopping you?

           Edmund can see the white cross sitting next to the Fiddler on 
           the table.  The bottom is splattered with blood from his own 
           head.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        I’ve killed many boys.  Your age 
                        and younger.  All different ways 
                        too.  The way you do it has 
                        meaning.  You wouldn’t think it, 
                        but it does.  Personal not just to 
                        the victim, but personal to all the 
                        involved parties.  The way it’s 
                        done.  The nature of it.  You 
                        remember it.  The whore asked me to 
                        leave you be, and I’ve been turning 
                        it over in my mind.  I could.  It 
                        would have no effect on me, leaving 
                        you out here in these woods.  No 
                        one would know.  But it’s not about 
                        me.  It would be a disservice to 
                        you.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Leaving you here, disgraced and 
                        rotten, festering like a sore on 
                        this mountain.  A no good dogshit 
                        thief and liar.  It wouldn’t be 
                        right to let you go on with this 
                        diseased life.  Wouldn’t be the 
                        Lord’s Way.

           INT. CALVIN ED’S TENT - DAWN

           Emily is sifting through Calvin Ed’s belongings.  She lays 
           her hands on a HUNTING KNIFE in his bag and then climbs into 
           the bed on top of him and puts the knife up to his throat.

                                 CALVIN ED
                        Do it.

           Emily stops.  She can see Calvin Ed’s delirious eyes wide 
           open in the darkness.

                                 CALVIN ED (CONT’D)
                        I’ve done all the wrong things, 
                        Momma.  Leave me behind.

           Emily covers the man’s mouth with her hand and STABS HIM IN 
           THE SIDE OF THE THROAT MULTIPLE TIMES.  AGAIN AND AGAIN...

           Calvin Ed struggles beneath her as blood rises up from his 
           mouth over her hand.  She takes her hand away and moves off 
           of him quietly.

                                 EMILY
                        That’s for all the evil shit you 
                        done to me, you sonavabitch.

           Emily moves quickly.  She finds the Winchester Repeater rifle 
           near his bed.  She takes a box of shells and loads the rifle, 
           shoving the scope inside her jacket.

           No movement outside.  Checking that no one heard her, Emily 
           lifts the back of the tent and rolls herself outside.

           EXT. TENTS - DAWN

           Crouched, Emily draws the rifle up eye-level and can see the 
           three tents laid out before her.  Calvin Ed’s tent in front 
           of her is black and silent.

           In the second tent, Emily can see Red Baker and Charley 
           asleep, silhouetted by the candlelight.  She raises her rifle 
           up and aims slow and careful at the first of the two shadows.  
           The shots have to come quick.  One then two.  She cannot give 
           the other any time.

           She stops, thinking.  Fiddler John’s tent is quiet.  She 
           looks around and sees him...

           INT. FRONT ROOM - DAWN

           Fiddler John has his pistol out.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Do you know the Lord’s Prayer?

                                 EDMUND
                        My father knew it.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        He taught it to you?

           Edmund does not respond.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I wonder what the father would 
                        think of the son now.

           Fiddler John drops six bullets into the cylinder of his 
           pistol.

           Edmund sees her first.  Emily.  Through the doorway.  She has 
           her rifle aimed directly at the Fiddler.

           BAM!  Edmund ducks as the rifle blast hits the wall directly 
           above him.  The wood splinters and hits the floor.  She 
           missed.  

           Fiddler John barely has time to turn around when...

           BAM!  The rifle fires again and TAKES OFF A PIECE OF FIDDLER 
           JOHN’S EAR.  Blood and cartilage jumping up into the air.

           In one quick move, Fiddler John ducks down, flips over the 
           dinner table and crouches behind it.  The dinner plates, 
           still on the table and full of food, come crashing onto the 
           floor.

           BAM!  BAM!  BAM!  Bullet holes rip through the table inches 
           away from the Fiddler’s face.

           Fiddler John turns quickly around to find Edmund, but he is 
           already gone.
           INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Edmund sails into the bedroom on his hands and knees, moving 
           toward the gun case under the bed.  He reaches it and puts 
           his hands on the Hawken rifle.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Fiddler John peeks out from the table, pistol in hand, to see 
           Red Baker and Charley running up to the front door.  He sits 
           himself up and looks around, but there is no sign of Emily.

                                 CHARLEY
                        What’s going on?

           Fiddler John motions the men inside and locks the door behind 
           them.  He looks at them and smiles.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        The whore’s got a rifle and she 
                        shot my ear off.

           Charley can see the blood pouring down the side of Fiddler 
           John’s face.

                                 CHARLEY
                        Jesus...

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Now, just listen.  This will be 
                        easy enough to clean up.
                             (to Red Baker)
                        Red, get the horses saddled up.  I 
                        want to be ready to leave within 
                        the hour.  Give me your rifle.
                             (to Charley)
                        The whore went around the back of 
                        the house.  I’ll go back around and 
                        take care of it.  The boy is hiding 
                        in the bedroom.  He’s got the 
                        Hawken so he’s only got one shot.

                                 CHARLEY
                        Yes, sir.

           INT. FOREST EDGE - THAT MOMENT

           Emily moves quickly into the dark trees at the back of the 
           farmhouse.  She slings the Winchester over her shoulder, and, 
           taking a firm hold, starts to climb up one of the pines.
           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Fiddler John has a firm grip on Red Baker’s rifle in his 
           hands as he moves off of the front porch to the side of the 
           house.  His revolver is shoved hastily into the back of his 
           pants.  

           He looks over at the hog pen.  His eyes scan the bushes at 
           the side of the house.  The trapdoor to the cellar.  The 
           trees ahead.  No movement.

           INT. CALVIN ED’S TENT - THAT MOMENT

           Red Baker opens Calvin Ed’s tent and begins to move inside 
           but pauses.  He looks at his friend lying in the bed, bloody 
           and quiet.  He exits.

           INT. FIDDLER JOHN’S TENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Red Baker is on his hands and knees, loading all of the 
           Orofino Mine pouches into a knapsack to take with them.  He 
           starts to gather up all of the Fiddler’s belongings at a 
           frantic pace.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ten Charley has his Remington New Model Army pistol drawn and 
           moves silently through the wreckage of the dinner table and 
           the scattered food.  His eyes move over the empty kitchen.

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The door to the bedroom BURSTS OPEN and Charley stands in the 
           doorway, pistol drawn, but Edmund is not there.  He scans 
           under the beds and the closet.  No sign of the boy.

           EXT. PINE TREE - MOMENTS LATER

           Hidden in the darkness, Emily has perched herself unsteadily 
           on the strongest branch she can find.  She is crouched, 
           balanced against the trunk.

           In one movement, she finds the long scope in her coat pocket, 
           screws it quickly to the top mount of the rifle, and raises 
           the sight up eye-level, aiming.

           She watches Fiddler John through the dirty glass of the scope 
           as he moves across the side of the house.  The rifle aimed at 
           his head.  She holds her breath.
           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENT LATER

           Charley sees the empty gun case on the bed and moves to the 
           door.  There are only a few places the kid could be.

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Darkness in the bathroom.  Charley’s footsteps quietly creep 
           up, shadows against the light near the bottom of the door.

           INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

           Charley puts his ear to the bathroom door, listening.  
           Silence.  After a long moment...

           INT. BATHROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Charley rips open the door to the bathroom, light pouring in 
           from the front room.  Empty.  Only the dark, empty hole of 
           the toilet.  Charley moves slowly toward it, his footsteps 
           CREAKING on the floorboards.

           INT. TOILET - THAT MOMENT

           Edmund, crouching in the darkness.  His rifle pointed upward 
           at the circular light.  Standing in nearly a foot of human 
           waste.

           INT. BATHROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Charley, tentative, peers over into the toilet.  Blackness 
           and shadow.  And then...

           BAM!  THE BRIGHT FLASH OF GUNFIRE THROUGH THE DARKNESS BELOW.  
           The round goes into Ten Charley just over his right eye, 
           shutting his motor off and spraying blood over the bathroom.  
           Without a scream, Charley collapses to his knees, his eyes 
           going black and dead.  His head hits the ground and shakes 
           the room.

           EXT. PINE TREE - THAT MOMENT

           Emily, her finger just about to squeeze the trigger, loses 
           her shot at the sound of the ECHOING GUNFIRE.  Through the 
           sight, she watches Fiddler John move quickly back toward the 
           house.
                                 EMILY
                        Dammit.

           INT. BATHROOM - THAT MOMENT

           The Hawken rifle rises quickly out of the toilet and Edmund 
           follows, raising himself up on to the bench, gagging from the 
           smell.  He looks down at his pants and shoes, dark with 
           filth.

           Edmund tosses the rifle aside and falls to the floor near 
           Charley, picking up his Remington pistol.  He opens the 
           cylinder and sees that it is fully loaded.  Six shots.

           Edmund takes a last look at Charley.  Looks into his eyes.  
           Charley is staring back at him, his mouth moving but no sound 
           coming out.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Edmund crawls silently out of the bathroom, pistol in one 
           hand and rifle in the other.  He pauses in the doorway, 
           looking out.

           BAM!  BAM!  BAM!  Sudden rifle fire all around him.  Wood in 
           the door frame splintering and flying into the air.  He loses 
           his balance, falling on his back into the bedroom.  As he 
           shuts the door with his legs, he sees...

           FIDDLER JOHN.  Outside the far window.  Aiming his rifle down 
           the long hallway at Edmund...

           INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Edmund slams the door shut with his legs and rolls out of the 
           way just as RIFLE FIRE SPRAYS THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE DOOR.

           EXT. FAR WINDOW - THAT MOMENT

           Fiddler John, raising the rifle and moving away from the 
           window, stops cold.  He looks again down the long hall...

           A hand in the bathroom doorway.  Motionless.  Charley is 
           dead.

           EXT. HITCHING POST - MOMENTS LATER

           Red Baker is almost finished loading up the pack saddles on 
           the four horses when Fiddler John comes around the corner.
                                 RED BAKER
                        Calvin Ed’s dead.

           This does not phase Fiddler John in the slightest.  He tosses 
           the empty rifle at Red and pulls out the pistol from the back 
           of his pants.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        I need your Colt and rounds for the 
                        Remington.  Quick.

           Red Baker gives him his pistol and a handful of cartridges.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        That it?

                                 RED BAKER
                        Yeah.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        We’ll take ‘em all, but we only 
                        need saddles and stirrups ready for 
                        two.

           Red watches as Fiddler John moves back toward the house.  
           Holding the Colt under his arm, Fiddler loads up the 
           Remington and shoves the remaining bullets into his coat 
           pocket, A FEW SLIPPING FROM HIS GRIP AND HITTING THE GROUND 
           BELOW.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Fiddler John moves silently through the front doorway like a 
           shadow, two pistols drawn.  The front room is empty.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                             (calling out)
                        Edmund!  Where are you gonna go, 
                        boy?  This is Death that’s comin’ 
                        for you!

           INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Edmund is crouched in the corner of the room, listening.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN (O.S.)
                        You can’t run from it!

           He has no clever ideas left.  Panicked, he turns over the 
           first bed, standing the mattress on it’s long side.  Gripping 
           the edge, he hides behind it, his other hand on Charley’s 
           Remington.  He watches the bedroom door.
           EXT. HITCHING POST - MOMENTS LATER

           Red Baker is listening as well, breaking open a new revolver.  
           He turns his eyes to the forest’s edge.  Darkness beyond the 
           trees.

           EXT. PINE TREE - THAT MOMENT

           Emily, hidden, holds her breath, her thumb bringing back the 
           hammer.

           THROUGH THE SIGHT:  Red Baker at the hitching post.

           She lets out a long breath and makes the adjustment, 
           squeezing the trigger...

           EXT. HITCHING POST - THAT MOMENT

           Red Baker, dropping in the first bullet, FREEZES at the sound 
           of ROCKETING RIFLE FIRE through the clearing...

           A LOUD SPLASH as the bullet rips through the pig trough just 
           a few feet away from Red and water LEAPS UP INTO THE AIR.

                                 RED BAKER 
                        Oh Hell...

           Without even a second to duck, ANOTHER SHOT HITS RED IN THE 
           CHEST AND COLLAPSES HIM TO THE GROUND, HIS EYES WIDE.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Fiddler John, checking the empty kitchen, lifts his head at 
           the sound of the gunfire.

           EXT. TREES - THAT MOMENT

           A cloud of ghostly white rifle smoke rising over the tops of 
           the pine trees and disappearing.

           EXT. PINE TREE - THAT MOMENT

           Emily, shrouded by the white smoke, raises the weapon away 
           and lets out a quick breath.
           INT. FRONT ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           A worried look crosses Fiddler John’s face, recognizing the 
           snap and hiss of the rifle fire even from a distance.  It was 
           the Winchester that Emily was holding.  And it was only two 
           shots.  No way to tell how many more she might have.

           He calls out to the boy, lying through his teeth.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Now that’s two pulls from the 
                        Winchester Repeater, Edmund.  Not 
                        too far away neither.  There’s a 
                        strong shot your girl didn’t 
                        survive it, not with Red at the 
                        trigger.  Just you and me now.  
                        There’s no more help comin’...

           Fiddler John pulls open the trapdoor and peers into the empty 
           basement.

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Edmund waits, breathless.  He’s lost his only ally.  

           The creaking of FOOTSTEPS ON THE WOODEN FLOOR.  He readies 
           himself, cocking his pistol.  The closed bedroom door.  The 
           dark room.  Each moment draws itself out longer and longer.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Gripping the rifle at her side, Emily travels quickly and 
           quietly from the trees to the side of the house.

           EXT. HITCHING POST - THAT MOMENT

           She moves carefully to the post to see if Red Baker survived 
           the gunshot.

           But he’s NOT THERE.  She stops.  An empty spot in the snow 
           colored with blood and dirt.  Tracks.  No sign of Red Baker.

           Emily is caught off guard.  She kneels down, cocking the 
           rifle.

           Now the horses are uneasy.  Grunting and whimpering.  Emily 
           turns to see why...

           Wolves at the edge of the clearing.
           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Fiddler John kicks in the bedroom door.  He spots Edmund 
           behind the mattress in an instant and ducks back into the 
           hallway just as...

           BAM!  BAM!  Edmund fires twice into the empty doorway, 
           hitting the wall where the Fiddler was standing only a second 
           before.

           Silence.  Edmund stays crouched, watching the open doorway.  
           Ready.

           INT. BATHROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Fiddler John escapes into the dark and quickly faces the 
           wooden wall that joins the bedroom to the bathroom.  He can 
           picture the layout of the bedroom in his mind and he 
           sidesteps, one at a time, measuring out where Edmund might be 
           crouched in the next room.

           He aims both pistols a foot apart at the wall.

           INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Edmund, still hunkered down, keeps his gaze intent on the 
           doorway.

           BAM!  BAM!  BAM!  Gunshots out of nowhere from the opposite 
           wall.

           Edmund falls to the ground, two bullets hitting the wall 
           behind him and one hitting him square in the shoulder.

           Fiddler John comes storming into the room, moving around the 
           mattress as both men UNLOAD THEIR WEAPONS.

           A TORNADO OF GUNFIRE.  But there are no fancy movements or 
           dodging of bullets.  There is no poetry to it.  It is clumsy 
           and brutal.  They stand feet apart and fire, missing and 
           hitting the wall or the floor...

           CHAOS...SMOKE AND FIRE IN THE ROOM...

           Fiddler John’s Remington tears into Edmund’s thigh...

           Edmund, with his last bullet, FIRES AND HITS THE FIDDLER IN 
           THE CHEST, SPINNING HIM AROUND AS HE COLLAPSES.
           EXT. HITCHING POST - THAT MOMENT

           Emily is frozen listening to the sound of the gunfire.  Her 
           eye catches a glimmer on the ground in the bloody snow where 
           Red fell.  His PISTOL.

           She eyes the outside cellar door.

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Edmund manages to pull himself up off of the floor.  Bloody, 
           he kneels over the Fiddler with a firm grip on his weapon.  
           Fiddler John slowly opens his eyes and sees the barrel of a 
           gun pointed directly at him, HIS BREATH LEAVING HIS LUNGS...

           CLICK.  CLICK.  Edmund pulls the trigger at the man on the 
           ground.  Fiddler winces, cowering.  It is a dry fire.  An 
           empty revolver.

           Wounded and bloody, Edmund crawls on all fours out of the 
           room.

           BAM!  A shot from Fiddler John’s gun misses just above Edmund 
           as he disappears from the doorway

           Fiddler John, blood running down the front of his shirt, 
           picks himself up.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Edmund is pulling himself along the floor, using the last of 
           his energy, looking frantically around the room.  Then he 
           sees it...

           A BULLET.  No...A COLLECTION OF BULLETS.  Scattered in the 
           front doorway.

           INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

           Fiddler John, looking for the boy, pulls himself slowly along 
           the wall, leaving a long smear of blood behind him.

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - THAT MOMENT

           Edmund on his knees in the front doorway.  Trying to steady 
           his hand long enough to fit a bullet into the cylinder of 
           Charley’s Remington.

           The bullet slides into the first chamber.  A perfect fit...
           INT. FRONT ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Fiddler John spots Edmund in the doorway.  He lifts up his 
           pistol.  Edmund, his back to the Fiddler, closes the cylinder 
           of the revolver and cocks the gun...

           BAM!  FIDDLER JOHN SHOOTS EDMUND IN THE BACK.  Edmund 
           collapses outside, falling like a wet sack into the snow.

           Fiddler John relaxes his weapon as a figure appears behind 
           him from the open cellar trapdoor.

           Suddenly, A PISTOL COCK, and he can feel cold metal against 
           the back of his head.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Emily, my sweet...

           Fiddler John smiles.  Emily has Red Baker’s Colt fixed on 
           him.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Edmund is on the ground, breathing heavily in the snow.  He 
           has given up.  Shot three times.

           HE DOES NOT SEE:  Fiddler John and Emily behind him through 
           the doorway.  Motionless.

                                 FIDDLER JOHN
                        Can’t help but wonder...

           BAM!  He can not even finish his sentence as EMILY’S PISTOL 
           FIRE RIPS THROUGH HIS HEAD AND COLLAPSES HIM TO THE FLOOR...

           INT. FRONT ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Emily draws back the gun, a thick cloud of gray smoke filling 
           the room.  She breathes it in, her eyes still fixed on the 
           space where Fiddler’s head used to be.  It is a long 
           moment...

           A black pool of blood begins to silently grow beneath the man 
           on the ground, creeping across the wood flooring.

           Emily watches the blood and then moves, taking extra care as 
           she heads out of the house not to step in the dark puddle 
           beneath her.

           Emily checks her gun.  An empty chamber.  She holsters her 
           weapon and moves to Edmund.  He is struggling with his 
           breath, twisted up on the ground.

                                 EMILY
                        Where’s Charley?
                             (He does not hear her)
                        Where’s Charley, Edmund?

                                 EDMUND
                             (turning)
                        Shot.

                                 EMILY
                        Dead?

           Edmund gives a slight nod of his head.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        That’s it then.  Where are you hit?

           She unbuttons his coat quickly.  No time to linger.

                                 EDMUND
                        Baker.

                                 EMILY
                             (uneasy look)
                        I shot Baker.

           Edmund winces as the coat opens over his wounds.  Emily looks 
           the boy over.  He starts to cough, and she can see that he is 
           in trouble.  The snow beneath him is a deep red.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                             (shaken)
                        C.E. is dead.  Ain’t no one left 
                        but us two.

           The slightest smile finds its way onto Edmund’s face.

                                 EDMUND
                        We got ‘em all, you and me.

           HOG PEN

           The sound of SQUEALING from the hog pen.  A pack of gray 
           wolves at the side of the house.  They have smelled blood and 
           seized the moment, collapsing onto the sick and paralyzed 
           animals.
           EMILY

           Unbuttoning Edmund’s shirt.

                                 EMILY
                        The pain is somethin’ fierce, ain’t 
                        it?  Feels like the air’s just 
                        comin’ out of you.  But it’s a 
                        false notion.  You ain’t hurt that 
                        bad.

           She wipes her face hard with the side of her coat sleeve.  
           His blood smearing across her cheek.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Bad news is that we’ve got to move 
                        you.  Hold on. 

           Emily works quick, tearing little pieces off the bottom of 
           her shirt and tying them around Edmund’s wounds, trying to 
           put some pressure on the bleeding.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                             (nervous)
                        Ready then?

           Emily tries to lift Edmund up by the shoulders but he lets 
           out a loud WAIL.

                                 EDMUND
                        No, no.

                                 EMILY
                        We have to move you.

                                 EDMUND
                        No.  I’m staying.

                                 EMILY
                        No arguing.  There ain’t no time.

                                 EDMUND
                        No.  No time.

           Emily stops.  She can see the look in his eyes.  He knows the 
           condition he is in just as well as she does.

           CALVIN ED’S TENT

           A low breathing inside the dark tent.

           A set of eyes watching Emily’s back as she kneels beside 
           Edmund only a few yards away.
           EMILY

           Her eyes move from Edmund and are now following the path of a 
           wolf as it moves from the hog pen to the front porch and then 
           inside the house.  They are closing in.

           Her window for a clean departure is closing every moment.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           The silhouette of a wolf in the doorway.  It’s long shadow 
           moving across Fiddler John’s dead body.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           No more time.  Emily picks up the revolver in Edmund’s hand.

                                 EMILY
                        Alright.

           She cracks it open.  One bullet.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll bring back help.  It’s less 
                        than a day’s travel to Stevens at a 
                        gallop.  There will be a doctor 
                        there.  
                             (beat)
                        Can you make it until I get back?

                                 EDMUND
                        Ain’t no good come of it...what 
                        I’ve done in this place.

                                 EMILY
                        Hold still.

                                 EDMUND
                        It’s a mess.

                                 EMILY
                        Don’t you be sorry for what you 
                        done here.
                             (urgently)
                        Now can you make it?

           Edmund nods his head.  She hands him the pistol.

                                 EDMUND
                        I’ll be here.
                                 EMILY
                        Good.

           She tries to keep her gaze on Edmund as the wolf inside the 
           house pounces at the body lying on the floor.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        You’ll see me round that forest 
                        edge after the next nightfall.  You 
                        keep your eyes intent there Edmund.

                                 EDMUND
                        I will.

           Without taking a second look, she moves away, walking quickly 
           to the horses.

           EXT. HOG PEN - THAT MOMENT

           The wolves inside the hog pen.  Most of the hogs cannot move 
           anymore, but the ones that can are running for their lives.

           A slaughter.  Fangs cutting into their skin.  Blood.

           EXT. HITCHING POST - THAT MOMENT

           Emily unties Fiddler John’s horse and leads it away from the 
           post.  She checks in the bags.  Gold.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Edmund can hear a HORSE WHINNY and HOOVES IN THE SNOW.  He 
           looks up to see Emily on horseback moving away from the farm.  
           The horse is loaded with heavy saddle bags and has a 
           difficult time moving very fast.

           EMILY

           In an involuntary moment, Emily stops the horse near the camp 
           and looks back at Edmund.  He lay helpless on the ground, 
           watching her as she leaves the clearing.

           She feels a sudden compulsion to turn around and make her way 
           back, but as she grabs the reigns, she sees Edmund give her 
           the slightest nod, and it is all she needs.  She pushes the 
           horse forward.
           EDMUND

           Watching her ride, but she no longer looks back.  Emily is 
           riding hard across the front yard toward the wheat field.  
           She has her gaze intent on the forest ahead.

           HOG PEN

           A lone wolf finds his way out of the pen and sets his sights 
           on the half-dead boy limp in the bloody snow. A GROWL...

           EDMUND

           He sees the wolf now.  Approaching him without any notion of 
           fear or hesitation.  In only a moment, the wolf is merely 
           feet away.

           CALVIN ED’S TENT

           A long rifle, low and hidden, trained on Emily as she rides 
           away.

           EDMUND

           Tightens his grip on the pistol and raises it, pointing it up 
           at the wolf just ahead of him.  A stand off...

           He PULLS BACK THE HAMMER...

           CALVIN ED’S TENT

           Red Baker COCKS HIS RIFLE...

           EDMUND

           Stops.  A sound from one of the tents...

           And then Edmund sees him.  Red Baker.  Just beyond the wolf 
           in the closest tent.  Pointing a long rifle at Emily.

           Edmund aims, but the wolf is right in his eyeline.

                                 EDMUND
                             (to himself)
                        Move...

           In one last motion, Edmund FALLS ONTO HIS SIDE, SETS HIS AIM 
           PASSED THE WOLF ONTO RED BAKER, AND SQUEEZES THE TRIGGER...

           BAM!  Red Baker takes a bullet straight through the side of 
           his throat and falls, a spray of blood hitting the flap of 
           the tent.
           Edmund collapses in exhaustion, the pistol falling from his 
           hand.

           EMILY

           Stops her horse at the edge of the clearing as the rippling 
           sound of GUNFIRE rushes by her.  Turning, she sees, in the 
           distance, Edmund on the ground.  No movement.

           The boy shot himself.  She closes her eyes.

           EDMUND

           Twisted up on the ground.  The cold wind rushing over him as 
           he tries in vain to catch his breath.

           In the distance he can hear the SOFT GALLOP OF A HORSE fading 
           away.  He turns his eyes up just in time to see Emily 
           disappear into the darkness of the treeline.

           A peacefulness moves through him, but it does not last...

           A SNARL.  The wolf, scared off momentarily by the pistol 
           fire, is now only several yards away.  It will not be 
           deterred.  

           Edmund meets the gaze of the animal, knowing that it will 
           never get the better of him.  He turns his eyes up to the 
           white sky above.  

           Snow falling.  He watches his last frozen breaths as they 
           evaporate up into the emptiness, each one more labored than 
           the last, until they cease...

           And the sound of the wind through the forest trees so loud in 
           his ears that he can hardly hear the low growl and the steady 
           rhythm of paws approaching in the snow.

                                                              FADE OUT.
