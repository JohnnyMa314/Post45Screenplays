           A TITLE CARD reads: “Rockville, MD. 12 Miles Northwest of Our 
           Nation’s Capital. December 17th, 2008.”

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           CLOSE ON scuffed New Balances and courderoy-clad legs 
           sprawled lifelessly on a carpeted floor. 

           A clock radio alarm sounds-- “Last Christmas” by Wham! plays.

           The right New Balance moves slightly, then rests. 

           We travel up the body-- past the courds, across a tightly 
           buttoned vintage navy peacoat spackled with blood, and settle 
           on the pallid face of PETER “PEACOAT” MILLER (21).

           He lays on the floor and uses the corner of a night table as 
           a pillow. His puffy eyes stare at something above.

                                 PEACOAT (V.O.)
                        Fuck. Catman Crothers.

           Peacoat’s POV: the carcass of a GREY CAT sprawled across the 
           blades of a still ceiling fan. It’s face has been torn off, 
           it’s torso checkered with bites and tears.

                                 PEACOAT (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I loved that cat.

           Peacoat looks down at his hands-- bloody, with bits of grey 
           fur and flesh under his fingernails.

                                 PEACOAT (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Ok asswipe. Relax. Recount recent 
                        events... Parents in Boca. 
                        Proverbial fort held down by me.

           On his desk is the clock radio-- it reads 6:48.

                                 PEACOAT (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Last night-- supposed to take out 
                        trash, shovel driveway. Did 
                        neither. 

           Next to the clock radio is a large bong.

                                 PEACOAT (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Watched Rudolph special. Did bong 
                        rips. Masturbated online.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:
                                 PEACOAT (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Then black.
                             (pause)
                        I loved that fucking cat.

           TITLE over black-- “THE BLIND RAGE OF PEACOAT MILLER”.

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Peacoat sits at his computer and opens ichat-- he launches a 
           video chat with the name “dopeman69.”

           A window reveals chipper WESAM FAHMY (21, Egyptian, painfully 
           nerdy-- thick glasses, a messy ‘fro, acne).

                                 WESAM
                        Catchin’ the worm, old pal?

                                 PEACOAT
                        My alarm. I shut it off, change the 
                        time. Always sounds at 6:48.

                                 WESAM
                        Buzzard’s luck, man. Even 
                        technology hates you...

                                 PEACOAT
                        And you’re up why?

                                 WESAM
                        Just got in. Finals then a redeye 
                        from LAX. I’m currently hopped up 
                        on No Doz and twizzlers. How’s it 
                        being back?

                                 PEACOAT
                        A welcome reprieve from my string 
                        of C minuses.

                                 WESAM
                        No Bernice?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Spain.

                                 WESAM
                        Cool. So it’s just us boys, 
                        cruisin’ the town--

                                 PEACOAT
                        That’s kinda homosexual.
                                 WESAM
                        You know what I mean. Your sister’s 
                        a distraction for me.

                                 PEACOAT
                        You made your bed on that one. Plus 
                        she’s about to get married. High 
                        time you got over shit.

           Wesam takes a moment, studies his friend.

                                 WESAM
                        What happened to you? Your eyes are 
                        sunken, your apple-cheeks have gone 
                        sallow. You look like Moby.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I feel like shit--

                                 WESAM
                        And your lips-- they’re all dry and 
                        cracked. Reminds me of when I 
                        checked out my anus with a hand 
                        mirror.

           A moment. Then,

                                 PEACOAT
                        I killed my cat.

                                 WESAM
                        Catman Crothers?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Yes.

                                 WESAM
                        You loved that cat.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I know.

                                 WESAM
                        So why would you do such a thing?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Not sure.

                                 WESAM
                        What’s that mean?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Don’t remember.
                                 WESAM
                        What’s the last thing you do 
                        remember?

           Peacoat pauses. Finally...

                                 PEACOAT
                        Sitting down to jerk off.

                                 WESAM
                        Then you blacked out.

           Peacoat nods.

                                 WESAM (CONT’D)
                        Did you cum?

                                 PEACOAT
                        I don’t know. You’re my most 
                        intelligent friend. You figure it 
                        out.

                                 WESAM
                        Flattery is appreciated, but it 
                        sounds like you need an MD. I’m 
                        merely an engineer-to-be.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Fine, don’t help me. Happy fucking 
                        xmas.

                                 WESAM
                        Hang on, hang on... Can you make it 
                        over here?

           Peacoat nods.

                                 WESAM (CONT’D)
                        Then do that. Whenever. We’ll take 
                        it from there. Cool?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Yep.

                                 WESAM
                        Cool. Peace.

           Wesam signs off.

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Peacoat stands on a chair. He pushes the cat carcass off the 
           ceiling fan with a broom. It THUDS into a trash can below.
           EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

           Peacoat digs a small hole in the snow-covered ground. He 
           somberly dumps the cat carcass inside.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           He scrubs blood off the ceiling fan.

           INT. FOYER - LATER

           Peacoat stares at a closed door, taped to which is a photo of 
           his gorgeous sister BERNICE (26), her meathead fiancee MARK 
           (29), and Mark’s golden retriever COMMANDO. 

           A speech bubble extends from each one’s mouth. 

           Bernice’s reads: “Reminder bro-- Feed Commando! CONFINE HIM 
           TO BASEMENT!”

           Mark’s reads: “I pay dog-sitters in euro-porn. Is that Miller 
           household legal tender?”

           Commando’s reads: “Remember, Sully, when I promised to kill 
           you last? I lied.”

           INT. BASEMENT - DAY

           Peacoat plays with and feeds Commando.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

           He shoves his courderoys and peacoat in the washing machine, 
           followed by his boxers and t-shirt. Peacoat reaches for 
           detergent and freezes...

           Three deep red marks on his left bicep catch his eye. The 
           marks trail across his shoulder and go to the middle of his 
           chest, where his light chest hair gives way to a bald patch.

           Peacoat curiously touches the red, irritated skin of the bald 
           spot. He traces his finger across a few dried blood droplets.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Peacoat, in a robe, takes bong hits as “Romancing The Stone” 
           plays on TV-- it’s the final scene-- MICHAEL DOUGLAS (in 
           crocodile boots) and KATHLEEN TURNER are on a yacht.

                                 KATHLEEN TURNER
                        I like your boots.
                                 MICHAEL DOUGLAS
                        That poor old yellow-tailed guy 
                        developed a fatal case of 
                        indigestion. Died right in my arms.

                                 KATHLEEN TURNER
                        I can’t blame him. If I were to 
                        die, there’s nowhere else on earth 
                        I’d rather be.

                                 MICHAEL DOUGLAS
                        I couldn’t stop thinking about you. 
                        I even read one of your books.

                                 KATHLEEN TURNER
                        Then you know how they all end...

           They kiss, the end credits roll... 

           A sudden meow. Then another. And another.

           Peacoat looks at the doorway leading to the kitchen-- an 
           ORANGE CAT hungrily whines for a meal.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Catligula... you asshole. Hungry?
                             (pause)
                        Or do you know what I did to your 
                        comrade?

           Another meow.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        Couldn’t I have killed you instead?

           Peacoat and the cat stare at each other with mutual disdain.

           KITCHEN

           He begrudgingly feeds the orange cat.

           I/E. OLD CHEVY CAVALIER/RESIDENTIAL ROAD - AFTERNOON

           Peacoat drives his car through a chilly suburban wasteland.

           I/E. OLD CHEVY CAVALIER/RESIDENTIAL ROAD - AFTERNOON

           He pulls up in front of a large, white McMansion, walks to 
           the unlocked front door and goes inside.

           INT. MCMANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Peacoat walks through the silent house.
                                 PEACOAT
                        Yo! Wesam!

           Nothing. He descends a flight of stairs into the

           BASEMENT

           He steps into a wood-paneled rec room, looks around-- no one.

                                 WESAM (O.S.)
                             (doing his best “Robocop”)
                        Don’t move, creep.

           Wesam stands in the doorway, over Peacoat’s shoulder. He aims 
           a Laser Tag gun at his friend’s head.

                                 PEACOAT
                        How’d you get there?

                                 WESAM
                        With the stealth of a cougar.

                                 PEACOAT
                        And a children’s toy.

                                 WESAM
                        Think so? Put this on.

           He tosses Peacoat the Laser Tag helmet.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Really?

                                 WESAM
                        Humor me.

           Peacoat studies the bulky ‘80’s-futuristic helmet. As he 
           straps it on...

                                 PEACOAT
                        Let this stand as a testament to my 
                        value of our friendship. No 
                        complaints about helping me--

           ZAP! Wesam fires-- a red beam of light crosses the room, 
           connects with Peacoat’s forehead. His entire head snaps back, 
           then forward.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck--?!

           ZAP! Another shot-- Peacoat flies back into a stack of boxes.
                                 WESAM
                             (approaches Peacoat)
                        Built into this “children’s toy” 
                        are the transformers, oscillator, 
                        and capacitor of your basic 70,000 
                        volt stun gun. The wireless 
                        relationship between gun and helmet 
                        allowed me to--

                                 PEACOAT
                        Send 70,000 volts straight into my 
                        skull.

                                 WESAM
                        Exactly.

                                 PEACOAT
                        You know, fuck you Wesam. You 
                        could’ve caused serious damage--

                                 WESAM
                             (points gun at Peacoat’s 
                              head)
                        It’s just Sam now. Assimilation is 
                        the key to joining campus culture. 
                        It only took me three years to 
                        figure that out.

           Sam grabs a marijuana vaporizer off a desk.

                                 SAM
                        Here. Smoke it off.

           Peacoat appreciatively begins to “smokelessly” smoke weed. He 
           remains nestled in the collapsed stack of boxes on the 
           ground. Sam sits in a nearby chair.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        So tell me what happened.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I already did.

                                 SAM
                        You blacked out while jerking off.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Yeah, but the disturbing part is 
                        that I killed my cat.
                                 SAM
                        Have you ever done things in your 
                        sleep before? Walked, talked, 
                        snored?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Nope. I sleep like a Nostromo crew 
                        member.

                                 SAM
                        Side note, homie-- no one’s ever 
                        gotten laid off the strength of an 
                        “Alien” ref. Pass that shit.

           Peacoat passes him the vaporizer. He hits it.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        And you never blacked out before?

           Peacoat shakes his head.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Well I’m puzzled, bro. We gotta 
                        call in a professional.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Absolutely not.

                                 SAM
                        Why’s that?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Tell a doctor I brutally murdered a 
                        housecat? That’s like some pre-
                        serial killing behavior. I’ll be in 
                        a straight jacket pallin’ around 
                        with a big Indian chief.

                                 SAM
                        Then we leave out the murder part. 
                        This is clearly some kinda head 
                        issue. You need to get your shit 
                        shrunk.

           INT. OFFICE BUILDING/HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           Sam and Peacoat walk down a cold, endless hallway towards a 
           door marked “Dr. Randolph Kaiser, MD.”

                                 PEACOAT
                        This is gonna be awkward.
                                 SAM
                        Yeah?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Been three years.

                                 SAM
                        How’d you leave things?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Didn’t. Moved to Ithaca, just 
                        stopped showing up.

                                 SAM
                        You should’ve called.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I know.

                                 SAM
                        But he’s a professional. I’m sure 
                        it’ll be fine.

                                 PEACOAT
                        He sent me a birthday card for my 
                        eighteenth.

                                 SAM
                        See? No hard feelings then.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Had a picture of a big-breasted, 
                        bikini-clad chick on the front. 
                        Said “This is Edith.” Then on the 
                        inside it had Edith, sans bikini, 
                        holding a birthday cake. And it 
                        read: “It’s your birthday-- have 
                        your cake and Edith too.”

                                 SAM
                        Weird. Doesn’t sound very doctorly.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Yet his reputation precedes him...

                                 SAM
                        Yo you get that evite?

                                 PEACOAT
                        No.
                                 SAM
                        How’d you know what I was talking 
                        about?

                                 PEACOAT
                        I haven’t gotten any evites.

                                 SAM
                        Nelly Skylar’s having her holiday 
                        party tomorrow.

                                 PEACOAT
                        You make it sound like an annual 
                        thing.

                                 SAM
                        It is. You coming?

                                 PEACOAT
                        As a non-invitee? I think not--

           Suddenly the door swings open, almost clocking them.

                                 GIRL (O.S.)
                             (from behind opened door)
                        Bye Dr. Kaiser! Thanks again!

                                 DR. KAISER (O.S.)
                        You take care, dear. See you 
                        next... Valentine’s Day!

           The girl giggles. Sam and Peacoat share a look.

                                 GIRL (O.S.)
                        See you then!

           The girl shuts the door and appears-- it’s VALENTINE SPARKS 
           (21), a beauty with a dark streak. She steps into the hallway 
           and freezes, sensing a look from the boys.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Can I help you two?

                                 SAM
                        You almost hit us. With the door.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Well go sing your song of sorrow to 
                        Dr. K.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Valentine Sparks.
                                 VALENTINE
                        You know me?

                                 PEACOAT
                        We went to school together. First 
                        through twelfth...?

           She takes a moment, releases an annoyed sigh.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Yeah... You and I-- we shared an 
                        unfortunate experience.

                                 PEACOAT
                        So you know who I am?

                                 VALENTINE
                        Peter Miller. Or, sorry-- Peacoat. 
                        And Wesam Fahmy.

                                 SAM
                        Just “Sam” now.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Were you pretending not to know us?

                                 VALENTINE
                        Kind of. How many annoying “catch-
                        up” convos do I have to have every 
                        time I’m home from college? Same 
                        script every time. Gets old.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Then let’s skip that part.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Ok.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Didn’t know you saw Dr. K.

                                 VALENTINE
                        I don’t. Not anymore. Just like to 
                        pop in when I’m home, bat my 
                        eyelashes, re-up on the Lexapro. 
                        Usual shit. What brings you here?

           Peacoat and Sam share a look.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Just some basic life re-assessment.
                                 VALENTINE
                        Thinking of transferring, switching 
                        majors, killing yourself--?

                                 SAM
                        He blacks out every time he 
                        masturbates.

                                 VALENTINE
                             (smirks)
                        Well color me intrigued. And you 
                        think that pervert’s gonna help?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Only one way to find out.

                                 VALENTINE
                        I’d love to hear how this 
                        progresses.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Me too.

                                 VALENTINE
                        You going to Nelly’s Ecumenical 
                        Holiday Booze ’N Fuck Fest?

                                 PEACOAT
                             (to Sam)
                        That’s what it’s called on the 
                        evite?

           Sam nods.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        Well shit. Guess I am now.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Cool. See you two then. Peace.

                                 PEACOAT
                        See ya.

           He watches her wistfully as she disappears down the hallway.

           INT. DR. KAISER’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Peacoat sits uncomfortably on a couch. He stares quietly at 
           DR. KAISER (a 53 year-old Casanova). After a long moment,

                                 DR. KAISER
                        So tell me something.
                                 PEACOAT
                        What do you want?

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Anything at all. What have you been 
                        up to lately?

           Peacoat thinks a moment.

                                 PEACOAT
                        This morning I watched a DVD.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Which film?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Romancing The Stone. Good flick.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        And what about it appealed to you?

                                 PEACOAT
                        I dunno... Cartagena, buried 
                        treasure, a hero who smokes weed 
                        and drinks yet still saves the day 
                        and gets the girl.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        So you aspire to be a little more 
                        like--

                                 PEACOAT
                        Jack T. Colton?

           Kaiser nods.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        He is a pretty smooth dancer.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Peter...

                                 PEACOAT
                        Yeah?

                                 DR. KAISER
                        You gonna tell me why you’re here 
                        now, after a three year absence?

                        I moved away. College.

                        That’s not what I meant...
                             (studies Peacoat)
                        I sense hesitation. You remember 
                        how I made my career, yes?

                        Indirectly. I worked with survivors 
                        of Branch Davidian sexual and 
                        physical abuse. Sent in by Slick 
                        Willie himself.

                        Nothing shocks me. I just wanna 
                        know what’s going on--
                             (touches Peacoat’s head)
                        --in there. Crack that melon open. 
                        Let it all out.

                                 PEACOAT
                        It’s kind of weird.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        It’s all in the way you view it. I 
                        once had a patient who couldn’t 
                        sustain an erection unless he 
                        recited the Declaration of 
                        Independence.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Whoa. Nutjob.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        No. Patriot.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Ok. I’m with you.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        So spill it.

                                 PEACOAT
                        The other night I went to... 
                        pleasure myself.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Magazine, website, grey matter?
                                 PEACOAT
                        Website. So I sit down--

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Which website?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Is that important?

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Maybe.

                                 PEACOAT
                        It’s called “McStiff the Slime 
                        Dog.” Dot com. It’s free.

           Kaiser writes this down.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        What link?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Huh?

                                 DR. KAISER
                        I know those sites. You choose your 
                        fetish-- pigtails, twins, BDSM--

                                 PEACOAT
                        The last link I remember-- said 
                        something like “average looking 
                        Asian teen taken from behind”--

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Average?

                                 PEACOAT
                        I was curious.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Perhaps because you feel you’re 
                        average.

                                 PEACOAT
                        So I’m not three minutes into 
                        the... festivities... when I pass 
                        out. I wake up the next morning on 
                        my bedroom floor.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Do you recall anything from the 
                        night?
                                 PEACOAT
                        No.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Have you been sexually active as of 
                        late?

                                 PEACOAT
                        With a girl?

                                 DR. KAISER
                        With anyone other than yourself?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Negative.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        And the other night-- this was the 
                        first time this has happened?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Yes.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Ok. Good. Here’s what I’m gonna 
                        suggest: Like any medical 
                        condition, we wait it out. See if 
                        it happens again. This could be 
                        holiday stress, could be coming 
                        home from college having to face 
                        the sexual being you were growing 
                        up. You and I both know those years 
                        were no peach.

                                 PEACOAT
                        No they were not.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        So just go about your business. But 
                        if this happens again, I beg you, 
                        call me immediately. Night or day.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Ok. Thanks.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Be safe, Peter. 

           INT. PEACOAT’S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Peacoat and Sam sit on the couch smoking a bong, watching 
           “Romancing The Stone”-- Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner 
           dance to beautifully cheesy music. As they kiss...
                                 SAM
                        I always thought this movie was 
                        just a series of mudslide scenes.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Like you wouldn’t watch that?

                                 SAM
                        I also kinda thought its target 
                        audience was chicks. No offense.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Cuz Joan Wilder’s a romance 
                        novelist? Fuck that. Waterfalls, 
                        crocodiles, partial nudity... It’s 
                        subversively actually for men--

                                 SAM
                        Who enjoy the company of other men.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Fine. Then you will remain one of 
                        the unenlightened.

           Peacoat stops the DVD. CNN appears in its place.

                                 NEWSANCHOR
                             (on TV)
                        We return now to Green Briar, West 
                        Virginia where Senator Blake 
                        Samarin and his wife Jodi, home for 
                        the holidays, were brutally 
                        murdered. Police Chief Randy 
                        Marbelle tells of the shock and 
                        fear that has stricken the 
                        community.

           On TV: fat, mustached CHIEF MARBELLE at a press conference.

                                 CHIEF MARBELLE
                        While we in the department are 
                        deeply saddened that even elected 
                        officials are no longer safe in 
                        their own homes, let me just say 
                        that in this case it is not the 
                        “who”-- it’s the “how” that makes 
                        this cop sick to his stomach.

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)
                        Can you describe what you saw?

           Marbelle takes a long, troubled moment.
                                 CHIEF MARBELLE
                        The bodies of the victims were 
                        partially dismembered. Eyes gouged. 
                        Faces torn straight off.

           Peacoat looks up from the bong.

                                 CHIEF MARBELLE (CONT’D)
                        Tears and bite marks throughout the 
                        flesh. It was just... savage. Never 
                        in my thirty years on the force 
                        have I seen such rage...

           Peacoat has turned white. Sam obliviously watches.

           CNN cuts back to the newsanchor.

                                 NEWSANCHOR
                        The senator’s thirteen-year-old 
                        son, William, was found alone in 
                        the house and is currently being 
                        held for questioning...

                                 SAM
                        Shit is fucked, right? Kid 
                        should’ve at least waited til 
                        Christmas morn, see what he got.

           Sam finally notices his pale, sickly buddy.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Yo-- you alright?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Think I over-smoked. I gotta go to 
                        bed.

                                 SAM
                        You?

           Peacoat nods.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        You must be maturing. You never 
                        over-smoked. Are you maturing?
                             (walks to the door)
                        If I come over tomorrow and you’re 
                        watching “The Big Chill”, we’re 
                        done.
           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Peacoat sits at his computer. He goes to cnn.com-- a headline 
           reads “Senator, wife murdered-- son remains lone suspect.”

           He turns on the computer’s internal camera and hits record. A 
           window on screen captures his every move.

           He goes to the website McStiffTheSlimeDog.com, scans the page 
           for the “average looking Asian teen taken from behind” link.

           He takes a deep breath and clicks it.

           ON SCREEN: Your basic web porno clip-- an ASIAN GIRL (18) 
           gets fucked from behind by a faceless MAN. She moans and 
           speaks in her native tongue.

           Her moaning builds in intensity. She screams loud. Louder. 
           Even louder. She shrieks at the top of her lungs-- it reverbs 
           into silence...

           The porn image becomes solarized as an electronic tune takes 
           over the soundtrack. 

           A gun-wielding HAND reaches into the frame foreground and 
           squeezes the trigger-- BLAM!

           Peacoat flinches. Sweat forms on his brow.

           A hyperkinetic montage of solarized violence (news clips, 
           movie scenes, etc.)-- intercut throughout is a repeated shot 
           of two DOGS humping. 

           Peacoat sweats even more.

           The word “love” appears on screen. It pulses to the music, 
           which gets even faster. As it pulses the word gets larger.

           Peacoat’s wide eyes watch as the word “love” looks like it’s 
           about to explode. Finally it does-- BOOM!

           His eyes slam shut, he hunches over and convulses. Tears roll 
           down his cheeks. Spittle leaks from his mouth.

           Peacoat looks like he’s about to explode, when his body goes 
           limp. His head SLAMS onto the desk below--

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           The clock radio sounds-- “A Wonderful Christmas Time” by Paul 
           McCartney.
           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           The clock reads 6:48. Peacoat lays on his carpet, face down, 
           forehead against the corner of the night table.

           He comes to and checks the ceiling fan-- no carcass.

           A slight rustle draws his attention-- Catligula takes a shit 
           in one of his shoes.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Asshole.

           He goes to his computer and double clicks a file on the 
           desktop-- the clip Peacoat shot of himself last night.

           He hits “play” and watches his “on screen” self start the 
           porn clip. We see bits of what we just saw-- Peacoat reacting 
           to the gunshot, to the violent clips, etc.

           “On screen” Peacoat convulses. Tears stream. Spittle forms. 
           Finally he collapses out of frame.

           Peacoat jogs through the clip until his “on screen” self 
           rises back into frame, eyes closed, a smile on his face. His 
           right hand methodically digs and claws at his left upper arm.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck...?

           “On screen” Peacoat scans the room and walks off.

           Peacoat frantically tears off his coat and lifts his t-shirt-- 
           the red marks on his upper arm are now lined with dried 
           blood. The bald patch in his chest is all scabby. 

           Whatever happened, it’s worse now.

           Peacoat launches an ichat with Sam.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        You up?

                                 SAM
                        I think I’m still on Pacific.

                                 PEACOAT
                        It’s 4 a.m. PST.

                                 SAM
                        Feeling better labia lungs?
                                 PEACOAT
                        It happened again.

                                 SAM
                        You killed your other cat?

                                 PEACOAT
                        I blacked out.

                                 SAM
                        Same deal? Knuckle shuffle on the 
                        piss pump?

                                 PEACOAT
                        I watched the last clip I saw the 
                        other night.

                                 SAM
                        So there’s one specific clip that’s 
                        freakin’ you out.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I think so. Check it.

           Peacoat sends Sam the clip of himself watching the porn.

                                 SAM
                        You want me to watch you rub one 
                        out?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Fuck off. Just watch it, hit me up 
                        when you’re done.

           Peacoat signs off. He immediately picks up his cell phone and 
           dials. After a few rings, he leaves a message.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Dr. K. It’s Peter Miller. It’s 
                        a bit early, sorry. But you wanted 
                        me to call if it happened again. It 
                        did. The thing is though, it seems 
                        to be this one clip-- the “average 
                        Asian girl”-- that knocks me out. I 
                        don’t know. Call me back when you 
                        can. I’d love to come in and see 
                        you today. Thanks.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Peacoat sits on the couch eating cereal and watching CNN-- an 
           ANCHORWOMAN discusses the West Virginia murders.
                                 ANCHORWOMAN
                        Police in Green Briar, West 
                        Virginia remain on the hunt for a 
                        killer despite last night’s 
                        shocking admission. Senator 
                        Samarin’s son, William, released 
                        this statement through his 
                        attorney.

           On screen a graphic of a drafted letter appears. The 
           anchorwoman reads along with it.

                                 ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        “Despite having no recollection of 
                        events on the evening of December 
                        16th, something tells me that I am 
                        responsible. With great regret, and 
                        with no motive, I know that I 
                        murdered my parents in cold blood. 
                        I loved them dearly. I miss them 
                        dearly. William Samarin.”

           The anchorwoman reappears on screen.

                                 ANCHORWOMAN (CONT’D)
                        A search of William’s room found no 
                        evidence linking him to the crime. 
                        He was home-schooled, teachers 
                        described him as an introvert--

           Peacoat’s cell phone rings-- it’s Sam.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Hey.

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        Crazy shit! What the hell were you 
                        doing to your arm?

                                 PEACOAT
                        There’s this whole self-mutilation 
                        element at work. I tore out a chunk 
                        of chest hair.

                                 SAM
                        A chunk. Your chest hair’s 
                        literally about as thick as 
                        Madonna’s daughter’s unibrow.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I like my chest hair. I’m what they 
                        call “retro-sexual.”
                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        Or non-committal. I’m on my way.

           INT. PEACOAT’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           Peacoat sits at his desk while Sam lounges on the bed 
           tinkering with his altered laser tag gun.

                                 SAM
                        So you’ve tested the possibility 
                        that it’s not just this clip?

                                 PEACOAT
                        I watched an over-40 blow an elf 
                        while Santa jerked off. Only thing 
                        missing was Burl Ives narration.

                                 SAM
                        I never knew you fetishized the 
                        over-40’s. I thought we shared.

                                 PEACOAT
                        The only active body parts were the 
                        windows to my soul.

                                 SAM
                        When did you watch?

                                 PEACOAT
                        About an hour ago. 

                                 SAM
                        So if it were to happen--

                                 PEACOAT
                        It’d happen right away. Least it 
                        did before.

                                 SAM
                        Now we gotta see if the clip-in-
                        question affects someone else. Get 
                        up.

                                 PEACOAT
                        What if you try to kill me?

                                 SAM
                        Why would I do that? You’re my best 
                        friend.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Catman Crothers was one of my best 
                        friends.
                                 SAM
                        Some sad shit... You’re still 
                        coming tonight, yeah?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Assuming I’m not walking around 
                        with my eyes closed.

                                 SAM
                        We gotta play this up.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Fuck you.

                                 SAM
                        Naw, man. It’ll be like “Teen 
                        Wolf.” Which makes me Styles. 
                        Remember the party scene?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Seven minutes in heaven.

                                 SAM
                        There you go.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I’d rather keep it on the DL. Until 
                        I find that I’m suddenly a 
                        basketball star or can car surf--

           Peacoat’s cell phone rings. He answers it.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

                                 DR. KAISER (O.S.)
                             (nervous energy)
                        Pete-- Dr. K. I know it’s last 
                        minute-- but can you come to me?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Your office?

                                 DR. KAISER (O.S.)
                        My apartment. The one downtown.

                                 PEACOAT
                        You have a downtown apartment?

                                 DR. KAISER (O.S.)
                        54 Connecticut Avenue. Number 4.
                                 PEACOAT
                        Why the urgency?

                                 DR. KAISER (O.S.)
                        You said it happened again.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I’m alive. Functioning normally.

                                 DR. KAISER (O.S.)
                        No matter. I think there’s more to 
                        this.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Huh?

                                 DR. KAISER (O.S.)
                        Just hurry.

           He hangs up. Peacoat looks at his friend.

           INT. SAM’S FORD PROBE - LATER

           Sam, behind the wheel, weaves in and out of highway traffic.

                                 SAM
                        I love that your shrink’s gone off 
                        the rails. Because of you.

                                 PEACOAT
                        He must think I’m pretty fucked.

                                 SAM
                        Show him the clip of you watching 
                        the clip?

                                 PEACOAT
                        No.

                                 SAM
                        Wait till he sees that. What the 
                        hell’s on this thing anyway?

           Peacoat thinks a moment. Sam exits the highway.

                                 PEACOAT
                        It’s all kind of hazy. I remember 
                        seeing this Asian chick--

                                 SAM
                        The average one.
                                 PEACOAT
                        She’s getting nailed. She screams.

                                 SAM
                        Pleasure or pain?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Can’t tell. Then this arm reaches 
                        across the screen. A burly arm. 
                        Like a longshoreman’s. It holds a 
                        gun. When it pulls the trigger all 
                        I recall are a bunch of crazy 
                        colors. No details.

           Peacoat thinks another minute.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        And warmth.

                                 SAM
                        Huh?

                                 PEACOAT
                        I felt this intense warmth seeping 
                        through my body. From my brain on 
                        down...
                             (pause)
                        Feels like the M&M’s commercial-- 
                        the cartoon one where the chocolate 
                        guys stand under a shower to get 
                        their colored candy coating.

                                 SAM
                        I don’t like the idea that those 
                        characters aren’t complete until 
                        they conceal their natural brown-
                        ness.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Says the man formerly known as 
                        Wesam.

                                 SAM
                        The name change serves no purpose 
                        other than to help me pull strange.

                                 PEACOAT
                        And it’s worked?

           Sam pulls up to the curb near an apartment building.
                                 SAM
                        Work-in-progress. 54 Connecticut 
                        Ave...

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Peacoat checks the numbers on the doors, stops at #4. He 
           rings the bell. No answer. He knocks.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Dr. K?

           Nothing. He checks the doorknob-- unlocked. He steps into the

           FOYER

           The apartment is dark-- all the curtains are down. A distant 
           TV blares CNN.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Hey... Dr. Kaiser? It’s Peter. 
                        Miller.

           Peacoat creeps through the apartment. He heads through the 
           living room, towards a bedroom in which the television plays.

           Peacoat stops at the door-- it’s open just a crack.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        Dr. K?

           Still nothing.

           BEDROOM

           The blue light of the TV illuminates a sleeping lump in bed.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Hey doc... Rise and shine.

           No movement. As Peacoat creeps towards the bed...

                                 ANCHORMAN (O.S.)
                             (on TV)
                        After the shocking death of Senator 
                        Samarin and his wife, CNN has 
                        received over twenty uncomfirmed 
                        reports of copycat killings, in 
                        cities ranging from Atlanta to St. 
                        Louis to San Francisco.

           Peacoat rounds the foot of the bed.
                                 ANCHORMAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                             (on TV)
                        Victims have been compared to chew 
                        toys, slabs of meat, rag dolls...

           Peacoat stands by the headboard, staring down at the lump. He 
           cautiously removes the blankets-- a WOMAN (28), face ripped 
           off, flesh torn and eaten, lays lifelessly.

           Peacoat holds back the vomit--

                                 DR. KAISER (O.S.)
                        Johnny-come-quickly-- welcome.

           Peacoat looks up-- Dr. Kaiser stands in the doorway holding 
           shopping bags. He looks exhausted yet crazed.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        Had I been home when you arrived I 
                        would’ve kept you out of here. 
                        Sorry about that. But in a way I’m 
                        glad you saw. No bullshit between 
                        us. Just a coupla old friends. 
                        Who’d you kill?

                                 PEACOAT
                        What?

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Peter--

                                 PEACOAT
                        My cat.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Ah, an innocent still.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I loved that cat. Who is she?

                                 DR. KAISER
                        My girlfriend. My mistress.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Thus the secret downtown apartment.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        I dunno about secret. My wife-- 
                        she’s gotta know. I’ve been banging 
                        twenty-somethings since I turned 
                        thirty. I just thank Christ I came 
                        here last night. Can you imagine if 
                        I’d been home?

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT'D)
                        If that were the mother of my 
                        children instead? Or, God forbid-- 
                        my kids?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Bullet dodged. When did you watch?

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Last night. I wanted to get inside 
                        your head, see what was knocking 
                        around. I pride myself on a 
                        personal interest in all of my 
                        patients. Particularly those with 
                        psycho-sexual issues. You could say 
                        I get off on it.

           Dr. Kaiser removes the items from the shopping bags onto the 
           bed-- rope, a saw, garbage bags.

                                 PEACOAT
                        So, in a way I’m responsible.

                                 DR. KAISER
                             (re: TV)
                        You see how this thing is 
                        spreading? Wildfire out there. I 
                        would’ve come across it sooner or 
                        later. You actually did me a favor. 
                        This kind of thing has been nothing 
                        more than academic back room 
                        whispers, rumors... until now.

                                 PEACOAT
                        And what kind of thing is that?

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Psychological terrorism.

           Peacoat can’t react.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        Come on. My office.

           Dr. Kaiser hurries into the next room.

           INT. DR. KAISER’S APARTMENT/OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           He sits at his computer. Peacoat sits on a leather couch.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Can I assume you’re gonna chop up 
                        her body and spread the pieces?
                                 DR. KAISER
                        Something along those lines.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Next time you leave home with a 
                        corpse inside, consider locking up.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Oh dear. My brain... been elsewhere 
                        since... you know. This is 
                        Pandora’s box. Open wide. This is 
                        the stuff careers are made of!

                                 PEACOAT
                        You killed your mistress.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Collateral damage, Peter. I need to 
                        explore this. Someone, somewhere, 
                        has figured it out-- how to attack 
                        an isolated society. Suicide 
                        bombings and the like-- only work 
                        in communities. This-- it’s gonna 
                        rot us from the id on out.

           Kaiser types a web address.

                                 PEACOAT
                        And how are you gonna study 
                        something like this?

                                 DR. KAISER
                        This kind of crisis-- it’s my bread 
                        and butter. Branch Davidians, 
                        polygamists, AIDS patients-- I’m 
                        the guy they called. Having moved 
                        onto a private practice in no way 
                        means I should stop serving the 
                        greater good.
                             (pats a nearby chair)
                        Come on. First step-- 
                        desensitization.

           Dr. Kaiser clicks the mouse-- the familiar screams of the 
           average Asian girl commence.

                                 PEACOAT
                        What are you doing?

                                 DR. KAISER
                        I thought you’d wanna assist. I’ve 
                        watched it twice. You at least as 
                        many times.

                        Logic tells me it’s effects will 
                        wane with each viewing. Like a 
                        drug.

                                 PEACOAT
                        And if it doesn’t?

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Hopefully between us we’ll remember 
                        more.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Doc, shut it off.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Sit next to me, Peter. Watch it 
                        with me.

           The gun shot. Then the electronic music. Peacoat turns his 
           head away from the computer.

                                 PEACOAT
                             (stands up)
                        Doc, please--

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Don’t you want that feeling again? 
                        That--

                                 PEACOAT
                        Warmth.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Exactly.

                                 PEACOAT
                        No. No I don’t.

           Dr. Kaiser starts to sweat and convulse.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Then... Then you should leave 
                        Peter...

           The electronic music picks up. So does Kaiser’s convulsing.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        Now... Leave now Peter...

           Peacoat backs out of the office, his eyes locked on the doc.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        Get out of here please... Leave!
           Kaiser’s eyes close-- sweat and tears pour down his face. The 
           explosion on the clip-- Kaiser’s body crashes onto his desk.

                                 PEACOAT
                             (retreating)
                        Ok Doc... I’m going. I’ll call 911. 
                        They’ll handle this. Sorry I 
                        brought you into it.

           Peacoat turns and starts to shut the door behind him.

                                 DR. KAISER (O.S.)
                             (softly, mechanically)
                        Don’t leave please.

           Peacoat freezes, turns around-- Kaiser stands by his desk, 
           eyes closed. He wears a creepy mouth-closed grin. His right 
           hand claws at his left shoulder.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        You’re my dear friend. Let’s spend 
                        time together.

           Kaiser steps towards Peacoat who retreats into the

           LIVING ROOM

                                 PEACOAT
                        Thanks, doc. But I really should 
                        go. I got a party. A “booze ‘n fuck 
                        fest.” I shouldn’t miss that, 
                        right? You wouldn’t if you were me--

           Peacoat trips over an ottoman-- he lands on his ass, looks up 
           as Kaiser closes in. Peacoat scoots back but corners himself 
           against a wall.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Poor boy. Let me help you to your 
                        feet.

           Kaiser stands over him-- he extends his left hand as his 
           right claws at his own chest.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        Let me help you.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I think I’m good, thanks. Just back 
                        up. A few steps. You and I will be 
                        fine.
                                 DR. KAISER
                             (leans in)
                        I want to help you.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I said I’m good. Thank you. Just 
                        stay where you are.
                             (reaches for cell phone)
                        I’m gonna make one quick call--

           Kaiser lunges for Peacoat’s cell phone. Peacoat flinches away 
           as Kaiser grabs his other hand. He squeezes.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        You’re my dear friend.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Doc, that hurts! Please--

           Kaiser digs his fingernails into Peacoat’s flesh. Peacoat 
           screams, yanks his hand away, clutches the wound. 

           Kaiser goes for his neck.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        Dr. K, no. Leave me alone.

           Peacoat crab-walks to a side table. He grabs items off the 
           table-- an ashtray, a lamp-- and flings them at the doctor. 
           He misses by a mile.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        I want to hold you.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I don’t wanna be held, doc. 
                        Seriously.

           The doctor leans in, grips Peacoat by the neck.

           Kaiser throttles Peacoat, digging his nails deep into his 
           flesh. Peacoat screams, kicks, flails-- he’s powerless.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        Doc, you don’t wanna kill me. 
                        Please. I’m a paying customer--

                                 DR. KAISER
                        You’re my dear friend. I want to 
                        love you.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Stop saying that shit!
                                 DR. KAISER
                             (digging deeper)
                        But I want to love you... I need to 
                        love you... I have to--

           Suddenly Sam clocks Kaiser across the temple with a lamp-- it 
           shatters. Ceramic shards everywhere. 

           Kaiser stumbles back and falls through a glass coffee table. 
           Glass shards everywhere...

           The two boys silently stare at his twitching body.

                                 SAM
                             (catching his breath)
                        You scream like a eunuch.

           Sam straightens himself up-- tucks in his shirt.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        So you coming to this party or 
                        what? I gotta change, shower, pick 
                        up magnums.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Sam and Peacoat head straight for the car. They fling the 
           doors open when suddenly-- a WOMAN’S TORTURED SCREAM pierces 
           the air. It comes from inside the building.

           Sam and Peacoat share a look. As the scream fades into 
           silence, the boys simultaneously jump in Sam’s car.

           INT. SAM’S FORD PROBE - LATER

           Sam speeds along the highway.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I feel like we should’ve checked it 
                        out. The woman. That Dr. K most 
                        likely relieved of a face--

                                 SAM
                        We don’t know shit. Chick could’ve 
                        seen a mouse. I’m done playing John 
                        McClane. Sam needs to get his drink 
                        on, his smoke on. Go home with 
                        somethin’ to poke on.

                                 PEACOAT
                        You’ve earned it.
                                 SAM
                        Fuckin’ a. Know what else I’ve 
                        earned?

                                 PEACOAT
                        I can’t. Not in good conscience. 
                        You saw what he became.

                                 SAM
                        I can’t believe you ever entrusted 
                        that guy with your mental state. No 
                        wonder people thought you were 
                        asexual.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Fuck that.

                                 SAM
                        You went through high school not 
                        talking to a single female.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I was saving myself for Valentine. 
                        You know this.

                                 SAM
                        You’ve inexplicably pined away for--

                                 PEACOAT
                        Eleven years.

                                 SAM
                        Which puts you on track to finger 
                        bang her sometime around your 
                        eightieth birthday.

                                 PEACOAT
                        At which point I’ll be too riddled 
                        with arthritis to even perform. 

                                 SAM
                        You’ve never really even spoken. 
                        Until today.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Which is why it’s time to “carpe 
                        diem.” Isn’t that what the 
                        optimists say?

                                 SAM
                        Don’t waste your time. At the age 
                        of twenty-one it’s about quantity.
                                 PEACOAT
                        But we got shit in common. We 
                        apparently share a shrink! 

                                 SAM
                        Think Mario Batali made fennel-
                        dusted sweatbreads right off the 
                        bat? I’m sure he first slogged 
                        through 400 runny, greasy, 
                        odiferous grilled cheeses.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Yes but...

                                 SAM
                        Huh?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Nothing...

                                 SAM
                        I got no time for coquettishness.

                                 PEACOAT
                        It’s just... She knows I’m a sexual 
                        being. She could be the only one.

           Sam shoots him a look.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        Sixth grade. I had a routine.
                        I’d hang in the library doing 
                        homework and shit. During free 
                        period. But after like a half hour 
                        I’d get super-horny. So I’d go to 
                        the magazine rack, grab a few 
                        issues of Jet--

                                 SAM
                        The number one African-American 
                        newsweekly?

                                 PEACOAT
                        The “beauties of the week” made my 
                        vas deferens feel like an illegal 
                        street race. I’d sift through the 
                        beauties and choose one to 
                        accompany me to the bathroom.

                                 SAM
                        Where she caught you in action.
                                 PEACOAT
                        She surprised me in the library. 
                        During the selection process.

                                 SAM
                        And you couldn’t play it off?

                                 PEACOAT
                        My feet were up on the desk. I was 
                        wearing Umbros. She walked over to 
                        ask me something and it was--

                                 SAM
                        Up periscope?

                                 PEACOAT
                             (nods)
                        Like a Nessie sighting. Plus a 
                        ball.

                                 SAM
                        Right or left?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Right. Which sucks cuz I think my 
                        left is more impressive.

                                 SAM
                        So you’ve been obsessed with her 
                        all this time simply cuz she knows 
                        for a fact that women give you 
                        erections.

                                 PEACOAT
                        And she never told a soul. It’s 
                        been our secret. Our bond.

                                 SAM
                        Right, but doesn’t that kinda 
                        perpetuate the whole nasty “Pete’s 
                        an asexual” business?

                                 PEACOAT
                        The point is she spared me 
                        humiliation. I never woulda done 
                        that for somebody--

                                 SAM
                        She made an effort to not talk to 
                        us before. But whatever man. Carpe-
                        fucking-diem.
           INT. PEACOAT’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Peacoat steps inside-- Catligula waits for him, pissed. 

                                 PEACOAT
                        Sorry. Forgot this morning. Not 
                        that you’d give a shit but I kinda 
                        got a lot going on.

           He hisses. Peacoat nods as he feeds the cat.

           INT. BASEMENT - EVENING

           As Peacoat descends the stairs,

                                 PEACOAT
                        You, on the other hand-- you and me 
                        Commando, same wavelength. People 
                        get preoccupied, they slip up. You 
                        understand, dontcha boy? That’s why 
                        you’re man’s best--

           Peacoat freezes-- sprawled across a treadmill is the Golden 
           Retriever’s carcass, face torn off.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        Oh no...

           The mess is contained to the treadmill. Nothing on the 
           surrounding floor. He looks at his clean hands, puzzled.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        I’ve gotten better. Neater. Fuck.

           A door is heard unlocking upstairs. Peacoat panics--

                                 BERNIE (O.S.)
                             (from upstairs)
                        Hola, acorn-dick!

           Peacoat rips off his coat and lifts the canine carcass. He 
           awkwardly carries it into the

           LAUNDRY ROOM

           He opens the washer door.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Sorry boy. You deserve better.

                                 BERNIE (O.S.)
                        Peacoat-- you here?
                                 MARK (O.S.)
                        Where you at, future bro-in-law?

           He shoves the carcass inside the washer, followed by his 
           stained t-shirt, and shuts the door.

           BASEMENT

           Peacoat powers up the treadmill-- the bloody section of the 
           conveyor belt rolls underneath. He puts his jacket back on.

           FOYER

           Bernie and Mark lug suitcases as Peacoat emerges.

                                 BERNIE
                        What’s shaking, acorn-dick?

                                 PEACOAT
                        I think we can retire that one.

                                 BERNIE
                             (to Mark)
                        I’ve seen a lot of penises in this 
                        life-- his looks just like a tiny 
                        little acorn.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I was five. I’ve grown some since.

                                 BERNIE
                        Used to razz him about getting a 
                        double BJ from Chip and Dale--

                                 MARK
                        Bern, c’mon. I’m sure by now he’s 
                        graduated to an Alvin-sized 
                        orifice.

           Mark playfully punches Peacoat in the shoulder.

                                 PEACOAT
                        So anyway-- Spain? How was it? Get 
                        to the Prado?

           Bernie and Mark share a smirk.

                                 BERNIE
                        We never made it.
                                 MARK
                        I think we both ingested some of 
                        that Spanish fly, if you’re 
                        catchin’ what I’m throwin’. 

                                 PEACOAT
                        Well, glad you two had fun.

           Mark seductively winks at Bernie.

                                 MARK
                        How’s my favorite bitch-magnet? 
                        Behaving?

                                 PEACOAT
                        He was...

                                 MARK
                        What’s up...?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Last night... We were out in the 
                        yard. He saw a deer.

                                 MARK
                        He bolted?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Sorry.

           Mark pauses a moment, thinks. Then,

                                 MARK
                        Ah, fuck it. I name him after an 
                        Arnie flick I can’t freak every 
                        time his predatory instinct kicks 
                        in. Am I right?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Sure.

                                 MARK
                        He’s done this before. Always comes 
                        back in a few hours. Whenever he 
                        gets hungry.

           Peacoat does his best to not let on.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Peacoat stands by a running sink-- he splashes water on his 
           face, plugs in an electric razor, shaves nonexistent stubble.
           He focuses intently on what he is doing. Suddenly...

                                 VALENTINE (O.S.)
                             (seductively)
                        I like your boots.

           Peacoat looks over-- Valentine stands in the doorway. 
           Shocked, he looks down at his feet: he wears crocodile boots.

           After a moment of confusion he looks back up at Val.

                                 PEACOAT
                             (uncontrollably)
                        That poor old yellow-tailed guy 
                        developed a fatal case of 
                        indigestion. Died right in my arms.

           Val smirks, walks over to him, her arms over his shoulders.

                                 VALENTINE
                        I can’t blame him. If I were to 
                        die, there’s nowhere else I’d 
                        rather be...

           The two stare at each other, nose-to-nose-- sweat pours from 
           Peacoat’s brow. He lowers his razor, starts to convulse...

           Val leans in for a kiss, when--

           ZAP!!! An electric spark-- Peacoat snaps out of it: Val is 
           gone, so are the croc boots. He has placed his (now fried) 
           razor in a puddle of water on the sink.

           He stares at his slick, sweaty face in the mirror.

           He grabs his cell and texts Sam: “party = bad idea. maybe 
           general practitioner time.”

           Sam fires back: “Valentine + ‘carpe diem’ = Pete Miller, 
           bottom bitch.”

           EXT. NELLY SKYLAR’S MANSION - NIGHT

           Peacoat and Sam walk from the car to the front door.

                                 SAM
                        So how’s she look?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Who?

                                 SAM
                        Bernie.
                                 PEACOAT
                        She looks like my engaged sister.

                                 SAM
                        Yeah but anything new? Tats? 
                        Piercings? A tan?

                                 PEACOAT
                        See for yourself. Come over.

                                 SAM
                        I can’t. Not ready yet.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Cause she saw you going to town.

                                 SAM
                        If only. She walked in as I came.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Seriously man-- who jerks off in 
                        someone else’s bathroom and doesn’t 
                        lock the door?

                                 SAM
                        I went in there to shit. The 
                        masturbation was an impromptu 
                        thing.

                                 PEACOAT
                        And that answers the door locking 
                        question how?

                                 SAM
                        Bottom line-- your sister, a woman 
                        I held in very high regard, 
                        happened to catch me ejaculating on 
                        a mound of my own feces. The irony 
                        being I would’ve normally flushed 
                        between the two events. Except, in 
                        an effort to appeal to that hippy 
                        phase she was in I’d been trying to 
                        reduce my carbon footprint. No 
                        extraneous flushes. I mean, where’s 
                        the fucking lesson--?

                                 PEACOAT
                        I killed her fiancee’s dog.

                                 SAM
                        What?! Why?
                                 PEACOAT
                        Last night. That clip I sent you, 
                        when I get up and walk out? Must’ve 
                        done it then. He was a great dog...

                                 SAM
                        I’m considering suspending our 
                        friendship. Until you get all this 
                        murder outta your system.

           They reach the front door.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        But for tonight we’re just a coupla 
                        party guys. Drinking, talkin’ up 
                        the skirts, normal shit. Cool?

           Peacoat nods.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Let’s do this-- buffalo stance.

           Sam flips up his collar and smooths his eyebrows.

           PARTY HOUSE

           The party is extravagant-- the house has an ‘80’s white and 
           pastel color scheme and sparse, modern furniture throughout.

           The boys scan the packed room.

                                 SAM
                        So to confirm-- I get to be 
                        “Styles.”

                                 PEACOAT
                        What does that even mean?

           Sam thinks a second, has no answer.

                                 SAM
                        Come on.

           He heads towards the bar with Peacoat hot on his heels. Sam 
           eyes a passing BLONDE CHICK.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                             (smiles at her)
                        Hey babygirl. I’m at Cal Tech. 
                        Engineering. Know what that means?

           The Blonde Chick shakes her head.
                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Means I’m gonna be loaded. Beyond 
                        your wildest dreams.

                                 BLONDE CHICK
                        So?

                                 SAM
                        So invest in your future-- let me 
                        ravage you tonight.

           Blonde Chick leans in close, seductively.

                                 BLONDE CHICK
                        I’ve got a better idea.

                                 SAM
                             (smirks)
                        And what’s that?

                                 BLONDE CHICK
                        Try me when you’re rich. Or when 
                        the Acutane kicks in. Whatever 
                        happens last.

           She walks off. Unfazed, Sam and Peacoat continue to the bar.

                                 PEACOAT
                        You should try a softer approach, I 
                        think. Less offensive.

                                 SAM
                        How? I’m always a perfect gent.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Well, for one you tend to discuss 
                        female anatomy with strangers. 
                        Maybe curb that a bit.

           They reach the bar. Sam fixes two Jack and Cokes.

                                 SAM
                        That’s because it’s beauty. God’s 
                        art. And it’s rarely with 
                        strangers. Acquaintances maybe.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Yeah but you use scientific terms. 
                        Labia, cervix, vulva-- makes people 
                        uncomfortable.
                                 SAM
                        And that’s my fault? All my terms 
                        have Latin roots. Same as the pro’s 
                        use.
                             (hands Peacoat a drink)
                        Bottoms up.

           The two clink their cups and guzzle their Jack and Cokes.

           INT. PARTY HOUSE - LATER

           Peacoat and Sam sit on either end of a white couch. They each 
           clutch a drink and sway slightly, having had a few too many.

           In between them a GIRL snorts a line of cocaine off a glass 
           table. She rises, wipes her nose-- it’s hostess NELLY SKYLAR.

                                 NELLY
                        When I get married, my body will 
                        totally belong to my husband. 
                        Except for one spot. It’s the size 
                        of a nickel and I poop out of it 
                        every morning.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I feel like I missed something.

                                 SAM
                        I said if society embraced 
                        cannibalism we should eat the band 
                        Nickelback, shit them into a 
                        spaceship and launch it into the 
                        sun. Maybe she misheard--

                                 NELLY
                        Guys I’m so glad you made it. I get 
                        nervous every year that no one’s 
                        gonna come. So every year I gotta 
                        invite more and more people. It’s 
                        just crazy, all the people that 
                        actually respond and come out. 
                        Makes me feel so loved!

                                 PEACOAT
                        I wasn’t invited.

                                 NELLY
                        It probably went to your spam 
                        folder.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I’ve never been invited. Makes me 
                        feel so hated.
                                 NELLY
                        Oh, Peacoat...

           She drunkenly rests her hand on his knee.

                                 NELLY (CONT’D)
                        You’re not hated. Most people 
                        couldn’t care one way or the other 
                        about you.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Wow. So in high school I was an 
                        asexual who inspired only 
                        indifference.

                                 NELLY
                             (cracks up)
                        Who knew you were so funny?

           She keeps laughing, finally resting her head on his shoulder.

           Nelly starts to play with one of the buttons on his peacoat.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Careful with that. This thing is 
                        old.

                                 NELLY
                        How old?

                                 PEACOAT
                        The ‘40’s.

                                 NELLY
                        Do you ever take it off?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Never.

                                 NELLY
                        Never ever?

           Suddenly,

                                 VALENTINE (O.S.)
                        You hard?

           Peacoat looks over his shoulder-- Valentine stands behind 
           him, smirking at fucked-up Nelly clinging to his sleeve.

                                 VALENTINE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t black out now.
                                 PEACOAT
                        My funny Valentine.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Never heard that before.

                                 PEACOAT
                        How goes it?

           She sits on the arm of a nearby chair.

                                 VALENTINE
                        I should be asking you that. Happen 
                        again?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Yeah.

                                 NELLY
                        Did what happen again?

           No one says a word.

                                 NELLY (CONT’D)
                        It’s my party. Which means I get to 
                        be involved in all conversations--

                                 VALENTINE
                             (to Peacoat)
                        How’d it go with Dr. K?

                                 PEACOAT
                        I don’t know how much help he’ll 
                        be, but it was fine.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Did you ever talk to him about what 
                        happened with us?

                                 PEACOAT
                        That was before I started going to 
                        him. You?

                                 VALENTINE
                        Of course. It was one of my first 
                        experiences of a certain type. 
                        Could’ve fucked me up sexually.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Did it?
                                 VALENTINE
                             (shrugs)
                        Kaiser thinks it might’ve.

           A PALE KID in skinny jeans and a trendy ‘do interrupts. He 
           carries a clipboard and looks as if he hasn’t slept in days.

                                 PALE KID
                        What’s going on, trancies?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Trannies?

                                 PALE KID
                        No. Sorry. Just an expression. So, 
                        you guys like to party, yeah?

           Peacoat shrugs. Val says nothing.

                                 PALE KID (CONT’D)
                        Well spread them earholes, I got 
                        news-- I provide a service, free-of-
                        charge. An e mail sign-up for 
                        future parties. Underground shit.

                                 VALENTINE
                        So raves, basically.

                                 PALE KID
                        Not exactly. But they’re fucking 
                        fun. I promise. It’s like we’re all 
                        in prison. And these fiestas are 
                        like the conjugal visits.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I think I’m sold.

           Peacoat grabs the clipboard, signs up and offers it to Val.

                                 VALENTINE
                        You really gonna start attending 
                        raves?

                                 PALE KID
                        Raves is a misnomer. But the next 
                        one’s tomorrow night. Ten-ish. 
                        Details to follow. Come check it 
                        for yourselves before you wreck it 
                        for yourselves.

           Valentine shrugs-- “why not?” As she signs up...
                                 NELLY
                        Guys I’m bored. Hello, this is my 
                        party. I wanna dance.

                                 PEACOAT
                        By all means--

                                 NELLY
                        A hostess should never dance alone. 
                        That’s what my mother always says.

                                 PEACOAT
                        That’s some Huxtable-caliber shit--

                                 NELLY
                        So let’s cut a rug. I mean, 
                        technically you weren’t invited so 
                        you shouldn’t even be here.

                                 PEACOAT
                        What happened to the “spam folder” 
                        theory?

                                 NELLY
                        You’ve still never kissed a girl 
                        right?

           Peacoat shoots a glance to smirking Valentine.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I’m not getting into this.

           Nelly leans in. Valentine watches, amused.

                                 NELLY
                        How about I kiss you. Long and hard 
                        and with my tongue if you come out 
                        on the dance floor with me?

           Peacoat is shocked into silence. He turns to Sam, who is 
           passed out. Nelly gets even closer.

                                 NELLY (CONT’D)
                        See, coke always makes me horny. 
                        And you need some action. Plus 
                        you’re actually not as hideous as 
                        you were in high school. That’s 
                        like, what-- three birds, one 
                        stone?

           Peacoat is paralyzed. Nelly smirks mischievously. 
                                 NELLY (CONT’D)
                        Good boy... Here comes trouble...

           Nelly leans in as if for a kiss-- she grazes his lips with 
           hers and goes for his ear.

                                 NELLY (CONT’D)
                        ...After you show me some moves.

           INT. PARTY HOUSE/DANCE FLOOR - LATER

           Coked-up Nelly grinds Peacoat, who does his best to channel 
           Michael Douglas’ moves in “Romancing The Stone.” He’s not 
           even close.

           Peacoat spots Valentine through a sliding glass door-- she 
           talks to a couple of DOUCHEBAG GUYS by an outside bar.

           He slows his “dancing” to a halt.

                                 PEACOAT
                        You good for a few?

                                 NELLY
                        I didn’t release you.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Right. But I’m empty. My cup.

                                 NELLY
                        Double time, Miller. I’m very 
                        fickle. You could lose out on this 
                        nubile bod.

                                 PEACOAT
                        You needing?

                                 NELLY
                        Chardonnay.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Really?

                                 NELLY
                        You never had Chardonnay and 
                        nostril dust?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Can’t say I have.

                                 NELLY
                        The balanced diet of any self-
                        respecting yuppie.
                                 PEACOAT
                        The secret of your success.

           She winks and goes back to dancing as Peacoat heads outside.

           EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           He sidles up to the bar, positions himself next to Valentine.

                                 VALENTINE
                        How’s it looking?

                                 PEACOAT
                        On a Chardonnay run.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Smooth. You’re on the fast track 
                        for an evening of WE TV.

                                 PEACOAT
                        My ovaries churn at thoughts of 
                        Cinematherapy. And you? How’s the 
                        juggling of douchebags going?

                                 VALENTINE
                        Easier than juggling bowling pins. 
                        More for amusement than anything 
                        else. I’m not so into rape.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Suppose you saw a hunk in cut-offs 
                        and a mesh tee? In an alley. Alone.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Well that beefcake’s begging for 
                        it. In which case I don’t consider 
                        it rape.

                                 PEACOAT
                        He shouldn’t be going anywhere 
                        lookin’ that fine.

           They share a laugh. 

           Something catches Valentine’s eye. She touches a small tear 
           in the shoulder of his peacoat.

                                 VALENTINE
                        You ever gonna retire this thing?
                                 PEACOAT
                        Probably not. The coat’s a 
                        survivor. It’s pushing seventy 
                        years.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Yeah?

                                 PEACOAT
                        My grandfather wore it in the coast 
                        guard during WWII.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Didn’t realize the coast guard had 
                        much of a role in the second world 
                        war.

                                 PEACOAT
                        It didn’t.

                                 VALENTINE
                        So why were you trying to force a 
                        connection?

                                 PEACOAT
                        I guess as some sort of temporal 
                        reference. I dunno.

                                 VALENTINE
                        So your grandfather gave it to you.

                                 PEACOAT
                             (nods)
                        Someone had to patrol the coast.

                                 VALENTINE
                        How old were you?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Ten.

                                 VALENTINE
                        And you’ve worn it every day since.

                                 PEACOAT
                        It’s comfy. Warm. Simple. Matches 
                        everything.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Yeah but-- wearing the same thing 
                        every day for eleven years-- that’s 
                        like beyond compulsion.
                                 PEACOAT
                        Everybody needs a crutch.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Has Kaiser buzzed in on this one?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Of course.

                                 VALENTINE
                        And?

                                 PEACOAT
                        He claims I find comfort in the way 
                        my grandfather never tried to be 
                        the hero. The coat belonged to 
                        someone completely average. Who did 
                        nothing great.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Not only superheroes get to wear 
                        uniforms...

                                 PEACOAT
                        Something like that.

                                 VALENTINE
                        You really are one for the books.

                                 PEACOAT
                        And you see a shrink cuz you’re of 
                        sound mind?

                                 VALENTINE
                        I saw a shrink because of you.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Bullshit.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Yours was the first turgid peen I 
                        ever saw. And it was forced into my 
                        line of vision. It’s not like I 
                        wanted to see it.

                                 PEACOAT
                        So I essentially raped your eyes. 
                        How horrific...

                                 VALENTINE
                        It’s just traumatic for a girl. I 
                        had no older siblings. Had never 
                        watched a porn.

                                 VALENTINE (CONT'D)
                        I started seeing your pulsing, pink 
                        baby snake everywhere-- lamp posts, 
                        the bathtub spigot... my grandma’s 
                        Virginia Slims--

                                 PEACOAT
                        I violated an innocent...

                                 VALENTINE
                        It’s good we’re talking about it.

                                 PEACOAT
                        But you actually invaded my 
                        privacy. Maybe I was victimized 
                        too. Ever consider that?

                                 VALENTINE
                        Hold up--

                                 PEACOAT
                        You’re kind of as much a Peeping 
                        Tammy as I am an ocular rapist--

                                 VALENTINE
                        Forget it then. Subject dropped.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Maybe we’re both injecting some of 
                        our own narcissism into it.

                                 VALENTINE
                             (incredulous)
                        Whoa... Really?

                                 PEACOAT
                        No use in having a pissing contest 
                        over who it was worse for.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Well perhaps one day you’ll come 
                        down with a case of objectivity. 
                        Until then...

           She steps back, pissed.

                                 VALENTINE (CONT’D)
                        Your girlfriend’s coming.

           Valentine walks back inside as Nelly approaches.

                                 NELLY
                        I’m coming down, Pea. I need more 
                        snowflakes.
                                 PEACOAT
                        Not without a dry white wine you 
                        don’t.

           He hands her a glass. She sips.

                                 NELLY
                        You coming? My mom always says--

                                 PEACOAT
                        The hostess should never ingest 
                        narcotics alone?

                                 NELLY
                        Close enough... I feel a real 
                        connection with you tonight. You’ve 
                        changed so much in three years.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I’m not as hideous.

                                 NELLY
                        That and you’re more... spiritual. 
                        I’m feeling you more...
                             (points to his forehead)
                        Up here... Come on.

           Nelly grabs his hand and leads him off.

           INT. PARTY HOUSE/NELLY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The room is an orgy of pink and stuffed animals.

                                 NELLY
                        Home to my private stash.

           She pulls a bag of coke from a night table and cuts lines.

                                 NELLY (CONT’D)
                        Want in? It’ll make you totally 
                        horny. I completely wore off while 
                        I was freaking you.

           She snorts some lines as Peacoat awkwardly wanders the room.

                                 NELLY (CONT’D)
                        Whew. There’s the magic. My legs 
                        are all rubbery.

           Nelly eyes Peacoat. She smirks and gently pats the bed.

                                 NELLY (CONT’D)
                        Sit here. Next to me.
                                 PEACOAT
                        Yeah?

                                 NELLY
                        I told you I get uber-horny.

           Peacoat nervously sits next to her.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Before anything happens, I just 
                        want you to think about tomorrow. I 
                        don’t wanna be the cause of intense 
                        regret on your part.

                                 NELLY
                        Shhhh...

           Nelly guides him down so that he’s on his back.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I just have a feeling you’ll spend 
                        the bulk of tomorrow seated in the 
                        shower, clutching your knees, 
                        sobbing--

                                 NELLY
                             (unbuckles his belt)
                        We’re young, it’s a party. Let’s 
                        make mistakes.

                                 PEACOAT
                        But you don’t find me attractive.

           As she slides his pants down...

                                 NELLY
                        And that matters why? I’ve blown 
                        many guys I don’t find attractive.

           Peacoat briefly wears confusion, then shrugs it off.

                                 NELLY (CONT’D)
                        Plus it’s the giving season. I’ll 
                        be like your sexual Santa. Want me 
                        to slide down your chimney?

           She doesn’t wait for a response-- she goes for it. Peacoat 
           closes his eyes and enjoys.

           After a moment, Peacoat starts to sweat. He wipes the 
           perspiration from his brow and concentrates.
           The sweat builds. It rolls down his face like rain on a 
           windshield. It stings his eyes. As he again wipes--

                                 PEACOAT
                        Hey, uh Nelly?

                                 NELLY
                             (mouth full)
                        Shhh... Just relax...

                                 PEACOAT
                        No, it’s just--

                                 NELLY
                        Quiet...

                                 PEACOAT
                        But something’s happening to--

                                 NELLY
                             (looks up, annoyed)
                        --Your body? See when a man gets 
                        excited, his heart pumps blood 
                        straight into his penis, at which 
                        point it grows in size--

                                 PEACOAT
                        Nelly... Please...

           A “soul glo”-style puddle forms on the pillow. Peacoat starts 
           to convulse. Nelly finally notices...

                                 NELLY
                        Dude, you alright?

                                 PEACOAT
                             (struggles with each word)
                        No... You gotta get outta here--

                                 NELLY
                        You about to pop?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Please... Just leave!

           Peacoat’s eyes slam shut. Tears pour down his cheeks.

                                 NELLY
                        Are you ODing? Shit-- I can’t have 
                        any ODers. I’m calling 911--

           Peacoat’s body goes limp. Silence... Nelly breathes heavily.
                                 NELLY (CONT’D)
                        Yo Pea-- you dead?
                             (shakes him)
                        Please don’t be dead. You’re still 
                        hard. Dead guys can’t be hard, 
                        right?

           She leans into his face, listens to his soft breathing.

                                 NELLY (CONT’D)
                        Cool... you just keep breathing.
                        I’m calling for help. Just stay 
                        alive...

           She grabs her cell and starts to dial when--

                                 PEACOAT (O.S.)
                        Let’s make love.

           Peacoat, on his side, seductively rests his head in his hand. 
           His eyes are closed and he wears a creepy, wide grin as he 
           paws at his chest.

           Relief washes over Nelly. She hangs up.

                                 NELLY
                        Jesus, man. You scared the fuck 
                        outta me. Totally killed my high.

           She grabs another bag of coke and cuts a line.

                                 NELLY (CONT’D)
                        And you don’t want to make love. 
                        You just wanna nut.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I love you. I do.

                                 NELLY
                        Well I’m flattered Peacoat. Really. 
                        But don’t mistake booze-fueled 
                        desperation for love.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I want to hold you.

                                 NELLY
                        Ok... But it’ll take more than that 
                        to get me back into it. You put 
                        quite a scare into me.

           Peacoat hugs her from behind with one arm, the other still 
           digs into his chest. Nelly chuckles, obliviously snorts.
                                 NELLY (CONT’D)
                        You virgins kill me with your 
                        clinginess.

           He rests his head on her shoulder as blood pools from his re-
           opened chest wound onto his shirt.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I feel close to you. I feel a 
                        spiritual connection.

           He tightens his grip around her.

                                 NELLY
                        Easy there, Pea. You’ll get yours 
                        eventually. I’m oddly charmed by 
                        you. I wouldn’t call it love, but I 
                        dunno. We could pretend we love 
                        each other--

           He digs his fingers into the nape of her neck.

                                 NELLY (CONT’D)
                        Oww. What the fuck?
                             (struggles)
                        You’re hurting me. Let me go--

           Nelly starts to bleed.

                                 NELLY (CONT’D)
                        Stop it, Peter--

                                 PEACOAT
                             (whisper)
                        I want to love you.

           Tears well up in Nelly’s eyes.

                                 NELLY
                        What are you doing? Stop...

                                 PEACOAT
                             (whisper)
                        I want to love you.

           He claws at her flesh. She squirms but can’t break free. 
           Blood spills onto the bed sheets.

                                 NELLY
                        Please Peter. Please--

           He traces a hand up to her cheek...
                                 PEACOAT
                             (whisper)
                        Give yourself to me--

           He digs in-- blood geysers from her face.

                                 NELLY
                        Help! Anyone... Please...

                                 PEACOAT
                             (whisper)
                        Love... me... too--!

           He swiftly tears away her cheek. As Nelly screams,

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           OVER BLACK “Do They Know It’s Christmas” by Band Aid starts.

           INT. PARTY HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING

           Nelly’s party mix plays as Peacoat sleeps.

           He slowly wakes and looks around-- the other half of the bed 
           is a bloodbath. Nelly’s lifeless body lays in a lump.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Oh no...

           He holds back the vomit, reaches for the lump, rolls it over-- 
           Nelly’s face has been completely torn off.

           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

           Peacoat stares into the mirror. He nervously lifts his shirt-- 
           chunks of flesh and muscle loosely hang around the growing 
           holes in his chest. The wounds still lightly ooze blood.

           He gently touches a gash and winces.

           He grabs a hand towel and some medical tape from a drawer and 
           bandages his chest.

           INT. PARTY HOUSE/DANCE FLOOR - MORNING

           Band Aid continues as Peacoat creeps out of the bedroom. The 
           house is empty-- everyone’s gone and the place is a mess.

           EXT. PARTY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Peacoat steps out into the chilly morning. He heads for his 
           car-- the only one parked out front.
           EXT. PEACOAT’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Peacoat’s Chevy pulls into the driveway. As he gets out...

                                 MARK (O.S.)
                        Yo-- bro-in-law!

           Mark emerges from the nearby woods with a bag of dog food.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Where’d you say he went? I feel 
                        like I covered these woods twice 
                        over.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I don’t know. He just took off.

                                 MARK
                        I’m getting worried, Pete. I put up 
                        signs, checked everywhere--

           Peacoat sheepishly shrugs. Mark suddenly spots something on 
           the ground. He picks up an acorn, displays it.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Shit, man... I think this rolled 
                        out your trousers!

           Peacoat nods and heads in.

           Mark laughs, chucks the acorn at him, returns to the woods.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Commando!

           PEACOAT’S HOUSE/FOYER

           Peacoat makes a beeline for the basement door.

           INT. PEACOAT’S HOUSE/LAUNDRY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           He opens the washer-- the stench hits him. He holds his 
           breath as he places the dog carcass into a garbage bag.

           He carries the bag out into the

           BASEMENT

           Peacoat removes a shovel from a storage closet.

           He goes to a sliding glass door which looks out to the woods.

           He grabs the garbage bag and unlocks the door, when...
           Mark walks the edge of the woods. He whistles, calls out the 
           dog’s name, sprinkles kibble on the ground.

           Peacoat cannot make it outside without being spotted.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Fuck.

           His cell rings-- it’s Sam. Mark hears the phone from outside-- 
           he curiously looks over.

           Peacoat waves to him and answers the phone.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        Really bad time. What’s the deal?

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        You tell me, Leisure Suit Larry.

           Peacoat drags the garbage bag back to the storage closet. He 
           returns the shovel and begins rummaging.

                                 PEACOAT
                        The fuck’s that mean?

                        I dunno... All night, behind locked 
                        doors with Nelly Skylar. And which 
                        of her body parts was the recipient 
                        of your charitable bonation? Tits, 
                        face, toes--?

                                 PEACOAT
                        I killed her.

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        Like in the hip hop sense... You 
                        “killed it”, “beat that pussy up”, 
                        that kinda thing?

                        I killed Nelly Skylar. Like she’s 
                        dead. One minute my cock’s 
                        barrelling towards her uvula, next 
                        I know she’s torn to shreds.

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        Don’t tell me this shit, man.

                        What the fuck am I supposed to do? 
                        Don’t watch the video anymore. 
                        There, done.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I didn’t watch it! I didn’t watch 
                        anything! My eyes were closed! Oh 
                        and I’ve practically literally torn 
                        my heart out of my chest--

                                 SAM
                        How’s that?

                        We should talk to Holland.

                                 PEACOAT
                        No can do. Not him.

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        You don’t think he’d be an

                        You must’ve done something.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Not a thing. He just refused.

           Peacoat hangs up. He pulls a large blue vinyl suitcase from 
           the closet, stuffs the garbage bag inside, zips it closed and 
           turns-- Catligula sits nearby, watching and judging.

           Sam sits at the computer as Peacoat smokes weed on his bed.

                                 PEACOAT
                        So I’m a trancer. That’s what 
                        they’re calling people like me.

           Sam logs onto ichat.

                                 SAM
                        Silence. I’m about to engage 
                        Holland in a chat. If he hears or 
                        sees you he’ll log off.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Where am I supposed to go?

                                 SAM
                        I dunno... sit on the floor. 
                        Somewhere the camera won’t see you.

           Peacoat sits on the floor as Sam launches a video chat with 
           HOLLAND OATES-- overweight with long hair and a bushy beard.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Holland Oates!

                                 HOLLAND
                        Wesam Fahmy. What’s the word?
                                 SAM
                        The word is just Sam now.

                                 HOLLAND
                        A name change ain’t gonna keep you 
                        off any FBI watch list.

                                 SAM
                        But it may get me cock-deep in lady 
                        jam.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Assimilate then penetrate. I like 
                        the way you think. Insider’s tip 
                        though: name your partner-in-creme.

                                 SAM
                        Yeah?

                                 HOLLAND
                        With a name comes respect. Until 
                        you respect your man-meat, no 
                        chick’s gonna.

                                 SAM
                        And your penile nom de plume?

                                 HOLLAND
                        Purple Justice.

                                 SAM
                        Huh. So how’s the biz?

                                 HOLLAND
                        Popular as ever. Who knew college 
                        kids were just as hard-up as the 
                        new-to-pubes demo?

                                 SAM
                        So you’re pretty up-to-speed on the 
                        goings-on in the industry?

                                 HOLLAND
                        Shit, man. I know who you’ll be 
                        jerking off to two years from now.

                                 SAM
                             (conspiratorial)
                        You heard of this clip that knocks 
                        people out? Sends ‘em into seizure-
                        like episodes, turns ‘em into 
                        murderous drones?
           Holland takes a long moment, stares Sam down.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Average Asian girl, yeah?

                                 SAM
                        Firsthand experience or hearsay?

                                 HOLLAND
                        Not online, man. Some things-- best 
                        discussed in person. Can you get to 
                        the Apex?

           Sam nods.

                                 HOLLAND (CONT’D)
                        My office is in the back. You’re 
                        not still hangin’ with the sexless 
                        blunder?

                                 SAM
                        Miller? He’s one of them.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Don’t bring him. A genderless 
                        presence-- bad for biz.

           Holland logs off.

           I/E. SAM’S FORD PROBE - DAY

           Sam drives, Peacoat fiddles with the radio-- Christmas music.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I don’t get the guy’s beef--

                                 SAM
                        I think you’re looking too deeply 
                        at it. He simply doesn’t like you.

           The car pulls in front of a run-down porn theater, sandwiched 
           between a gun shop and a Pinkberry. As Sam slides out,

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Seriously, man. Just stay out here. 
                        Don’t wanna piss him off.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Call if there’s tracer trouble.

           APEX THEATER/LOBBY

           Sam approaches a grizzled OCTOGENARIAN working concession.
                                 SAM
                        Holland Oates?

                                 OCTOGENARIAN
                        Through the theater, behind the 
                        green door.

           Sam gives him a thumbs up.

           APEX THEATER

           Sam walks the aisle, suspiciously eyeing the FEW SLEAZY 
           PATRONS enjoying an ear-splittingly loud skin flick.

           He heads straight for a green door, just next to the screen.

           APEX THEATER/BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR

           Dark and quiet-- muffled moaning comes from the theater. Old, 
           dusty film reels clutter the area.

                                 SAM
                        Holland? Yo man you here?

           No response. Sam creeps up to a closed office door.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        You in there? Can I come in?

           A pause. Then,

                                 HOLLAND (O.S.)
                             (slow, mechanical)
                        Who is it?

                                 SAM
                        Who do you think? It’s Sam.

                                 HOLLAND (O.S.)
                        Come in please.

           Sam looks a bit confused as he opens the door.

           INT. HOLLAND’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           It’s dark-- the curtains are closed, no light breaks through. 
           The only illumination comes from a TV playing vintage porn.

           Sam squints through the darkness.

                                 SAM
                        Dude-- mind if I turn on a light? I 
                        can’t see a fucking thing.
                                 (MORE)
                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                             (waits for response)
                        Hello? You here?

           Sam hits a lamp, scans the room-- no Holland.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        What the hell, man? If you’re in 
                        the trance, I swear to God...

           Sam goes to Holland’s computer, pulls it out of sleep mode-- 
           the “average Asian girl” site is up. 

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Shit...

           A sudden “ding”-- new e mail. Sam opens it: “Trance The Night 
           Away-- Tonight! 7503 Labyrinth Rd. 10ish. Guests encouraged.”

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        The fuck...?

           Sam senses something, spins around-- he’s face to face with 
           Holland, eyes closed, grinning, and pawing at his chest.

                                 HOLLAND
                        I am orgasm.

                                 SAM
                        Huh--?

           Holland lunges-- he grips Sam’s neck and begins to squeeze.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Dude... please... It’s Sam--

           Holland hurls Sam across the room-- he crashes to the floor. 
           Holland moves in, claws at Sam’s neck and face. Blood spills.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Please stop--

           Holland lifts Sam by the collar and throws him onto a couch.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Are you gonna rape me? Cuz if you 
                        are I’d rather you just tear my 
                        face off right now--

           Holland crawls towards him, digging deeper into his chest.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Seriously man--
                                 HOLLAND
                        I am orgasm.

                                 SAM
                        Fine but no rape--

           EXT. APEX THEATER - CONTINUOUS

           Peacoat waits in the car, bored to tears. He quietly listens 
           to Christmas music on the radio.

           He opens his cell and scrolls to Valentine’s number. His 
           finger hovers over the “send” button. Yet he can’t press it. 
           After a moment he closes the phone.

           He fiddles with the radio, flips on a news station.

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)
                        In local news, District police 
                        dealt with an horrific discovery at 
                        a Dupont Circle apartment complex-- 
                        54 Connecticut Avenue--

           Kaiser’s building! Peacoat raises the volume.

                                 REPORTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        --resembled something out of a 
                        horror movie, as twenty-three 
                        bodies, all showing signs of 
                        vicious Trancer attack, were 
                        discovered in every unit. Thus far, 
                        there have been no reports of 
                        survivors--

           Suddenly, two camouflage jeeps speed down the street and 
           SCREECH to a halt in front of the theater. 

                                 PEACOAT
                        What the fuck...?

           EIGHT ARMY GUYS file out and noisily march inside.

           INT. HOLLAND’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Holland grips Sam’s neck with one hand as the other intensely 
           claws at his own chest.

           The army guys storm the room.

                                 ARMY GUY #1
                        Move in! Trancer’s at stage five! 
                        Repeat, stage five! Bring him in 
                        with a pulse, boys--
           Holland tears into his own chest cavity. Blood geysers.

           One army guy removes a tazer, brings it to the back of 
           Holland’s head.

           The guy squeezes the trigger-- ZAP! Holland’s body tightens 
           then goes limp. He collapses on top of Sam.

                                 ARMY GUY #1 (CONT’D)
                        All clear. Let’s shit-bag this 
                        orca!

           Sam peers out from underneath Holland’s large, limp body.

           Two army guys lift Holland, zip him into a mesh body bag and 
           carry him out.

                                 SAM
                        Thanks.

           Sam goes to a mirror and cleans blood off his face.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        So clearly you guys are monitoring 
                        the site. You must be government 
                        muscle, am I right?
                             (pause, no answer)
                        But when did they declare martial 
                        law? I never heard a thing--

           Sam looks up-- Peacoat stands behind him.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Day late, dollar short.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Looks like you didn’t need my ass.

                                 SAM
                        He practically killed himself.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Is it me or are these dudes 
                        ignoring us?

                                 SAM
                        No I noticed that.

           The army guys case the room, not acknowledging the boys.

                                 PEACOAT
                        This is kinda awkward, right?
                                 SAM
                        A little.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Like we should at least exchange 
                        pleasantries.

                                 SAM
                        I tried. Nothing.

           A silent moment as Sam finishes cleaning blood off his face.

                                 PEACOAT
                        So...

                                 SAM
                        Splitsville?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Sure.

           The two ever-so-awkwardly walk out, weaving around army guys.

           EXT. PEACOAT’S HOUSE/WOODS - NIGHT

           Mark stands near the edge of the woods. He whistles loudly.

                                 MARK
                        Commando! Here boy!
                             (shakes kibble)
                        ‘Mando? C’mere!

           A sudden meow draws his attention. Another meow. And another.

           He follows the mewing into the backyard-- behind the sliding 
           glass door leading to the basement is Catligula. The cat 
           stares Mark down.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        What do you want, Puss? If it’s 
                        grub look to your boy Pete.

           More mewing. The cat paws at the door.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        This better be important is all I’m 
                        saying. Cuz you’re not getting a 
                        morsel outta me.

           Mark opens the door and steps into the
           BASEMENT

           He squats to eye level with Catligula.

                                 MARK
                        So what’s your damage, feline?

           Catligula meows then takes off.

           Annoyed, Mark follows the cat towards the storage closet.

           INT.  PEACOAT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Peacoat sits at his computer studying a news site. Sam 
           lounges on the bed.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Says here they’ve been collecting 
                        trancers about a day, anyone who’s 
                        visited the site.

                                 SAM
                        Does it say what they’re doing with 
                        said trancers?

                                 PEACOAT
                        “Studying all specimens in an 
                        effort to end this epidemic.”

                                 SAM
                        Ominously vague... So basically 
                        we’ll never see Holland again.

                                 PEACOAT
                        They can’t just make people... 
                        citizens disappear.

                                 SAM
                        I never got to tell him.

                                 PEACOAT
                        What’s that?

                                 SAM
                        I named my partner-in-creme.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Yeah?

                                 SAM
                        I thought long and hard, so to 
                        speak. Really weighed the options.
                                 PEACOAT
                        And?

                                 SAM
                        Lance.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Hmmm.

                                 SAM
                        Both name and phallic noun.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Got it.

                                 SAM
                        What if they come for you?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Haven’t been to the site in the 
                        last twenty-four.

           Sam thinks a minute.

                                 SAM
                        When I was at Holland’s, before he 
                        jumped me, I saw an invite in his e 
                        mail. Said “Trance the Night Away.”

                                 PEACOAT
                        Seriously?

                                 SAM
                        If I made that shit up I woulda 
                        said “Trance Party U.S.A.” Or “The 
                        Politics of Trancing.” Something 
                        more clever.

           Peacoat is hit with a thought. He checks his e mail.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I’m invited too...

                                 SAM
                        Wow. Hear that?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Huh?

                                 SAM
                        The pop of your party-invitation 
                        hymen. So we checkin’ it out?
                                 PEACOAT
                        Negative. Last party I attended--

                                 SAM
                        You murdered another human being?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Yeah... I was thinking more of the 
                        Valentine situation.

           INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Mark opens the storage closet-- intense stench hits him. He 
           pinches his nose as Catligula calmly sits by his feet.

           The cat paws at the blue vinyl suitcase.

                                 MARK
                        Jesus, man. Whatchu got in there?

           Mark unzips the luggage-- he curiously removes a garbage bag.

           Catligula casually walks off.

           Mark opens the bag and peers in-- he gags, chokes on tears.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Commando...

           INT. PEACOAT’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 PEACOAT
                        I just don’t get why she has to 
                        return right around the time I 
                        start spontaneously killing things.

                                 SAM
                        If you didn’t have buzzard’s luck--

                                 PEACOAT
                        I’d have no luck at all.

           Peacoat’s cell rings.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

                                 SAM
                        Huh?

                                 PEACOAT
                        It’s Val!
                                 SAM
                        So answer it.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I’m letting it go to voicemail. I 
                        tend to fuck up when it’s live--

           Sam pries the phone away, flips it open and hands it back.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

                                 VALENTINE (O.S.)
                             (whisper)
                        Hey.

                                 PEACOAT
                        This is a surprise. A pleasant one. 
                        I’m sorry about pissing you off at 
                        the party--

                                 VALENTINE (O.S.)
                             (whisper)
                        Shut up-- can you hear me ok?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Of course.

                                 VALENTINE (O.S.)
                             (whisper)
                        You gotta get over here.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Where?

                                 VALENTINE (O.S.)
                             (whisper)
                        That “Trance the Night Away” party. 
                        Were you not invited?

                                 PEACOAT
                        You shouldn’t be there-- it’s 
                        dangerous. You gotta split--

                                 VALENTINE (O.S.)
                             (whispers)
                        It’s a normal party. Some familiar 
                        faces. Just... one very odd guest.

           Loud knocking is heard in the background.
                                 VALENTINE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                             (whisper)
                        Shit-- I’m hiding in the bathroom. 
                        Natives are restless. Get here and 
                        find me--

           Her phone cuts out.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Hello?

           Nothing. She’s gone.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        She’s at the party. Said to come.

                                 SAM
                        Good thing I brought my trancin’ 
                        shoes--

                                 BERNIE (O.S.)
                        Doth mine ears deceive me?

           Sam panics. Bernie opens the door, steps inside.

                                 BERNIE (CONT’D)
                        They doth not. It is my favorite 
                        scat-lover!

                                 SAM
                        And how are you, Bernice?

                                 BERNIE
                        What I’ve been trying to figure out 
                        the past three years is, are you 
                        simply a fecal fetishist? Or are 
                        you that narcissistic that even 
                        your own waste turns you on?

                                 MARK (O.S.)
                        A deer...

           Everyone turns to see Mark in the doorway, clutching the dog-
           carcass-filled garbage bag.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        A fucking deer... That my best 
                        friend chased into the woods... As 
                        if what you did isn’t horrific 
                        enough-- you decide to lie, make a 
                        fool of me. Disrespect me.
                                 PEACOAT
                        I respect you, Mark--

           Mark punches a hole in Peacoat’s door.

                                 MARK
                        Do not shit me! You’re four red 
                        cunt hairs from Charlize playing 
                        you in a flick. You’re a sick fuck, 
                        torturing the innocent--

                                 PEACOAT
                        That’s not true.

           Mark, wild-eyed, tosses the garbage bag into the room. 
           Peacoat, Sam and Bernie recoil from the stench.

                                 MARK
                        Here’s how it’s going down, Dr. 
                        Giggles-- Step one: I’m calling the 
                        appropriate authorities. They will 
                        take you away-- to a “Ha Ha House”, 
                        a loony bin, wherever they keep 
                        your sick kind. Two: when you get 
                        outta the straightjacket it’s 
                        reparations time-- you’re gonna 
                        live out your days volunteering for 
                        PETA or the ASPCA. Something 
                        that’ll keep you poor. And lastly, 
                        you’re gonna wear a “Hello my name 
                        is” sticker on that ratty-ass coat 
                        24-7, but instead of “Peter” it’ll 
                        say “Puppy Killer.” The only reason 
                        the previously mentioned doesn’t 
                        include a painful public fisting-- 
                        that’s outta respect to that hot 
                        piece of ass with whom you share 
                        genes. Now go give my fallen 
                        soldier a hero’s burial.

           He storms off, leaving the bag in the center of the room.

                                 MARK (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Tell al-Zarqawi he’s pallbearer!

           Peacoat shoots Sam a look.

                                 BERNIE
                             (sadistic grin)
                        So euphoria, huh? Like what? 
                        Rollin’ balls on E?

           Peacoat just shakes his head in disbelief.
           EXT. PEACOAT’S HOUSE/BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Sam carries the garbage bag, Peacoat holds a shovel.

                                 SAM
                        We’re not really doing this, are 
                        we? I don’t excel at manual labor.

           Peacoat offers Sam the shovel.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want it. We audi, yeah?

                                 PEACOAT
                        I am.

           Peacoat grabs his car keys.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        You gotta cover me. Gimme a head 
                        start. They can’t know I’m gone.

           Sam eyes him-- this is the last thing he wants to do.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        I gotta do this. It lessens the 
                        effect if we show up together. From 
                        Val’s standpoint.

                                 SAM
                        This is like Ash rolling up 
                        somewhere without Pikachu. It’s 
                        just nonsensical.

                                 PEACOAT
                        And can you please bury Commando?

                                 SAM
                        Want me to bake a fucking sponge 
                        cake while you’re out too?

           Peacoat eyes his friend-- “not now.”

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        It’s just not cool. I bet trancer-
                        chicks hump like Quasimodo--

                                 PEACOAT
                        Remember when we left Kaiser’s and 
                        I thought maybe we should stick 
                        around but you wanted to get your 
                        drink on, smoke on--
                                 SAM
                        And my potential poke on.

                                 PEACOAT
                        As we drove home he murdered every 
                        resident of the building. Twenty-
                        three people in all. Made the news.

                                 SAM
                        And this concerns my burgeoning sex 
                        life how?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Valentine’s at a party full of 
                        Kaisers. I save her life--

                                 SAM
                        Think you’re gonna get laid?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Heroes usually do.

                                 SAM
                        And the fact that you’ve recently 
                        taken to murder yourself?

           Peacoat thinks a long moment. He’s stumped.

                                 PEACOAT
                        I dunno. Just please-- be my friend 
                        and cover my ass. Then you can 
                        attempt to hump anything you like.

           After a long moment, Sam grabs the shovel.

           INT. PEACOAT’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Bernie sits at Peacoat’s computer-- she scrolls through his 
           web history. She finally finds the sought-after link...

           The familiar sounds of the average Asian girl commence.

           EXT. BACKYARD - LATER

           Sam begrudgingly digs a hole in the snowy ground.

           INT. CHEVY CAVALIER - CONTINUOUS

           Peacoat speeds along a rural road. He opens his cell, dials.

                                 VALENTINE (O.S.)
                             (voicemail)
                        Hey you’ve reached Valentine--
           He hangs up.

           INT. BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           Mark lays in bed watching “Commando” on TV. Holes have been 
           punched in the surrounding walls.

           In “Commando” ARNIE has just killed a GUY on a plane and 
           disguised him so he looks like he’s sleeping.

                                 ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGAR
                             (on TV, to stewardess)
                        Don’t disturb my friend-- he is 
                        dead tired.

           Mark loses it-- head in hands, he sobs. After a moment he 
           starts punching the bed. Suddenly,

                                 BERNIE (O.S.)
                        You’re hot when you’re violent.

           Mark looks-- tranced-up Bernie stands in the doorway. Her 
           eyes are closed and she gently paws at her left breast.

                                 MARK
                        Did you see what your twisted fuck 
                        of a brother did to ‘Mando?

           Bernie shuts the door and slowly walks towards Mark.

                                 BERNIE
                        I’m your hot piece of ass.

                                 MARK
                        Not now, Bern.

                                 BERNIE
                        Treat me like your hot piece of 
                        ass...

                                 MARK
                        Babe, please-- you’re being 
                        inappropriate.

           Bernie crawls in bed, snakes her arms around his shoulders.

                                 BERNIE
                        I wanna wheelbarrow--

                                 MARK
                        I’m not feeling very sexual right 
                        now, ok?
                                 BERNIE
                        I wanna be your sexual pushcart--

                                 MARK
                        Bernie, enough!

                                 BERNIE
                        Shhhh...

           Bernie lightly strokes his cheek with her free hand.

                                 MARK
                        Babe, I appreciate the distraction, 
                        but your brother-- he needs to be 
                        locked away. He’s demented.

                                 BERNIE
                        I know...

                                 MARK
                        You do? Good.

                                 BERNIE
                        I do...

                                 MARK
                        So how about you let me finish my 
                        tribute--

                                 BERNIE
                        After...

                                 MARK
                        After what? After we fuck? No. This 
                        needs to be done. For ‘Mando--

                                 BERNIE
                        After please...

                                 MARK
                        Bern, you’re not making any 
                        sense...

           She slowly stops stroking his cheek. A moment of stillness. 
           Mark looks at her, confused.

                                 BERNIE
                        After this--

           Bernie tears at his cheek. Mark screams, clutches his wound.
           EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Sam buries Commando.

           Mark’s screams are heard from inside-- he bolts.

           HALLWAY

           Sam races to the bedroom as Mark’s final screams fade into 
           silence. He grabs the doorknob, holds it shut.

                                 SAM
                        Bernice! You in there?

           Bernie breathes heavily. Finally,

                                 BERNIE (O.S.)
                        Yes... I’m shaking...

                                 SAM
                        It’s ok... Just relax...

                                 BERNIE (O.S.)
                        I want more... I want it to happen 
                        again...

           She lightly scratches at the door.

                                 BERNIE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I need more... Can I be your hot 
                        piece of ass--?

           Sam smiles at the prospect, when--

           A deafening CRASH from downstairs.

           A flurry of bootsteps storm the house.

           A team of ARMY GUYS march upstairs, past Sam and storm the

           BEDROOM

           Bernie lunges at the first Army Guy-- she grips his neck, 
           draws blood, and tosses him aside.

                                 SAM
                             (from doorway)
                        Bernie-- no! Stop!

           The other Army Guys ready their machine guns and close in.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Hey... Yo... Bernice!
           Bernie’s ready to pounce.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        You are my hot piece of ass...

           Bernie turns to him, distracted.

           Suddenly-- bloody Army Guy leaps up, tazer aimed-- ZAP!

           The electric currents drop her to the floor.

                                 ARMY GUY
                        Trancer down! Get this sushi to go, 
                        boys! Shit-bag the bitch!

           EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

           The huge home is the only one for miles.

           Peacoat parks amidst the long line of cars on the street. He 
           eyes drunken PARTY GOERS as he heads in.

           Pale Kid (from Nelly’s) waits by the door, clipboard-in-hand.

                                 PALE KID
                        Trance Armstrong!

                                 PEACOAT
                        That me?

                                 PALE KID
                        What’s the deal? Welcome, welcome--

                                 PEACOAT
                        Everyone’s really into word-play it 
                        seems. Why is that?

                                 PALE KID
                        All scenes have their own lingo-- 
                        beatniks, hippies... Glad you came!

                                 PEACOAT
                        Yeah. Quite a trek out here--

                                 PALE KID
                        And well worth it.
                             (checks watch)
                        The witching hour’s almost upon us.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Don’t you mean the trancing hour?
                                 PALE KID
                        No.

           Awkward silence.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Well ok. See you in there.

                                 PALE KID
                             (blocks his entry)
                        One rule, Armstrong: it’s a mobile-
                        free zone inside. Phones, laptops, 
                        wireless gadgets-- you use ‘em, we 
                        trash ‘em. What can I say? Trance 
                        governs all...

           Peacoat nods as he heads in.

           INT. MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Usual displays of drinking, dancing and drugging-- all amidst 
           Christmas decor. Flat screen monitors occupy every free inch 
           of wall space-- they flash candid photos of PARTYERS.

           Peacoat scans the room... Some familiar faces, yet no Val.

           Suddenly, the ELECTRONIC MUSIC from the “average Asian girl” 
           clip kicks in. The CROWD buzzes with excitement. 

           Peacoat stands confused in the middle of the dance floor.

           The lights dim. The crowd cheers. The music builds...

           As the music climaxes-- each monitor flashes porn of a 
           different kind: bondage, lesbian, orgies, GILFs, everything.

           A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN next to Peacoat focuses intently on one 
           monitor in which a FAT HAIRY MAN in a diaper jumps rope.

           The woman cannot look away. She touches herself... Suddenly, 
           she drops to the floor, pouring sweat, convulsing.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Fuck...

           Other Partyers drop as well. Bodies writhe across the floor.

           Peacoat weaves through the packed dance room, up into the

           UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Slightly calmer-- a long hallway lined with closed doors. 
           Scantily-clad BIMBOS and shirtless BOYS wander throughout.
           Peacoat tries to open the first door-- it’s locked.

                                 PEACOAT
                             (knocks)
                        Val?!?!

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Fuck you!

           Peacoat goes to the next door-- also locked. He pounds on it.

                                 GRAVEL-VOICED WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Who’s that?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Umm, name’s Peter. I’m looking for--

                                 GRAVEL-VOICED WOMAN (O.S.)
                        You sound hairless.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Huh?

                                 GRAVEL-VOICED WOMAN (O.S.)
                        And shy. Are you bashful--?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Thank you.

           As he bangs on the next door...

                                 DR. KAISER (O.S.)
                        Miller-- Ol’ Doc Feelgood is in...

           Peacoat looks up-- Kaiser, dressed in a sharp suit, stands at 
           the end of the hallway. He holds a door open.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        C’mon-- hugs.

           Peacoat doesn’t move.

                        Peter...

                                 PEACOAT
                        This is a little strange, right? 
                        Being at the same party?

                                 DR. KAISER
                        One man’s strange makes another 
                        man’s day. 
                                 PEACOAT
                             (re: bimbos and boys)
                        And these folks?

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Hookers and rent boys. The help.
                             (motions with his head)
                        C’mere-- you won’t wanna be out in 
                        the open much longer.

                                 PEACOAT
                        You about to trance the night away?

                                 DR. KAISER
                        That’s more of a secondary 
                        priority. I’m here, first and 
                        foremost, as field researcher. See 
                        above all I’m a man of science.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Caught your handywork on the news. 
                        Alotta science go into that--?

                                 DR. KAISER
                        The early’s are gonna rise any 
                        minute now. And I’m gonna hafta 
                        close and lock this door. Will it 
                        only be Valentine who’s safely 
                        behind it?

           Peacoat eyes Kaiser. A chorus of screams commence downstairs-- 
           the hookers and rent boys scurry behind closed doors.

           INT. PALATIAL BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kaiser deadbolts the door. 

           Peacoat takes in the room-- a lavish canopy bed, towering oak 
           bookshelves, a fireplace with dancing flames.

           Valentine sits by the fire in a large leather chair.

                                 PEACOAT
                             (re: Kaiser)
                        The “one very odd guest”...?

                                 VALENTINE
                        I had yet to see the prostitutes.

                                 PEACOAT
                        You ok?

           Kaiser lays on his side on the canopy bed.
                                 DR. KAISER
                        She’s just fine. We’re all just 
                        fine. Everyone’s safe in here.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Unless, of course, you trance-out 
                        and kill us.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        I could say the same to you, Peter.

           Peacoat looks at Val.

                                 VALENTINE
                        He already told me-- your cat.

                                 PEACOAT
                        And Nelly Skylar.

                                 VALENTINE
                        No...

           Peacoat sheepishly nods.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Peter, have a seat. Get comfy.

           Peacoat sits in a leather chair adjacent to Valentine as 
           Kaiser scoots to the edge of the bed.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        Yoshiko! Sakura! Come meet my 
                        friends!

           YOSHIKO and SAKURA-- two sultry, freshly-showered Japanese 
           hookers slink in from the bathroom. A towel clings to each.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        Pete, Val-- say hi to Yosh and Sak.

           The girls crawl on the bed and embrace Kaiser from behind.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        Between the two of ‘em-- not one 
                        lick of English.

           Kaiser deep-tongues Sakura then turns back to Peacoat and 
           Val. Yoshiko caresses his chest.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        Introspection, abstract reasoning, 
                        analytic thought... all uniquely 
                        human qualities, yes?
                                 PEACOAT
                        As proven on “Rock of Love.”

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Thing is, Peter-- everything in 
                        life needs balance. Every Yin has a 
                        Yang. And to the human experience 
                        it’s the orgasm-- the perfect 
                        antidote to the curse of a powerful 
                        mind. A brief, simple escape from 
                        reflecting on the shittiness of 
                        existence. This trance, its more 
                        than just an escape. It’s a gift.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Call me old-fashioned but I’ll just 
                        shoot a load.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Well what’s replaced your load 
                        lasts longer, is more intense, is 
                        more free of thought. It evolves... 
                        It’s almost a living organism!

                                 PEACOAT
                        Doc, I’ve never gotten laid! You 
                        know this. I’ll be damned if that’s 
                        gonna remain fact for the next 
                        sixty years--

           Kaiser chuckles to himself.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        This is starting to feel better. 
                        More comfortable, yeah? Just like 
                        in the office.

           Kaiser crosses his legs, looks “professional.”

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        So, you two, tell me why you’re 
                        here.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Ummm... I thought it was a party?

                                 DR. KAISER
                        And it is, my dear. Peter?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Well... I sorta came here... to 
                        rescue her.
                                 DR. KAISER
                        How heroic! How valiant!

                                 PEACOAT
                        Not if I botch it.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        But an average schlub like yourself 
                        would normally never be here in the 
                        first place. Why now?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Are you gonna bill me for this? Cuz 
                        honestly I’m strapped--

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Avoidance, Peter--

                                 PEACOAT
                        Why now...? 

           Peacoat thinks a long moment.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        Val and I-- we shared an experience 
                        that rocked her world. Not in a 
                        good way. And if she’s at this 
                        party she’s gonna get her face torn 
                        off. And frankly I can’t live with 
                        the guilt of knowing that I fucked 
                        her up for much of her short life.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Thanks...

                                 DR. KAISER
                        It amuses me how important the past 
                        becomes when the future’s in peril--

                                 PEACOAT
                        I’d still call your past important. 
                        What you did to those twenty-three 
                        people...

                                 DR. KAISER
                        I had to. Couldn’t help myself. It 
                        feels like... like fucking someone 
                        with God’s penis!

                                 PEACOAT
                        A man of science, through and 
                        through--
                                 DR. KAISER
                        I really do wanna learn how to 
                        treat this thing. I have a 
                        reputation to uphold.

                                 VALENTINE
                        But you don’t wanna treat yourself.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        It’s much too freeing. An ideal 
                        sidekick to a developing mid-life 
                        crisis.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Sounds to me like you want your 
                        cake... and Edith too.

           Kaiser smirks knowingly.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Know what “projective 
                        identification” is, Peter?

           Peacoat shrugs.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        Well let’s say one assumes that 
                        others hate them when in fact they 
                        have no idea. Yet they act as if 
                        everyone hates them, which in turn 
                        makes them legitimately despised.

                        “People don’t like me.”

                        True, true, and true.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Doesn’t count if you “botch” this 
                        rescue mission... It’s very crafty 
                        how you set things up. So no one 
                        notices when you fail...

                                 PEACOAT
                        Low expectations are like a warm, 
                        cozy blanket.
                                 DR. KAISER
                        Or perhaps a vintage naval peacoat? 
                             (off Peacoat’s smirk)
                        Yet you’ve obviously convinced 
                        yourself that heroism is the 
                        ultimate goal.

           Peacoat thinks on this.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        Well what’s it gonna be? Jack T. 
                        Colton or your dear old granddad? 
                        The soldier of fortune on a 
                        dangerous treasure hunt or the 
                        safely content yet never heroic 
                        member of the coast guard?

                                 PEACOAT
                        I don’t know...

           Yoshiko/Sakura massage Kaiser’s crotch-- he starts to sweat.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Well unfortunately you just might 
                        have to choose between the two.
                             (wipes sweat from face)
                        Wicked wiles-- my girls here, they 
                        got ‘em in spades... And, well they 
                        seem to be affecting me.

                                 PEACOAT
                        So we stay here with you or leave. 
                        Either way we go out fighting, Jack 
                        Colton-style.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Either way is a gallows walk... 
                        Heroes are merely fools with large 
                        egos. Survival’s more your cup of 
                        tea. Kinda runs in your family.

           Peacoat studies Kaiser.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        Peter, you introduced me to this 
                        same glorious world that you 
                        continually reject. And for what? 
                        To pursue the pedestrian rite of 
                        passage that is “penis-in-vagina”?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Penis in mouth or ass would 
                        suffice.
                                 DR. KAISER
                        Well I’d like to repay your 
                        introduction with a re-
                        introduction. Embrace it with me... 
                        Save yourself--

                                 VALENTINE
                        Whoa-- hold up...

           Kaiser foams at the mouth. Peacoat studies Valentine.

                                 DR. KAISER
                             (can barely speak)
                        Yoshiko... Sakura... Make nice, 
                        will ya?

           Kaiser weakly pushes their heads together. The girls get the 
           gist: Yoshiko and Sakura passionately kiss...

           Peacoat, wide-eyed, gets momentarily lost in the lesbian 
           display. Val watches him with disbelief. Finally,

                                 VALENTINE
                        Ummm... Pete?

           He snaps out of it, turns to her-- his face pours sweat.

           INT. MANSION/DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Music blares, strobe lights flash and porno plays on the 
           monitors as hordes of Partyers convulse on the floor. 

           A few NON-TRANCERS huddle powerlessly in the corner.

           Sam creeps in, eyes wide, a bookbag strapped to his back. He 
           cautiously steps over convulsing bodies. He scans the room... 

           The Pale Kid is the last one standing on the dance floor. His 
           eyes are locked on a monitor-- it plays a gangbang scene.

           Sam races over.

                                 SAM
                        Yo!

           Throughout the conversation Pale Kid faces away, his gaze 
           never leaves the monitor. He speaks slowly, softly.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Hey yo-- what’s happening?

                                 PALE KID
                        Feeling good...
                                 SAM
                        Are you like trancing out?

           He starts to sweat and shake a bit.

                                 PALE KID
                        I said I’m feeling good...

                                 SAM
                             (looks at monitor)
                        But I see no average Asian girl in 
                        that fleshy daisy chain. Where’s 
                        the clip?

                                 PALE KID
                        The clip... only plants the seed...

           He shakes uncontrollably.

                                 SAM
                        You’re about to drop--

                                 PALE KID
                        Will you be here when I rise? Like 
                        a phoenix from the ashes...

           His twitching hits a fever pitch. Sam reaches into his 
           backpack and removes the laser tag gun and helmet.

                                 PALE KID (CONT’D)
                        Stay. You stay... watch me explode--

                                 SAM
                        Sorry, man. No can do. I gotta weed 
                        dealer to support and an unwatched 
                        “Eyes Wide Shut” Euro-release DVD.

                                 PALE KID
                        Phones... laptops... wireless 
                        gadgets... you use... we trash--

           In a swift motion Sam slams the helmet on his head and ZAP! 
           Point blank-- Pale Kid hits the floor, unconscious.

           An iphone spills out of Pale Kid’s pocket. Sam eyes it, picks 
           it up-- he types in the “average Asian girl” website.

                                 SAM
                        Come hither, you average-looking 
                        wench of the Orient...

           Sam watches the phone as the page loads, when--
           A TRANCER GIRL grabs him from behind.

           Sam whips around, stuffs the helmet on her head and fires.

           The Trancer Girl flies back and drops.

           Sam smiles to himself, scans the room...

           INT. PRIVATE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Yoshiko and Sakura still intensely make out. Peacoat sweats, 
           shakes, and steals glances as he tries to focus on Val.

                                 VALENTINE
                        What the hell are you doing? I’d 
                        think your fantasies were less 
                        cliche than simple girl-on-girl--

                                 PEACOAT
                             (voice quivering)
                        Sorry. It’s just I’ve seen this in 
                        pics, videos... but in the flesh, 
                        the beauty of a sapphic liplock--

                                 VALENTINE
                        Is gonna get me killed! You gotta 
                        stop it!

                                 PEACOAT
                        I don’t think I can... I think it’s 
                        too late...

                                 DR. KAISER
                             (intensely convulsing)
                        Give in to it, Peter.

           Peacoat wipes sweat from his brow.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        Just one spark... one lusty spark. 
                        It’s survival and pleasure...

           Valentine pleads with her eyes.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        Your very own cake and Edith... 
                        together at last!

           Peacoat shakes and sweats yet his eyes are locked on Val.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Yeah but... I think in this case...
                                 DR. KAISER
                             (almost out)
                        Yes, Peter?

           Peacoat struggles to his feet...

                                 PEACOAT
                        Right now all I want... is Edith.

           He leans into Val, grabs her by the shoulders. She flinches.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                             (struggles to speak)
                        Kick me... in the... nuts.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Huh?

                                 PEACOAT
                        I have a theory. A work-around of 
                        sorts---

           THWAK! Val knees Peacoat in the groin. He doubles over, takes 
           deeeeep breaths, fights off the pain.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Well? Now what?

           As Peacoat’s convulsions begin to subside...

                                 PEACOAT
                        You went to Kaiser cuz of me.
                             (extends his hand)
                        Maybe you’ll leave him cuz of me 
                        too...

           She takes a moment, cautiously grabs his hand and rises.

           Yoshiko and Sakura start screaming in Japanese-- Kaiser is 
           unconscious, convulsing and covered in sweat.

                                 VALENTINE
                             (motions for them)
                        Yoshiko! Sakura!

           Confused and frantic, the girls grab their purses. The four 
           race to the door. Peacoat nervously opens it--

           Sam waits-- the laser tag set aimed and ready.

                                 SAM
                        Your ass almost got “lanced.”
                                 VALENTINE
                        Like a wart?

                                 SAM
                             (re: laser tag gun)
                        It’s what I named this puppy.

                                 PEACOAT
                        After his cock.

           Sam’s gaze falls on Yoshiko and Sakura.

                                 SAM
                        Well, konnichiwa miladies...

                                 PEACOAT
                        That’s Yoshiko and Sakura. Dr. 
                        Kaiser’s hookers. Speak zero 
                        English.

                                 SAM
                        And Kaiser?

                                 PEACOAT
                        Trancing out over my shoulder.

                                 SAM
                        Should I “lance” him?

                                 PEACOAT
                        If you’re referring to your gun.

           Sam walks to the bed, wedges the helmet onto Kaiser’s head.

                                 SAM
                        Hope no one minds. I called in the 
                        Band of Brothers...

           He removes the Pale Kid’s iphone (playing the “average Asian 
           girl” clip) and slides it in Kaiser’s pants pocket.

           He raises the gun--

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to the party, pal--

           Kaiser reaches up and grips Sam’s neck.

                                 DR. KAISER
                        My love spills...

           He tosses Sam across the room. The gun and helmet go flying.
           Peacoat protects the girls as he fights off a relapse of the 
           convulsions and sweating. Sakura fearfully sobs. 

           Sam groggily looks up from the floor as Kaiser sits up in 
           bed, eyes closed and grinning.

           He unbuttons his dress shirt and reveals a deep, scabby, 
           bloody gash over his heart. He claws at it.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        My love spills with you, Peter.

           Blood bubbles from his chest as Kaiser crawls off the bed.

                                 VALENTINE
                        What’s he doing? He’s gonna kill 
                        himself!

           Peacoat trembles as he lifts his shirt and reveals his bloody 
           chest wound to Val. She cringes.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Happens to the best of us. If I 
                        don’t make it, tell people I went 
                        out with my heart on my sleeve...

           Val sadly takes in his weakening state...

           Sakura sees Kaiser and Peacoat’s bloody chests, makes a 
           connection. She freaks. Sobbing uncontrollably, she pushes 
           Peacoat aside and bolts out of the room.

                                 YOSHIKO
                             (frantic, in Japanese)
                        Sakura! Sakura! No!

           Seconds later, a deafening DEATH-SCREAM comes from the hall. 
           Peacoat and Val share a look-- Sakura didn’t make it.

           Kaiser stands over a battered, helpless Sam. As he leans in,

                                 DR. KAISER
                        Spill love with me, Peter.

           Peacoat’s face pours sweat. He shakes. Kaiser claws at Sam’s 
           neck with one hand, his own messy chest with the other.

                                 DR. KAISER (CONT’D)
                        Spill love...

           Peacoat eyes the laser tag set on the floor in the far corner 
           of the room.
           A sudden TIRE SCREECH outside.

           Through the window Peacoat spots four jeeps pull up. A team 
           of ARMY GUYS storm the house.

           Peacoat turns to Val.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Again... Kick me in the--

           Thwak!!! She kicks him hard in the balls.

           Peacoat breathes deep and stumbles for the laser tag. He 
           scoops it up, slams the helmet on Kaiser’s head and-- ZAP!!!

           Kaiser’s body tightens, then collapses onto the floor.

           Peacoat helps Sam to his feet as three army guys invade the 
           room. They head straight for Kaiser (and ignore the kids). 

                                 ARMY GUY
                        Looks dormant. Repeat, dormant. 
                             (checks Kaiser’s body)
                        McSteamy here was one flesh rip 
                        away from tearing his ticker--

                                 SAM
                        That was my friend’s doing. Saved 
                        his life. And mine--

                                 ARMY GUY
                             (still ignoring)
                        Neutralize and shit-bag him, boys!

           Sam shakes his head in disbelief.

           DANCE FLOOR

           A strobe light partially illuminates an orgy of chaos-- 
           hookers and rent boys get torn to shreds as Army Guys 
           haphazardly “taze and bag” trancers. This is a war zone.

           Peacoat, Valentine, Sam and Yoshiko descend the stairs and 
           step onto the floor-- the strobe adds to the disorientation.

           As they move, Val wipes sweat from Peacoat’s face and holds 
           him up, as he “lance’s” a path to the front door.

           As they near their escape, Peacoat falls to the ground. He 
           uncontrollably shakes.

           Trancers begin to move towards the group.
                                 VALENTINE
                        On your feet, Bernie Lomax! Wanna 
                        get... shit-bagged?

           Spittle leaks from his mouth. The trancers close in. 

           Val picks him up, stares at him deeply. Then... Thwak!!! She 
           punches him in the balls. As he weakly reflects the pain...

                                 VALENTINE (CONT’D)
                        C’mon!

           EXT. MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           The four spill out on the empty, garbage-littered front lawn. 

           Peacoat lays sprawled on the ground-- the trance/testicle 
           abuse are taking its toll.

           Yoshiko, still miraculously in her towel, sobs as she 
           frantically rummages through her purse.

                                 SAM
                        So now what?

                                 VALENTINE
                        What do you mean? We leave.

                                 SAM
                        Yeah but we all drove. What do we 
                        caravan outta here?

                                 VALENTINE
                        That’s a terrible idea. None of us 
                        should be alone.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Then whose car--?

           Sudden jingling draws their attention-- Yoshiko clutches a 
           set of keys and heads for a gold Bentley.

                                 SAM
                        Fuck. Yoshiko’s stackin’ paper...

           Yoshiko opens the door and waves them over.

           Sam and Val help Peacoat to the car. Sam hops in shotgun, Val 
           and Peacoat get in the back. Yoshiko guns the engine...

           INT. BENTLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           The Bentley races down a dark tree-lined road.
           Peacoat leans against the window-- he’s covered in sweat and 
           shakes uncontrollably. Valentine watches with concern.

           Sam ogles Yoshiko’s towel, barely clinging to her breasts.

                                 SAM
                        One pothole and it’s “tune in 
                        Tokyo”--

           On cue, the car hits a bump-- Yoshiko’s towel drops exposing 
           her breasts. She could care less.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                             (under his breath)
                        Let them titties hang, girl...
                             (deep breath, to everyone)
                        Cupid’s arrow has pierced my loins.

           Peacoat struggles to smile through his worsening state.

                                 VALENTINE
                        We’re losing him, Sam! And I don’t 
                        think he can take another shot to 
                        the babymakers--

                                 SAM
                        You can’t wait a few? I’m nursing a 
                        serious hankerin’ for dairy.

           Peacoat shakes intensely, leaks spittle and sweat, goes limp.

                                 VALENTINE
                        He’s out! Gimme the helmet!

           Sam, annoyed, takes his eyes off Yoshiko’s tits and passes 
           the helmet back to Val. She tenderly straps it onto his head.

           Sam readies the gun-- he brings it to Peacoat’s forehead.

                                 VALENTINE (CONT’D)
                        This is safe, yeah?

                                 SAM
                        I shot him the other day. He 
                        survived.

           Sam thinks a second.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Of course I since upped the voltage 
                        to two-hundred k.
                                 VALENTINE
                        From?

                                 SAM
                        Seventy-thou.

                                 VALENTINE
                        What?

                                 SAM
                        It’s fine. Trust me.

                                 VALENTINE
                        You tested it?

                                 SAM
                        On a gerbil...

           Sam thinks... his face reflects the fate of the gerbil.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        But Pete and a gerbil... two very 
                        different species.

                                 VALENTINE
                        This is insane--

                                 SAM
                        I once thought that about making 
                        love to a cored-apple. Now it’s my 
                        preferred method--

                                 VALENTINE
                        Then just do it already!

           ZAP! Sam shoots Peacoat-- his body tightens, then goes limp.

                                 SAM
                        Done. Let’s go home...

           Sam’s gaze immediately returns to Yoshiko’s breasts.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        And Yoshiko-- take the scenic 
                        route.

           She hasn’t a clue. As the car continues...

                                                              FADE OUT.

           Over black, John Lennon’s “Happy Xmas (War Is Over)” plays.

           A TITLE CARD reads “5 Days Later-- Xmas Morn”
           INT. PEACOAT’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Peacoat stirs awake in bed. He looks at his desk-- a new 
           alarm clock with a bow around it flashes 10:00 am. 

           On his bare chest is a clean bandage. He peers underneath the 
           bandage-- his self-inflicted wound has started to heal.

           MUFFLED CONVERSATION comes from downstairs.

           As Peacoat shuts off the alarm he catches his reflection in 
           the mirror-- dried red liquid is smeared across his mouth and 
           chin. His face sinks. He’s killed again...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The room is awash in Christmas decorations.

           Peacoat enters and stands in the doorway: Sam hangs ornaments 
           on a Christmas tree/smokes a bong while Yoshiko sits on the 
           floor intensely studying a driver’s license.

                                 SAM
                        Your boy JC woulda been none-too-
                        pleased had you slept through his b-
                        day. So Santa brought you a new 
                        alarm--

                                 PEACOAT
                        Who’s dead?

                                 SAM
                        Ummm... no one?

                                 PEACOAT
                             (points to mouth)
                        What the fuck is this? Unless I’m 
                        shedding the lining of my uterus 
                        through my mouth, someone’s dead.

           Sam laughs.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 VALENTINE (O.S.)
                        Strained beets.

           Valentine, adorable in an oversized t-shirt and tousled hair, 
           stands behind Peacoat.
                                 VALENTINE (CONT’D)
                        I mean, a) you had to eat. And b) 
                        there’s a rampant web rumor that 
                        beetroot dulls the effects of the 
                        trance. Could be bullshit though.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Oh.

           Val sits by the tree, grabs the bong, takes a hit.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Your parents called. I told ‘em you 
                        were sleeping. Your dad 
                        uncomfortably referred to you as “a 
                        drip off the ol’ cock.”

                                 PEACOAT
                        They come back last night?

                                 VALENTINE
                        They made a detour-- VA.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Huh?

                                 VALENTINE
                        Trying to pull your sis from the 
                        Donald H. Rumsfeld Trancer 
                        Decontamination Center.

                                 SAM
                        They’re apparently snuffing out 
                        libidos in the joint.

                                 PEACOAT
                        And how might they be doing that?

                                 VALENTINE
                        Classified.

                                 SAM
                        My guess-- the delicate dance that 
                        is castration-slash-female 
                        circumcision.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Aren’t those methods generally 
                        considered illegal and inhumane?

                                 SAM
                        Give ‘em credit for trying. They 
                        gotta live up to their namesake.
                                 PEACOAT
                        They know who started this shit by 
                        now--?

                                 VALENTINE
                        Some asshole right-wing “cyber-
                        warrior” group claimed 
                        responsibility.

                                 SAM
                        The O’Reilly Hackers. Retaliation 
                        against the porn industry and 
                        anyone who supports it.

           Peacoat finally notices Yoshiko-- she wears khaki Z. 
           Cavaricci’s and a hideous paisley rayon shirt.

                                 PEACOAT
                        What is that? Early ‘90’s lesbo 
                        chic?

                                 SAM
                        From your mom’s storage closet, 
                        dick. She was naked!

                                 PEACOAT
                        That’s not preferred?

                                 SAM
                        By me, sure. I was trying to tone 
                        down the objectification of women 
                        for Val here.

           Yoshiko continues to intensely study a driver’s license.

                                 YOSHIKO
                             (HEAVILY accented)
                        We-sam. We-sam... Yes?

                                 SAM
                        Homegirl’s obsessed with my 
                        “cultural” name. Either that or 
                        she’s continually insinuating I’m 
                        an Egyptian Uncle Tom.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Hit it?

                                 SAM
                        Naw, man. Yosh charges 500 bones an 
                        hour. I will charm her into some 
                        pro bono work though.
                                 PEACOAT
                        By engaging her in conversation, no 
                        doubt.

                                 SAM
                        Mock me, but I’m quickly gaining 
                        fluency in the one true universal 
                        language--

                                 PEACOAT
                        Flatulence?

                                 SAM
                        I got bitches throwing me their 
                        digits. Being a non-trancer-- 
                        suddenly I’m a catch. I’m like a 
                        Jewish doctor.

           Sam tosses a wrapped gift from under the tree to Peacoat.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Gift number two.

           Peacoat unwraps it-- Sam’s laser tag set is inside.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Figured it just might keep you 
                        outta the Rumsfeld Center.

                                 PEACOAT
                        Thanks. I do like my balls. Even 
                        hope to enjoy ‘em again someday.

           Val, bong-in-hand, joins Peacoat in the doorway.

                                 VALENTINE
                        When you heading back to school?

                                 PEACOAT
                        The third, I think.

                                 VALENTINE
                        Cool...

           She grabs the laser tag set from his hands.

                                 VALENTINE (CONT’D)
                        My Christmas gift to you-- a Lance-
                        toting shadow. Until you skip town. 
                        Then you’re on your own.
                                 PEACOAT
                        I do tend to get drunk and horny on 
                        new year’s. And if the beets fail, 
                        someone’s inevitably gonna hafta... 

           He brings a finger-gun to his head, pulls the trigger.

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        And, well, getting put down by you--

           Peacoat thinks a sec, looks at her, smiles...

                                 PEACOAT (CONT’D)
                        There’s nowhere else on earth I’d 
                        rather be...

           Valentine smiles. The two share a long moment. Finally...

           She offers him the bong in the style of a game show hostess. 
           Peacoat appreciatively nods. 

           As he takes a monster hit...

                                 SAM
                        Ahem...

           Sam mischievously eyes the top of the door frame, just above 
           where they stand.

           Peacoat and Valentine follow his gaze-- they stand underneath 
           a mistletoe. The two silently stare at it.

           Lennon’s “Happy Xmas (War Is Over)” resumes.

           They return their gazes to each other. They share a brief 
           smile. After a long moment...

                                 PEACOAT
                        Wake me up for New Year’s?

           Valentine smiles and nods.

           Peacoat takes a deep breath and leans in for a kiss. As the 
           kiss grows in intensity...

                                                              FADE OUT.

           OVER BLACK we hear their lips part, a loud ZAP, and finally, 
           Peacoat’s body drop to the floor.

           THE END
