           RHINO”:

           A progression of images of CELESTE and JESSE, ages 18 to 30.  
           Visual media evolves with them throughout the years.

           POLAROIDS of high school moments:
           *Celeste is a chronic overachiever and Jesse is sweet, goofy 
           and funny. He makes her laugh. They are best friends but it’s 
           clear that Jesse wishes they were more. 
           *Close-up of their hands crossed, making “C” and “J” shapes.
           *Celeste and her football player boyfriend, Mike, kissing. 
           Jesse watches enviously from the sidelines, holding Mike’s 
           helmet.

           DIPOSABLE CAMERA PHOTOS:
           *They go to college together, study together, drink together. 
           They are still best friends. 
           *Junior year, Celeste with Saleem, her hot, black militant 
           boyfriend. They kiss passionately. 
           *A moment later, Jesse poses reluctantly with Saleem and 
           Celeste.  

           SUPER 8 FOOTAGE:
           *Senior year, Jesse draws “C AND J FOREVER” in a pristine, 
           snowy forest with a stick; he and Celeste laugh. 
           *A moment later, they kiss deeply. They are finally together. 

           DIGITAL VIDEO FOOTAGE of “Celeste and Jesse Forever”: 
           *On an engraved necklace, carved into a tree, written on a 
           wet beach, and on their wedding cake. 

           BLACK AND WHITE HI-RES PHOTOS show them married:
           *Moving into their house, dancing, reading side by side, 
           kissing. This is true, everlasting love, the real kind. 

           SHUTTERFLY album photos from friends’ parties: 
           *Celeste and Jesse, in silence, amongst joyful party guests. 
           *Jesse telling a joke and Celeste no longer laughing. 
           *Jesse and Celeste on a bench, distant.

           head.

           INT. TOYOTA PRIUS-DAY

           It’s a bright, clear Los Angeles Saturday afternoon. Celeste 
           and Jesse, now 30, both sing along to “Love Rhino,” the song 
           heard under the montage. Jesse drives while Celeste is on her 
           Blackberry. 
           Jesse, boyishly handsome, wears an old tee and a hooded 
           sweatshirt.  Celeste is wearing all black workout gear. She 
           is always wearing all black.

                                 JESSE
                        I’m a Love Rhino...

                          CELESTE
                                                          JESSE
                                              Dont’ worry ‘bout me, I’ve 
                                              got enough love, for the two 
                                              us. Oh please...
           Don’t worry ‘bout me, I’ve 
           got a enough love for 
           the...(her Blackberry rings) 
           oh shit, I gotta take this. 
           Turn it down.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        ...I’m a Love...

                                 CELESTE
                        Jess, turn it down, seriously!

           She playfully slaps him. He turns it down. A little.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Hi. With Jesse, running 
                        errands. (to Jesse) Turn it down. 
                        More. (back to the phone) Yeah, I 
                        can do it now. No, it’ll be fast, 
                        right? (To Jesse) Hey, I have to 
                        give a quick sound byte for the New 
                        York Times, so no noise please? For 
                        a second?

                                 JESSE
                        Maybe. I may have an important call 
                        coming in too, so...

           They both know he has no important call coming in.

                                 CELESTE
                        (on the phone) Okay. Ready? This 
                        year all trends point towards 
                        simplicity and comfort. Consumers 
                        will be less likely to go out for 
                        entertainment.

           While Celeste is dictating, Jesse is getting bored. He starts 
           looking through the middle console. He finds something. A 
           melted tube of Chapstick. Ew. Ooh, a cigarette. 

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        One more line? Okay...

           Jesse lights the cigarette, takes a drag. Celeste looks at 
           Jesse and signals to him, “Can I have a drag?”  
                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Uhhh, things like Netflix, casual 
                        wear and cookbooks will see a huge 
                        spike in the market.

           He hands her the cigarette and she promptly chucks it out the 
           window.

                                 JESSE
                        What the shit??

                                 CELESTE
                        (she whispers to Jesse) Shhh. Phone 
                        call.(back to her call) That’s 
                        enough of a blurb, right? 

           Jesse is now checking out nose hairs in the visor mirror. He 
           then looks at his teeth. 

                                 JESSE
                        Does this tooth look dark?

           Celeste just glares at him.

                                 CELESTE
                        Okay. Call me back if they need 
                        more. 

           Jesse looks at his tooth again in the rearview mirror.

                                 JESSE
                        Like a little darker than the rest?

           Celeste waves her hand to quiet Jesse.

                                 CELESTE
                        Okay, thanks bye. (to Jesse) Can’t 
                        you just sit still for two minutes? 
                        And we talked about this, no more 
                        smoking!

                                 JESSE
                        I wasn’t smoking, I just found it.

                                 CELESTE
                        Come on.

           They drive by “Urban Light,” Chris Burden’s installation at 
           the entrance of LACMA. They are rows of restored street 
           lamps. Celeste sneers.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Really? Street lamps? No. Not doin’ 
                        it. That is not art.
                                 JESSE
                        I think it’s beautiful.

           A beat passes. Then, Jesse pulls over.

                                 CELESTE
                        What are you doing? Why are you 
                        stopping?

                                 JESSE
                        Well, your appointment is not until 
                        noon and this is that place with 
                        the deadstock vintage Italian 
                        fabric. I thought it would be good 
                        for the guest room windows.

           Celeste is truly touched by the gesture.

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh wow.. you are so thoughtful.

           Jesse smiles, proud of himself.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks, Jess.

           She gives him a kiss on the cheek. Jesse’s phone rings, he 
           answers.

                                 JESSE
                        Whassup, muthafucka??

           Celeste rolls her eyes and gets out of the car to look at 
           fabric.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TOYOTA PRIUS-10 MINUTES LATER

           Celeste is getting back in the car with some fabric swatches.

                                 CELESTE
                        Jess, that place is insane. They 
                        have tassels that were manufactured 
                        for Mussolini’s mistress...

                                 JESSE
                        (covering the phone) Sorry, I’m on 
                        the phone. It’s important.

                                 CELESTE
                        Okay then.
           Celeste sits quietly while Jesse is on his call.

                                 JESSE
                        Really? I just...don’t know what to 
                        say. Thank you so much for calling 
                        me.

           Celeste throws her hands up in silent celebration.

                                 CELESTE
                        (whispers) Did you get the job??

           Jesse signals with his finger, “one minute.”

                                 JESSE
                        Well, sometimes things are just 
                        meant to work out.

           Celeste looks at him with anticipation.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, great. Great. Talk soon. Bye.

                                 CELESTE
                        Was that the job? Did you get the 
                        Slate job?

                                 JESSE
                        No, but Celeste...

           He looks at her and grabs her hand, with tears in his eyes.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        ...a swell came in last night. Out 
                        of the Northeast. It’s overhead and 
                        it’s glassy.

                                 CELESTE
                        What the fuck are you talking 
                        about?

                                 JESSE
                        Malibu. The waves are peeling out 
                        there.  

                                 CELESTE
                        Is this about surfing? You’re 
                        talking about going surfing. 
                        Unbelievable.

                                 JESSE
                        No, this is best part. Skillz got a 
                        hi-def digital camera and he’s 
                        gonna film me!!!
                                 CELESTE
                        Oh, god.

                                 JESSE
                        And we’re gonna upload it on You 
                        Tube!

                                 CELESTE
                        I’m not...

                                 JESSE
                        What? Isn’t that awesome?

                                 CELESTE
                        No, yeah, I just thought it was 
                        about the Slate job you applied 
                        for.

                                 JESSE
                        Oh yeah. No. They haven’t called 
                        yet. But if they can’t see that I’m 
                        taking hip-hop journalism to the 
                        next level, then they’re not for 
                        me. I have a lot to offer.

                                 CELESTE
                        You absolutely do. You are a 
                        wonderful writer.  And you will 
                        show the world that one 
                        day...right?

                                 JESSE
                        Hey, can I drop you at home now?
                        Because I just missed a wave. 

                                 CELESTE
                        Well...

                                 JESSE
                        Wait! I just missed another one.

                                 CELESTE
                        Yeah. Take me home, it’s fine. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TOYOTA PRIUS-30 MINUTES LATER

           Jesse is dropping Celeste at home.

                        Be back by six so you can shower.
                                 JESSE
                        Why shower?

                                 CELESTE
                        Dinner with Beth and Tucker.

                                 JESSE
                        Right, right.

                                 CELESTE
                        Have fun shredding your glassy 
                        peel.

                                 JESSE
                        Aw, so wrong.

                                 CELESTE
                        Love you.

                                 JESSE
                        Love you too.

           He promptly blasts the radio and flashes their signature “C 
           and J” hand sign. She flashes it back. He zooms off.

           INT. LITTLE DOM’S-NIGHT

           Celeste and Jesse are on double date with BETH, 30, petite, 
           and full of energy and TUCKER, 31, preppy in an indy way. 
           These are their best friends from college. They’re engaged.

                                 TUCKER
                        Did you end up going to see that 
                        band at Spaceland last week?

                                 JESSE
                        Oh, My Agent Loves Your Lawyer? 
                        Yeah, dude. They are ri-sick-ulous. 
                        You know what? They should be your 
                        wedding band. They’re loud but 
                        they’re affordable.

                                 CELESTE
                        They opened for Darcy Fudged His 
                        Knickers. Now they’re amazing. 
                        You’d be lucky to book them for 
                        your wedding.

                                 BETH
                        It’s already done. We got the best 
                        swing band in New England. 
                        Sugarfoot and The Swingin’ Scrod.
                                 TUCKER
                        I told you, I’m not doing it. Swing 
                        is so late 90’s, honey. 

           Beth leans over a gives him a deep kiss. She knows how to 
           work him.

                                 BETH
                        I love you. We’ll talk about this 
                        later. 

           Celeste looks over the menu. Celeste and Jesse’s next 
           interaction is said with heavy, really bad German accents, 
           which is hilarious--only to them.

                                 CELESTE
                        So veee ahhh gawwnna share zeh beet

                                 JESSE

                        have bite oof yorrrs.

                                 CELESTE
                        Yawh!!!!

           Celeste and Jesse giggle at their stupid inside joke for a 
           little too long.  Then, there is a deafening lull in the 
           conversation. Beth is buttering a piece of bread. She loudly 
           drops the knife on her plate and buries her head in her 
           hands.

                                 BETH
                        I can’t do this. I just can’t.

           Celeste is genuinely concerned about her friend.

                                 CELESTE
                        Are you okay? Oh no...

                                 BETH
                        It’s just not right. I can’t hold 
                        my tongue. We can’t do this 
                        anymore.
                                 CELESTE
                        Honey, weddings are stressful, I 
                        know all about it. But you guys 
                        we’ll be fine!

                                 BETH
                        NO. WE are fine. What the fuck are 
                        YOU TWO doing??

           Jesse and Celeste look at Beth in amazement.

                                 CELESTE
                        What do you mean?

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah, what do you mean?

                                  BETH
                        What do I mean??  You guys are not 
                        together anymore! This is not 
                        normal! You’ve been separated for 
                        SIX MONTHS and you hang out every 
                        day like nothing’s wrong! It’s 
                        fucking weird!

                                 TUCKER
                        Beth...

                                 BETH
                        No, Tucker, you think it’s weird 
                        too. Speak up for yourself.

                                 TUCKER
                        It’s weird. Let’s not play charades 
                        anymore.

                                 CELESTE
                        No charades. We are separated and 
                        we’re friends. You guys should be 
                        happy, all we did was fight before.

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah, you guys should be thrilled 
                        about this. You’ll never have to 
                        pick sides.

                                 CELESTE
                        Yeah, everyone’s cool.

                                 BETH
                        Everyone is not cool! This is not 
                        cool!  It’s just not working for 
                        me, I’m sorry.
           Beth gets up and walks out. Celeste and Jesse sit there and 
           stare at Tucker in silence.

                                 JESSE
                        Bett iz zo angry.

                                 CELESTE
                        Yah, she iz uber angry. Yahhh.

                                 TUCKER
                        Yeah, you guys are weird. I can’t 
                        do this. It’s fucked up.

           Tucker gets up and leaves. Jesse and Celeste watch him leave 
           and sip their wine quietly.

           INT. TOYOTA PRIUS-NIGHT-LATER

           Celeste drives and Jesse is in the passenger seat.  He has a 
           tube of Vaseline Lip Therapy. He is stroking it rapidly as if 
           it were a penis. This is not the first time.

                                 JESSE
                        C, look...uhhhh!

           Celeste looks at him. She joins in. She reaches over and 
           pushes in on the tube. Vaseline comes out of the top.  This 
           looks a lot like a penis ejaculating. 

                                 CELESTE
                        Ahhhhh! Oh god! 

           They both erupt in laughter. Even though this is the 
           thousandth time they’ve done this stupid joke, it will always 
           be funny.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Beth and Tucker are crazy.

                                 JESSE
                        Crazy.

                                 CELESTE
                        It’s not weird that we hang out.  
                        Do you think it’s weird we hang 
                        out? 

                                 JESSE
                        No, of course not. You’re my best 
                        friend.
                                 CELESTE
                        Yeah you too. I mean, we can’t not 
                        hang out. The last time we didn’t 
                        talk for longer than a week was in 
                        10th grade when you went to Space 
                        Camp Canada.

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah, that was 6 weeks of torture. 
                        I mean, the anti-gravity training 
                        was fresh but I missed you.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CELESTE’S DRIVEWAY- 10 MINUTES LATER

           Celeste and Jesse stand in the driveway of Celeste’s house. 
           There is a bit of a linger.

                                 CELESTE
                        Well, I’m exhausted.

                                 JESSE
                        Me too.

           Celeste walks to her front door with her key and Jesse heads 
           towards the side gate with his key. It is now obvious that he 
           is living in her guest house.

                                 CELESTE
                        Hey, it’s kinda chilly tonight, 
                        how’s the heat in there?

                                 JESSE
                        Oh, it’s fine. It’s fine.

           He keeps walking. He turns again to Celeste.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, sorry I’m still living here. 
                        Times are tough and money’s tight 
                        so you know...

                                 CELESTE
                        Jesse, please, you can stay here as 
                        long as you like. It’s actually 
                        really nice to have you here.

                                 JESSE
                        For me too.
                                 CELESTE
                        Oh, don’t forget, the contractor 
                        needs to get in there for 
                        measurements in the morning.

                                 JESSE
                        Got it.

                                 CELESTE
                        Night.

                                 JESSE
                        Night. Love you.

                                 CELESTE
                        Love you too.

           INT. CELESTE’S HOUSE-MORNING

           Celeste’s morning symphony is under way. She sits in front of 
           a bowl of oatmeal, a bowl of berries, a cup of coffee, 4 
           neatly stacked newspapers, her laptop and the television 
           tuned to CNN.  She methodically eats, sips her coffee, reads 
           the paper, watches TV, and surfs the internet. She is clearly 
           a methodical culture vulture. Jesse walks by outside and does 
           the “C and J” sign to Celeste. She does it back 
           instinctively. Is it weird that we hang out so much? She 
           shakes it off and chortles. She’s being ridiculous; it’s 
           fine.

           INT. COFFEE BEAN- MORNING

           Celeste walks in dressed impeccably. Again, in all black.  
           She is in a rush, on her Blackberry, bombarded with a hefty 
           pre-work crowd. People are in some semblance of a line, 
           waiting to order. Celeste spots a man in a business suit, 
           taking advantage of the confusion and cutting in front of a 
           woman at the head of the line. He orders.

                                 BUSINESS MAN
                        Large coffee, please.

                                 CELESTE
                        Excuse me, sir?

           The business man pretends to not hear her.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Sir? You?

           She taps him on the arm. He turns around.
                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        You do realize that you just cut in 
                        front of a lot of people.

                                 BUSINESS MAN
                        Oh. Sorry, I didn’t know.

                                 CELESTE
                        Did you not?

                                 BUSINESS MAN
                        I’m in a rush.

                                 CELESTE
                        So you did know. And everyone’s in 
                        a rush, so...

           Other people in line are now paying attention. Celeste wants 
           to let it go, but she can’t.

                                 BUSINESS MAN
                        Well, she was looking at the 
                        pastries, I didn’t think she was 
                        ready to order.

                                 CELESTE
                        Well, it’s not just her. It’s 
                        everyone behind her too. So, if you 
                        want to ask all these people if 
                        it’s okay to cut in front of them 
                        because you are late, be my guest. 
                        Just don’t assume that your time is 
                        more important than everyone 
                        else’s.

           The business man gets his coffee.

                                 BUSINESS MAN
                        Have a nice day.

                                 CELESTE
                        (sotto) Prick.

           INT. POP FORM CONFERENCE ROOM-MORNING

           Pop Form Headquarters looks like the future. No walls, just 
           large glass slabs, separate the offices from each other. 

           Celeste is on camera, in the middle of conducting a live 
           satellite interview for MSNBC. 
                                 CELESTE 
                        Yeah, I think buyers will gravitate 
                        towards products they need more 
                        than the ones they want. There will 
                        be a lot of home-cooked meals and 
                        DVD watching in sweat pants. 
                        “Staycations,” I call them. It 
                        could be the end of aspirational 
                        shopping. For now, at least.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MSNBC STUDIOS 

           Rachel Maddow is conducting the interview in studio.

                                 RACHEL MADDOW
                        Sounds cozy but depressing. How 
                        will the conglomerates deal with 
                        the loss of their faithful sheep? 
                        Will we finally see the 
                        gazillionaires shut down shop?

                                 CELESTE
                        Well, no, companies will just have 
                        to find a new way to reach their 
                        target buyers, to appeal to a more 
                        acute, minimal sense of culture. 

                                 RACHEL MADDOW
                        Okay, thanks for being with us 
                        today. You’re great, come back any 
                        time. For more on this gloomy but 
                        interesting subject, look out for 
                        trend forecaster, Celeste James’ 
                        new book “Shitegeist,” on 
                        bookshelves Monday.

                                 CELESTE
                        Thanks so much, Rachel.

           INT. CELESTE’S OFFICE-AFTERNOON

           Celeste’s office is impeccably clean and stark. Celeste eats 
           a macrobiotic meal.

           SCOTT, 48, Celeste’s boss, gay but very straight, sharply 
           dressed and bespectacled. He peeks his head in without 
           knocking. 
                                 SCOTT
                        I know this isn’t going to be your 
                        favorite conversation but I signed 
                        Riley Banks today.

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh no. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I know but it’s a huge account. 
                        Riley is having a hard time 
                        transitioning from teen pop star to 
                        adult artist. Her futile attempt to 
                        sex herself into womanhood was, 
                        shockingly, a failure.  Her last 
                        album, “I Know What I Want” was a 
                        colossal bomb. 

           He hands Celeste his laptop. It is streaming a music video 
           starring Riley Banks, 19, making orgasmic faces in a wet 
           neglige, straddling a spouting fire hydrant.

                                 CELESTE
                        Subtle. She’s a genius.

                                 SCOTT
                        She is re-launching her clothing 
                        line and she wants us to brand it. 
                        We need to take this account.

           Scott turns to go and looks back at Celeste, looking lonely, 
           eating her meal. He studies her, and kind of feels bad for 
           her. Then:

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Are you dating yet?

                                 CELESTE
                        Dating is ridiculous. But I’m still 
                        totally on track for my 25 year 
                        plan.

                                 SCOTT
                        No one has a 25 year plan. Except 
                        for my mortgage company.

                                 CELESTE
                        First child at 33. Second at 35. 
                        Which means I will only be 56 at my 
                        eldest’s college graduation. The 
                        bad news is that I may not be at my 
                        4th grandchild’s high school 
                        graduation. But that’s okay, I 
                        guess.
                                 SCOTT
                        I’m fascinated with the mentally 
                        ill. 

                                 CELESTE
                        I still have two more years to meet 
                        the guy, get married and get 
                        pregnant. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Well, do me a favor and get your 
                        fuck on before you meet this guy.

           Celeste looks at Scott in shock.

                                 CELESTE
                        What are you doing?

                                 SCOTT
                        Sorry, I was trying to be your 
                        saucy gay friend. It didn’t feel 
                        good. 

                                 CELESTE
                        Yeah don’t.

           EXT. YOGA YURT-AFTERNOON

           Jesse and SKILLZ, 32, another man-boy, in hip-hop gear, wait 
           in a very, very long line of very, very hip people at LA’s 
           trendiest new yogurt place.

                                 SKILLZ
                        The economic climate is real bad, 
                        man. And I think my business is 
                        taking the hardest hit of all. It’s 
                        brutal. And no one’s talking about 
                        it.

                                 JESSE
                        You sell pot.

                                 SKILLZ
                        Not for long, dude. Have you been 
                        to those weed pharmacies? They’re 
                        killing me. I gotta branch out. 
                        Maybe start working in 
                        methamphetamines? Or maybe teach 
                        pre-school. I always wanted to do 
                        that. I love kids.

           Skillz is distracted by something.
                                 SKILLZ (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, I know this is serious talky 
                        time but would you look at the 
                        fucking seat on that girl?

           We see a girl’s apple bottom butt stuffed into blue jeans.

                                 SKILLZ (CONT’D)
                        THAT is a party. 

           Jesse does not laugh. He looks like he is in pain.

                                 JESSE
                        I don’t think it’s over.

                                 SKILLZ
                        What?  Her butt? No, it will never 
                        be over. It goes on forever. It’s 
                        like space. So great.

                                 JESSE
                        No, Celeste and me. I think she’s 
                        bugging right now about a bunch of 
                        stuff. But she’ll come around.

                                 SKILLZ
                        Uh oh. It’s been a while now.  I 
                        think it’s over, bro. It may be 
                        time to accept that.

                                 JESSE
                        How ‘bout you look out for you and 
                        I’ll look out for me.

                                 SKILLZ
                        Okay, don’t get spicy with me. I 
                        just love you and I’m trying to 
                        help. 

                                 JESSE
                        I know, thank you. But I know what 
                        I’m doing.

                                 SKILLZ
                        Okay, but remember, you can’t re-
                        heat a souffle. And don’t forget, 
                        there’s Bettys everywhere. It’s LA.

                                 JESSE
                        (sotto) Celeste would lose her mind 
                        if I took a girl out. 

           They reach the front of the line.
                                 YOGURT GIRL
                        Do you know what you want?

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah, I want to not be a quitter. I 
                        don’t want to start all over again. 
                        I want everything that I believed 
                        to have been true to be true. I 
                        also want a goji berry/green tea 
                        swirl with yogurt chips and Fruity 
                        Pebbles. Please.

                                 SKILLZ
                        (to Yogurt Girl) Hey, you should go 
                        out on a date with my friend here.

                                 YOGURT GIRL
                        Um, wait, where’s your wife? You 
                        guys are here like everyday 
                        together.

                                 JESSE
                        Well...we’re separated.

                                 YOGURT GIRL
                        Oh. Cool. I mean, bummer. But okay. 
                        I’ll go.

           INT. LACMA-LATE AFTERNOON

           Celeste and Beth wander amidst the modern art. They stop to 
           take in a Cindy Sherman photo.

                                 BETH
                        It’s so...grotesque.

                                 CELESTE
                        But kind of beautiful. In a 
                        grotesque way. 

                                 BETH
                        Ugh, let’s keep moving. Too many 
                        feelings.  

           Celeste and Beth wander to the wall and stare at a Damien 
           Hirst collage. 

                                 BETH (CONT’D)
                        I need to say this and then I’ll 
                        never bring it up again. I’m sorry 
                        I wigged on you guys the other 
                        night but I don’t know what you’re 
                        doing. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BETH (CONT’D)
                        I think it’s stupid that you’re not 
                        together. You are best friends and 
                        that’s the hard part. Nothing else 
                        matters.

           Celeste and Beth stand in silence. Then:

                                 CELESTE
                        Beth, I love Jesse. But he’s not in 
                        the forecast.

                                 BETH
                        Oh god, really? No forecast.

                                 CELESTE
                        Yes, forecast, Beth. The reality is 
                        I love him dearly but he doesn’t 
                        have a checking account. Or dress 
                        shoes. The father of my children 
                        will have a car. But...Jesse will 
                        always be my best friend.

                                 BETH
                        Well, if that’s the case, you need 
                        time apart.  I think hanging out 
                        with him is kind of breaking his 
                        heart. Slowly.  Can I show you 
                        something?

                                 CELESTE
                        Sure.

           Beth suddenly pulls Celeste into a corner. With no art.

                                 BETH
                        Okay. Look.

           She points to her neck.

                                 CELESTE
                        What am I looking at?

                                 BETH
                        It’s a hair. On my NECK.

                                 CELESTE
                        Ewww. Will you get that thing 
                        lasered off, please? What the fuck?

                                 BETH
                        I can’t because it will pop up 
                        somewhere else where I can’t keep 
                        my eye on it.
                                 CELESTE
                        Are you serious? That’s the 
                        craziest thing I’ve ever heard. 
                        It’s not a turnip.

                                 BETH
                        Trust me, I know my body. It’s a 
                        cruel land mine.

                                 CELESTE
                        Okay, well at least pluck it for 
                        Chrissake.

                                 BETH
                        I should, at least before my 
                        wedding, right?

                                 CELESTE
                        What is wrong with you? 

           Celeste grabs the hair and pulls it out.

                                 BETH 
                        (in pain) AHHHHHHHHHH!

           A security guard heads for them.

                                 CELESTE
                        Sorry sir, my friend has a really 
                        strong emotional reaction to modern 
                        art. 

                                 BETH
                        That was fucking rude.

                                 CELESTE
                        Had to be done. 

           EXT. CELESTE’S HOUSE-EARLY EVENING

           Celeste comes in the front door. Jesse is pasted to the 
           couch, he’s clearly been there for hours. He is watching the 
           2008 Beijing Olympics on Tivo. He is at the end of one of 
           those Olympian short documentaries about Matthias Steiner, a 
           gold medalist in weight lifting.

                                 CELESTE
                        Hey...are you watching the 
                        Olympics? Again? And crying? Again?

           Jesse blows his nose.
                                 JESSE
                        Yeah.

                                 CELESTE
                        God, you really love that, don’t 
                        you?

                                 JESSE
                        Matthias’ wife died in a car 
                        accident last year. 

                                 CELESTE
                        Well, three years ago now but...

                                 JESSE
                        And he dedicated his gold medal to 
                        her.  The human spirit 
                        is...unbreakable.

           Jesse is choked up, can barely speak.

                                 CELESTE
                        Uh huh.

           Jesse turns off the television, takes a deep breath, wipes 
           his eyes and recovers.

                                 JESSE
                        Celeste, can you sit down for a 
                        minute? I have something really 
                        important to tell you.

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh. Okay.

           Celeste sits. Jesse sits next to her. Again, he has tears in 
           his eyes.

                                 JESSE
                        I don’t know how to tell you this 
                        but...I have a date tonight. I’m 
                        gonna start dating...people. 

                                 CELESTE
                        A date? Really?  That is so great. 

                                 JESSE
                        It is?

                                 CELESTE
                        Yeah! Don’t cry. Good for you, 
                        Jess.
                                 JESSE
                        It is? Yeah, I guess it is. It’s 
                        actually the Yogurt Girl. From Yoga 
                        Yurt?

                                 CELESTE
                        Really? Yogurt Girl, huh. She’s 
                        cute! But so young, right?

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah but I’m trying, you know, just 
                        getting...

                                 CELESTE
                        No, no, no this is so good. You 
                        gotta crawl before you walk. I mean 
                        she’s definitely not gonna be wifey 
                        number two, right? Ha.

           She hugs him in an unconsciously patronizing way.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Big move. I’m proud of you. 

           Jesse looks confused and slightly hurt.

                                 JESSE
                        Thanks?

                                 CELESTE
                        Can I get up now?

                                 JESSE
                        Huh? Yeah, sure.

           Celeste gets up and is immediately fixated by his hair.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, Skillz kinda made me do it 
                        and at first I was like no way and 
                        then I...what are you looking at?

                                 CELESTE
                        No, nothing. Are you gonna wear 
                        your hair like that?

                                 JESSE
                        What? Oh. I don’t know, is it 
                        weird?

                                 CELESTE
                        Not weird, just different from how 
                        it looks best.
           She walks over and starts messing with his hair as he 
           continues.

                                 JESSE
                        Anyway, this is what we’re doing 
                        right? We’re getting divorced and 
                        we’re friends and we’re also dating 
                        people? That’s what we’re doing?

           She is satisfied with her work. She steps back.

                                 CELESTE
                        There. Better. You’ll be great. You 
                        don’t even need to be great. Just 
                        be you. Take her somewhere nice.

                                 JESSE
                        Okay mom.

                                 CELESTE
                        Call me after?

           INT. HATFIELD’S RESTAURANT-NIGHT

           Jesse is on a date with Yogurt girl. It’s clear he’s hasn’t 
           been doing a lot of talking.

                                 YOGURT GIRL
                        So I was in school but then I 
                        dropped out because I really wanted 
                        to work in fashion but it’s really 
                        hard to find a paid internship? So 
                        I went back to school and now I 
                        work at Yoga Yurt part time but I’m 
                        really looking to make money doing 
                        something I love? But I’m sure the 
                        universe is looking out for me and 
                        when the time is right, the right 
                        thing will come along, you know?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CELESTE’S BEDROOM- NIGHT

           Celeste is in bed on the computer. She hears noise from the 
           outside. She listens more intently and hears Jesse... and a 
           woman, giggling and talking loudly. Then, the door shuts. Is 
           Yogurt Girl sleeping over? He wouldn’t do that. Would he?
           EXT. CELESTE’S GARDEN- NEXT MORNING

           Again, with the morning symphony. Celeste drinks coffee, eats 
           breakfast, surfs the internet and flips through magazines. 
           She is doing research on Riley Banks. A candid paparazzi shot 
           of Riley leaving a club drunk, her crotch is blurred out, a 
           gossip article with the heading “Riley in Love! Again!” with 
           a picture of Riley furiously making out with a guy, an 
           article on how Riley’s clothing line sales have plummeted 
           since she has become a tabloid staple.

           Celeste can’t stop herself from constantly looking over at 
           the guest house to see if Yogurt Girl is still in there.  
           Finally, a sleeping Jesse stirs for a minute and changes 
           position. He is alone. Phew.

           INT. BORDER’S BOOKS-LATER THAT DAY

           Celeste, Beth, Tucker and Jesse browse as a foursome for 
           books.

                                 CELESTE
                        Where is it? They told me it would 
                        be in new releases...

           Celeste searches frantically for her book. She peeks around a 
           corner at a very obscured aisle with a sign reading “More New 
           Releases.”  Three copies of her book, “Shitegeist” appear in 
           the very bottom row, barely visible. She is disappointed. 

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        That’s what I call placement.

           She grabs a copy of her book and briskly walks back to the 
           front of the store. 

                                 BETH
                        Well you probably shouldn’t steal 
                        it. Even if it is yours.

           Celeste marches to the Oprah’s Book Club table and swiftly 
           replaces the center display book with her own.

                                 CELESTE
                        There.

                                 BETH
                        But you don’t have the “O” on your 
                        cover, you can’t do that!

                                 CELESTE
                        Yes I can.
           Jesse and Tucker arrive and see the book.

                                 JESSE
                        There you guys are...you’re on 
                        Oprah’s Book List?? That’s so dope!

           Celeste smiles at Beth in victory. Then:

                                 GIRL (V.O.)
                        Jesse?

           The four of them turn to see VERONICA, 26, stunning and 
           European.

                                 JESSE
                        Veronica?

                                 VERONICA
                        Yeah, hey. How are you?

                                 JESSE
                        Good, good.

           There is silence, as the group stares at her. Who is this 
           creature??

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Oh sorry, Veronica, this is Beth 
                        and Tucker and Celeste.

           Veronica notices Celeste’s name on the book.

                                 VERONICA
                        Oh, this is your book? I read an 
                        excerpt online, it’s really 
                        compelling.

                                 CELESTE
                        Wow, thank you. That is so nice.

                                 VERONICA
                        Well, nice to see you, Jesse. You 
                        look great.

                                 JESSE
                        Oh you too. Take care.

           She turns and leaves.

                                 CELESTE
                        She is so great. Who is that? 

                                 JESSE
                        That was uh...Veronica.
                                 CELESTE
                        Story?

                                 JESSE
                        No story. Just this girl I met a 
                        while ago.

                                 CELESTE
                        I really like her.

           Celeste changes focus and turns to a Border’s employee to 
           loudly and unconvincingly acts out “interested reader” for 
           other shoppers to hear.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        EXCUSE ME SIR? WHERE CAN I FIND 
                        MORE COPIES OF THIS BOOK 
                        “SHITEGEIST” FOR MY FRIENDS? I 
                        HEARD IT IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!

           He looks at her like she’s crazy and keeps walking. And so do 
           her friends.

           EXT. TROUBADOR THEATER-NIGHT

           Jesse and Skillz are exiting a Bizmarkie concert, surrounded 
           by older hip-hop fans and young hipsters who weren’t alive 
           when the Biz dropped his first album. They are trashed.

                                 JESSE 
                        Oh baby youuuuuuuu, you got what I 
                        neeeeeed...

                                 SKILLZ
                        And you say he’s just a friend, and 
                        you say he’s just a friend....

                           JESSE
                                                         SKILLZ
           Oh baby youuuuu....
                                              Oh baby youuuuu....

           Jesse’s iPhone rings. A very flirty picture of Celeste comes 
           up.

                                 SKILLZ (CONT’D)
                        No, no, no. Ignore for sure.

                                 JESSE
                        Uh, I just need to...(picks up) 
                        Hey.

                                 SKILLZ
                        (whispering) Nooooo!
                                 JESSE
                        (talking to Celeste) Uh huh. Okay. 
                        Okay. No, I’m not busy. (hangs up) 
                        Uh, can you drop me off at home?

                                 SKILLS
                        Come on, after the show it’s the 
                        after party.

                                 JESSE 
                        There’s an Ikea dresser that she 
                        needs me to “build.”

           Skillz takes this in. He is impressed.

                                 SKILLZ
                        Huh. Really? Are you guys...

                                 JESSE
                        I told you pal, I know what I’m 
                        know I’m doing. She just needed 
                        time.

           INT. CELESTE’S HOUSE-NIGHT

           Celeste is in a corner with a glass of wine and a HUGE bag of 
           nuts and bolts. She had a fight with a dresser and the 
           dresser won. Jesse uses his key and enters.

                                 CELESTE
                        I’m in here! Fuck Sweden!

                                 JESSE
                        Oh baby youuuuu....

                                 CELESTE
                        It was definitely easier to build 
                        the Brooklyn Bridge, I think.

                                 JESSE
                        Well, how hard can it be? It’s a 
                        dresser, right?

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           INT. CELESTE’S HOUSE- 30 MINUTES LATER

           Jesse is drunker than before and sitting where Celeste was 
           earlier. Crying, frustrated. He’s covered in sawdust and nuts 
           and bolts.
                                 JESSE
                        Fuck me!!! Do you think they 
                        intentionally pick a random piece 
                        of furniture to make totally 
                        unbuildable, just to fuck with 
                        you??!

                                 CELESTE
                        Thank you!

                                 JESSE
                        Wait. I got it.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           INT. CELESTE’S HOUSE- 30 MORE MINUTES LATER

           We see Jesse and Celeste admire their “dresser” as they drink 
           wine.

                                 CELESTE
                        Perfect.

                                 JESSE
                        Fucking lay-up.

           We reveal that they are looking at a small, mangled, Swedish 
           robot constructed from the nuts and bolts and wood panelling 
           that was should have been the dresser. They both slide to the 
           floor in satisfaction. They look at their “artwork.” They 
           laugh; they are pretty drunk.

                                 CELESTE
                        Ruscha meets Basquiat meets Serra 
                        meets...

                                 JESSE
                        ...Corky from “Life Goes On.”

                                 CELESTE
                        Yeah. He’s a vegan, you know.

                                 JESSE
                        Cherish. That is so cute.

           They share a laugh. 

                                 CELESTE
                        You’re cute.
           Celeste looks at him. She kisses him. He kisses back. It gets 
           hotter. They fall back.

                                                               FADE TO:

           CELESTE’S BEDROOM-THE NEXT MORNING

           Celeste and Jesse are in bed.  Celeste is asleep. Jesse wakes 
           up and gently kisses Celeste all over her face. This wakes 
           her up. She is hungover and confused.

                                 CELESTE
                        Hey. What are you doing?

                                 JESSE
                        I love you.

           Celeste does not respond.  She pops up out of bed.

                                 CELESTE
                        Okay...

                                 JESSE
                        We should talk about this.

                                 CELESTE
                        Yeah. Whoa, we were drunk. What a 
                        bad idea. I’m sorry.

                                 JESSE
                        Don’t be sorry. It was nice. And I 
                        love you.

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh Jess, I don’t...come on, we were 
                        drunk, and the dresser and I 
                        thought...you’re dating other 
                        people!

                                 JESSE
                        Only to...make you care.

           He realizes how pathetic it sounds. 

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh no, I thought...

                                 JESSE
                        You thought what?

                                 CELESTE
                        Well, clearly I wasn’t thinking. Or 
                        I wouldn’t have let it happen. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CELESTE (CONT'D)
                        Come on Jess, we’re not getting 
                        back together, you didn’t think...

           Celeste realizes he did think...Jesse is crushed. He gets up 
           and leaves. He turns.

                                 JESSE
                        You know, there’s a guy that you 
                        can call, from Ikea, that will 
                        build you’re dresser. You should 
                        call him. Hell, he’ll probably fuck 
                        you too. I’m a fucking idiot.

                                 CELESTE
                        Jess! No, I didn’t..Jess!

           Celeste collapses back in the bed.

           INT. EQUINOX GYM-MORNING

           A bunch of Los Angeles hipsters file out of a yoga class. 
           Everyone is sweaty and a little out of it. Celeste heads out 
           as she towels off. She heads towards the shoe cubby holes.

                                 PAUL
                        Hello.

                                 CELESTE
                        What?

                                 PAUL
                        I said hello.

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh. Hi.

           Celeste keeps walking briskly. Paul tries to keep up with 
           her.

                                 PAUL
                        (a little too loud) How was your 
                        practice?

                                 CELESTE
                        My practice?? It was...wait, 
                        what?...it was fine. (who is this 
                        guy?)

                                 PAUL
                        I see you in class a lot. You have 
                        a great warrior two. Are you 
                        single?
           Celeste puts on her shoes.

                                 CELESTE
                        Are you really doing this right 
                        now? You’re really doing this right 
                        now.

                                 PAUL
                        So, what do you do?

                                 CELESTE
                        Just gonna jump right into huh. 
                        Wow, Captain Conversation.

                                 PAUL
                        Paul. Here’s my card.

                                 CELESTE
                        You bring cards to yoga??

                                 PAUL
                        You never know who you’re gonna 
                        meet. 

           He smiles.

                                 CELESTE
                        (sotto) Wow. (she looks at the 
                        card.) A financial analyst. Cool. 

                                 PAUL
                        Did you tell me what you did for a 
                        living?

                                 CELESTE
                        No, no I didn’t. 

           There is a pause in conversation. Celeste continues to put 
           her shoes on.

                                 PAUL
                        Well, will you? I’d love to know.

                                 CELESTE
                        I’m a trend forecaster. I forecast 
                        trends.

           Paul scoffs at the notion that this is a real career.

                                 PAUL
                        Trend forecaster. Really?

           They have reached the parking lot. Celeste turns to him with 
           purpose.
                                 CELESTE
                        You traded in your Porsche for an 
                        Audi because the economy is tanking 
                        and you’re afraid you’ll lose your 
                        job soon. You bought a Samsung cell 
                        phone because you think it makes 
                        you seem more “business-oriented,” 
                        unlike the iPhone which is for 
                        teenage girls. You go to yoga 
                        because you went to a sub Ivy 
                        League college, spent the last ten 
                        years working long weeks and 
                        drinking all weekend and you feel 
                        like it’s time to do something 
                        “spiritual.”  Nice to meet you, 
                        (looks at the card) Paul.

           Celeste walks away. Paul remains where he is, flummoxed.

           EXT. CELESTE’S GARDEN-LATER

           Celeste enters through her side gate. She has some Chinese 
           food takeout in her hand. She heads for the guest house. She 
           sees that Jesse is not there. Neither is any of his shit. 
           He’s gone. 

           EXT. LAX-LATER THAT NIGHT

           Celeste is about to go on the road for work. She is on the 
           phone.

                                 CELESTE
                        No, just make sure the San Fran 
                        focus group has a little more 
                        diversity than last time. It was 
                        like a rave. Without drugs. Okay. 

           She hangs up and pauses. Then dials again.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Jess, it’s me. I’m getting on 
                        a plane but I’d really like to talk 
                        to you. I don’t know what happened 
                        last night. Hope you’re okay.  Call 
                        me.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Celeste looks off into the city and thinks. 
           INT. FANEUIL HALL-DAY 

           We see Celeste having lunch with a group of eight teenagers. 
           She asks questions, they share laughs, she engages with them. 
           She is good at this. She excuses herself to make a phone 
           call.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DOWNTOWN L.A. DINER-LATE AFTERNOON

           Jesse sits at a booth with a girl eating pie. We don’t see 
           her face but we see him genuinely happy. He’s on a good old-
           fashioned date. He laughs and talks.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SAN FRANCISCO W HOTEL ROOM-NIGHT

           Celeste watches CNN alone. She dials Jesse. She gets his 
           voice mail.

                                 CELESTE
                        Hey. It’s me. Again. I miss you.  
                        Anyway, call me. Okay. Bye.

           She hangs up, takes a breath and then, to herself:

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        We should be together. We’re right 
                        together. Celeste and Jesse 
                        Forever, right?

           She chuckles.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Of course.

           EXT. STREET - WEST HOLLYWOOD-DAY

           Jesse is walking.

                                 JESSE
                        (on the phone) Hey. You’re back. I 
                        want to talk to you.

           INT. CELESTE’S HOUSE-SUNDOWN

           Celeste is in her home office, working on the Riley account.
                                 CELESTE
                        Yeah, I want to talk to you too. 
                        Where have you been?? It’s been 
                        more two weeks. So much to lay 
                        down...like, did you know that pay-
                        per-view porn is available in 
                        Spanish?

           EXT. STREET-WEST HOLLYWOOD-SUNDOWN

                                 JESSE
                        Like subtitles or dubbed? Wait, 
                        actually, I’m really close to your 
                        house right now.  Can I come by for 
                        a minute? It’s....important.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CELESTE’S HOUSE-NIGHT

           Celeste puts away groceries.

                                 JESSE
                        Okay. I have to tell you something.

                                 CELESTE
                        Me too. Wait, you first. Are you 
                        gay?

                                 JESSE
                        No, not gay. 

           He takes a really deep breath.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Um, you’re not gonna believe this 
                        but...

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh no, did you go on another date? 

                                 JESSE
                        I’m having a baby.

                                 CELESTE
                        I don’t understand.

                                 JESSE
                        I’m having a baby.

           Celeste is still busy with putting away groceries. She is 
           half-listening.
                                 CELESTE
                        What do you mean?

                                 JESSE
                        I am having a baby.

           Celeste opens the pantry and puts away cereal.

                                 CELESTE
                        With another person?

                                 JESSE
                        Yes. With another person.

           Celeste takes out cold cuts from the bag and opens the 
           fridge.

                                 CELESTE
                        Um. What? Sorry, I’m confused. 
                        Wait, what? What the fuck? With 
                        whom?

                                 JESSE
                        With Veronica.

                                 CELESTE
                        Veronica?? What’s a Veronica?

                                 JESSE
                        You actually met her. That day at 
                        the book store.

                                 CELESTE
                        Huh.  But that’s not even 
                        physically possible, that was two 
                        weeks ago.

                                 JESSE
                        Well, the truth is, I slept with 
                        Veronica three months ago. It was 
                        just a one night thing. But she’s 
                        pregnant.

           Celeste rearranges the fruit bowl.

                                 CELESTE
                        Whoa. Okay. Shit. Didn’t know about 
                        that.  But that’s not important 
                        right now. This is not good. 
                        Alright. Okay. You and I are gonna 
                        deal with this. We will, we’ll just 
                        have to. What do you need me to do?
                                 JESSE
                        No, you don’t have to do anything.

                                 CELESTE
                        But you don’t even know this 
                        person, right?

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah I know her. I mean, I’m 
                        getting to know her. And I think I 
                        might love her.

                                 CELESTE
                        Love her?? You slept with her once, 
                        how could you love her? You don’t 
                        love her.

                                 JESSE
                        I’ve actually been seeing her, 
                        well, a lot, recently. And I think 
                        I do.

                                 CELESTE
                        So what you're saying is you got a 
                        girl pregnant and now you think you 
                        love her because she’s pregnant? 
                        Or...I’m really confused.

                                 JESSE
                        The universe is fucking weird, 
                        Celeste. I slept with her months 
                        ago and never called her after. But 
                        we started hanging recently and she 
                        told me she was pregnant with my 
                        child.  I know it’s crazy, but it 
                        just felt...right.  It was like a 
                        this really weird retroactive gift. 
                        I don’t know...

                                 CELESTE
                        Can you excuse me for a second? 

           Celeste gets up and walks slowly to the bathroom. She gently 
           shuts the door. She looks around, not knowing what to do with 
           herself. She focuses on a crack in the wall, she looks closer 
           and then grabs the wall, thinking she might faint. She 
           silently begins to sob, mouth open, eyes shut tight. She 
           collapses on the wall. She is in silent turmoil. Is this 
           really happening?

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CELESTE’S LIVING ROOM- A MOMENT LATER

           Jesse is sitting, waiting. He checks his cell phone. He hears 
           the toilet flush. A moment goes by.  Celeste re-enters, 
           having pulled it together. Her face is wet with tears.

                                 CELESTE
                        So sorry about that. I had 
                        something in my eye.

                                 JESSE
                        Uh huh.

                                 CELESTE
                        (convincing herself) Well....wow, 
                        Jesse. That’s great! I just want 
                        you to be happy. I’m so happy for 
                        you!

                                 JESSE
                        Well, Celeste, you don’t have to be 
                        happy for me right now. I know this 
                        is weird. But I just wanted you to 
                        know that who I am, where I am now, 
                        is because of you.  You taught me 
                        how to love. Thank you.

                                 CELESTE
                        Wonderful.

                                 JESSE
                        Sorry, I’ve been going on forever. 
                        You had something you wanted to 
                        tell me, right? What’s up?

           Celeste takes a beat.

                                 CELESTE
                        It was nothing.

           She forces a smile.

           INT. CELESTE’S OFFICE-DAY

           Celeste has put a treadmill in her office. She is currently 
           running at a 6.6, with her Blackberry in hand, a coffee in 
           the cup holder and the television on. Scott peeks in.

                                 SCOTT
                        Hello?
                                 CELESTE
                        Hi!! Sorry, just trying to get some 
                        stuff done.

                                 SCOTT
                        Clearly.

                                 CELESTE
                        What’s up??

                                 SCOTT
                        I just wanted to check on you, you 
                        didn’t call me back last night. How 
                        was your trip?

                                 CELESTE
                        It was great. Sorry, Jesse actually 
                        came over last night.

                                 SCOTT
                        Oh yeah, how is he?

                                 CELESTE
                        Good, actually. He came over to 
                        tell me that he met someone and 
                        she’s pregnant. Crazy, right?

                                 SCOTT
                        Whoa. Wow. How did you not know he 
                        was seeing someone?

                                 CELESTE
                        It’s some girl he slept with once a 
                        couple of months ago. And now 
                        they’re in love! Go figure!

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t know what to say. I am so 
                        sorry, Celeste.

                                 CELESTE
                        No need, Scott, I’m totally fine!

                                 SCOTT
                        You are not.

                                 CELESTE
                        Look, it was bound to happen at 
                        some point, so why not now? 
                                 SCOTT
                        Well, it’s great that you’re being 
                        so understanding but it’s also okay 
                        for you to have feelings about 
                        this. 

           Celeste, on the treadmill, pauses to consider this.

                                 CELESTE
                        Well, let me see...mmmm, nope, I’m 
                        fine. No feelings. I promise. Not 
                        in love with him anymore. It kind 
                        of makes it easier.

           Scott looks at Celeste as if she has four heads.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        I actually have a date tonight.

                                 SCOTT 
                        Um...that’s great. Who’s the guy?

                                 CELESTE
                        The yahoo that did our taxes last 
                        quarter. He really likes me. Not 
                        the one, but it’s nice to be 
                        admired.

                                 SCOTT
                        I agree, go be admired. Who knows, 
                        you may actually even simulate 
                        human emotion.

           INT. CELESTE HOUSE-EARLY EVENING

           Celeste, still in workout clothes, is cleaning up her house 
           maniacally. She is walking past her office. The Ikea robot 
           she built with Jesse catches her attention for a moment. Then 
           she keeps walking.

           INT. MADEO’S RESTAURANT-NIGHT

           Celeste and MAX, 38, handsome and clean cut, are sitting at 
           dinner. They have just ordered.

                                 CELESTE
                        Thank you.

           She hands the menu back to the waiter. 
                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        My foot actually pronates. And my t-
                        band is strained when I run, which 
                        really hurts. So Dr. Ozar 
                        recommended a foot specialist who 
                        made these customized orthotics for 
                        me and it’s amazing how much better 
                        I feel.

                                 MAX
                        Well, actually I...

                                 CELESTE
                        Did you see 60 Minutes this past 
                        Sunday? There was the most 
                        incredible segment on a new machine 
                        that reads brainwaves and helps 
                        people in comas communicate...

                                 MAX
                        Oh, no I didn’t but that sounds...

           Suddenly, Celeste catches a glimpse of Jesse, sitting at the 
           bar, by himself, watching tv. She is not prepared for this.

                                 CELESTE
                        OH MY GOD. My ex is here. Oh god, 
                        oh no, we just made eye contact. 
                        Maybe he didn’t see me. Wait, he 
                        did.  He’s coming over. Oh god, 
                        this is so awkward, what am I 
                        supposed to say?? (to Max) You 
                        should probably leave.

                                 MAX
                        Wait, what? I don’t think...really?

           Celeste immediately digs into her salad which has just

           EXT. MADEO’S RESTAURANT-NIGHT

           Celeste and Max wait for their cars at the valet stand. Max’s 
           car arrives. He pays the valet.

                        This was great! I’m free next

                        Oh, because of the mercury

                        No, I think you may need some time. 
                        To get over, you know, your 
                        divorce. It took me a long time to 
                        start dating after mine. 

                                 CELESTE
                        Thank you for your concern but I’m 
                        just fine. I guess you’re just not 
                        a match for me.

                                 MAX
                        Well, have a good night. Good luck.
           Max gets in his car and is gone. Celeste stands there, 
           confused and alone. She shakes him off.

                                 CELESTE
                        (sotto) Whatever.

           EXT. H.D. BUTTERCUP- CULVER CITY-A COUPLE WEEKS LATER

           Celeste arrives to meet Beth. She is in full marathon gear. 
           She waves at Beth and enters, panting.

                                 CELESTE
                        Hi honey!

                        Hi, wow, you are really out of 
                        breath. Did you fucking run here?? 
                        from West Hollywood??

                                 CELESTE
                        Yeah I ran. Just started. It’s 
                        really fun.

                                 BETH
                        You’re soaking wet. Isn’t that like 
                        12 miles??

                                 CELESTE
                        13.5 actually. I was just clearing 
                        my head, you know, keeping the 
                        endorphins up.

           Celeste pants like she’s about to collapse. She doubles over 
           with her hands on her knees. She’s in pain.

                                 BETH
                        Do you...want to sit down?

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh, okay! Wow, is this it? It’s so 
                        nice.

           Celeste flops on the couch full prostrate. A saleswoman 
           approaches.

                                 SALESWOMAN
                        I’m so sorry but that’s a one-of-a-
                        kind piece that was handwoven by a 
                        tribe of Afghani women. So if you 
                        could maybe just sit over there?
           The saleswoman points to a metal industrial, uncomfortable 
           looking chair.

                                 CELESTE
                        Right. Sorry. Totally.

                                 BETH
                        Wow, you are a sweat tsunami.

                                 CELESTE
                        You should get it. It’s really 
                        pretty.

           Celeste gets up and there is an outline of Celeste’s entire 
           body in sunblock and sweat. They look at the wreckage.

                                 BETH
                        Uh boy.

                                 CELESTE
                        Don’t worry. I know people who can 
                        get that out. Easily.

                                 BETH
                        Okay. I guess I’m getting it.

           The saleswoman is ringing Beth up for the couch. It is 
           basically ruined.

                        Simple means dumb.

           folksy restaurant. Celeste is on the phone. She waves at 
           Jesse and gestures “one second.”

                                 CELESTE
                        No, I don’t want to do a video 
                        chat, this is our biggest client 
                        yet. Yeah. Just tell her she needs 
                        to get to L.A. tomorrow. Okay. (she 
                        hangs up, now on the Blackberry) 
                        Sorry, one second, I just have to 
                        send this e-mail. 

           Jesse sits there and wait for several seconds for her to 
           finish her e-mail.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        There. Hi.

                                 JESSE
                        Hi. What’s up?

                                 CELESTE
                        A lot. (to waitress) Can I get some 
                        coffee?

                                 WAITRESS
                        We have yerba matte?

                                 CELESTE
                        Um, green tea?

                                 WAITRESS
                        We have decaf green tea.

                                 CELESTE
                        Water’s fine.
                                 WAITRESS
                        K. Anything for you?

                                 JESSE
                        I’ll get the veganchilada with the 
                        cashew cheese sauce on the side. Oh 
                        can I look at the seaweed menu?

           She hands him a tiny piece of recycled paper.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Awesome. You do have the Baltic 
                        kelp today. I’ll get that. Thanks.

                                 CELESTE
                        Wow.

                                 JESSE
                        How are you? You look great.

                                 CELESTE
                        Thanks, you too. 

           She notices his feet.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Are you wearing...dress shoes?

                                 JESSE
                        Oh yeah, they’re vegan.

           Celeste could throw up.

                                 CELESTE
                        You look good too.

                                 JESSE
                        A lot of pilates. 

                                 CELESTE
                        Huh, I didn’t know you did pilates.

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah, well, Veronica’s an 
                        instructor and has a studio in her 
                        house. And I live there now, so...

           There is an uncomfortable beat.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        How’s work?

                                 CELESTE
                        Um...work is great.
                                 JESSE
                        Good.

                                 CELESTE
                        My book is getting great reviews. 
                        Riley Banks is a new client which 
                        is huge. Things are going really 
                        well.

                                 JESSE
                        Great.

           Long silence.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I know this has all been 
                        pretty weird.

                                 CELESTE
                        It’s only weird if you think it’s 
                        weird.

                                 JESSE
                        Celeste, I never wanted to hurt 
                        you.

                                 CELESTE
                        Thank you. You didn’t. Glad we 
                        cleared that up.

                                 JESSE
                        Look, I actually wanted to see you 
                        because...apparently there’s some 
                        kind of hold up on your side with 
                        the divorce papers and Veronica’s 
                        actually not a citizen so..

                                 CELESTE
                        What? Where’s she from?

                                 JESSE
                        Uh, Belgium.

                                 CELESTE
                        (sotto) Huh. Belgium. Elegant.

                                 JESSE
                        What?

                                 CELESTE
                        Nothing.
                                 JESSE
                        Point is, we need to...get married. 
                        I’m sorry.  I really need you to 
                        sign those papers. 

                                 CELESTE
                        Well, Jesse, I’ve been travelling, 
                        for work. Because some people work 
                        for a living. So I haven’t really 
                        been focused on what I can do to 
                        help you get on with your new life.

                                 JESSE
                        I’m sorry. I know.

                                 CELESTE
                        What makes you think you are even 
                        suitable to be a dad?? You don’t 
                        even know how to read the electric 
                        bill. How are you going to support 
                        yourself? Have you even thought 
                        this through? 

                                 JESSE
                        I guess I’ll have to figure it out.

           There is a long pause.

                                 CELESTE
                        We never even talked about kids.

                                 JESSE
                        You had reservations about having 
                        kids.

                                 CELESTE
                        I had reservations about having 
                        kids with YOU.

                                 JESSE
                        Well, ditto. I think Veronica will 
                        be a really good mother.

                                 CELESTE
                        Low blow.

           Celeste gets up from the table. She collects her things.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll sign the fucking papers. I  
                        don’t have time for this.  You’re 
                        ridiculous, this place is 
                        ridiculous. Fucking vegan kelp 
                        cashew bullshit. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck is this place anyway. 
                        (she addresses the restaurant) Do 
                        any of you have jobs?? Anyone? What 
                        do you do? Wait, let me guess. You 
                        grow pot. 

           Celeste looks at an innocent bespectacled patron.

                                 RESTAURANT GUY
                        Um, yeah. I do.

                                 CELESTE
                        Exactly. Get a real job.

           Celeste exits.

           INT. CELESTE’S HOUSE HALLWAY-NIGHT

           Celeste is in her robe about to get in the bath. She walks to 
           the kitchen to grab a tea and walks by her office. The Ikea 
           Robot catches her eye. She stops and enters the office.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CELESTE’S OFFICE-A MOMENT LATER

           Celeste stares at the robot. It stares back. She hates it. 
           She kicks it. That hurt. She violently, with all her might, 
           rips its head off. That felt good. She picks it up and starts 
           to thrash the robot torso all over the room as, slowly, 
           pieces of wood flail in every direction. She’s angry and out 
           of control. She stops to catch her breath and sees what she 
           has just done.  She falls to the ground in tears.

           INT. POP FORM OFFICES-AFTERNOON

           People file out of the conference room. Celeste walks down 
           the hall quickly to the bathroom.

           INT. POP FORM BATHROOM

           Celeste enters a stall. Then, she hears two girls enter the 
           bathroom. Riley and SAVANNAH, 22, are chatting. Celeste goes 
           quiet and listens.

                                 RILEY 
                        Ugh. My hair is so dry. It looks 
                        like straw.
                                 SAVANNAH)
                        Oh please, you look amazing. 

                                 RILEY
                        What are these fucking people 
                        doing? That presentation was lame; 
                        they’re so old. What the fuck are 
                        emerging markets, who cares?? 

           Riley looks closer at her skin and picks at it.

                                 RILEY (CONT’D)
                        I need a new skin regime.

           Celeste flushes the toilet and emerges from the stall.

                                 CELESTE
                        It’s regimen.

                                 RILEY
                        Excuse me? Did you say something?

                                 CELESTE
                        Sorry, did I? It just, it’s 
                        regimen, not regime. Regime is a 
                        system of government.

           Riley just glares at her.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        I’m Celeste. One of the old people. 
                        You probably don’t care what I 
                        think but let’s be honest, you need 
                        help. Your image and your brand 
                        need a huge makeover and you can 
                        start with your own conduct.

                                 RILEY
                        Excuse me??

                                 CELESTE
                        Your behavior is childish. Your 
                        audience is more sophisticated than 
                        than you. Stop going out, stop 
                        getting drunk.  Get your shit 
                        together. Trust me, you’ll sell 
                        more albums and more clothes.

           There is a beat of uncomfortable silence. 

                                 RILEY
                        Let’s go.
           Riley and Savannah leave.

           INT. POP FORM HALLWAY

           Scott sees Riley leaving. He runs after her.

                                 SCOTT
                        Ms. Banks, where are you going?

           Celeste comes out of the bathroom to see the chaos in the 
           hallway. Scott looks at Celeste.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        What did you say to her? 

                                 CELESTE
                        That girl is desperate for honesty.

                                 SCOTT
                        Oh God, Celeste. I hope you didn’t 
                        just blow this.

           Savannah comes running back to Scott and Celeste.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Um, Riley wanted me to tell you she 
                        thinks you’re a bitch and she loves 
                        that. Do whatever you want. She’s 
                        into it.

                                 SCOTT
                        Well done, Celeste. Riley likes 
                        you.

                                 CELESTE
                        Yay. I need some air. I’m going 
                        out, I’ll be back later. Or maybe I 
                        won’t.

           Celeste turns and goes. Scott looks at her go, she seems off.

           EXT. SANTA MONICA BEACH-DUSK

           Celeste runs really hard, listening to her music on her 
           iPhone. She stops suddenly. She dials Jesse’s number 
           unconsciously, she puts the phone up to ear. She promptly 
           hits “end call.” She starts running again with purpose.
           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME-NIGHT

           Celeste, Beth and Tucker enter and survey the scene.  Beth is

           looks like a punk teenager with a bowler hat. Celeste is in a

           Beth and Tucker look at her, judging.

                        Yup.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME KITCHEN-NIGHT

           Celeste is drilling Car Bombs with 5 guys. She’s keeping 
           pace.

                        What are you?
                                 CELESTE
                        What? Oh, White trash. 

           Snow White is silent. Celeste points to her trash bag.

                        (doesn’t get it) Huh.

           Paul (from yoga) enters to grab some ice from the freezer. He 
           is wearing a black shirt covered in mini cereal boxes with 
           plastic knives through them. Celeste is mid-Car Bomb and 
           wasted.

                                 PAUL
                        Celeste?

                        Yeah, I haven’t seen you there for 
                        a while. 

                                 CELESTE
                        I’ve been running a lot. Keeps you 
                        in better shape.

                                 PAUL
                        I can see that’s important to you. 
                        (referring to the Car Bomb in her 
                        face)

           Celeste is now drunk.

                        How’s your practice? (waving her 
                        finger in his face, laughing)

                                 PAUL
                        White trash?

                        Um, a cereal killer, obviously.

                        By the way, you were right.

                                 CELESTE
                        About what?

                                 PAUL
                        About me. All of it, the car, the 
                        phone, the yoga. Except that I did 
                        go to an Ivy League school. 
                        Cornell.

                                 CELESTE
                        Barely an Ivy.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME BACKYARD-NIGHT

           Celeste and Paul sit away from the party, smoking cigarettes.

                                 PAUL
                        Sorry about that day at the gym. I 
                        feel really open after yoga, I just 
                        want to connect...

                        Shhhh. Don’t say open. You’re 
                        costume’s great. Don’t ruin it.

                                 PAUL
                        So what’s the deal with you and me? 
                        Is this happening? Or...

                        My husband of six years wants a

                        who’s carrying his child. That’s 
                        the deal with you and me.

                        just going about this all...wrong.

                                 PAUL
                        So you’re right. Now what?

                                 CELESTE
                        What do you mean?

                                 PAUL
                        Well do you want to be right or do 
                        you want to be happy? 

                                 CELESTE
                        Listen, Yoga, I don’t WANT to be 
                        right, I AM right. People will let 
                        you down. I’ve accepted that fact, 
                        and unfortunately, most of the 
                        time, knowing that does keep you 
                        from being happy.  But at least 
                        it’s real.

                                 PAUL
                        No one has ever given a more self-
                        righteous monologue wearing only a 
                        trash bag. Except for the homeless 
                        guy outside my dry cleaners.

           Beth and Tucker approach Celeste and Paul.

                                 BETH
                        Time to go, drunky.

           They head off.

                                 PAUL
                        (yells to Celeste) Call me!

           INT. CELESTE’S HOME OFFICE-DAY (SUNDAY)

           Celeste is going through papers on Jesse’s desk. She’s 
           cleaning house. She comes across a notebook. She flips 
           through it. She reads a couple of sweet passages about her. 
           She grabs the phone.

                                 CELESTE
                        Hey, it’s Celeste. You know, I 
                        still have a bunch of your stuff in 
                        the office. You should probably 
                        grab it at some point. Okay.
           She hangs up. She makes a decision. She grabs a box and 
           starts throwing everything and anything that belongs to 
           Jesse.

           EXT. JESSE AND VERONICA’S HOUSE-ECHO PARK-DUSK

           Celeste carries a box of Jesse’s stuff to his front door. She 
           drops it down. She knocks. No answer. She knocks again. Oh 
           well. She leaves the box by the door. She decides to keep the 
           one journal with the sweet passages for herself; she deserves 
           it and he’ll never know. She starts to walk away when she 
           notices, it’s trash day.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. VERONICA’S VOLKSWAGON BEETLE-DUSK

           Jesse drives and Veronica is in the passenger seat. They are 
           quiet and content. They look at each other and smile.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JESSE AND VERONICA’S DRIVEWAY-A MOMENT LATER

           Three trash cans-green, brown, and blue-are lined up in the 
           driveway.  A huge box is protruding from the blue can. 
           Celeste considers. So much to be learned from the trash. She 
           slowly walks over. She peeks in at the box; it has a big 
           picture of a fancy stroller on the side of it. Crushing.

                                 CELESTE
                        At least they recycle.

           INT. VERONICA’S VOLKSWAGON BEETLE-A MOMENT LATER

           Veronica looks out the window.

                                 JESSE
                        This is...so weird but I just 
                        realized...what’s your middle name? 
                        I don’t even know it.

           They laugh a little.

                                 VERONICA
                        It’s um...Godelieve.

                                 JESSE
                        Goldleaf?
                                 VERONICA
                        No, Goldelieve. It means loved by 
                        the Gods. It’s Dutch.

                                 JESSE
                        Sweet. Mine’s Mordechai.

                                 VERONICA
                        What does it mean?

                                 JESSE
                        Means I’m really Jewish.

           Veronica giggles. They’re getting to know each other. It’s 
           awkward...but sweet.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JESSE AND VERONICA’S SIDEWALK-ANOTHER MOMENT LATER

           Celeste is still digging in the trash. She looks further 
           down.

                                 CELESTE
                        Guitar Hero?? That’s quite an 
                        extravagant purchase for a 
                        freelancer and his “elegant” 
                        Belgian bride.

           She looks further down and sees empty wine bottles. Lots of 
           them.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Good to see some things don’t 
                        change.

           Her diamond bracelet slips off her wrist and plunks to the 
           bottom.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Shit. Shit shit shit.

           She drops Jesse’s journal to the concrete and crawls into the 
           trash can, still reaching for the bottom, not quite getting 
           there. The trash can falls over with her in it. Just then, 
           Jesse’s car pulls up and headlights shine on Celeste half-way 
           in the trash can. She fumbles and then:

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Ow!!! Shit!
           A piece of glass from the can has sliced her face. She 
           immediately wiggles out of the trash can, stands it back up 
           again. She looks for a place to run. It’s too late. She picks 
           up the journal and hides behind the trash cans but Jesse and 
           Veronica have been watching her whole opera from the car. 
           Jesse approaches a crouching Celeste.

                                 JESSE
                        Celeste?

           Celeste stands up slowly as if nothing is wrong. She is also 
           holding Jesse’s journal close to her chest. 

                                 CELESTE
                        Hey!

                                 JESSE
                        What...are you doing?

                                 CELESTE
                        I just...

           She looks around to make an excuse.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Um...came over to drop off some of 
                        your stuff.

                                 JESSE
                        But why were you in the trash can?

                                 CELESTE
                        I lost something.

                                 JESSE
                        In the trash can?

                                 CELESTE
                        My bracelet. It was a whole thing. 
                        It’s over now.

           Jesse and Veronica just stare at Celeste for a long beat.

                                 JESSE
                        You’ve met Veronica, right?

                                 CELESTE

                        right! I love your sweater.

                        What? Oh (she touches her cheek), 
                        yeah, I guess I am.

                                 VERONICA
                        Let me get you something for that.

                                 CELESTE
                        NO. No, don’t. It’s fine, just a 
                        little cut.

                                 VERONICA
                        Are you sure? I’m so sorry about 
                        this.

                                 CELESTE
                        No, I’m sorry. So sorry. Well, I’m 
                        late for things. But so nice to see 
                        you guys.

                                 VERONICA
                        You sure you don’t want to come in 
                        for a drink?

                                 CELESTE
                        Nooooo, no. That’s very nice but 
                        no. So good to see you guys! Okay.

           She starts to walk away with the journal.

                                 JESSE
                        Is that mine?

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh, yeah, that’s weird. I don’t 
                        know how...here you go.

           She laughs nervously and hands him his journal.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Bye!

           EXT. POP FORM COURTYARD- 30 MINUTES LATER

           Celeste and Beth eat lunch in the zen garden outside the Pop 
           Form building. Celeste is picking at the end of her sandwich, 
           recounting the waking nightmare of last night. The cut on her 
           face is neatly bandaged.

                                 BETH
                        You told her you liked her sweater? 
                        What are you, twelve?

                                 CELESTE
                        It was a disaster. But you should 
                        have seen the sweater. So great. 
                        Beth, am I losing my mind?

                                 BETH
                        Maybe. No. Please no more trash-
                        diving. Let’s focus on you now. I 
                        have someone.

                                 CELESTE
                        No, no, no, no.

                                 BETH
                        C, this guys just a slumpbuster, 
                        you need that. He’s really smart. 
                        He’s like Tucker’s financial 
                        mentor.

                                 CELESTE
                        Smart means ugly.

                                 BETH
                        He’s really successful, really 
                        rich. Slightly losing his hair.

           INT. FOGO DE CHAO-NIGHT

           Celeste sits at the Brazilian meat feasting restaurant. It’s 
           a meat fest. Celeste is texting Beth. INSERT: The text reads 
           “Slightly?? Totally.” 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FOGO DE CHAO TABLE-A MOMENT LATER

           JOSH BIRNBAUM, 40, very bald and sweaty, sits across from 
           Celeste, organizing his pill box and swallowing pills. He’s 
           smiling and sweating.

                                 JOSH
                        And this one is for lactose 
                        intolerance. Because somebody loves 
                        the mac and cheese!

                                 CELESTE
                        (disgusted) Yummy. 

                                 JOSH
                        Is it warm in here? 

           Josh is flop sweating.

                                 CELESTE
                        No, I’m okay.

           Josh peers into his pillbox, picks up a blue pill.

                                 JOSH
                        Did I take this one already?

                                 CELESTE
                        Is that the lipitor?

                                 JOSH
                        Yes.

                                 CELESTE
                        Yup. You took that one. I think 
                        I’ve had enough meat.

           Josh is chomping offensively on a meatball.

                                 JOSH
                        Really? You didn’t even try the 
                        barbecue meatballs yet. Not to be 
                        missed. 
           Josh offers his fork with half an eaten meatball to Celeste. 
           He guides it toward her mouth.

                                 CELESTE
                        No, I’m good.

                                 JOSH
                        Excuse me, waitress? Where’s my mac 
                        and cheese? Are you dumb?  I 
                        ordered it twenty minutes ago.

                                 CELESTE?
                        I’m just gonna use the restroom.

           Celeste dives for the door and runs out.

           Skillz rolls a tight joint.  Celeste takes a drag.

                        So, you know, I have this client...

                        I don’t know that first one was mad 
                        historical but it really spoke to

                        Hot. How bad it could it be.

           RUPERT BATES, 22, very handsome, British, wearing a leather 
           jacket, sporting tousled actor hair is playing a hideously 
           earnest original song on the guitar. He sings with passion. 
           He looks up at Celeste and winks.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Celeste is on the couch looking slightly mortified. She 
           smiles weakly at him. Rupert finishes the song, closes his 
           eyes and hangs his head. A beat of silence. Celeste musters 
           up a short and slow round of applause.

                                 CELESTE
                        That was so...good.
                                 RUPERT
                        I wrote that for my mum.

           Rupert slides next to Celeste and is all of a sudden right in 
           her face. He touches her hair. He kisses her, deeply. He 
           pulls away and takes her in.

                                 RUPERT
                        Hello, Special One.

           INT. POP FORM CONFERENCE ROOM-AFTERNOON

           Pop Form employees are gathered to celebrate the finalizing 
           of the Riley Banks campaign. The new Riley Banks logo is 
           featured on a huge projector and people mingle. Riley Banks 
           is also there, her hair pulled back, dressed relatively 
           modestly, for her. She approaches Celeste and Scott with a 
           few of her minions.

                        I like the logo.

                        Yeah you are, but you’re still 
                        pretty. Guys would like you.

                        You got to try a little harder to

           Celeste sits on the balcony with Nick Moran. He has Indy 
           rocker hair and a Los Feliz beard. He’s hip and smart in an 
           effortless way. Celeste is feeling him. They drink wine and

                        finally got the shot of Putin.

           He hands her a photograph. 
                                 CELESTE
                        Wow. That is incredible. I think 
                        he’s smiling, maybe.

                                 NICK
                        He is.  I think the piss stain 
                        running down my jeans made him 
                        laugh.

                                 CELESTE
                        Well, the world will think you’re 
                        brilliant. No one will ever know 
                        but me. 

                                 NICK
                        I was nominated for a Pulitzer. I 
                        didn’t win.

                                 CELESTE
                        Well, maybe you should have crapped 
                        your pants.

           They laugh. They are connecting.

                                 NICK
                        (looking at his watch) Oh my god, 
                        we missed our reservation. It was 
                        at 8:30. Should I call down and see 
                        if they can still take us?

                                 CELESTE
                        How about room service?

                                 NICK
                        Perfect.

           INT. CHATEAU MARMONT-LIVING ROOM- LATER

           Nick and Celeste are kissing. It’s passionate but tender. 
           They stop and their foreheads rest against each other’s and 
           they take a deep breath. They speak in hushed tones. 

                                 CELESTE
                        That was really, really nice.

                                 NICK
                        Um, yeah. So, what are you doing 
                        for the rest of your life?

                                 CELESTE
                        Making out with you.

           They start to kiss again. 
                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t remember ever feeling like 
                        this.

           They continue to kiss. Celeste notices that she and the couch 
           are vibrating. She looks down. Oh no. Nick is masturbating. 
           Can he really be masturbating?

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        (whisper)What are you doing?

                                 NICK
                        (whisper)What do you think 
                        I’m doing?

                                 CELESTE
                        (whisper) Why are you doing that? 
                        Don’t do that..It was going so 
                        well. 

                                 NICK
                        Shhhhh.

           Celeste pulls away slowly, shaking her head, “no.” Nick keeps 
           going. Eyes closed.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Watch me. I’m almost there.

           Celeste cannot believe what she is watching.

                                 CELESTE
                        Almost where?? No!

           Celeste quickly grabs her stuff and gets the hell out of 
           dodge.

                                 NICK
                        Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhh! 

           Nick recovers from his climax and looks around to realize 
           she’s gone.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Celeste?

           EXT. CELESTE’S GARDEN-NIGHT

           Skillz and Celeste sit in her backyard and watch the last 
           scene from “Dirty Dancing.” The image is being projected onto 
           her garden wall.  There is no sound. Instead, Bob Marley’s 
           “Kaya” plays over the speakers. Celeste is ripping an 
           enormous bowl from a four-foot bong. 
           Skillz is on his knees, bracing the bong, looking at Celeste 
           with admiration. Celeste watches the movie. 

                                 CELESTE
                        She’s so sad.

                                 SKILLZ
                        Is she? I don’t think so.

                                 CELESTE
                        No, she’s sad. I can tell. I went 
                        to dance camp.

           We see Jennifer Grey elevated above Patrick Swayze, looking 
           elated. Celeste exhales a huge billow of smoke.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        That’s the first good thing that’s 
                        happened to me in months. 

                                 SKILLZ
                        Shit’ll get better.

                                 CELESTE
                        Will it? You don’t know that. 

           Celeste grabs a handful of Cheetos from an economy-sized bag.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        How could he do this to me?

                                 SKILLZ
                        J-Thunder? He’s not doing anything 
                        to you. You wanted a divorce.

                                 CELESTE
                        But I didn’t want it like this.

                                 SKILLZ
                        When we are no longer able to 
                        change a situation, we are 
                        challenged to change ourselves.

                                 CELESTE
                        Huh?

                                 SKILLZ
                        Oh. It’s Victor Frankl.

                                 CELESTE
                        Huh.

           Skillz gets up.
                                 SKILLZ
                        I gotta go before Petco closes.

                                 CELESTE
                        You have a pet?

                                 SKILLZ
                        No, but I gotta get a toy for this 
                        girl’s cat, you know, so she’ll 
                        give up the kitty.

                                 CELESTE
                        Can I come?

                                 SKILLZ
                        No.

                        Will you bring me some Panda

                        you up at noon.

                        Beth and Tucker’s pre-wedding BBQ? 

                                 CELESTE
                        Right, right.

                                 SKILLZ
                        Hey, easy on the herb until then. 
                        That shit is powerful.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BETH AND TUCKER’S BACKYARD-DAY

           Celeste is sitting alone, wearing sunglasses, going to town 
           on a HUGE plate of food: chicken wings, fries, burger, hot 
           dog, coleslaw, egg salad and a beer. She attacks it like it’s 
           her last meal ever. She’s also trashed. 
           Celeste gets up and heads towards a group of people talking 
           including, Beth’s mom, Beth and a couple of her girlfriends.

                                 BETH
                        Hi honey, you remember Eileen 
                        from...

                                 CELESTE
                        Do you have any more of that ranch 
                        dressing? It’s the fucking 
                        booooooomb.

           Beth is embarrassed. Celeste gives Beth’s mom, CAROL, 60, 
           very large, a big sloppy hug.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Hi Carol! Beth’s getting married! I 
                        was married, remember? These guys 
                        are in for a fucking dogfight, 
                        right?

           Beth pulls Celeste away.

                                 BETH
                        Let’s get you a soda.

           They get to the bar.

                                 CELESTE
                        Do you guys have any tequila?

                                 BARTENDER
                        We only have Mimosas and Shandys.

                                 CELESTE
                        I’ll have both please.

           Beth pulls Celeste away from the bar and brings her into the 
           house and plops her down on the couch.

                                 BETH
                        I’m going to recommend some quiet 
                        time for you right now.

                                 CELESTE
                        Can I smoke?

                                 BETH
                        No.

           Celeste starts weeping.

                                 CELESTE
                        I don’t want to be alone forever.
                                 BETH
                        Not forever, honey. Just until you 
                        sober up. You’ll be fine.

                                 CELESTE
                        Okay then, I’ll just go to the 
                        other side of the pool. I promise I 
                        won’t make you look bad.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BETH AND TUCKER’S BACKYARD- A LIITLE LATER

           There are various familial toasts going on across the pool. 
           Celeste is smoking a cigarette alone. She is also holding a 
           small plate of baby carrots and ranch dressing. She is still 
           fucked up. Jesse sidles up to her.

                                 JESSE
                        I looked through that journal you 
                        left. A LOT of bad poetry from me 
                        in college.

                                 CELESTE
                        I liked your poetry.

                                 JESSE
                        Aw, thanks.

           He takes a beat.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Beth’s mom gave me a mouth-kiss. 
                        Again. 

                                 CELESTE
                        I saw that. Tongue?

                                 JESSE
                        I think a little bit.

           We see Beth’s very large mom giving a toast. She let’s out an 
           insanely unpleasant, loud laugh. 

                                 CELESTE
                        I bet you she’s an animal in the 
                        sack.

                                 JESSE
                        She might get it from me at the 
                        wedding.
           Celeste picks up a baby carrot and starts to jerk it off, as 
           Jesse did earlier and as they have done many times.

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh god, tug it, Mrs. Weinberg, 
                        you’re the best in the biz!

           Jesse starts to participate. He dips his finger in the ranch 
           dressing and puts it on the top of the carrot.

                                 JESSE
                        Aw yeah! Fuck!

           Jesse and Celeste are in hysterics.  Just then, Veronica 
           arrives. 

                                 VERONICA
                        Jesse?

                                 JESSE
                        Oh. Hey.

           Celeste and Jesse stop like two children who just got caught.

                                 VERONICA
                        What are you doing?

                                 JESSE
                        What? Nothing. We’re just...

           He looks at Celeste for cover. She is giddy, wasted and happy 
           to explain.

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh, Jesse and I do this thing where 
                        we find the littlest thing that 
                        resembles a penis and we just, you 
                        know...

           Celeste shows Veronica what she means on the carrot. Jesse 
           does not participate this time.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Ah, oh yeah, do it!

           Celeste notices Veronica is not enjoying this. She slows down 
           her stroke, until she finally stops.

                                 VERONICA
                        I don’t get it.

                                 JESSE
                        It’s stupid. Never mind.
                                 VERONICA
                        They just put out the food. (to 
                        Celeste) It’s nice to see you.

                                 JESSE
                        Oh yeah, let’s eat.

           They awkwardly leave Celeste, standing alone. She bites into 
           the carrot.

           EXT. BETH AND TUCKER’S POOL-LATER

           Jesse and Veronica are saying goodbye to Beth. In the 
           foreground, Celeste slowly floats into frame on a raft in the 
           pool, passed out, face down, sunglasses half off, fully 
           clothed. Skillz approaches Beth.

                                 BETH
                        At least she’s quiet now.

                                 SKILLZ
                        I’m gonna get her out of here.

           INT. CELESTE’S OFFICE-DAY

           Celeste is extremely hung over and multitasking. She is on 
           the Blackberry and the phone and on her computer.

                                 CELESTE
                        (on the phone) Well, maybe we can 
                        do a tie-in with the CW? It just 
                        needs more exposure...shit, hold 
                        on, Scott, I have another call...

           Celeste’s assistant enters with a folder of graphics to show 
           Celeste. She barely glances at it. She’s listening to Riley 
           but covers the receiver part of the phone.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        The logo is fine.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        But will you just...

                                 CELESTE
                        Please, I’ve seen it a million 
                        times, I know it’s fine. Hello? Hi, 
                        thanks for getting back to me...

           She waves her assistant out, like “We’re done.”
           INT. CELESTE’S BEDROOM- EARLY EVENING-A WEEK LATER

           Celeste is very hung over, again, rushing around trying to 
           pack for Beth’s wedding. She is throwing things into a bag.

                                 BETH (V.O.)
                        Hi princess. I’m so nervous and 
                        stressed, but so thin, thank God. 
                        Please don’t miss my wedding, 
                        please make your flight tonight. 
                        Also, I don’t know how much you 
                        remember about last Saturday but if 
                        you could not dry hump my 
                        grandmother again, that would be 
                        great. Can’t wait to see you. Love 
                        you.

           EXT. CELESTE’S HOUSE

           Celeste jumps into a cab. She is completely disheveled. She 
           looks out the window, lost.

           INT. AIRPLANE CABIN-RED EYE-NIGHT

           Celeste is sitting in a window seat next to a crying kid and 
           his disinterested mom.  Her phone rings. She looks at it. 
           It’s Paul. Again. She pushes “Ignore.” She puts on her sound-
           cancelling Bose headphones and tries to tune out. She can’t. 
           This will be her next four hours.

           INT. CLEVELAND INT’L AIRPORT-EARLY MORNING

           Celeste is hauling ass across the terminal with a computer 
           bag, a rolling bag, a Hudson News bag, a McDonald’s bag and a 
           large purse. She runs with no apparent pace and is clearly 
           late for her connecting flight.

           INT. CLEVELAND INT’L AIRPORT-SECURITY LINE-MORNING

           The airport is heaving and the security line is absurdly 
           long. She will miss her flight if she doesn’t jump the line. 
           But this is not an option for Celeste, that is wrong. Unless 
           she asks everyone in line if it’s okay. 

                                 CELESTE
                        Excuse me, I’m late for my flight. 
                        Do you mind if I go in front of 
                        you? (traveler nods) Thanks.
                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me, I’m really late for my 
                        flight. Is it ok...(another 
                        traveler nods) Thanks so much.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Hi, I’m sure you heard me ask the 
                        last guy but do you mind...(third 
                        traveler says “yes.) Oh thank you.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CLEVELAND INT’L AIRPORT-SECURITY LINE

           A wide shot of Celeste asking each and every traveler if she 
           can cut in front of them. It looks tedious and ridiculous.

           INT. BARRINGTON BREWERY-NIGHT

           Lots of preppy people are gathered for the night before the 
           wedding. It is festive. Celeste is alone in a booth, leaning 
           on her hand and sleeping. Yes, sleeping.  ANGIE, 30, wearing 
           lots of florals and festive colors, approaches the booth.

                                 GIRL
                        Celeste? Hey! Angie.

           Celeste stares blankly.

                                 ANGIE
                        Angie? Lead soprano of the Treble 
                        Makers? I lived in Jarvis? 

           Still nothing.

                                 ANGIE (CONT’D)
                        I played field hockey with your 
                        roommate? I was All-NESCAC?

           Nope, still nothing.

                                 ANGIE (CONT’D)
                        (quietly)We made out at the Psi U 
                        House junior year? On a drunk dare?

                                 CELESTE
                        So sorry, I have no idea who you 
                        are. I got a lot happening in here 
                        right now so...(referring to her 
                        brain) 
                                 ANGIE
                        No worries! I am in charge of the 
                        Girl’s scavenger hunt tonight and 
                        you will need to report to the 
                        front of the bar at 10pm sharp.

                                 CELESTE
                        No, no reporting. Definitely not.

                                 ANGIE
                        Oh come on, it’ll be fun! You don’t 
                        want to?

                                 CELESTE
                        I would rather give a donkey a blow 
                        job. But I’m sure you’ll have so 
                        much fun.

                                 ANGIE
                        Okay. Nice to see you.

                                 CELESTE
                        You too. 

           Angie walks away.  Celeste notices Jesse with a group of 
           college friends. He looks happy. Celeste slumps over the 
           table.

           INT. DELI-GREAT BARRINGTON-LATE AFTERNOON

           Celeste sits at a window counter. She looks out onto a small 
           street in the center of town. She unwraps her sandwich from 
           noisy, wax paper. It’s really quiet in the deli. She sees a 
           group of wedding guests outside. They wave. She waves back. 
           She is alone but for the moment, she is okay.

           INT. LIBRARY- BIDDLE ESTATE IN THE BERKSHIRES-EARLY EVENING

           This is Tucker’s family’s historic home in Great Barrington. 
           It is enormous. The wedding is under way.

                                 PRIEST
                        I now pronounce you husband and 
                        wife. 

           Tucker and Beth kiss deeply. Everybody explodes in applause. 
           We see Celeste in the audience, clapping tepidly. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. RECEPTION TENT-NIGHT

           Three girls, with no stage presence, are giving a speech. 
           They are trading off rhyming couplets. 

                                 GIRL #1
                        She pursued her love of Spanish 
                        men, but missed her Tucker, more 
                        than just as a friend.

                                 GIRL #2
                        And our princess returned home to 
                        her loving prince, and they’ve been 
                        together ever since.

                                 ALL THREE GIRLS
                        We love you, Bethy!!

           The audience applauds. Celeste rolls her eyes. 

                                 GIRL #2
                        And now we’re gonna hear from 
                        Celeste, Beth’s best friend in the 
                        world.

           A little more applause. Celeste has completely forgotten she 
           was supposed to speak. Oh no. She gets up slowly and grabs 
           the mike. 

                                 CELESTE
                        Thank you. Thanks a lot, girls, 
                        that was so...wow. There are no 
                        words. Well, this is gonna sound 
                        bad but I actually forgot that I 
                        was speaking tonight. 

           Beth looks at her, frozen.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t where to start. Um...how do 
                        you get a nun pregnant? You fuck 
                        her? 

           Beth’s father laughs uncontrollably. He’s the only one 
           laughing.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks, Tom. Man, it is not that 
                        easy to get to Great Barrington 
                        from Los Angeles. Took the red eye 
                        to Cleveland. Best porno title 
                        ever? Then a delayed flight to 
                        Logan, then drove to the Berkshires 
                        in torrential rain. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        I think there was a rickshaw 
                        involved somewhere. Also, stellar 
                        call on having a destination 
                        wedding the weekend before 
                        Thanksgiving. So thanks for that, 
                        Mrs. Weinberg. But the truth is, I 
                        would go anywhere for Beth. She’s 
                        my best friend. And I’m so happy 
                        for her. Senior year of college, we 
                        had a tradition. Every Sunday, come 
                        rain or shine, Beth and Tucker 
                        would meet me and Jesse at the 
                        Bishop with a 12-pack of Miller 
                        High Life, the champagne of beers, 
                        and we would meet to talk about 
                        what was important in the world, 
                        you know, Heidegger’s influence on 
                        hip-hop. Or the feminist duality on 
                        “Melrose Place.” Life’s big 
                        questions. Beth and Tucker were 
                        just friends then but there was 
                        always something there. Just an 
                        ease they had with each other. 
                        Jesse and I spent years trying to 
                        get them together, unsuccessfully. 
                        But we all remained friends as we 
                        watched Tucker date a series of 
                        slutty, vacuous and vile girls for 
                        five long years. 

           Tucker flinches.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Finally, he removed his head from 
                        his ass, and saw what was in front 
                        of him. And that was beautiful 
                        Beth. And none of us could be 
                        happier about it; they were 
                        perfect. At last. Love wins.

           Celeste looks at Jesse in the crowd.  Veronica is not there.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Um...Jesse and I are getting a 
                        divorce. So that’s...yeah, our 
                        timing was not as good, I guess. 
                        Beth and Tucker, you are lucky to 
                        be best friends. Work hard and 
                        respect that. It doesn’t come 
                        easily in life. Be patient, don’t 
                        always think you’re right. And if 
                        you are, it doesn’t really matter 
                        anyway. Fight for it, everyday, I 
                        wish I had.
           EXT. RECEPTION TENT-AN HOUR LATER

           Celeste smokes a cigarette in the freezing cold. She is in 
           pain from the speech she just gave.  She shivers and takes a 
           drag just as Jesse walks past. He stops.

                                 JESSE
                        Hey.

                                 CELESTE
                        Hey.

                                 JESSE
                        How are you?

                                 CELESTE
                        I’m...having a hard time. 

                                 JESSE
                        I know.  But you’re Superman. 
                        You’ll be fine. Your speech was 
                        great.

                                 CELESTE
                        Right. Thanks. Where’s Veronica?

                                 JESSE
                        Oh, she’s in LA. She had to work.

           Just then, TREVOR, 31, a college classmate of theirs, comes 
           up to Jesse. Trevor is hammered.

                                 TREVOR
                        Dude, I just heard about your book 
                        deal! That is sweet as hell, 
                        congrats!

                                 JESSE
                        Oh, thanks Trevor.

           Trevor is gone. Celeste struggles with this information.

                                 CELESTE
                        Book deal. Wow. The history of hip-
                        hop?

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah. It’s crazy.

                                 CELESTE
                        Yeah, it really is. You’re on fire 
                        right now. Breaking up was the best 
                        thing that ever happened to you. I 
                        should break up with me.
                                 JESSE
                        Celeste...

           Celeste stubs out her cigarette. She looks like she’s holding 
           back a big cry. 

                                 CELESTE
                        Sorry, congratulations on 
                        everything. I’m...cold, I’m going 
                        inside.

           Celeste walks back in the tent.

           INT. GREAT BARRINGTON INN- NEXT MORNING

           Celeste’s hotel room phone is ringing naggingly. Finally, she 
           emerges from a deep sleep, just enough to pick up the phone.

                                 SCOTT (V.O.)
                        Celeste?  Hello? Celeste?

                                 CELESTE
                        Yeah, I’m here.

                                 SCOTT
                        We have a massive problem on our 
                        hands. I need you back here. Now.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. POP FORM OFFICES-LATE AFTERNOON

           INSERT of a large, magnified version of Riley’s “RB” logo. It 
           is pretty clear what the image looks like. Scott stares at 
           Celeste, waiting for her to freak out.

                                 CELESTE
                        I don’t see anything.

                                 SCOTT
                        (referring to the logo) It’s a 
                        penis. And a butt.

                                 CELESTE
                        What? Really? I don’t see it.

                                 SCOTT
                        You can’t be serious. (points to 
                        the logo) There’s the penis. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        And there’s the penis going into 
                        the butt.

                                 CELESTE
                        I think it’s a stretch.

                                 SCOTT
                        Well, it’s not a stretch, Celeste.

           Scott puts a DVD into the DVD player. A reel of news clips 
           comes on.

                                 NEWSCASTER
                        Teenage girls are flocking to 
                        boutiques around the country today 
                        to buy the new clothing line from 
                        music sensation Riley Banks. They 
                        were hoping to get a little bit of 
                        the teen star’s fashion magic but 
                        instead, they have been confronted 
                        with vile and pornographic imagery.

                                 PARENT
                        There’s homosexual butt sex in the 
                        logo. Does Riley think we’re that 
                        stupid?? I will never support gay 
                        marriage.

                                 NEWSCASTER
                        Neither Riley nor a representative 
                        from Pop Form-the marketing company 
                        responsible-could be reached for 
                        comment. 

           Scott turns it off.

                                 SCOTT
                        This piece has been syndicated by 
                        several news shows. 24 stores have 
                        already cancelled the line and I 
                        have Riley Banks calling me the 
                        most obscene names I’ve ever heard.

           Celeste picks up the magnified logo again.

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh. Oh my God. Oh wow, I totally 
                        see it now. WOW. Ha. Haha. 
                        Hahahahaaha.

           Celeste starts laughing uncontrollably. It’s the funniest 
           thing she’s ever seen.
                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        It’s a cock in a butt!!! 
                        Hahahaahaaa!!

                                 SCOTT
                        (fuming)Stop it. Stop laughing.

                                 CELESTE
                        Scott, come on...

                                 SCOTT
                        No, this is not a joke. Our 
                        company’s in serious danger. How 
                        could you be so careless?

                                 CELESTE
                        You’re being dramatic. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Get out. I can’t. With you. Right 
                        now. I have to deal with this. I’ll 
                        call you soon.

           Her laughter fades and she exits the conference room.

           INT. CELESTE’S BEDROOM- THE NEXT DAY

           Celeste is in bed. It’s the afternoon. She hasn’t been in bed 
           in the afternoon in years. She flips through channels on the 
           television faster than she can actually see what’s on the 
           screen. Nothing’s registering. It’s just light flickering. 
           Her bed is covered in bowls and plates. She gets on her 
           computer, on the Amazon Top Sellers page. Her book, 
           “Shitegeist” is listed at #204. She hits the refresh button 
           over and over again, wanting the rating to go up. It doesn’t. 
           She shuts the computer and puts her head in her hands.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD.-LATER THAT DAY-DUSK

           Bon Iver’s “Skinny Love” plays as Celeste walks slowly 
           amongst the celebrity impersonators, tourists and drunks on 
           the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She has never felt more alone in 
           a city full of people. It is intercut with a montage of Super 
           8 footage of Celeste and Jesse in the past: At a seaside 
           house, Jesse is reluctantly cutting a head off a fish to cook 
           it, Celeste is repulsed but laughing. Celeste and Jesse 
           cuddle in a sleeping bag, fighting off the cold. Celeste and 
           Jesse take cover in a torrential New York City rain. They 
           stand under an awning and she smiles as she runs her hand 
           through his wet hair. Celeste is abruptly shaken out of her 
           memories when a person in a giant Elmo costume suddenly gives 
           her a huge hug. And then he’s gone.
           INT. THE WELL BAR-EARLY EVENING

           We see Celeste sitting at the dive bar, seemingly waiting for 
           another disastrous date. But this time, Jesse enters and sits 
           next to Celeste. Celeste looks a mess but seems really happy 
           to see him. He looks good. Better than ever.

                                 CELESTE
                        Hey.

                                 JESSE
                        Hey.

           He sizes her up.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        What are you wearing?

                                 CELESTE
                        What do you mean?

                                 JESSE
                        I can’t tell if you’re dressed like 
                        a rich European or a homeless 
                        woman.

                                 CELESTE
                        (she looks at her clothes) Oh 
                        right. Thanks for meeting me.

                                 JESSE
                        Of course.

                                 CELESTE
                        I haven’t signed the divorce papers 
                        yet.

                                 JESSE
                        I know.

           Celeste looks at him. Then, she looks away.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Celeste? What’s up?

                                 CELESTE
                        You told me that whatever it took, 
                        you would keep me forever. I know 
                        that I can be difficult and I know 
                        I set this whole thing in motion 
                        but I’ve been having a really hard 
                        time with all this. I made a lot of 
                        mistakes, Jess. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CELESTE (CONT'D)
                        And obviously, you have this whole 
                        other situation with the baby going 
                        on and I know this sounds so crazy 
                        but I can’t help but feel like we 
                        could have done more, that we can 
                        do more. And I don’t want to lose 
                        you. Just tell me, and I’ll never 
                        ask again, is it over with us? Is 
                        it really over with us?

           Jesse can’t even look at her.

                                 JESSE
                        I’m sorry. I can’t.

           Jesse gets up and leaves.

           EXT. THE WELL BAR-EVENING

           Jesse walks out of the bar. He takes a deep breath and starts 
           walking. A beat later, Celeste tears out of the bar, walking 
           quickly after Jesse.

                                 CELESTE
                        Hey! Where you going? Come back! 
                        Please.

           Jesse pauses for a moment. He walks slowly back to her.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t figure it out. You were one 
                        way and now, all of a sudden, 
                        you’re another way. And you’re with 
                        someone else. And you’re having a 
                        baby.

                                 JESSE
                        Well, Celeste, I’ve changed.

                                 CELESTE
                        You never changed with me.

                                 JESSE
                        You didn’t let me.

                                 CELESTE
                        Why couldn’t you have just grown up 
                        for me?? I was waiting for you to 
                        grow up! All I did was root for 
                        you, I believed in you. I fucking 
                        built you! How dare you change for 
                        someone else!
                                 JESSE
                        Wow. The entire world revolves 
                        around you. It always has.

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh. Okay. I’m sorry I’m successful 
                        and you’re not. I know that never 
                        worked for you.

                                 JESSE
                        Right. And how do you define 
                        success, Celeste? Because you don’t 
                        look very successful right now.

                                 CELESTE
                        And you are? You get a girl 
                        pregnant and all of a sudden that 
                        makes you an adult.  You have no 
                        idea what you’re in for. 

                                 JESSE
                        What do you want, Celeste?

                                 CELESTE
                        I just want you to admit that 
                        you’re wrong.

                                 JESSE
                        Wrong? Wrong about what? What did 
                        you want me to do? Wait for you to 
                        meet someone first? Is that how you 
                        saw it happening?

           Celeste doesn’t respond.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t expect to meet someone so 
                        fast, but I did. And the nice thing 
                        is, Celeste? I don’t disappoint 
                        Veronica.

                                 CELESTE
                        You know what, Jesse? You 
                        definitely will.

           Jesse takes a beat. It stings.

                                 JESSE
                        I feel really sorry for you. You 
                        might be alone forever.

           He starts to walk away. Celeste runs after him.
                                 CELESTE
                        I’ll sign the fucking papers. Don’t 
                        call me.

                                 JESSE
                        Don’t worry about it. 

           Jesse walks away.

           INT. CELESTE HOME OFFICE-NEXT DAY

           Celeste is on the phone.

                                 CELESTE
                        Well, do you know when he will be 
                        back? He’s not answering his 
                        cell...Okay well, tell him I 
                        called. 

           She dials his cell.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, it’s me. Again.  I’m really 
                        sorry about yesterday. My life has 
                        been hilariously unmanageable and 
                        it was kind of the last straw for 
                        me. I’m probably no help to you 
                        anyway right now. But call me if 
                        you need me. Okay.

           Celeste’s doorbell rings. She hangs up the phone and runs to 
           the door. She opens it and Riley is standing there, face wet 
           with tears.  She stinks of booze.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Riley? Are you okay? What are you 
                        doing here?

           Riley looks at Celeste.

                                 RILEY
                        I fucking hate him.

           She then doubles over and vomits on Celeste’s shoes.

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh balls.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CELESTE’S LIVING ROOM- NIGHT

           Riley is asleep on the couch with a blanket over her. Next to 
           her, Celeste is watching the Matthias Steiner Olympics 
           documentary. Jesse’s favorite. Celeste is crying. This wakes 
           Riley up.

                                 RILEY
                        Are you crying?

           Celeste turns off the television.

                                 CELESTE
                        Uh, yeah, this just reminds me of 
                        someone. 

                                 RILEY
                        A guy?

                                 CELESTE
                        Yeah. A guy.

                                 RILEY
                        You miss him?

                                 CELESTE
                        Yeah, I do.

                                 RILEY
                        They all fucking suck.

                                 CELESTE
                        Kind of.

                                 RILEY
                        So it never gets better?

                                 CELESTE
                        No, it doesn’t. But you do. You’re 
                        gonna be fine.

           INT. PHO SIAM THAI MASSAGE-NIGHT

           Celeste is lying in a quiet, dark room in thai fisherman 
           pants and a large t-shirt. She takes a deep breath. 

                                 CELESTE
                        So where do you live?

           We reveal that she is lying next to Paul, they are both about 
           to get thai massages.
                                 PAUL
                        Uh, I live in Westwood. In a condo.

                                 CELESTE
                        Cool.

                                 PAUL
                        You are gonna love this place. 
                        You’ve never felt so relaxed in 
                        your life.

           Cherry and Lucky enter, the masseuses. They all exchange 
           quiet hellos and head nods. Cherry and Lucky get to work. 
           Lucky takes Celeste’s leg and pushes it all the way over her 
           head, not the most comfortable position.

                                 CELESTE
                        Ahhhhh.(responding to the stretch) 
                        Wow, this is a unique place to take 
                        a date.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah, I take all my dates here.

                                 CELESTE
                        I feel special.

                                 PAUL
                        You shouldn’t. 

           Paul takes a deep exhale as Cherry rams her elbow into his 
           shoulderblade.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        So how is being right about 
                        everything going for you?

                                 CELESTE
                        Not...that well. I gave a super 
                        embarrassing speech at my best 
                        friend’s wedding, I was caught 
                        going through my ex-husband’s trash 
                        and my company is in shambles. 

                                 PAUL
                        So, that’s why you called.

                                 CELESTE
                        Yeah, I’ve been on a real winning 
                        streak, so I thought I’d call you.

                                 PAUL
                        You know what? I’m happy you did.
           At that moment, CRACK! Lucky has Celeste in a bear hug and it 
           looks like she may have broken her back.

                                 CELESTE
                        AHHHH! I don’t know what your 
                        definition of relaxing is but...

                                 PAUL
                        Just wait. Trust me, you need this 
                        right now.

           EXT. PHO SIAM-NIGHT

           Celeste and Paul exit. He has a huge smile on his face. She 
           looks like she’s in pain.

                                 CELESTE
                        Why would you take me to a place 
                        where Asian people beat you up? 
                        That was absolute torture.

                                 PAUL
                        How do you feel?

           Celeste takes a beat to see how she feels.

                                 CELESTE
                        I feel great, actually.

                                 PAUL
                        So shut up then.

                                 CELESTE
                        Where are we going now?

                                 PAUL
                        Don’t try to control me. You need 
                        to let go. In yoga, we call it 
                        vairyaga.

           He strikes a reverse triangle yoga pose in the parking lot.

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh my god, don’t, with the yoga.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DOWNTOWN CLUB-NIGHT

           Celeste and Paul walk down stairs into an incredibly cool- 
           looking speak easy. Teddy Pendegrass’ “Love TKO” is playing 
           and people are dancing, actually dancing. 
           No one is there to be seen, there is no pretention. It’s 
           pretty much the coolest place Celeste has ever been to in LA. 

                                 CELESTE
                        This place is...really cool.

                                 PAUL
                        You sound surprised.

                                 CELESTE
                        I am, Westwood condo.

                                 PAUL
                        I’ll get us beers.

           Celeste takes in the atmosphere for a moment. She is happy to 
           be out and out of her element. She takes her hair down, puts 
           her hands through it, trying to look a little better.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           Paul is on the dance floor, with two beers. Celeste meets 
           him, takes her beer, and downs a third of it. Celeste looks 
           up and Paul has started to dance. He looks at Celeste with 
           jocular seduction. He’s actually not a bad dancer. Maybe he’s 
           good? Okay, no, he’s great.  Paul pulls Celeste in and they 
           dance together. She’s sort of embarrassed but she’s having 
           fun. Paul pulls away in a little spin and goes into a James 
           Brown splits move. 

                                 CELESTE
                        Ohh!!

           Celeste is into it now. She dances around him, other people 
           watch them. Paul pulls Celeste in close. Celeste kisses Paul, 
           to his surprise.

                                 PAUL
                        What was that for?

                                 CELESTE
                        Vairyaga, bro, let go. Not 
                        everything has to have a reason.

           They smile at each other.

           INT. CELESTE’S HOUSE-THE NEXT MORNING

           The doorbell rings. Celeste opens the door and Beth is 
           standing there in a state. Her face is tear-stained. Lots of 
           crying women at the door in the past 24 hours.
                                 BETH
                        I’m fucked.

                                 CELESTE
                        Come in. What happened?

           Celeste walks Beth into the kitchen.

                                 BETH
                        I slept with somebody before my 
                        wedding.

                                 CELESTE
                        What? What do you mean?

                                 BETH
                        I slept with Todd.

                                 CELESTE
                        Work Todd?

                                 BETH
                        Yes, work Todd. You know, he’s been 
                        hitting on me for so long and we 
                        were drunk and in New York and I 
                        don’t know. Please don’t be Judge 
                        Judy right now.

                                 CELESTE
                        I don’t judge you. At all. Todd’s 
                        been into you for a while. Also, 
                        getting married is a big deal.

                                 BETH
                        It would break Tucker’s heart. What 
                        do I do?

                                 CELESTE
                        Honestly, I don’t know what’s 
                        right. 

                                 BETH
                        Give me a break, you always know 
                        what’s right. Help me!!

                                 CELESTE
                        Well, you could tell him and hope 
                        he loves you enough to look past it 
                        or you could stow it away forever, 
                        and hope that your guilt doesn’t 
                        ruin your marriage. I love you and 
                        there is no right. I support you 
                        either way, whatever you do.
                                 BETH
                        Why are you being so balanced right 
                        now? Are you medicated?

                                 CELESTE
                        I’m not.

                                 BETH
                        Am I a terrible whore?

                                 CELESTE
                        You’re not terrible but you’re a 
                        whore. A cute whore.

           Beth giggles through her tears. She grabs Beth and gives her 
           a big hug as Beth cries.

           INT. TARGET-AFTERNOON

           Celeste is shopping for a dresser. She is talking to a 
           salesperson.

                                 SALESMAN
                        So, it comes with directions and 
                        it’s actually really easy to 
                        assemble.

                                 CELESTE
                        Look, you do not know me. I do not 
                        want to assemble. Trust me, you do 
                        not want me to assemble. Bad things 
                        happen. Could I just take the floor 
                        model? I’ll hook you up.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Lemme go ask my manager.

                                 CELESTE
                        Thanks, dude.

           Celeste is browsing and spots Veronica with a shopping cart 
           filled with baby stuff. She approaches her.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Veronica? Hey, Celeste.

                                 VERONICA
                        Of course, yeah, hi! What are you 
                        doing?

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh, I’m getting a dresser. You?
                                 VERONICA
                        Oh, you know getting...

                     VERONICA (CONT’D)
                                                         CELESTE
           Baby stuff.
                                              Baby stuff.

                                 CELESTE
                        Right. (laughs) Well, looks like 
                        you’re really organized. 

                                 VERONICA
                        Organized, terrified.

                                 CELESTE
                        You’ll do great.

                                 VERONICA
                        Thanks. I hope so.

           They share an awkward moment.

                                 VERONICA (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I never got a chance to 
                        just tell you I’m so sorry about 
                        all this. Trust me, I didn’t 
                        expect...

                                 CELESTE
                        No, don’t. Really. There’s nothing 
                        to apologize for. I’m the one who’s 
                        sorry. I mean, I dug through your 
                        trash.

           Celeste laughs.

                                 VERONICA
                        Look, I don’t blame you. For 
                        anything. This has all been so 
                        weird. Everything happened really 
                        fast. 

                                 CELESTE
                        Yeah, it did. But everything will 
                        work out. I know it.

                                 VERONICA
                        Thanks.

           An awkward silence.

                                 CELESTE
                        Well, good luck. Nice to see you.
                                 VERONICA
                        You too.

           They both steer their carts towards each other in opposite 
           directions but bump right into each other.

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh sorry!

                                 VERONICA
                        Oh, it’s okay! Bye again.

           INT. PAUL’S CONDO-NIGHT

           Celeste and Paul are playing scrabble and drinking wine. 

                                 PAUL
                        (keeping score on a notepad) So, 
                        that’s 38 points plus 50 bonus 
                        points for using all my tiles so...

                                 CELESTE
                        Wait, wait, wait. I think I may 
                        have to challenge. Zooecia?? That’s 
                        not a word, that’s my hoochie 
                        cousin’s name!

                                 PAUL
                        Are you challenging or not?

                                 CELESTE
                        Yes, I am.

                                 PAUL
                        Well, I will tell you that Zooecia 
                        is a sac secreted by a compound 
                        organism but here you go. (he hands 
                        her the Scrabble dictionary) Look 
                        for yourself.

           Celeste finds the word, reads the definition and silently 
           accepts defeat.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Ha ha! I go again.

                                 CELESTE
                        I’ve never lost a game of Scrabble 
                        in my life.

                                 PAUL
                        Well, nothing lasts forever.
           INT. PAUL’S LIVING ROOM- LATER

           Celeste and Paul are making out on the couch.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m so sorry I beat you in 
                        Scrabble.

                                 CELESTE
                        No you’re not.

                                 PAUL
                        You’re right, I’m not.

           The making out gets a little hotter. Celeste is aggressive.

                                 CELESTE
                        Will you get a condom?

                                 PAUL
                        Uh...I don’t think we should...

                                 CELESTE
                        No, you’re using a condom.

                                 PAUL
                        No, I don’t think we should sleep 
                        together.

           Celeste pulls away from him.

                                 CELESTE
                        What?

                                 PAUL
                        I just...I don’t know.

                                 CELESTE
                        Are you not into it?

                                 PAUL
                        No, no believe me, I’m into it. 

                                 CELESTE
                        Then, what’s the deal?

                                 PAUL
                        I really like you.

                                 CELESTE
                        So, I’m confused...why not sleep 
                        with me then?
                                 PAUL
                        Because I think I might really like 
                        you.

                                 CELESTE
                        Oh. (further realizing) Oh. Okay. 
                        Well, I like you too.

           Celeste looks distant.

           INT. NIGHTCLUB-VIP AREA

           We see Celeste sitting in a very loud club. She is sipping 
           champagne. She is surrounded by trendy 20-year olds, writhing 
           and dancing in sexy clothes. One of them is Riley. Celeste 
           looks out of place.

                                 RILEY
                        I LOVE THIS SONG! THERE’S SO MANY 
                        HOT GUYS HERE!

           Celeste looks out amongst the crowd. It is looking like there 
           are a lot of hot guys. But they are definitely all gay.

                                 CELESTE
                        IS THIS A GAY CLUB?

                                 RILEY
                        I DON’T THINK SO! THIS IS THE 
                        HOTTEST NEW CLUB IN LA!

                                 CELESTE
                        WHAT’S THE NAME OF IT?

                                 RILEY
                        SWALLOW!

                                 CELESTE
                        HUH.

           Celeste checks her phone and sees a text from Paul that says, 
           “Can I see you again this week? I may let you sleep with me.” 
           It makes her giggle. Just then, two beefy, waxed, tanned, 
           well-groomed gay men walk up to Celeste.

                                 GAY MAN
                        Excuse me, can you please tell your 
                        friend Riley that we worship her??

                                 GAY MAN #2
                        OMG, she’s so pretty!
                                 CELESTE
                        I’ll tell her!

           Celeste notices that they are both wearing the Riley Banks t-
           shirts, made for pre-teens, with the cock-in-the-butt mistake 
           in the logo. She points at it.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Are you aware that the logo is...

                                 GAY MAN #2
                        A dick in a butt? Yeahhh!

                                 GAY MAN
                        It’s amazing. All of our friends 
                        are rocking it. It’s like the gay 
                        Izod.

           The gay man points to a group of his friends on the dance 
           floor, ALL wearing Riley Banks gear, some of them have even 
           made their own t-shirts with the cock in the butt logo 
           magnified.

                                 CELESTE
                        Wow, so, what, you just buy the 
                        biggest size they make?

                                 GAY MAN
                        How dare you, I’m a size 10 in 
                        tween. I have a slight frame.

           They walk away, offended.  Celeste turns to Riley.

                                 CELESTE
                        Riley, you’re not gonna believe 
                        this but it turns out...

                                 RILEY
                        Not now, C, this really hot guy is 
                        kicking some serious game my way. 
                        Celeste, this is Bruce.

           Celeste looks at Bruce. He is wearing a Riley Banks cock in 
           the butt tee. Bruce is gay. Celeste just smiles politely. She 
           gets up and walks to the edge of the balcony and looks down 
           at the dance floor. There are tons of gay men wearing the 
           Riley Banks cock in the butt t-shirts. Wow, this is huge.

           EXT. RUNYON CANYON-MORNING

           Celeste is hiking alone on the phone, energized.
                                 CELESTE
                        We need to take advantage now, 
                        Scott.  Just be as gay as you can 
                        right now and we could change our 
                        company.  Ten percent of Americans 
                        are gay. Gay Izod. Huge market.

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m so glad you’re back, Celeste. 
                        Wow, the cock in the butt could 
                        work.

                                 CELESTE
                        The cock in the butt definitely 
                        works! The cock in the butt is 
                        huge!

           Just then, a mom with two children walk by her, overhear her 
           dirty mouth and glare at her. She waves at them self-
           consciously.

            INT. BEVERLY NAILS-AFTERNOON

           Celeste and Beth are getting pedicures and manicures.

                                 BETH
                        We fucked so much last night?! I 
                        mean, we have never fucked like 
                        that. Ever. It was like Tucker was 
                        trying to fuck that other guy out 
                        of me. I swear, telling him I 
                        fucked Todd might have been the 
                        best thing I’ve ever fucking done. 
                        Fuck!

                                 CELESTE
                        I’m so happy for you guys.

                                 MANICURIST
                        Stop. With your mouth. So filthy.

                                 BETH
                        Oh. Sorry. I just saved my 
                        marriage. So I’m really excited.

                                 MANICURIST
                        Oh you married, huh?

                                 BETH
                        Yes. Thank. The. Lord. (looks at 
                        Celeste) Oh sorry, I didn’t mean...
                                 CELESTE
                        No, I’m good. I’m good. 

                                 BETH
                        So you’ve really not talked to 
                        Jesse at all? That is so weird.

                                 CELESTE
                        No, it’s not. It’s actually better 
                        this way. I miss him though.

                                 BETH
                        How’s that guy?

                                 CELESTE
                        Who? Paul?

                                 BETH
                        Yeah. 

                                 CELESTE
                        He’s funny. I like him.

           INT. YUU YUU KARAOKE-LATER THAT NIGHT

           Celeste and Paul are in a private karaoke room. Paul is 
           belting his heart out, singing Boyz To Men, “On Bended Knee.” 
           Celeste is loving it. She has her own mike and pipes in once 
           in a while with a harmony.

                                 PAUL
                        Can somebody tell me how to get 
                        things back the way they used to 
                        be...oh God give me a reason, I’m 
                        down on bended knee..ooohohhh ooooh

                                 CELESTE
                        Ooohh ohhh. Til you come back to 
                        me..

                                 PAUL
                        I’m down on bended knee hee hee 
                        hee.

           They finish with a huge applause for themselves and toast 
           with beers.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I think we’re really good.

                                 CELESTE
                        No, we ARE really good.
           Celeste punches in the numbers for the next song. It’s 
           “Islands in the Stream,” made popular by Kenny Rogers and 
           Dolly Parton.

                                 PAUL
                        Aw shit!

                                 CELESTE
                        Get ready. You’re first.

                                 PAUL
                        Baby when I met you, there was 
                        peace on earth, I set out get you 
                        with a fine tooth comb. I was soft 
                        inside. Soft inside? What the fuck?

                                 CELESTE
                        Shhh come on. Focus.

                                 PAUL
                        You do something to me, that I 
                        can’t explain, hold me closer, and 
                        I feel no pain. Tender love is 
                        blind, it requires a dedication.

           Celeste and Paul sing in harmony.

                          CELESTE
           Honest love, we feel, needs 
           conversation. And we ride it 
           it together, uh huh...
                                                          PAUL
                                              Honest love, we feel, needs 
                                              conversation. And we ride it 
                                              it together, uh huh...

           Celeste slowly drops her mike. Paul is still singing.

                                 CELESTE
                        (quietly) I can’t.

                                 PAUL
                        What? Come on, we’re so good 
                        together. Islands in the stream, 
                        that is what we are. Get in there!! 
                        This is my favorite part!

                                 CELESTE
                        No. I can’t.

                                 PAUL
                        I know I’m pitchy but I’m finding 
                        it. Sail away with me...

                                 CELESTE
                        No. This. Us. I’m sorry.

           Paul slowly drops his mike.
                                 PAUL
                        What do you mean?

                                 CELESTE
                        I just...can’t.

                                 PAUL
                        Are you serious? Oh no. Why?

           He sits down on the couch. The music is still playing in the 
           background.

                                 CELESTE
                        I think I need to be alone. I’m not 
                        ready. I’m having fun and I feel 
                        like I’m beginning to like you and 
                        I don’t think I’m ready for that.

                                 PAUL
                        What? Really? 

           Celeste doesn’t say anything.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Wow, you’re breaking my heart.

                                 CELESTE
                        I’m so sorry. You are so...great. 
                        But I’m getting divorced. 

                                 PAUL
                        Celeste, I know.

                                 CELESTE
                        I think I need to go through this 
                        alone.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. Yeah, okay. I respect that. 
                        Live by will, not by force.

                                 CELESTE
                        What do you mean?

                                 PAUL
                        You’re only ready when you’re 
                        ready, you know? Don’t force it. 
                        It’s just some yoga shit.

                                 CELESTE
                        Thanks.
                                 PAUL
                        But I do like you. I like you a 
                        lot.  And when you are ready, if 
                        you’re ready, call me.

           INT. CELESTE’S PRIUS- MOMENTS LATER

           Celeste sits in her car alone, with tears in her eyes. Her 
           phone rings. It’s Jesse.

           EXT. LACMA-NIGHT

           Celeste sits on the steps in front of “Urban Light.” The 
           street lamps are now illuminated. She sits on a step below, 
           staring at the lights. Jesse approaches.

                                 JESSE
                        Hey.

                                 CELESTE
                        Hi.

                                 JESSE
                        Thanks for seeing me.  (referring 
                        to the lamps) I thought you hated 
                        these.

                                 CELESTE
                        Yeah, well, I never saw them at 
                        night. 

           Jesse looks at the lamps and takes them in.

                                 JESSE
                        I’m gonna talk right now and don’t 
                        interrupt, don’t nod your head. 
                        Don’t do anything. Just listen to 
                        me.

           Instinctively, Celeste starts to nod her head in 
           acknowledgement.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t. You were right. I’m a fuck 
                        up. I’m a loser, I will never 
                        change. I don’t know how to pay 
                        bills, I don’t like waking up 
                        early, I’m scared, I’m fucked. I 
                        don’t know what I’m doing.

           There is a long pause.
                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Veronica left.

                                 CELESTE
                        Left where?

                                 JESSE
                        Left me. She wanted me to tell her 
                        everything was gonna be okay and I 
                        couldn’t. I don’t know why but I 
                        just...couldn’t. She wants to go 
                        back to Antwerp.

           Another monumental pause. Jesse’s eyes start tearing up.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, you can say it now. You were 
                        right, I am and will always be 
                        disappointing. Just say it.

                                 CELESTE
                        Hey...don’t do that.

                                 JESSE
                        Do what?

                                 CELESTE
                        You are not a loser. You never 
                        were. You let go of me and you took 
                        a chance with someone else; I 
                        admire that. I was controlling and 
                        demanding and I never gave you room 
                        to grow.  We weren’t right 
                        together. 

                                 JESSE
                        Do you really believe that?

                                 CELESTE
                        I do. And thank you.

                                 JESSE
                        For what?

                                 CELESTE
                        For never being the person I wanted 
                        you to be.

                                 JESSE
                        Oh, your welcome. Wait, what?
                                 CELESTE
                        When we are no longer able to 
                        change the situation, we are 
                        challenged to change ourselves.

                                 JESSE
                        Huh?

                                 CELESTE
                        Skillz said that to me once. He’s a 
                        genius.

                                 JESSE
                        Don’t sleep on Skillz. Back to my 
                        missing pregnant fiancee for a 
                        second...

                                 CELESTE
                        Go get her. 

                                 JESSE
                        But I can’t tell her it’ll all be 
                        okay.

                                 CELESTE
                        Well, who can. Do you love her?

           Jesse looks at Celeste.

                                 JESSE
                        So much.

                                 CELESTE
                        Than it’s worth fighting for.

                                 JESSE
                        Okay. Okay.

           Celeste smiles with tears in her eyes.

                                 CELESTE
                        God, I finally understand why you 
                        fucking cry all the time. Shit is 
                        emotional.

           They share a laugh. Then, they sit in silence for a beat.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        You deserve to be happy. And I wish 
                        that for you, always.

                                 JESSE
                        Me too.
                                 CELESTE
                        So...I guess we were right.

                                 JESSE
                        Huh?

           Celeste makes the “C and J” hand gesture from the high school 
           photo in the opening montage. Jesse makes it back. They 
           smile. 

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        I love you.

           He kisses her on the lips. For the last time. And then, he’s 
           gone.

                                 CELESTE
                        I love you too.

           Celeste sits awhile and looks up at the sky.

           INT. CELESTE’S PRIUS- NEXT DAY

           Celeste drives and dials a number on her bluetooth.

                                 CELESTE
                        Hey. So, you’re probably giving 
                        your card to some girl in yoga 
                        right now. But if that doesn’t work 
                        out for you...I think I may be 
                        ready. To beat you in Scrabble. 

           EXT. GAS STATION- A MOMENT LATER

           Celeste runs in to pay for gas. She is on her Blackberry.

           INT. GAS STATION MART

           Celeste stands in line with some gum and water. A young man 
           blatantly cuts in front of her with a gallon of water. Old 
           Celeste returns for a moment.

                                 CELESTE
                        Excuse me, sir?

           The young man turns around. Celeste realizes she’s no longer 
           this person. She restrains herself.

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Nothing.
           Celeste takes in how she has changed. She smiles a little. 
           The young man turns back to her.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Hey, I’m sorry for cutting. My 
                        dog’s in the car and he’s really 
                        thirsty. So, thanks.

                                 CELESTE
                        No problem.

           She smiles again. The world feels bigger now.

                                                              FADE OUT.
