           EXT. WASHINGTON DC (ABOVE) - NIGHT

           WE MOVE over America’s Capitol.  It most definitely “Tis 
           the Season”.  CHRISTMAS LIGHTS are everywhere.  Tinsel 
           and decoration gleam--monuments are bathed in green and 
           red flood lights.  

           Sidewalks are crowded with PEDESTRIANS--”Christmas Sale” 
           bags in hand.  Smiles abound.  Goodwill easy to come by.  
           Unless you’re trying to drive in this furball.  The 
           streets are crowded.  Cars as far as the eye can see--one 
           of them is a piece of shit 1979 Bonneville.  

           GRAPHIC: DECEMBER 25th, 2011

           And right about now, it has half the cops in DC on its 
           tail.

           EXT. STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           TRACKING WITH BONNEVILLE: It bounces over a curb, and 
           cruises up a sidewalk.  Mailboxes.  Cafe tables.  HORN 
           HONKING, it plows over everything in its way...

           EXT. CAFE - NIGHT

           An OLD LADY gives the BLOWN BULB on a strand of Christmas 
           lights over the awning the skunk eye.

                                 OLD LADY
                        Abner!  Abner..!  Hurry up.  It’s 
                        cold out here.

           ABNER, the long-suffering husband comes out--ladder in 
           hand. He squares the SANTA HAT on his head--climbs up.

                                 OLD LADY (CONT’D)
                        That bulb ain’t gonna change 
                        itself.  What’s taking so long?  
                        Are you doing it right?  I’m going 
                        to catch my death waiting on you.  
                        Is that what you want?

                                 ABNER
                        Dear Santa...

                                 OLD LADY
                        What?  What did you say?
                                 (BEAT)
                        What is that racket..?

           VROOM!  The Bonneville roars up the street, right by that 
           cantankerous old hussy, and nails the ladder--an UNGODLY 
           melody of SIRENS in pursuit.  In a blink, they’re gone.

           So is Abner.
                                 OLD LADY
                        Abner!  Abner, you come back here 
                        this instant..

           INT. BONNEVILLE - CONTINUOUS

           THUMP--Abner lands on the hood.  He’s staring directly 
           into the crazy eyes of the guy behind the wheel--JAMES 
           SMITH.  A man who looks like he has had 2,555 bad days in 
           a row. 

           A large BACK PACK lays next to him on the seat, next to 
           that, a FUTURISTIC ASSAULT RIFLE.  Riding shotgun, is a 
           pretty girl trying really hard to not freak out--RILEY 
           HOLLAND.  

           She records everything with a TINY CAMCORDER.

                                 RILEY
                        Smith...there’s a guy on the 
                        windshield.

           Santa hat blowing in the wind, Abner SCREAMS his head off 
           like a freaked out suction cup Garfield.

                                 SMITH
                        I wish he’d stop doing that.

           He does it again.   

                                 RILEY
                        Shouldn’t you do something about 
                        this?

           Smith flips on the wipers.

                                 RILEY (CONT’D)
                        Something else...

           Smith points the Assault Rifle at Abner’s face through 
           the windshield.

                                 SMITH
                        Do you mind?

           Abner climbs onto the roof.

           INT. DC METRO HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

           A SPOTTER watches the car chase below--The White House 
           visible in the distance.

                                 SPOTTER

           Riley consults a “cartoon” tourist map--as Abner screams.

                                 ABNER (O.C.)
                        Oh my God!  

                                 SMITH
                        This the right street?

                                 RILEY
                        Uh...

                        I don’t wanna die..!

           Smith pounds on the roof.

                                 SMITH
                        Knock it off!
                                 (to Riley)
                        Tonight, Honey...

                                 RILEY
                        It’s a fast food tourist map.  If 
                        you’re in the mood for McMuffin-y 
                        goodness, we’re golden.  But it 
                        doesn’t say back door to the White 
                        House “This Way”, you know.  

           A Police Car careens out of a side street just ahead of 
           them.  Smith sheers the front bumper off with the tank of 
           a Bonneville.

           The Spotter calls the circus below.

                        On 18th, heading towards Virginia.  
                        Looks like he’s aiming for 
                        President Park...

           EXT. PRESIDENT PARK - NIGHT

           Secret Service GUARDS swarm the lush grass of President 
           Park--SWAT ready and manning reinforced barricades.

           Tourists snap photos--this kind of shit doesn’t happen 
           back in Spokane.  DC METRO COPS scream at them to go be 
           somewhere else.
           INT. BONNEVILLE - NIGHT

           Smith rockets towards the road block at President Park--
           dozens of rifles pointed in his direction.

                                 SMITH
                        On the floor board.  Hang on.

                                 RILEY
                        You’re not gonna...

           Smith stomps the gas.

                                 RILEY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, crap.  You’re gonna.

           The first bullet cracks the windshield.  It has friends.

           ON ROOF:

           Abner goes bug-eyed, staring down 100 gun barrels.

                                 ABNER
                        Aw, nuts...

           He let’s go and sails like one of Santa’s reindeer into 
           the night.

           EXT. PRESIDENT PARK - CONTINUOUS

           The guns open up on the Bonneville.  About now, it’s 
           obvious that big assed hunk of Detroit was chosen for 
           this moment.  Engine steaming, tires flattened, the 
           Bonneville SLAMS into the police cruisers.

           They part like the Red Sea.

           INT. BONNEVILLE - CONTINUOUS

           Smith lays in the seat, to the tune of Riley’s screams.  
           Glass showers.  Bullets pound Morse Code into the car.

           Still going...

           EXT. PRESIDENT PARK - CONTINUOUS

           The weight and momentum of the charging Bonneville, 
           combined with that of the Cruisers, snaps the concrete 
           drive barriers.  The shot to shit car lumbers across the 
           perfectly manicured grounds, fishtailing towards the 
           White House two blocks away.

           Until, out of nowhere, a black SUV nails it squarely at 
           the rear axle.  The Bonneville spins violently on the 
           grass--tireless rims dig in.  It flips.
           INT. BONNEVILLE - CONTINUOUS

           Hands drag Smith and Riley out before the car has even 
           stopped moving.

           EXT. BONNEVILLE - CONTINUOUS

           Tactical Boots step on their necks.

                                 SMITH
                        The trunk...

                                 GUARD #1

                                 SMITH
                        Look in the trunk.

                                 GUARD #3
                        I want a perimeter five blocks 
                        out.  There might be others.

                                 RILEY
                        Open the damned trunk, Barney..!

           Guards stop cold, eyeing the trunk of the destroyed 
           Bonneville for a BEAT.

                                 GUARD #3
                        Fall back!

                        I need EOD on site.  We may have a 
                        bomb...

           As he and Riley are dragged away...

                                 SMITH
                        Just open it!  Just look inside...

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Pissed and bleeding, Smith sits in a chair in a painfully 
           bright room.  ARMED GUARDS stand post inside the door, as 
           the cold eyes of Marine COLONEL “BO” BODETTE stare into 
           Smith’s soul and out the other side.  

           Bodette sets Smith’s futuristic assault rifle on the 
           table--scarred and scratched, this thing has been around.  
           Next to it, Smith’s back pack and six mags of ammo.
                                 COLONEL BODETTE
                        We’re gonna play a little game, 
                        Son.  I’m gonna ask questions.  If 
                        your answers fill me with an 
                        overwhelming compulsion to yell 
                        bullshit in an unbelieving 
                        fashion, I’m gonna stomp you in 
                        places you don’t want to be 
                        stomped.  Are we clear?

                                 SMITH
                        I’ll tell you anything you wanna 
                        know...after you look in the 
                        trunk.

                                 COLONEL BODETTE
                        That set off radiological sensors 
                        all over town.
                                 (points to gun)
                        But it ain’t the low level Alpha 
                        radiation emitted from this weapon 
                        that has got me buffaloed.  No, 
                        it’s how you came across such a 
                        very classified, depleted uranium 
                        round firing, assault weapon 
                        prototype.  This is the XM-97, 
                        Mark One, Mod One.  And, there’s 
                        only one of these in the world.  

                                 SMITH
                        Any minute now, you’re gonna 
                        experience a whole new level of 
                        “Oh Shit”.  Stop wasting time...

           Bodette shakes a device about the size of a BLACK BERRY 
           at Smith--it’s peppered with buttons inscribed with 
           foreign characters.  

                                 COLONEL BODETTE
                        This a detonator?  

           EXT. PRESIDENT PARK - NIGHT

           A BOMB ROBOT eases towards the rear of the Bonneville, 
           it’s arm slowly extending towards the trunk.  A block 
           away, a blast proof EOD truck idles.

           Police Lt. gives Bodette the folder--he peruses.  

                                 COLONEL BODETTE

           EXT. PRESIDENT PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Slowly, inch by creeping inch, the Bomb Robot lifts the 
           trunk lid...
           INT. OVAL OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

           PRESIDENT MALLOY, fifty years of political animal in a 
           suit, sits behind his desk sipping scotch.  Dark circles 
           under his eyes.  This is a SAD, SAD MAN.    

           SECRETARY OF DEFENSE KRONAU, a man who has the perpetual 
           look of a viper ready to strike, strolls in.  He takes in 
           Malloy and his drink, and pours himself one.

                                 KRONAU
                        No salvation at the bottom of this 
                        bottle, Mr. President.  I should 
                        know.  

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        How did you get through it?  How 
                        does anybody get through this?

           Kronau drains his glass in one pass.

                                 KRONAU
                        Who says I have?  

           He pours another and has a seat opposite Malloy.

                                 KRONAU (CONT’D)
                        Twelve years and every morning I 
                        still expect to wake up next to 
                        her.  

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Thanks for coming to their 
                        funeral.    

                                 KRONAU
                        Don’t.  I was just there for the 
                        photo op.

           AGENT DAWES, a walking recruitment poster, and the 
           President’s personal Agent, enters--pale as a ghost.

                                 AGENT DAWES
                        Mr. President...there’s something 
                        you have to see.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #2 - NIGHT

           In a room similar to Smith’s, Riley waits--TWO GUARDS as 
           well.  She eyes their guns.

                                 RILEY
                        I really hope those are loaded.

           Bodette storms in, and slaps the folder on the table.  
                                 COLONEL BODETTE
                        James Thomas Smith is in a jail 
                        cell five miles from here.  He’s 
                        also sitting in a room thirty feet 
                        from where I’m standing.  How?

                                 RILEY
                        They’re coming.   

                                 COLONEL BODETTE
                        Who’s coming?

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #1 - CONTINUOUS

           The table flipped over.  The chair across the room.  
           Hands now tied behind his back, Smith kicks at the door.

                                 SMITH
                        Do something now!  Time is running 
                        out.  It’s always running out...

           HALLWAY OUTSIDE

           The Guards, now outside the door, trade a look.  They can 
           sense it in their bones--something about this guy.

           EXT. PRESIDENT PARK - NIGHT

           The Bonneville wreck is surrounded by six-foot tall men 
           in black suits, armed to the teeth--SECRET SERVICE 
           AGENTS.

           EXT. BONNEVILLE - CONTINUOUS

           The Bomb Robot is still there--mechanical arm aimed into 
           the trunk’s darkness, as President Malloy, Sec Def 
           Kronau, Agent Dawes, and Colonel Bodette stare inside.  

           Their faces are the textbook definition of thunderstruck.  
           Whatever they’re seeing simply does not compute.  It’s a 
           long moment before anyone can speak.

                                 KRONAU
                        What the hell is that?

                                 COLONEL BODETTE
                        Better question...where the hell 
                        does that come from?

           BEAT.

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                                 (to Kronau)
                        Recall the Joint Chiefs.  Space 
                        Command.  NASA.  
           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #1 - NIGHT

           President Malloy, Colonel Bodette, Sec Def Kronau, and 
           Agent Dawes stare at Smith across the table.  Complete 
           silence.  Complete shock.   

           Complete horror.

                                 COLONEL BODETTE
                        Those are Black.  How can you know 
                        about those projects...

                                 SMITH
                        Am I speakin’ Greek here?  Take a 
                        shot in the dark, Pal.  You gotta 
                        have something...

                                 KRONAU
                                 (to Bodette)
                        The ArchAngel Project...

                                 SMITH
                        Oh, hell no.  No!  Bad idea.  
                        Don’t even think about that one.  
                        Something else.  Anything.

                                 KRONAU
                        There is nothing else...just...

           Kronau is shaking so bad, he fades.  Smith SLAPS the 
           table in front of him--scaring the shit out of all.

                                 SMITH
                        Just what?

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #2 - CONTINUOUS

           Riley sits quietly alone, her foot tapping like a jack 
           hammer--eyes glued to a clock on the wall.

           Then, A SOUND--like groaning metal, but not quite.  
           Almost sorrowful.  Louder...

                                 RILEY
                        Oh...crap.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #1 - CONTINUOUS

           Just as loud in here.  Where is it coming from?  Growing 
           ever louder, the answer is as unsettling as it is 
           apparent--EVERYWHERE.

           Eyes are wide--blood turns to ice water before our eyes.  
           But, not Smith--he just sighs.
                                 AGENT DAWES
                        Mr. President, we have to get you 
                        out of the area.  Now.

           Dawes drags Malloy to the door, Bodette on their heels.  
           Kronau gets yanked back by the collar...

                                 SMITH
                        What’s his name?

           Kronau tries to wriggle free of Smith’s grasp, panicked.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        The name, man.  The name!

                                 KRONAU
                        Oro.

           He gets free and makes for the door.

                                 KRONAU (CONT’D)
                        Dr. Constantine Oro.

           Smith scribbles the name on the back of his hand, and 
           runs for the door--it closes on it’s own, right in his 
           face.  Locked.  

                                 SMITH
                        God, I hate the Holidays.  

           EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PARK - NIGHT

           The air around the wrecked Bonnevile seems to fracture, 
           as if the atmosphere was breaking like glass...

           INT. EOD TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           The Black & White monitors of the Bomb Robot are still on-
           -we see what it sees...

           A cloudy REPTILIAN EYE, as big as a tea cup, fills the 
           monitor, fixed in a death stare.  

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #1 - NIGHT

           Church mouse quiet, Smith hunches against a wall.  
           GUNFIRE in the hallway.  Screams.  WHAM--someone bounces 
           off the door.  

           The BODY OF ONE OF THE GUARDS CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL 
           just over his head!  Bloody, dead, and hanging through 
           the sheet rock, bent at the waist.  Dead eyes stare at 
           Smith upside down--terror forever frozen on the face.  
           Suddenly, the body is JERKED out of the hole in the wall.
           As horns, gunshots, screams, explosions, and chaos 
           outside crescendo into audio focus, a shadow oozes over 
           Smith.  Something just stuck its head through that hole.  
           Something big...  

           CLOSE ON SMITH:

           He doesn’t even move his eyes.  A SNIFF.  Another.  
           Inches above his head.  Something reddish drips onto him.  
           Saliva.  BLOODY SALIVA.

           It’s a moment of hell that won’t stop.  Then, the shadow 
           disappears.  IT, whatever IT is, has left.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #2 - CONTINUOUS

           Empty.  Only a ceiling tile a little off kilter...

           INT. CEILING - CONTINUOUS

           Riley lays in the dark--a single sliver of fluorescent 
           light carves across her face.

           Gunshots.  Close.  Someone screams.  Silence.  Right 
           outside her door.  

           A CREAK--the door of her room opens!  Something is moving 
           down there, just under her.  She tries like hell to hold 
           her breath, but it escapes in quiet little whimpers.

           The tile in front of her moves--Riley vaporlocks in wide-
           eyed horror as the tile slides back ever so slowly.  
           There’s nothing she can do.  Nowhere to go.

           Just as her heart is about to burst in her chest, Smith’s 
           head pokes through the ceiling.  

                                 RILEY
                                 (hissing)
                        Asshole.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #2 - MOMENTS LATER

           Smith motions for Riley to climb down, gesturing that 
           he’ll catch her, and...

           ...giving her the “SHHH” sign.  He points--something is 
           in the hallway.  Carefully, she dangles her legs down.  
           The ceiling gives way!  Tiles CRASH down as she falls 
           onto Smith--they slam into the table, causing it to 
           SCREECH across the tiled floor.  

           They leap up, hearts pounding--staring at the door in a 
           panic.  Waiting.  

           But, nothing happens.
           EXT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Smith and Riley ease along a destroyed hallway.  Bullet 
           holes.  BLOOD.  Shattered sheet rock.

                                 RILEY
                                 (whispers)
                        Running away...  

                                 SMITH
                        Huh?

                                 RILEY
                        See how good it sounds?    

                                 SMITH
                        We can’t.

                                 RILEY
                        We’ll try again tomorrow...or, 
                        yesterday.  Whatever.  Let’s just 
                        go...go...all...Poof.  Please?  

                                 SMITH
                        They took the The Thing.  We can’t 
                        go.    

                                 RILEY
                        The Thing..?

                                 SMITH
                        The Thing.  The clicker.  The...

           She slaps him in the back of the head Grandma style.

                                 RILEY
                        Oh my God, you let them take The 
                        Thingy?

                                 SMITH
                        What have I told you about hitting 
                        me?  It’s gotta be in one of these 
                        offices, OK?  

           Riley picks up a discarded M4.

                                 SMITH
                                 (re: gun)
                        Those just piss them off.

           Screw you--Riley hangs onto the M4.
           INT. WHITE HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

           MP5’s and Sig Sauer pistols spray the hallway, as Agent 
           Dawes, Colonel Bodette, Kronau, and President Malloy run 
           for their lives--half a dozen SECRET SERVICE AGENTS cover 
           them.

           The lights flicker OFF.

           Men scream in the dark.  Faces of agony and terror are 
           briefly illuminated by strobe light staccato muzzle 
           flashes.  

           The lights flicker back ON.

           Only Malloy, Kronau, and Bodette are left, and they’re 
           streaked in blood.  It isn’t theirs.

           Bodette empties an MP5 down the hall--drops it and grabs 
           two more off the floor.  He slams one into the 
           President’s hand.

                                 COLONEL BODETTE
                        Move your Presidential ass, Sir.

           Kronau is already beating feet down the hall--Malloy 
           follows.  

           Jaw set, Bodette stands and delivers--firing at whatever 
           it is coming down the dark hall.

           TRACKING WITH MALLOY & KRONAU:

           Running for their lives from God knows what down White 
           House hallways.  Somewhere behind them, the last ROAR of 
           a warrior--Bodette goes down. 

           INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

           Smith kicks open the door of an office--more blood on the 
           floor and massive holes in the walls.

           On a desk are his belongings--his back pack, the XM-97, 
           and the BLACK BERRY.  He locks and loads--plunders in his 
           back pack for a small CAMCORDER, which he hands to Riley.

                                 SMITH
                        Film it.

                                 RILEY
                        Where are the bodies?

           Come to think of it, we haven’t seen a single dead body.  
           Smith shoots her a look--she knows the answer.
                                 SMITH
                        The President.  Nothing else 
                        matters.  No matter what you see.  
                        No matter what you hear.  OK?

           Scared shitless, she nods.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Don’t lose sight of me.  Keep your 
                        hand on my shoulder.  No matter 
                        what.  Ready?

                                 RILEY
                        Hell no.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE COMPOUND - NIGHT

           There’s a flaming helicopter wreck smoking on the ground.  
           Cars are flipped.  Fires in the distance.  Sirens.  
           Sporadic gunfire.

           Smith exits one of the buildings, Riley glued to his back-
           -they make for the White House across the lawn.  As they 
           do, they’re greeted by BONE CHILLING SOUNDS emanating 
           from the darkness of night.  Engines screech overhead--
           aircraft of some kind.  And the screams.  Primal and 
           petrified.  It’s as if everyone in the entire city of 
           Washington DC is screaming...

           Because they are.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

           President Malloy and Kronau make it to an underground 
           safe room.  No dice.  The metal blast door has been 
           ripped off the hinges.  Blood is everywhere--no bodies.

                                 KRONAU
                        There’s no one left.  Oh, 
                        God...there’s no one left!

           Malloy is in obvious shock.

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        They’ll come for me.  We’re under 
                        attack, and they’ll come for me...

                                 KRONAU
                        There’s no them left.  

           Kronau rips the MP5 out of Malloy’s hand and runs.

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Kronau!  Don’t leave me here!  
                        Kronau..?
           A BEAT later, Kronau runs back into sight--chased.  
           Something grabs him from behind.  He falls to the floor 
           screaming bloody murder--his body tenses, squeezing off 
           the MP5.  The rounds nail Malloy in the chest.

           The President drops to his knees, while Kronau is dragged 
           screaming God knows where, by God knows what.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           Smith and Riley head in the direction of Kronau’s 
           screams.

           INT. HALLWAY AT SAFE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Malloy reaches out to Smith and Riley as they approach.

                                 SMITH
                                 (to Riley)
                        You recording?

           She nods.  Smith kneels next to the dying man.

                                 SMITH
                        Mr. President, where were you 
                        yesterday?

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Help me...

           Smith shakes him by the collar.

                                 SMITH
                        Listen to me!  Where were you 
                        yesterday? 

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        I’m dying.

                                 SMITH
                        Everyone is dying.  Where were 
                        you?  Did you have a distress 
                        code?  A password?  Some security 
                        phrase?  I need you to tell me 
                        everything about that day.  Do you 
                        understand?  Every detail.

           FURTHER DOWN THE HALL:

           Something is coming.  Something big...

           SOMETHING POV:  Nine feet off the ground--moving towards 
           the three people at the end of the hall.

           WITH SMITH & RILEY:
           She sees it.

                                 RILEY
                        Smith...

           Malloy is dead--his head lolls lifeless.  Smith reaches 
           into the dead man’s shirt and retrieves a RED PLASTIC 
           CARD, sealed in a plastic case.  Then, he retrieves a 
           pair of CUTTERS from his backpack--places one of Malloy’s 
           fingers between the blades...

                                 RILEY
                        Smith!

           Smith whips around--grabs Riley and throws her into the 
           doorless saferoom.  He raises the XM-97, and...CLICK.

                                 SMITH
                        Damn, friggin’..!

           Jammed.  He tries like hell to clear the weapon--stepping 
           back to put distance between him and the SNARLING death 
           coming from the shadows.  He fuckin’ trips over the dead 
           President--flat on his back.

           SOMETHING POV: It’s almost on top of him.  A few feet 
           away.  Then...

           Riley empties that M4 on full Auto from the safe room.  
           Smith was right--from the SNARLING that just pissed it 
           off.  She drops the M4 and yanks a loose PIPE out of a 
           broken wall--leaps over Smith and charges towards the 
           shadows...

           Smith is up--yanks her back by the collar.  BOOM BOOM.  
           THUMP.  Weapon cleared, he drops the “IT” that we never 
           see before Riley gets to it.  

                                 SMITH
                        Don’t ever do that again.

                                 RILEY
                        Hello, gratitude...

                                 SMITH
                        Never take one of them on alone.  
                        Ever.  You run next time.  Far and 
                        fast.  If you don’t have this 
                        weapon, you run.  Do you 
                        understand me?  Never. I can’t 
                        watch you die again.  Don’t do 
                        that to me.

           A tired smile bends her lips.  
                                 RILEY
                        I love you, too.  Can we go now?

           No sooner is the question asked...

           The wall behind Riley EXPLODES in a cloud of sheet rock!  
           SOMETHING drags her through it.  Screaming bloody murder.

           Smith blasts into the wall with the XM-97, killing 
           whatever it was.  He pulls Riley back through, but she’s 
           in a bad, bad way.  Her legs bleed heavily--shredded.

           Smith rips her shirt for a bandage--feverishly trying to 
           stop the blood loss.

                                 RILEY
                        Let it bleed.  Let’s just go.

           He locks eyes with her--she’s already going pale.      

                                 RILEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m OK.  I can do it.

           Her legs all but useless, and leaving a river of a blood 
           trail, Smith pulls her down the hall.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           They exit the White House, Smith’s arms around the dead 
           weight that is Riley.  She’s DEAD.  He drags her for 
           several steps, refusing the truth.  

           But, the weight of his pack, the XM-97, and her dead 
           weight are too much.  Smith lays her down in the grass.  
           He has no words.  He has no tears.  Just weariness in his 
           sad eyes. 

           Smith takes the CAMCORDER from Riley’s hand.  Aiming it 
           at himself, he heads across the lawn towards President 
           Park--the BLACKBERRY in his other hand.

                                 SMITH
                                 (to camcorder)
                        Christmas, 2011. Failure.  

           He tosses a baleful glance back at Riley.

                                 SMITH
                        See you yesterday, Cupcake.

           He presses a few of the hundred buttons on the BlackBerry 
           device, and...

           Nothing.  He tries again.  Nada.
           Something SCREAMS from the sky--an F-18, flaming and 
           broken in half, streaks directly towards him.  Smith runs 
           for everything he’s worth, pounding that damned 
           BlackBerry like his life depended on it.

                                 SMITH
                        Come on...come on!  You piece 
                        of...

           WHAM--the jet hits the ground a hundred feet behind him, 
           EXPLODING into a jet fuel fireball.  He jackhammers the 
           button on the device.

           Running at a full gallop, the air around him begins to 
           fracture--the relentless fireball overtakes him...

           EXT. PRESIDENT PARK - MORNING BEFORE

           Smith APPEARS OUT OF THIN AIR.  His clothes smoking in 
           the morning light--blackened from fire, covered in dried 
           blood.  

           But, all is quiet.  Tourists.  The white noise of 
           traffic.  There’s nothing out of the ordinary at all.  

           It’s as if the preceding had never happened.  

           Because it hasn’t yet.

           GRAPHIC: DECEMBER 24th, 2011.

           Smith tucks the XM-97 under his jacket, and blends into 
           the unremarkable morning bustle of DC.

           INT. GRAYHOUND BUS - DAY

           Smith is asleep--the NYC skyline visible in the distance.

           He wakes with a START--the sudden move freaks out those 
           sitting next to him.  Smith calms down.  No danger here.  
           Not yet.  He checks his watch.  A TIMER COUNTS DOWN.

           A LITTLE GIRL sitting next to him, all of seven, nods.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Bad dreams.  

                                 SMITH
                        What?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Bad dreams.  I have them, too.  
                        They suck.  They say it’s your 
                        subconscious, but I don’t believe 
                        it.
                                 SMITH
                        I don’t dream.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Everybody dreams.  

                                 SMITH
                        Not for much longer.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I’m going to my Mom’s for 
                        Christmas.  

           Smith could give a shit.  She tries again.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I’m going to be a psychiatrist.  

                                 SMITH
                        Fantastic.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        When I grow up.
                                 (whispers)
                        Then I’m gonna help my dad stop 
                        drinking.

           Smith eyes the LUSH passed out on the other side of her--
           a bottle of OLD CROW peeking out of his coat.  

                                 LITTLE GIRL (CONT’D)
                        So he and mom will get back 
                        together.  I asked Santa for that 
                        last year, but I didn’t get it.  
                        So, I’m gonna do it myself.  
                        That’s a good plan, right?

                                 SMITH
                        Good plan.

           INT. BUS STOP RESTROOMS - DAY

           The Little Girl enters the Ladies’ Room, leaving her Lush 
           father swaying against the wall.  Smith approaches.

                                 SMITH
                        Cute kid.  Your daughter?

                                 LUSH
                        What’s it to ya?

           Smith shoves the XM-97 into the Lush’s ample gut.

                                 LUSH
                        I don’t have any money, man.  I 
                        don’t have any...
           Smith slaps him--yanks the Old Crow out of his jacket.

                                 SMITH
                        You’re not going to drink any more 
                        of this today.  

                                 LUSH
                        What..?

                                 SMITH
                        You’re going to do anything your 
                        daughter wants to do.  You’re 
                        gonna treat today like it was her 
                        last day on Earth.  You’re going 
                        to spoil her rotten.  You’re gonna 
                        tell her you love her a hundred 
                        times, and you’re gonna be sober 
                        for it.  Right?

                                 LUSH
                        Yeah...yeah...whatever you say.

                                 SMITH
                        Or, I’ll come down your chimney 
                        tonight, and break things you 
                        didn’t know could be broken.  You 
                        readin’ me, Prancer?

           Smith pulls a few bills out of a pocket, and hands them 
           to the sobbing wreck of man before him.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Let her open her presents tonight.

           He walks away, swiggin’ the hooch.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Riley delivers a steaming cup of coffee to a PATRON, and 
           retreats behind the counter to talk smack with her friend 
           JOY--the EMO lady at the register, who is entirely too 
           old to be EMO.

                                 JOY
                                 (re: patron)
                        Look at ‘em.  He makes me sick.

                                 RILEY
                        Everybody makes you sick, Joy.

                                 JOY
                        Yeah, but this guy...this guy 
                        deserves something awful.  Truly 
                        awful.  
                                 RILEY
                        I went all Llama on his coffee.

                                 JOY
                        You spit in it?

                                 RILEY
                        I did.

                                 JOY
                        You are so lying.

                                 RILEY
                        OK, I’m lying.  But, I wanted to.  
                        Bad, Joy.  Real bad.

           Smith enters--has a seat.  Joy pings him with the bitch 
           radar.

                                 JOY
                        Look at this winner. 

                                 RILEY
                        Hello.  Have him bathed and 
                        brought to my tent.

                                 JOY
                        My dear, that is a clear cut case 
                        for a flea dipping.

           Riley grabs her order pad.

           INT. SMITH’S TABLE - CONTINUOUS

           Riley approaches--NOT A HINT OF RECOGNITION on her face.  
           She has no idea who he is.

                                 RILEY
                        Hi.  What can I get for you?

                                 SMITH
                        I’m sorry.  

                                 RILEY
                        I’m Riley.

                                 SMITH
                        It was my fault.  I swear to God, 
                        I won’t let it happen to you 
                        again.

                                 RILEY
                        Do I know you?

           Smith brushes hair out of her face, stands...
                                 SMITH
                        Not yet.

           ...and walks out.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           New York City.  

           The cemetery is a place of beauty, and presently it is 
           overflowing with NYPD POLICE, SECRET SERVICE AGENTS, and 
           NEWS CREWS beyond a security perimeter.

           EXT. GRAVESIDE - CONTINUOUS

           President Malloy stands stone-faced before two caskets--
           one of them a child’s.  

           MILITARY COLOR GUARD are at attention, as DIGNITARIES and 
           GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS look on.  The familiar faces of 
           Kronau and Agent Dawes aren’t too far away...

           EXT. OUTSIDE CEMETERY - CONTINUOUS

           A REPORTER speaks into a camera, the cemetery in the far 
           background.

                                 REPORTER
                        ...since the tragic helicopter 
                        crash that took the lives of the 
                        First Lady, and their daughter 
                        Sophia.  On this sad Christmas 
                        Eve, Flags are at half mast across 
                        the country, and across the world, 
                        as government leaders have 
                        expressed their condolences...

           ACROSS THE STREET

           More NYPD COPS ensure that no one in crowd comes too 
           close.  There aren’t that many people, just a couple of 
           dozen mourners with signs and banners of support for the 
           President...

           Among them, Smith--keeping his eye on the gates of the 
           cemetery, waiting...

           EXT. CEMETERY - CONTINUOUS

           The President enters the PRESIDENTIAL LIMO--Agent Dawes 
           holds the door open for him.
           INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMO - DAY

           President Malloy stares out the window blankly, his face 
           creased with sadness--Agent Dawes rides shotgun with a 
           DRIVER.

           EXT. STREETS (ABOVE) - DAY

           Some asshole in a Taxi is ripping off bumpers, 
           sideswiping buses, and causing all kinds of hell and 
           mayhem at 75 MPH.

           INT. TAXI CAB - CONTINUOUS

           Smith drives it like he stole it.  He glances at his 
           watch--a TIMER COUNTS DOWN: 07:57:02 and falling.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           The Taxi SCREECHES to a halt at the sidewalk.  Smith 
           leaps out and retrieves a Styrofoam Cooler, a jug of gas, 
           a paint brush, a bucket, and a coil of rope from the 
           trunk.

           He disappears into a nearby tenement.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Smith crushes up the Styrofoam and mixes it with the gas 
           in the bucket--the mixture turns into a jellied poor 
           man’s napalm.

           He ties the rope around his waist, the other end to a 
           pipe, and over the edge he goes.

           WITH SMITH ON SIDE OF TENEMENT

           Smith smears the gas jelly in large strokes across the 
           brick face with the paint brush.

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMO - CONTINUOUS

           President Malloy gazes out the window--lost in thought as 
           the city passes by...

           EXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Smith ditches the bucket, and pats himself down.  
           Whatever he’s looking for, he can’t find.

                                 SMITH
                        Son of a...

           A LITTLE BOY pokes his head out of a window, not five 
           feet from Smith.
                                 LITTLE BOY
                        Hi.

                                 SMITH
                        Hi...

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        Are you an Elf?

                                 SMITH
                        Yeah...yeah, I’m an Elf.  You got 
                        a match, Kid?  

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        Why do elves need matches?

                                 SMITH
                        I’m...would ya just get me a 
                        friggin’ match.

           The Little Boy looks like he’s about to cry.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        I’m tryin’ signal Santa.  

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        Really?

                                 SMITH
                        Yeah.  So, unless you want me to 
                        tell him what an uncooperative 
                        little bastard you are, you’ll 
                        make with a match.  You don’t 
                        wanna get on Santa’s shit list, 
                        Munchkin...  

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMO - CONTINUOUS

           Something catches President Malloy’s eye as he gazes out 
           the window.  Something he can’t believe he’s seeing.  

           Dawes turns to the President--just as stunned. 

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Stop the car.

           EXT. STREETS (ABOVE) - CONTINUOUS

           The whole motorcade comes to a stop in the middle of the 
           street.  Secret Service AGENTS pour out of SUV’s, 
           establishing an immediate perimeter--scaring the shit out 
           of everyone on the sidewalks.
           EXT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMO - CONTINUOUS

           President Malloy, Kronau, Agent Dawes, and the Driver 
           stare...

           A block away, three foot tall FLAMING LETTERS on the side 
           of a brick building--a fiery message reads:

           “RAZOR RED. 6BRAVO.”

                                 DRIVER
                        What does it mean?

           Dawes retrieves a red sealed plastic card from his 
           jacket, exactly like the one Smith took from Malloy 
           earlier--cracks it open...

                                 AGENT DAWES
                        It’s the President’s personal 
                        distress code...

           ...the card inside reads simply: “6BRAVO”.

                                 AGENT DAWES (CONT’D)
                        Authenticated.

           INT. NYPD STATION (DARK ROOM) - DAY

           President Malloy watches Smith sitting in the 
           interrogation room through a two way mirror.

           Agent Dawes enters.

                                 AGENT DAWES
                        Blood samples in his backpack.  
                        And a finger...
                                 (BEAT)
                        They’re both yours.

           Malloy looks at his hands--all ten are there.

                                 AGENT DAWES (CONT’D)
                        Gets better.  He has bone and 
                        tissue samples that are 
                        unidentifiable.  Not human.  Not 
                        animal.  They’re either from an as 
                        of yet undiscovered species on 
                        Earth.  Or, an as of yet 
                        undiscovered species...from some 
                        place else.

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Some place else...

                                 AGENT DAWES
                        See the videos?
                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Manipulated?

           Dawes shakes his head--hands the President a tiny piece 
           of plastic.

                                 AGENT DAWES
                        The hard drive out of one of his 
                        video cameras.  NYPD eggheads say 
                        it can hold three hundred 
                        terabytes of data.

           It’s no larger than a quarter.

                                 AGENT DAWES (CONT’D)
                        That technology does not exist 
                        today.  Not even in Japan.  Their 
                        still reviewing it, but it looks 
                        like he has years’ worth of 
                        videos.  He’s been documenting 
                        something. 

           Kronau enters with our old salty friend Colonel Bodette.

                                 KRONAU
                        This is Colonel Bodette, he’s in 
                        charge of the XM-97 program at the 
                        Pentagon.  I thought...

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Your prototype is accounted for.

                                 COLONEL BODETTE
                        Disassembled.  Non-functioning for 
                        the last three months.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Smith sits on one side of the table, President Malloy on 
           the other.  Agent Dawes stands over the President, while 
           a DOZEN NYPD OFFICERS keep an eye on Smith.

           Smith sighs like he’s done this a few times before.  

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        What are they?

                                 SMITH
                        Hungry.

           He reaches under his shirt, pulls off a leather strap 
           necklace, and tosses it on the table--several HUGE FANG-
           LIKE TEETH dangle from it.
                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Galactically speaking...turns out, 
                        we’re the other white meat.  
                        Cattle.  

           Uncomfortable glances fill the room.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Like a never ending food supply.  
                        They wipe us out on Tuesday, jump 
                        to Monday, do it all over again.  
                        Yesterday by yesterday.

           Smith’s trembling hand grabs a paper coffee cup, as 
           Malloy taps the BLACK BERRY.

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        This?

                                 SMITH 
                        I think it gets it’s power from 
                        their ships.  Don’t work till they 
                        come.  I stay a day ahead of them.  
                        It’s what they use.  They all have 
                        them.

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Just one day...

           Smith points at the hundred buttons of indecipherable 
           language.

                                 SMITH
                        Can you read that?  All I know is 
                        press five buttons in sequence, 
                        and I go one day back.  It’s 
                        damned near impossible to get one.  
                        You can kill ‘em.  They can be 
                        killed.  But they’re...wired.  
                        When they die, they disappear...  

                                 KRONAU
                        This is ridiculous...

                                 SMITH
                        Still diving for your wife in a 
                        bottle of scotch?

           Kronau lunges for Smith--is held back.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        This is the ninth time we’ve had 
                        this conversation.  Punchline’s 
                        always the same.
                                 (to Kronau)
                        And you’re always an asshole.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Kill them, their bodies go back to 
                        the Harvester ships, and they take 
                        anyone within ten feet with them.  
                        Keeps the cows from getting their 
                        technology.   

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        And I’m to believe you’ve done 
                        this every day for seven years...

           Despite the evidence, they obviously struggle to believe.  
           Smith notices--levels a glare at Malloy.

                                 SMITH
                        You’re wearing green boxers with 
                        white stripes.  Your wife bought 
                        them for you on your last trip to 
                        France.  You had a bagel and two 
                        eggs, over easy, for breakfast 
                        this morning.  And you cried 
                        yourself to sleep last night 
                        reading old love letters from your 
                        wife’s college days.  That’s what 
                        you told me when you died in my 
                        arms...tomorrow night.  And right 
                        now, you need to find Dr. 
                        Constantine Oro.

           Speechless comes to mind.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Can I have my gun back?

           With President Malloy, Colonel Bodette, and Kronau.

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        You explain it.  Forget for the 
                        moment we have one individual in 
                        two places at the same time...

                                 KRONAU
                        What do we tell the American 
                        people?  Hell, what do we tell the 
                        governments of the world?  

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        The Truth.  

                                 KRONAU
                        We’re looking at a Global panic.

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        I’m panicking.  Do what he says.  
                        I want this Dr. Oro located  ASAP.
                                 KRONAU
                        Oro?  Mr. President, have you ever 
                        met Dr. Oro?

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        No...why?

           EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

           The USS KITTY HAWK launches an F-18 Super Hornet off her 
           deck.

           TRACK WITH F-18

           Full afterburner, the Fighter rips over the water, 
           pulling up as it approaches...

           Malibu.

           EXT. DOWN TOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Our Malibu buzzing F-18 joins TWENTY OTHER FIGHTERS 
           patrolling the sky over the City of Angels.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

           APACHE ATTACK HELICOPTERS cruise in pairs between 
           skyscraper canyons, as F-16 Eagles and F-22 Raptors roar 
           overhead.

           PEDESTRIANS stare at the birds--these are New Yorkers, 
           they don’t panic that easily. 

           Then, the M1A ABRAMS TANKS roll by, followed by ARMY 
           SOLDIERS tricked out in full battle gear and armed to the 
           teeth.  

           Now they panic.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

           A PRESS SECRETARY speaks to REPORTERS.

                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                        ...and in response Department of 
                        Homeland Security has elevated the 
                        threat level to red, or severe, 
                        until more information is 
                        available...

           A REPORTER cuts him off.

                                 REPORTER
                        Can you give us any particulars?  
                        What’s the nature of the threat?  
                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                        Not at this time.

           A BLONDE REPORTER chimes in.

                                 BLONDE REPORTER
                        The sky over DC, New York, and 
                        several other cities is...

                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                        You may notice fighter aircraft.  
                        I’m told these are strictly 
                        precautionary measures to ensure 
                        the safety of the public.

                                 REPORTER
                        There are reports of Marines 
                        mobilizing at Pendleton and...

                                 BLONDE REPORTER
                        And National Guard Units.

                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                        Right now there’s credible 
                        information that some kind of 
                        attack may be in the works.  
                        Precautions are being taken until 
                        more concrete information is 
                        available.  There is no cause for 
                        panic.  This is not the time for 
                        speculation.  Thank you.

           The Reporters go crazy with questions as the Press 
           Secretary ends the briefing.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Joy and Riley stare at the TV with a few other PATRONS.

                                 RILEY
                        No cause for panic...

                                 JOY
                        Eh, somebody carried KY onto an 
                        airplane.  They do this crap all 
                        the time.  

                                 RILEY
                        Jets?  You think they’d send up 
                        jets because somebody left 
                        Astroglide in a briefcase?

                                 JOY
                        Yes.  Yes, I think they would.

                        Riley Holland?

           The two MEN IN BLACK are standing at the door.

                                 RILEY
                        Who’s askin’?

                        come with us.

                        A Mr. James Smith has requested 
                        that you meet him.

                                 RILEY
                        What the hell is a Mr. James 
                        Smith?

           Man In Black #2 grabs Riley by the elbow.

                                 RILEY
                        Hey!  Don’t get grabby.  What do 
                        you think you’re doing?

           She’s dragged out the door.

                                 JOY
                                 (calls after)

                        Wow.  It’s always the quiet ones.

           INT. SUV - MOMENTS LATER

           Riley climbs into the back.  She’s greeted by the creepy, 
           Captain Weirdo smile of a man who could be the 
           illegitimate spawn of Al Einstein and Phyllis Diller--DR. 
           ORO.

                                 DR. ORO
                        Pretty exciting, huh?
                                 (extends hand)
                        Oro’s the name.  Sweet, sweet 
                        lovin’s the game.

                                 RILEY
                        Uh...what’s going on?

                                 DR. ORO
                        Whole lotta me, lookin’ at a whole 
                        lotta you.  

           Riley leans over the seat.
                                 RILEY
                                 (to Agents)
                        Hello?  Wrong girl.

           Oro taps her on the shoulder.

                                 DR. ORO
                        One of us is wearing mistle toe 
                        underwear.

           She leans over the seat again.

                                 RILEY
                                 (to Agents)
                        Is this guy OK?  I didn’t bring my 
                        pepper spray with me.

                                 MAN IN BLACK #1
                        Please sit back, Ms. Holland.

                                 RILEY
                        Where are you taking me?

                                 MAN IN BLACK #2
                        That’s classified, Ma’am.

           Riley sits back--Oro gives her that smile again.

                                 RILEY
                        OK, you don’t look at me any more.

           INT. UNDISCLOSED FACILITY - AFTERNOON

           Kronau, President Malloy, Colonel Bodette, and Smith 
           stride down a hallway hewn from underground rock.  

                                 KRONAU
                        Most of your aides and advisors 
                        left New York after the funeral.  
                        Many of them were still in the 
                        air...

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Were?

                                 KRONAU
                        Well, we grounded all air traffic 
                        as part of the increased threat 
                        level.

                                 COLONEL BODETTE
                        On Christmas Eve.

           They come to a stop in front of door labeled AUDITORIUM.
                                 COLONEL BODETTE (CONT’D)
                        It’s my suggestion we look into 
                        declaring the Department of 
                        Homeland Security a terrorist 
                        organization, Sir.

           BEAT of blank stares.

                                 COLONEL BODETTE (CONT’D)
                        That was a joke, Sir.

           MAN IN BLACK #1 approaches.

                                 MAN IN BLACK #1
                        Mr. Smith, she’s here.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Riley sits across from Smith--eyeing him like he’s trying 
           to sell her the Brooklyn Bridge.

                                 RILEY
                        The future.  

           Smith nods.

                                 RILEY (CONT’D)
                        And...we’re...

                                 SMITH
                        Married, yeah.

                                 RILEY
                        In the future.  Where you’re from.

           Smith reaches across the table and lays his hand on hers. 

                                 SMITH 
                        I know it’s hard to get your mind 
                        around.

           She yanks her paw back.

                                 RILEY
                        I kiss every frog in New York 
                        looking for my prince, and you’re 
                        the guy I end up with?  

                                 SMITH
                        What? 

                                 RILEY
                        Look, no offense, but you’re not 
                        exactly in my league, OK?
           Through a window, Riley glances at Colonel Bodette in an 
           adjoining War Room with the others.  Smith follows her 
           gaze--frowns.

                                 SMITH
                        I think you’re missin’ the bigger 
                        picture here.

           Agent Dawes enters.

                                 AGENT DAWES
                        The President would like you to 
                        join us.

           INT. WAR ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The President and his entourage are seated, as Smith and 
           Riley enter.  The former still stinging.

                                 SMITH
                                 (whisper)
                        What’s wrong with me?

                                 RILEY
                        Look, I just thought I’d end up 
                        with a Doctor or something.  And 
                        if you don’t mind, I’m in denial 
                        right now.  And shock.  Shocking 
                        denial...

           TECHNICIANS work at several stations scrutinizing the 
           video footage that Smith has shot.  Various moments of 
           his travels are “freeze framed” on large monitors, while 
           other monitors run loops of frightening footage.

           At a table are seated various MILITARY and GOVERNMENT 
           personnel, along with DR. ORO.

                                 SMITH
                        Or something?  I’m not even a 
                        something?

                                 RILEY
                        You’re making a scene.

                                 SMITH
                        Yeah?  Well, you get fat.

           Malloy interrupts before she counter strikes.

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        You’ll forgive me if I’ve ruined 
                        your Christmas, Dr. Oro.  
                                 DR. ORO
                        You kiddin’ me?  I’m usually faced 
                        on schnapps and sending 
                        threatening e-mails to my ex-wife 
                        by now.

           Kronau motions Smith to join him outside.

           EXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Kronau leads Smith to a quiet corner--speaks in hushed 
           tones.

                                 KRONAU
                        Mr. Smith, I’d like to ask you 
                        some questions.

                                 SMITH
                        Told the guys with the pocket 
                        protectors everything I know.

                                 KRONAU
                        Who led the Nation? 

                                 SMITH
                        What?

                                 KRONAU
                        In the future.  In your time.  Who 
                        was...is the President?  

           Smith looks at him like he has three heads.

                                 KRONAU (CONT’D)
                        It was me, wasn’t it?

                                 SMITH
                        I’ve never heard of you before 
                        today.

                                 KRONAU
                        I don’t know why you feel 
                        compelled to lie about this.

           BEAT.

                                 SMITH
                        Your chestnuts have been roasting 
                        on an open fire too long.  You 
                        know that?  

                                 KRONAU
                        Mr. Smith, when we have defeated 
                        this threat, or prevented it from 
                        happening, life will go on.

                                 KRONAU (CONT'D)
                        You’ve lived every day for the 
                        last seven years twice.  Your 
                        knowledge of the future could 
                        be...beneficial to a man of my 
                        political aspirations.

                                 SMITH
                        Get your head out of your ass-
                        pirations.  None of that shit 
                        matters any more.

           Kronau leans into Smith’s face.

                                 KRONAU
                        Know your place, James.  I am not 
                        a man you want to anger.    

           And heads back into the War Room.

           INT. WAR ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Dr. Oro stares at THE BLACKBERRY--his face a whiter shade 
           of pale.  Yeah, he’s been told.

           Smith returns and yoinks the Blackberry back from him.

                                 DR. ORO
                        Do you have any idea of the energy 
                        necessary to move anything of 
                        significant mass through time? 
                        Theoretically speaking, I’m not 
                        even sure it’s possible.

                                 SMITH
                        You’re kibbles-n-bits in about 
                        four hours.  It’s possible.

                                 DR. ORO
                        You’re the one from the future..?  

                                 SMITH
                        You got it, Poindexter.

                                 DR. ORO
                        No.  Really?  You’re the one who 
                        has braved the end of the world a 
                        thousand times?  

           BEAT.

                                 SMITH
                        I’m gonna let that go, cause I 
                        know what a kick in the Rudolphs 
                        this is.  
                                 DR. ORO
                        Wormholes.  They’re using 
                        wormholes, aren’t they?

                                 SMITH
                        A billion of ‘em, just big enough 
                        to step through...

                                 COLONEL BODETTE
                        Worm holes?

                                 DR. ORO
                        Tunnels through space time.

                                 RILEY
                        It’s like they could be standing 
                        right here, you know?  They’re 
                        just not standing right here right 
                        now.  They’re standing right here 
                        tomorrow.  Same space, different 
                        time.  Bend ‘em together, or make 
                        a passage from there to here.  Ta-
                        da.

           The room goes quiet.

                                 RILEY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and you’ve never seen an 
                        episode of Star Trek?

                                 DR. ORO
                        Wow.  Are you seeing anyone?

           Smith grabs Riley’s hand and pulls her close.

                            RILEY
                                                         SMITH
           No.
                                              Yes.

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        OK.  Can we stop these wormholes?

                                 DR. ORO
                        Um...we just got digital watches 
                        thirty years ago.

                                 SMITH
                        Tell ‘em about your project.

           EXT. NYU CAMPUS - AFTERNOON

           Establishing of NYU Campus.  MILITARY and SECRET SERVICE 
           swarm.  MARINE ONE, the President’s Helicopter, is parked 
           in front of a building.  THREE APACHE attack choppers 
           hover...
           INT. BASEMENT STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

           Steam pipes and flickering lights.  Not many people come 
           down here, based on the cob webs.  Dr. ORO, President 
           Malloy, Dawes, Kronau, Smith, and Riley descend.

                                 DR. ORO
                        It’s not what you think.  

           They enter a large basement room--Oro hits the lights...

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - CONTINUOUS

           In the center of the room is a massive contraption--in 
           the center of which are several small mirrors angled at 
           45 degree angles.  

                                 DR. ORO
                        I call her Stella.

           Oro flips half a dozen breakers.  The contraption HUMS to 
           life like a 1976 Pinto that’s been sitting in a barn for 
           a decade.  Thin beams of LASERS bounce of the mirrors, 
           creating a small cube of empty space between them.

           A fuse blows--POP.  Sparks.  A small fire.  

                                 DR. ORO 
                        Don’t sweat that.  Just a...with 
                        the...and...

           Oro sprays it with a fire extinguisher.

                                 DR. ORO
                        DARPA project for military 
                        communications.  Be pretty 
                        freakin’ sweet to send messages a 
                        few minutes back in time on the 
                        battlefield, huh?

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        This...is a time machine?

                                 DR. ORO
                        No.  Well, yeah.  Not really, 
                        maybe sorta...

                                 COLONEL BODETTE
                        Does it work?

                                 KRONAU
                        We cut his funding, what does that 
                        tell ya?
                                 DR. ORO
                        Always with the negative vibes, 
                        man.  Yeah, just sub-atomic 
                        particles a fraction of a second 
                        forwards and backwards.  Energy is 
                        the pooch screw.  Remember the New 
                        York black out a decade ago?

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Yeah.

                                 DR. ORO
                        Oops.  Requires more juice than we 
                        can...

           He wags his eye brows at Riley

                                 DR. ORO (CONT’D)
                        Squeeze.  

                                 SMITH
                        When they show up, the Blackberry 
                        draws its power from their ships.  
                        You figure out how to tap into 
                        that energy, and send a message 
                        back in time to yourself using 
                        your machine.

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        With particles?

                                 DR. ORO
                        String of zeroes and ones.  
                        Binary.  I mean, theoretically, I 
                        could only send it back as far as 
                        the moment I first turned it on, 
                        fifteen years ago.

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        We’d have fifteen years to prepare 
                        for this moment, instead of six 
                        hours.  
                                 (to Oro)
                        Can you do it?

                                 DR. ORO
                        Sure.  If I had a decade and a 
                        genie shoved up my ass. 

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        How about every resource of the 
                        United States of America at your 
                        disposal for the next...
                                 (checks watch)
                        Five hours.
           Oro takes the Blackberry from Smith.  Well, tries to, he 
           ain’t lettin’ go--it’s his safety, and has been for 
           years.  Till, he looks at Riley--the fear in her eyes.  

           She catches herself--realizing, for a moment, she was an 
           open book.  So, she does what any self-respecting woman 
           would do who just outed herself.

           She glares at him and yanks the Device out of his hand.

                                 RILEY
                        Idiot.

           And hands it to Oro.

                                 DR. ORO
                        If we find out fifteen years ago, 
                        that the world is going to end on 
                        this day in the future...I can’t 
                        even speculate what the result 
                        with be.  We’ll be changing the 
                        past...

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        To prepare for now.

                                 DR. ORO
                        Yeah.  But who knows the 
                        ramifications.  Every single thing 
                        in each of our pasts has led us to 
                        where we are.  Change anything in 
                        the past and we don’t have the 
                        same present.  You may not be 
                        President.  I may not have been 
                        acquitted of that sexual 
                        harass...well, you get my drift.  
                        Who knows?

           BEAT.

                                 SMITH
                                 (to Malloy)
                        Mr. President...what color 
                        underwear did you wear yesterday?  
                        Just, you know, in case.

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - LATER

           This place is a buzzing with activity and the sputtering 
           of that piece of junk Oro calls a Time Machine.  Dozens 
           of TECHNICIANS and SCIENTISTS work--more arrive every 
           minute.  

           WE FIND President Malloy quietly sitting--a picture of he 
           and his family in his hand.  
           Lost in wallet sized memories.  Kronau watches him 
           quietly, as Agent Dawes approaches.

                                 AGENT DAWES
                        Air Force One is ready.  You can 
                        broadcast your address en route to 
                        Cheyenne.

           Malloy nods.

                                 AGENT DAWES (CONT’D)
                        Tough choice.  We stop them today, 
                        you’re family is still gone.  We 
                        lose, and send a message back, 
                        maybe they never get on that 
                        helicopter.

           Malloy puts the photo away--chagrined Dawes has read his 
           mind.  

           He nods towards Smith across the room, standing over 
           Riley, guarding her like a like a pit bull.  She steals 
           glances at Smith on the sly, a smile on her lips when he 
           ain’t lookin’--X-ray eyes of death when he is.

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY  (CONT’D)
                                 (re: Smith)
                        He told me he’s watched her die 
                        one hundred and nine times.  Can 
                        you imagine that?  Watching this 
                        happen to who you love over and 
                        over?  I’m not sure I’ll make it 
                        through this once.

           A loud ZAP and a BLUE ARC scares out the hell out of 
           everybody--Dr. Oro steps out of it, goggles smoking.

                                 DR. ORO
                        Sorry.  My fault.  Totally my 
                        fault.

           A TECHNICIAN at a laptop--she’s transcribing 
           notes/details, as a program converts the data to BINARY 
           CODE--”001001100...”

           Kronau watches this process intently--wheels turning 
           behind his eyes.

           WITH SMITH:

           Agent Dawes pulls him aside.

                                 AGENT DAWES
                        I want to ask you a favor, because 
                        he would never do it.  If there’s 
                        any way...if there’s a chance...
                                 SMITH
                        His wife and daughter?

                                 AGENT DAWES
                        He’s a good man.  Don’t let ‘em 
                        get on that helicopter.  For him, 
                        promise me that.

                                 SMITH
                        Do what I can.  You have my word.

           INT. HOUSE - DAY

           A FAMILY stares, stunned, at the TV--watching President 
           Malloy address the nation.

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY 
                                 (on TV)
                        ...we learned of this roughly two 
                        hours ago.  And, as we understand 
                        it, this will take place in 
                        approximately three to five hours 
                        from now.    

           MONTAGE:

           This scene is replayed again and again--Families in 
           different homes across America. 

           HOLIDAY SHOPPERS stare slack-jawed at a bank of TV’s in 
           an electronics store...

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY 
                                 (on TV)
                        The militaries of the world are 
                        dedicated to engaging this threat, 
                        and protecting our species.  But, 
                        you must understand, if you call 
                        for help, there will be none.  If 
                        you are hurt, there will be no 
                        rescue.  When the lights go out, 
                        they won’t come back on...

           TV’s across the world play the address.  Families in 
           Japan.  Russia.  China. Etc. His words translated into a 
           dozen languages on the TV screens...

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY (CONT’D)
                                 (on TV)
                        You must band together.  Do not, 
                        under any circumstances, get 
                        caught alone.  Do not attempt to 
                        engage one on your own.  Run.  
                        Fight back only in numbers.
           INT. AIRFORCE ONE - CONTINUOUS

           The President sits behind a desk, a small VIDEO CAMERA 
           recording...

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY (CONT’D)
                        If you are a member of the Armed 
                        Forces on leave, please report to 
                        your nearest airport.  A transport 
                        and orders are awaiting.  If you 
                        have any combat, or law 
                        enforcement training, please 
                        report to your local city hall.  
                        Weapons and ammunition will be 
                        provided to you.  We need militias 
                        in every state and city.  EMS 
                        systems nationwide will keep 
                        broadcasting messages for as long 
                        as they can...

           INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           An ANCHOR stares, dumbfounded at her monitor. 

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve instructed all networks to 
                        broadcast footage of what we’re 
                        facing.  You will find it graphic 
                        and disheartening.  But, it is the 
                        reality we will all soon face.  
                        Mankind has many times stood at 
                        the edge of extinction; we find 
                        ourselves here again, at a time 
                        known for peace.  But, this time, 
                        we can fight back.  We will fight 
                        back.  We must.  

           The monitor plays the VIDEO CLIPS we have seen before--
           glimpses.  Screams.  Shaky.  Disorienting and terrifying.

           INT. ELECTRONICS STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Holiday Shoppers in shock and horror, as the Clips are 
           played on the bank of TV’s.  

           INT. HOME DEPOT - DAY

           PEOPLE are just taking plywood and supplies.

           EXT. VARIOUS NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS AMERICA - DAY

           Houses are boarded up--make shift defenses against an 
           enemy one cannot defend against.
           INT. GUN STORE - DAY

           The PROPRIETOR is just handing out bullets and firearms 
           to desperate PEOPLE.  A SCUFFLE breaks out over a box of 
           ammo.  Someone fires a shot.  Another...

           Of course.

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - CONTINUOUS

           All present stare, jaws on the floor and horrified, at 
           the terrifying footage played on a TV.  The ambient 
           sounds picked up in the video turn blood to ice.  
           SCREAMS. GROWLS.  A cacophony of death.

           Riley grabs Smith’s hand.  Then, his arm.

           Smith turns off the TV.  Riley can’t tear her eyes from 
           the blank screen.

                                 RILEY
                        Seven years...of that?

           Smith nods.

                                 RILEY (CONT’D)
                        For me...

           EXT. SKY - AFTERNOON

           Air Force One cruises through the clouds--SIX F-22 
           RAPTORS flying guard...

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - AFTERNOON

           Oro is one of ten faces on ten small monitors on the wall 
           of the Air Force One office.  The others are MILITARY and 
           WORLD LEADERS...

                                 DR. ORO (ON VID)
                        Well, theoretically...depending on 
                        what is done with the information 
                        fifteen years ago.  If the time is 
                        spent preparing, instantly, from 
                        our point of view, things should 
                        change.  Weapons we devised in the 
                        past, based on the data we send 
                        should...well...just kinda...Poof.

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - CONTINUOUS

           Dr. Oro speaks into a LAPTOP VIDCAM...

                                 DR. ORO  (CONT’D)
                        But, we’re screwing around with a 
                        time line.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. ORO  (CONT’D)
                        There could be any of a number of 
                        outcomes.  Absolute, soul-crushing 
                        failure being one of them.

                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY (ON VID)
                        How much more time will you need?

           Oro glances at the rat’s nest of wires and gear behind 
           him.

                                 DR. ORO
                        All of it.

           AT TIME MACHINE:

           Smith looks at the Blackberry like a kid staring at a 
           squished puppy.  It’s in three pieces.

           But, before he breaks down sobbing, he notices something--
           KRONAU AT THE LAPTOP.  The Technician’s back is turned, 
           and he appears to be typing something into the message.

                                 SMITH
                        What are you doin’?

           Kronau turns with an unnerving smile.  He doesn’t reply.  
           He just slithers away.  

           That bastard is up to something, and Smith knows it.  
           But, before he can beat it out of him...

                                 RILEY (O.C.)
                        I usually can’t find a guy who’ll 
                        hold a door open for me...

           Smith finds Riley behind him, looking like she has to get 
           to third period Algebra in two minutes.  He sucks in the 
           gut--stands a little straighter.

                                 RILEY (CONT’D)
                        I guess I should thank you.

                                 SMITH
                        Be a refreshing change.

                                 RILEY
                        How did we meet?  In the future I 
                        mean.

                                 SMITH 
                        I ran over your cat.

                                 RILEY
                        You ran over my cat?
                                 SMITH
                        It’s not my fault.  That thing 
                        wasn’t all there...

                                 RILEY
                        OK, not the nuptial inducing 
                        moment I was hoping for.  I 
                        married you after that?

                                 SMITH
                        Not the next day or anything.

           She fidgets--arms around herself.  Smith lifts her face 
           to his, a gentle finger under her chin.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        You wouldn’t believe the things 
                        I’ve seen you do.  Hate to tell 
                        you this, Cupcake...you’re 
                        actually as tough as you think you 
                        are.

                                 RILEY
                        Stop calling me that.

           She catches herself gazing into his eyes.  Turns away--
           damnit.  He noticed.  She knows he noticed.  That wise 
           ass “I’m under your skin” smirk broadcasts it.

           She levels a finger at him, ready to give him both 
           barrels.  But, something kills the words on her tongue...

           In a shower of disassembled SPARKS, THE BLACKBERRY HUMS 
           TO LIFE.

           Then...THAT SOUND.  Like groaning metal, but not quite--
           It stops everyone in the lab in their tracks.

                                 RILEY
                        Oh, my God.  What the hell is 
                        that?

           The blood drains from Smith’s face.

                                 SMITH
                        They’re early.

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - AFTERNOON

           Through the windows we can see the sun low on the 
           horizon, as Kronau, Dawes, President Malloy, and a few 
           other AIDES vaporlock at the SOUND...

           Malloy looks out the window.
                                 PRESIDENT MALLOY
                        Oh...Dear God.

           EXT. SKY - CONTINUOUS

           Against the bleeding sunset--THOUSANDS OF ALIEN CRAFT.  
           Shimmering black, all.  Massive TRIANGLES--The 
           Harvesters.  Still they come--appearing in thin air out 
           of shimmering holes of atmosphere.

           It isn’t the size of them that’s bone chilling.  It’s the 
           sheer number.  Thousands.  Hundreds of thousands.  A 
           million.  They blot out the sky, leaving only the 
           thinnest slivers of sky visible between them.

           And out of the HARVESTERS, pour angular “M-SHAPED 
           FIGHTERS”--Sleek ships of ungodly maneuverability and 
           technology.  Just the HELLISH SCREECH of their engines is 
           enough to send anyone cowering.

           The F-22 RAPTORS escorting Air Force One engage the M-
           SHIPS with a hail of missiles and gunfire.  They last 
           exactly seven seconds.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - AFTERNOON

           On the streets and sidewalks, the air warps, and THEY 
           appear.  We finally see them, and they are Legion.  
           Easily nine-foot tall, REPTILIAN, heavily armored with 
           both scales and some manner of battle armor.  Bi-pedal, 
           and upright, with knees that bend the wrong way--giving 
           them a disturbing gait, and an ability to leap distances 
           that means your ass.  We’ll call them DRAGONS.

           Snarling and methodical, razor sharp talons fire wrist 
           mounted weapons that PARALYZE all they hit.  SCREAMING 
           PEOPLE, running for their lives, drop to the sidewalks--
           awake and conscious, but unable to move.

           Then, The Paralyzed RISE...

           EXT. NEW YORK SKYLINE - CONTINUOUS

           Like slow-motion rain in reverse, The Paralyzed rise into 
           the air.  Thousands.  Tens of thousands.  The air is full 
           of the frozen bodies--awake and SCREAMING IN HORROR, as 
           they are lifted through the air into the Harvester ships.

           In the midst of the floating bodies, air-to-air combat 
           rages--our fighters dropping like flaming flies...

           EXT. NYU CAMPUS - AFTERNOON

           Colonel Bodette fights alongside a detachment of DELTA 
           FORCE TROOPERS protecting the basement lab of Dr. Oro.  
           Six .50 Cal. Guns tear into the Aliens. 
           They bleed black blood, but they bleed.  Heavy weapons 
           are the key.  Hand grenades wound them.  Claymores piss 
           them off.

           Bodette, firing a belt-fed SQUAD AUTOMATIC WEAPON from 
           the hip, retreats into the building...

           TRACKING WITH BODETTE:

           Running through the building.  He boots open a door, and 
           tears down a flight of steps...

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - CONTINUOUS

           Smith damned near blows Bodette away as he careens in.  
           For a moment, even a Marine as salty as Bodette, just 
           leans against the wall quietly--coming to terms with the 
           terror coursing through his veins.  

                                 COLONEL BODETTE
                                 (to Oro)
                        You might wanna consider gettin’ 
                        the lead out, Gomer.

                                 DR. ORO
                        Hey!  Somebody told us we’d have 
                        another two or three hours.

                                 SMITH
                        It’s not my fault!

           AN EXPLOSION shakes the building.  A distant SNARL from a 
           hallway somewhere above--blood turns to ice.

                                 RILEY
                        OK.  Gun.  I don’t have one.  Why?

           Oro flips a few final switches.

                                 DR. ORO
                        I think it’s ready...

                                 SMITH
                        Then call Christmas Past already.

           Dr. Oro connects the laptop with the information in it to 
           his machine, and double checks the connection to the 
           Blackberry components.

                                 DR. ORO
                        In three...two...one!

           CLACK--the power goes out.  PITCH BLACK.

                                 DR. ORO (O.C.)
                        Well...Spock’s balls, man.
           A meek little emergency bulb flickers on.

                                 COLONEL BODETTE
                        Tell me that was part of your 
                        plan.

                                 DR. ORO
                        I think I tripped a breaker.

                                 RILEY
                        You said it drew power from 
                        the...the...

                                 SMITH
                        Things that eat us.

                                 RILEY
                        Them.

                                 DR. ORO
                        But the laptop with the data is 
                        plugged into the wall.  

                                 SMITH
                        Yeah, this is definitely a 
                        government operation...

                                 DR. ORO
                        Musta created some kind of 
                        feedback surge.  Somebody’s gotta 
                        fix the breaker.

           Smith looks at Bodette.  Bodette looks at Smith.  They 
           raise the Rock, Paper, Scissor fists-- One, Two...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. NYU HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Smith runs like hell down a darkened hallway, kicks open 
           a door, and ducks in...

                                 SMITH
                        Shit.  Shit.  Shit...

           INT. BOILER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Smith makes a beeline for the BREAKER BOX to the BUZZ of 
           a flickering emergency light.  Quickly, he spots the 
           tripped breaker.  With a CLACK, life oozes back into the 
           fluorescent lights of the building.
           INT. NYU HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Smith pokes his head out of the boiler room door meercat 
           style--checks up and down the hallway.  Nothing.  A smile 
           creeps over his lips.

           He steps into the hallway.  Creeping.  Quiet.  His smile 
           a little bigger with each step.  

           Till, he hears the heavy CLICK of claws on tile behind 
           him...

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - AFTERNOON

           Oro, Riley, and Bodette hear the muffled firing of the XM-
           97, and Smith’s screams of profanity.  Bodette doesn’t 
           skip a beat, he charges up the steps.

           Riley bounces from foot to foot.

                                 RILEY
                        Ohmigod, ohmigod, ohmigod...  

           She grabs Oro by the shirt.

                                 RILEY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t die now!  I just met a 
                        decent guy.  I’m gonna kick you in 
                        the jingle bells if you don’t get 
                        this...this time thingy to do its 
                        timey thing.  

           BEAT.

                                 DR. ORO
                        What?

                                 RILEY
                        Do not make me go Chick Norris on 
                        you!

                                 DR. ORO
                        I’m waiting for the computer to 
                        boot up...

           Yeah...it’s a Windows Start Up Screen.

           At the top of the steps, Bodette cuts loose with the SAW--
           it’s deafening.  We can’t see him from down here, but the 
           hot brass is plinking down the steps.  

           A BEAT later, BODETTE’S HEAD TUMBLES DOWN THE STAIRS!  
           Followed by Smith, sliding down the stairs on his back, 
           head first, and firing the XM-97 wildly up the stairwell.
           He staggers to his feet, speckled with blood, and panting-
           -retrieves Boddette’s SAW and hands it to a trembling 
           Riley.  It’s almost as big as she is.

                                 SMITH
                        Point that end at anything with 
                        scales and pull the trigger.

                                 RILEY
                        OK.  Scales, right...

           BAM-BAM-BAM.  She squeezes off a few rounds, damned near 
           taking off Smith’s head.  He gingerly pushes her barrel 
           vaguely in the direction of the stairs.

                                 SMITH
                        Scales, Honey.  Scales.

                                 DR. ORO
                        Data uploaded.  Ready...

                                 RILEY
                        Well, do it.

                                 DR. ORO
                        In three...two...one.

           Oro hits the transmit button--a small swirling ball of 
           atmosphere appears in the empty space between a series of 
           intersecting lasers.

                                 DR. ORO
                        I think it’s working...it’s 
                        working!

           BOOM--the entire building shakes.  An explosion far away, 
           but close enough to shake the foundations, and dislodge 
           pipes from the ceiling.  

           One of them, spewing hot steam, falls directly on Dr. 
           Oro’s time machine.  In a shower of sparks, the lights go 
           out again, and the time machine goes dead.

                                 DR. ORO
                        Crap.

                                 SMITH
                        Did it send?

                                 DR. ORO
                        I don’t know...

                                 RILEY
                        Immediately!  You said 
                        Immediately...
                                 DR. ORO
                        I don’t know!

           BANG BANG--the metal door at the top of the steps has a 
           visitor.  Something big.  Something strong.  Riley cuts 
           loose with the SAW--the muzzle strobe flashing in the 
           near dark basement.

           Smith grabs up the pieces of THE BLACKBERRY.

                                 SMITH
                        You got about thirty seconds to 
                        put this back together.

                                 RILEY
                        Smith?  

                                 SMITH
                        I won’t let them get you.

           She grabs him by the shoulders.

                                 RILEY
                        No, if they come, you kill me.  
                        I’ll do the same for you.  
                        Promise, OK?

                                 SMITH
                        They’re not going to get you.

                                 RILEY
                        Don’t let me die like that.  
                        Promise me.  If you love me as 
                        much as you say, you’ll promise 
                        me.

           Smith nods.  

                                 SMITH
                        I promise.

           EXT. NYU CAMPUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Smith, Riley, and Dr. Oro slide out a shattered window.  

           New York city is eerily QUIET.  No more jets.  Just an 
           occasional scream or gunshot.  Something wet drips onto 
           Riley.  Smith grabs her face--forcing her eyes to his.

                                 SMITH
                        Don’t look up.  Do not look up.

           Red stuff drips onto Smith as he speaks.  Riley’s eyes go 
           wide with realization--she looks up.
           Blood.  From the MILLIONS OF WOUNDED BODIES floating into 
           the harvesters and blotting out the sky.

           Riley hits her knees, the strength just leaves her.  Dr. 
           Oro falls against a wall, slides to his ass.  The horror 
           overwhelming.  The magnitude of what’s happening.  The 
           end of the human race.

           Smith looks at the ground.  

                                 SMITH
                        Get up.

           They don’t.  Smith shakes Riley.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        You’ve done it before.  Get 
                        up...get up!  You can do this.

           Riley struggles through the terror to her feet--not Oro.  

                                 DR. ORO
                        Hopeless...

                                 SMITH
                        Doc?  Doc...

           He’s checked out.  Nobody home.

           Smith yanks the Blackberry out of his limp hands and 
           slides last piece back into place.  He pulls Riley close 
           and presses the button sequence...

           NOTHING.  He shakes the damned thing.  No dice.  GROWLS 
           draw nearer.

           Across the campus, THREE DRAGONS spot them.  Smith 
           feverishly takes the Blackberry back apart and puts it 
           back together, dropping a piece in the process...

           He grabs it off the ground--when he stands back up, Riley 
           has the SAW pointed at his head--BAM!  Smith slaps the 
           barrel away at the last instant.

                                 SMITH
                        What the hell!

                                 RILEY
                        We had an agreement...

                                 SMITH
                        Well, Damn!  You wanna give me 
                        half a chance to...

           A SCREECH from above cuts him off--an ALIEN FIGHTER 
           glides over building and stops directly above them.  
           They haul ass, as pulses from the Alien Paralysis Weapons 
           slam into brick and mortar just behind them.  Somewhere 
           behind them, Dr. Oro SCREAMS...

           Smith looks at one component of the Blackberry cross-
           eyed, flips it upside down, and plugs it back in.  Bingo!  
           It powers on.

           He grabs Riley by the shirt and pulls her close--the 
           DRAGONS will be all over them in seconds if this doesn’t 
           work.

           As he and Riley fire their from the hip at the snarling 
           bastards, Smith hits buttons.  Braving the fire, one of 
           the DRAGONS leaps for them, fangs barred.

           Just as the air begins to warp...

           EXT. NYU CAMPUS (NEXT DAY) - DAY

           GRAPHIC: DECEMBER 23rd, 2011

           Screaming bloody murder, Smith and Riley appear out of 
           thin air...

           And find themselves staring down gun barrels.  

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        Drop your weapons!

           FOUR SOLDIERS in futuristic “HALO Style” body armor and 
           uniforms have XM-97 style guns leveled at them.

                                 SOLDIER #2
                                 (on radio)
                        Sector seven reporting, we found 
                        them.  

           Before Smith and Riley can de-freak, FUTURISTIC 
           HELICOPTERS soar overhead, cannons scanning, as fifty 
           more SOLDIERS converge.

           The wall of Soldiers parts like the Red Sea, from their 
           midst emerges...

                                 KRONAU
                        James Smith, we’ve been expecting 
                        you.

           He’s surrounded by a dozen SOLDIERS IN BLOOD RED UNIFORMS-
           -The RED GUARD.  One of them is DAWES.

                                 DAWES
                        The President is addressing you, 
                        Citizen.
           WE PULL BACK TO:

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - CONTINUOUS

           Decay.  This is not the New York we know.  This is 
           Sarajevo 1995 without the bomb craters...yet.

           Vines creep up the sides of broken windowed skyscrapers.  
           Concrete is cracked.  The whole place is in a state of 
           disrepair.

           Above it all, soaring through the cold gray winter sky, 
           are FUTURISTIC FIGHTERS AND ARMORED HELICOPTERS...

           MOVING OVER THE CITY:

           MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS and ARTILLERY PLATFORMS are 
           perched atop the tallest buildings--manned by SOLDIERS 
           behind the scanning cannons of ANTI-AIR GUNS.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

           WE MOVE through the decaying canyons of the city.  Cars 
           burn.  Dogs roam. SOLDIERS are everywhere.  Every corner.  
           TRENCHES have been cut into the streets.  All manner of 
           Hi-Tech weaponry is on display: gleaming EXO-Skeletons 
           worn by MECH SOLDIERS, futuristic TANKS, and APC’s.  

           The only PEOPLE not in uniform are in rags, and there 
           aren’t many of them--all under fifteen or over fifty-
           five.  They’re huddled around burning drums for warmth--
           faces filthy, spirits broken.

           Perched twenty feet above them all, on the side of a 
           building every block, A LARGE MONITOR runs a relentless 
           countdown.  You know what happens when it hits zero.

           INT. ARMORED SUV - DAY

           Smith and Riley stare aghast at the decaying city and 
           filthy faces passing by the windows.  Across from them 
           sits Bodette--here a GENERAL.  His face is heavily 
           creased with sorrow.  On either side of him, TWO MILITARY 
           GUARDS.

           Visible through the windows, a hungry crowd descends on 
           the MOTORCADE, forcing it to slow.

                                 SMITH
                        What the red hot hell have you 
                        people done?

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        Every hour, Son.  Every minute of 
                        every day.  For fifteen long 
                        years.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GENERAL BODETTE (CONT'D)
                        The end of the human species 
                        weighin’ on every person in this 
                        world.  Tell me, what exactly did 
                        you think would happen?  

           A filthy face is slammed into the window next to Smith by 
           a Soldier, as the SUV slows--the CROWD tightens in the 
           street.  Riley glances out the window and sees the reason-
           -she locks eyes with a crying FIFTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL 
           shoved against a wall by a SOLDIER... 

                                 RILEY
                        No.  No, stop the truck.

           She’s already out the door.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

           Three SOLDIERS have a GIRL of fifteen, a BOY of sixteen, 
           and a DAD of about fifty against a wall--trying to 
           protect his kids, arms around them.

                                 DAD
                        Don’t do this.  Please...don’t do 
                        this...

           Riley sails out of the crowd and shoves the Soldiers.

                                 RILEY
                        Big Man, huh?  Gettin’ all pointy 
                        with a gun at kids?  

           They grab her, as Smith comes out of the crowd swinging.  
           The crowd ignites.  Bodette is hot on Smith’s heels.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        Stand down!

           The Soldiers leap to attention.

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        Sir, a Citizen reported this man 
                        and his two kids hiding.  They 
                        refuse to fight.

                                 DAD
                        Please...Sir, I beg you...

           Bodette squares off with the Dad, his gaze withering.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE 
                                 (to Dad)
                        You can’t protect them from what’s 
                        coming.  You die right now, or you 
                        die fighting for each other.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GENERAL BODETTE  (CONT'D)
                        My Soldiers will not be 
                        sacrificing themselves for 
                        cowards.  Am I clear?  Everyone 
                        fights.

           Bodette makes for the SUV.

                                 SMITH
                        They’re just children...

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        Ain’t no children anymore.
                                 (to Guards)
                        And this doesn’t happen again.

           The Guards cuff Smith and Riley, and drag them away. 

           INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           PRESIDENT KRONAU strides down the hallway with a squad of 
           his RED GUARD, including Dawes.  Speaking with him is a 
           familiar face--MALLOY, here he wears the uniform of a 
           VICE ADMIRAL.

                                 ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        Her experiences appear limited.  
                        But, Smith is proving a gold mine 
                        of intel.

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        When can you provide the intel to 
                        our Field Commanders.

                                 ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        We have to pause periodically, 
                        Sir.  The process can be fatal.  

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        I am not concerned with one man’s 
                        well being, Admiral.

           They come to metal doors at the end of the hallway--
           Malloy places his hand on a scanner.  When the doors 
           open...

           ...WE CAN HEAR SMITH SCREAMING.

           INT. HI-TECH LAB - CONTINUOUS

           The place is darkened to allow better viewing of the 
           dozen TEN FOOT VIDEO MONITORS across the wall.  
           SCIENTISTS and TECHNICIANS man HOLOGRAPHIC COMPUTER 
           DISPLAYS--faces bathed in the blue glow.

           In the middle of the room, strapped to two dastardly 
           looking metal chairs, we find Smith and Riley.  
           She moans as Technicians detach electrodes and help her 
           up.  Smith, however, convulses--screaming through 
           clenched teeth.  His body covered in electrodes--the top 
           of his head covered by a round metal device.

           What’s it all for?  Smith’s MEMORIES are being played on 
           the large video monitors.  Hundreds of encounters with 
           the Dragons.  A thousand “end of the world” moments, from 
           his point of view.

           Kronau and Malloy join Bodette at a smaller bank of 
           monitors--reviewing Dragon ships and weapons from Smith’s 
           memory.

           WITH RILEY:

           She comes out of her stupor--struggles with the 
           Technicians trying to help her.

                                 RILEY
                        What are you doing?  Stop it!  
                        You’re killing him..!

           Then, another familiar voice...

                                 DR. ORO (O.C.)
                        No...no...no..!

           Dr. Oro comes out of a darkened corner waving his arms 
           like a pissed off chimp.  From the looks of him, he may 
           be the only thing in the world that is unchanged.  He 
           makes a beeline for the Technicians at Smith’s side.

                                 DR. ORO (CONT’D)
                        You got the cortex feedback loop 
                        bleeding into the neural mapping 
                        threshold inhibitor, man.  Duh.  

           Oro twists dials and adjusts--Smith’s screams ebb, as 
           Riley jerks free and shoves Oro.

                                 RILEY
                        Turn it off!

           Oro eyes Riley from stem to stern.

                                 DR. ORO
                        Does...does your chest heave like 
                        that all the time?

           Riley lunges for him, but is held back.  Oro waves the 
           Technicians off.
                                 DR. ORO
                        It’s OK.  Alright?  We just need 
                        to see what he’s seen.  Know what 
                        he knows.  

           One monitor in particular catches Riley’s eye--SMITH’S 
           MEMORIES OF HER.  A hundred versions of her, in various 
           states of disarray.  In various states of love.  She sees 
           herself kissing Smith.  She sees herself bitching him 
           out.  She sees herself dying before his eyes.

           Over and over...and over...and over...

           INT. ROOM - NIGHT

           A small room with nothing but a cot.  Riley sits in a 
           corner, arms around her knees.  The door opens, and TWO 
           SOLDIERS bring Smith in.  They lay him on the cot and 
           exit.

           Riley cradles Smith’s head.  He ain’t lookin’ too frisky.  

                                 SMITH
                        Well...can’t say I never take ya 
                        anywhere.

                                 RILEY
                        Oh my God.  You look awful.

           BEAT.

                                 SMITH
                        Can you smell purple?

           Kronau enters with Malloy and Dawes.  

                                 RILEY
                        Oh, you two are...are...are so 
                        getting coal in your stockings.

                                 SMITH
                        You tell ‘em, Cupcake.

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        Do you know how many hundreds of 
                        thousands died in riots when the 
                        message was made public?  Every 
                        voice in the world demanding we do 
                        something.  I restored order.  
                        Restored security.  Promised them 
                        I would protect them.  Sacrifices 
                        had to be made.  Hard choices.  
                        And, I made them.  Victory will 
                        come of this.   
                                 SMITH
                        Self-righteous, power hungry, 
                        bureaucratic assholes...

                                 RILEY
                        Gimme man-eating snarl-y things 
                        any day of the week.

           Smith sits up--bad idea.  Malloy notices.

                                 ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        The effects are only temporary.  
                        Some of the information in the 
                        original message was 
                        indecipherable.  We couldn’t 
                        depend upon your recollection 
                        alone.  Every detail of what we’re 
                        facing is vital.  Sorry to put you 
                        through that.   

                                 SMITH
                        Well...thanks for the hospitality.  
                        How ‘bout ya just gimme back 
                        The...the...the, uh...

                                 RILEY
                        Thingy.

                                 SMITH
                        And we’ll be on our way.  

           Kronau pulls The Blackberry from a pocket--he gazes at 
           it, then at Smith.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Look, man...I really don’t have 
                        the energy to do the whole 
                        threatening you thing.  Not with 
                        this headache...

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        We are at the pinnacle of what 
                        mankind can accomplish, Mr. Smith.    
                        We’ll never be this capable again.  
                        It will end today, I assure you.

                                 SMITH
                        Just that sure, huh?

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        No...

           Kronau drops The Blackberry on the floor AND STOMPS IT.

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU (CONT’D)
                        I am that sure.
           Smith and Riley damned near have strokes on the spot.

           INT. COMMAND AND CONTROL - NIGHT

           Bleeding edge Hi-Tech.  If America spent every dime on 
           defense for fifteen years, this is what we’d have.  A 
           hundred SOLDIERS man terminals of holographic computers.  

           General Bodette stands before a HOLO-DISPLAY OF THE NORTH 
           EASTERN UNITED STATES.  He zooms in to Manhattan, 
           dragging representations of BATTALIONS here and there...

           A YOUNG CAPTAIN approaches.

                                 YOUNG CAPTAIN
                        General, the ArchAngels are 
                        approaching.

           Bodette zooms the Holo-Display out--way out.  Planet 
           Earth before us.  A THOUSAND BLIPS fan out, encircling 
           the planet.

                                 YOUNG CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        Settling into low earth geo-synch 
                        orbit in approximately twenty 
                        minutes.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        Diagnostics.

                                 YOUNG CAPTAIN
                        Fully functional.  Should we arm, 
                        Sir?

           Bodette stares at the blips grimly.

                                 YOUNG CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        Sir?  Do we begin the arming 
                        sequence?

           Bodette shrinks two inches under the weight the question.  
           Slow to answer.  The words are razors on his tongue...

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        Do it.

           INT. ROOM - NIGHT

           Smith stares down the barrel of Dawes’ weapon--intent on 
           ripping Kronau’s head off.  

                                 DAWES
                        Don’t even think about it.

           Riley is on her knees gathering up Blackberry pieces, as 
           Kronau turns on his heel, and exits with Dawes.
                                 RILEY
                        Was he bitten by a radioactive 
                        penis, or something?  Nobody can 
                        be born that big of a dick.

                                 ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        I’ll see to it that you’re placed 
                        under General Bodette’s command.

           BEAT.

                                 SMITH
                        Try that again?

                                 ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        You’re going to the front lines. 
                        Both of you.

           Smith and Riley stare at him like he has three heads.

                                 ADMIRAL MALLOY (CONT’D)
                        We need your experience.  You’ve 
                        fought them a thousand times...

                                 SMITH
                        No, I ran screaming the hell away 
                        a thousand times.  Which, I might 
                        add, is exactly what I wanna do 
                        this time.  And she couldn’t hit 
                        the ground if she tripped.

                                 RILEY
                        It’s true.  I suck.  I really, 
                        really suck.  

                                 ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        There are seven billion people on 
                        planet Earth.  Maybe half of them 
                        are in any shape to fight back.  
                        At best, we’ll outnumber them 
                        three, maybe four, to one.  
                        Everyone fights.  Or, we’re dead 
                        before they get here.    

           Malloy heads for the door--stops just this side of it.

                                 ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        You’ve given us the only chance 
                        we’ll ever have. 

           He exits.

                                 RILEY
                        They can’t stop them, can they?

           Smith pulls her close.
           SOLDIERS enter and drag Smith and Riley, kicking and 
           screaming, out the door. 

           INT. HI-TECH LAB - NIGHT

           Dr. Oro reviews footage from Smith’s memories--the 
           moments before the message was sent in the NYU basement.

           Something catches his eye.  He isolates a particular 
           scene--Smith busting Kronau monkeying with the Laptop 
           that was translating data into Binary.

           He zooms in on the data that Kronau typed on the laptop 
           screen...

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU (O.C.)
                        Dr. Oro...

           Oro leaps a foot in his seat--finds Kronau behind him.  
           The President calmly DELETES the video Oro viewed.

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        The time when this mattered, 
                        Doctor, has long passed.

           Oro scoots his chair away from him.

                                 DR. ORO
                        Man, you let us believe you were 
                        some future hero.  The man who 
                        could save us all...

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        I didn’t ask for this...

                                 DR. ORO
                        You were just a petty hack...who 
                        sent himself just enough knowledge 
                        of the future to grab control.

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        That was a man I never became!  

           Kronau is surprised by how own outburst.

                                 DR. ORO
                        You told us this was the only way.  
                        God, man, look what you made of 
                        us.  

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        It is the only way, Dr. Oro.  And 
                        you can’t imagine the hatred I 
                        have for the man who made me 
                        responsible.  
                                 DR. ORO
                        Didn’t hate him when he put you in 
                        power, did you? You may not be the 
                        same man now...but you sure as 
                        hell were fifteen years ago.

           Gut wrenching guilt eats Kronau alive before our eyes.

                                 DR. ORO (CONT’D)
                        Give me Smith’s device. I saw how 
                        I did it before.  I can send 
                        another message back if we lose.  
                        Give us another chance yesterday.  
                        Tell us what worked and 
                        what...what...

           He trails off--seeing it on Kronau’s face.

                                 DR. ORO (CONT’D)
                        You giant evil son of a bitch.  
                        Just couldn’t risk a message that 
                        might cost you the power, could 
                        ya?  

           Oro backs away, bumping into DAWES, who oozes from the 
           shadows.

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        One way or another, it ends today.

           EXT. NEW YORK SKYLINE - NIGHT

           Giant spotlights cut through the night sky, while 
           ridiculously powerful flood lights make daylight on 
           streets.

           ATTACK AIRCRAFT circle like sharks, some soaring high 
           above, some patrolling through the city canyons.  THREE 
           BULKY TRANSPORTS rise over a skyscraper...

           INT. TRANSPORT #1 - CONTINUOUS

           Fifty people are crammed on board.  Some of them are 
           SOLDIERS, heavily armed, armored, and steely-eyed.  Some 
           of them are CITIZENS--just Average Joe’s, scared to 
           fucking death.    

           General Bodette stands at the front, leaning into the 
           cockpit.  Smith and Riley may be sitting at the back of 
           the bus, but they’re residing in the ninth ring of Hell.  

           WITH BODETTE:

           He turns to all--a RED LASER strobing over him as he 
           speaks...
                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        The whole City has been evacuated 
                        to Manhattan.  Where we make our 
                        stand...  

           INT. TRANSPORT #2 - CONTINUOUS

           A flickering, red-tinged HOLOGRAM of Bodette stands 
           before the same SOLDIER to CITIZEN ratio in here.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE (HOLOGRAM)
                        All across the country, all across 
                        the world, the same thing is being 
                        done.  This time we force ‘em to 
                        fight on our terms.  They’re in 
                        for a helluva surprise.  Do not 
                        get caught alone.  Stay 
                        together...

           Some of the Citizens openly cry.  Some are fighting mad.  
           Most are too terrified to move.

           INT. TRANSPORT #3 - CONTINUOUS

           A Hologram Bodette here, too.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE (HOLOGRAM)
                        Do not try to take their weapons.  
                        No matter what they look like, 
                        they do die.  The weapons you have 
                        will kill them.  Don’t panic if 
                        you lose yours.  They’ll be plenty 
                        laying on the ground...

           WE MOVE through the cabin of Soldiers and Average Joes, 
           to find a familiar face...

           The DAD from earlier.  His arms around his kids--the BOY 
           and the GIRL.  The Kids are scared, Dad is in sheer 
           unadulterated agony. 

           INT. TRANSPORT #1 - CONTINUOUS

           Bodette continues.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        I shit you not...Soldier or 
                        Citizen, chances are, you will 
                        meet your Maker tonight.  Just do 
                        one thing.  For yourself...  

           INT. TRANSPORT #3 - CONTINUOUS

           The Dad glares at Bodette’s Hologram.
                                 GENERAL BODETTE (HOLOGRAM)
                        For your family.  For the person 
                        sitting next to you.  Take just 
                        one of the son of a bitches with 
                        ya.

           Steely-eyed Soldiers roar a “HOO-YAH”.  Grim 
           determination and resolve takes hold on the faces of all.  
           But, there’s a different kind of resolve on one face...

           The Dad stands, grabs his XM-97...

                                 GIRL
                        Daddy..?

           And charges down the aisle--through the Hologram of 
           Bodette, and in to...

           INT. TRANSPORT #3 COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

           The Dad leaps into the cockpit and shoves his weapon into 
           the ribs of the PILOT...

                                 DAD
                        Land right now!  I’m not gonna let 
                        my children do this..!

           The CO-PILOT reaches for the gun.  SOLDIERS descend upon 
           the crazed Father from behind, wrestling with him.  The 
           man is out of his mind with anguish and rage.

           EXT. NEW YORK SKY - CONTINUOUS

           Three Transports in formation.  MUZZLE FLASHES strobe 
           through the Cockpit windows of Transport #3.  

           A BEAT LATER--it drifts out of control, and SLAMS INTO 
           TRANSPORT #1 IN MID-AIR--ripping a massive gash down its 
           side, and knocking a wing mounted engine lose. 

           Transport #3 disappears over the Skyscrapers, lumbering 
           towards the ground...

           INT. TRANSPORT #1 - CONTINUOUS

           Wind ROARS through the torn bulkhead of the Transport.  
           An engine CRASHES THROUGH THE CABIN--punching a six foot 
           hole clean through the boat.   A dozen souls sent 
           screaming into the night.

           The Transport shudders into a FLAT SPIN. 

           WITH SMITH AND RILEY:

           Knocked out of their harnesses and hanging on for dear 
           life.   Centrifugal force slings them outwards.  
           Riley looses her grip.  Smith grabs for her, misses.  
           She’s headed towards one of the gaping holes--sliding 
           towards oblivion and clawing for a hold.

           Out she goes, JUST grasping the crumpled metal edge.  Her 
           fingers are the only part of her inside.  Smith yells 
           over the deafening roar.

                                 SMITH
                        Grab my hand!

           He can’t quite reach her without letting go of the pipe 
           he’s holding on to.  A tangle of WIRES AND HOSES breaks 
           loose--entangling Riley.

                                 RILEY
                        Help me..!

           Smith almost has her.  Just another inch...

           Till, A SOLDIER, heavy with armor, sails past him and 
           into Riley.  They both disappear into the night.

           Smith can’t even manage a scream.

           INT. TRANSPORT #1 COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

           The CREW wrestles for control, serenaded by ALARMS.  
           Every warning light that can blink is yelling.  They’ve 
           almost got it...  

           But, there’s another problem--a MASSIVE ANTENNA ARRAY 
           sitting atop a Skyscraper fills the cockpit windows...

                                 CO-PILOT
                        Pull up..!

           EXT. TRANSPORT #1 - CONTINUOUS

           The lumbering ship streaks smoke and flame towards the 
           top of the Skyscraper just ahead--but, what’s that 
           hanging off the ship...

           RILEY!  She and the Soldier that slammed into her are 
           tangled up in that mass of wire harnesses and hoses--
           dangling in the wind twenty feet below the bird.

           INT. TRANSPORT #1 COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

           Using every ounce of skill and sheer dumb luck, the Pilot 
           and Co-Pilot get the wounded Transport over the antenna 
           array in the knick of time--it SCREECHES along the belly 
           of the bird.
           EXT. NEW WORK STREET - NIGHT

           Transport #1 sits on the street, smoking.  General 
           Bodette is windblown, and pissed, as he eyes some of the 
           WOUNDED laying on the street.

           A SERGEANT approaches.

                                 SERGEANT
                        General, three confirmed 
                        fatalities.  Nine wounded.  Eight 
                        more unaccounted for.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        Other Transports?

                                 SERGEANT
                        Transport Two has touched down 
                        safely in Sector Seventeen.  
                        Number Three went down.  No 
                        survivors.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        What the hell happened here..?

           Smith grabs the General’s arm.

                                 SMITH
                        You gotta help me find Riley.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        Five hundred foot fall.  I don’t 
                        think you find that...

           Smith looks positively ill.

           Bodette turns to bark at a Soldier--Smith persists.

                                 SMITH
                        The Riley from this time.  She’s 
                        still out there... 

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        Son, I just lost a third of this 
                        Company and a shot hasn’t been 
                        fired yet.  I now got an entire 
                        Sector with no flank protection...

           Smith gets in his face.

                                 SMITH
                        Hey, asshole!  If it wasn’t for me 
                        and her, you wouldn’t even have 
                        this chance.  Just find out where 
                        she is.  You bastards owe me that 
                        much.  Please.    
           Bodette glances up at one of building mounted monitors 
           ticking down the time: 00:28:23 and falling.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        You ain’t back here when the hurt 
                        comes, you’re on your own.

                                 SMITH
                        Used to it.

           Bodette sizes him up.  On any other day, he’d probably 
           admire this lunatic.  The General takes a radio and an 
           extra ammo mag from a SERGEANT--hands them to Smith.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        Channel twelve.  I’ll do what I 
                        can.

                                 SMITH
                        Thank you.

           Bodette grabs his own radio.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                                 (On Radio)
                        Command and Control, I need an 
                        immediate last-known personnel 
                        location.  Holland, Riley...

           WE MOVE DOWNWARD:

           Down THROUGH the street and earth beneath it.  Past pipes 
           and conduits.

           Down further.  

           Past water mains and the multitude of apparatus that 
           dwells beneath the surface of New York.  Down.  Further.  
           Till we come to...

           INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

           Beehive comes to mind.  The place is crawling with 
           Kronau’s RED GUARD SOLDIERS.  This section of the tunnel 
           has been walled off with gleaming titanium, in the center 
           of which is a massive SIX FOOT THICK BLAST DOOR.

           A line of TRUCKS and CITIZENS stretches down the tunnel, 
           entering the blast door.  We follow into the...

           INT. ARK - CONTINUOUS

           It’s a whole different ball of wax on this side of that 
           blast door.  Polished floors and titanium reinforced 
           concrete walls and ceilings.  This place is a BUNKER to 
           the Nth degree.
           The tunnel forks here--Trucks head in one direction, 
           Citizens in another.  Red Guard Soldiers check ID with 
           retina scanners.

           INT. ARK OFFICE - NIGHT

           In a large office of similar titanium and concrete 
           construction, sits an ornate oak desk.  Behind that desk 
           is President Kronau.

           There’s a half-empty bottle of scotch sitting next to a 
           half empty glass.  Neat.

           Kroanu holds his head in his hands.  There’s a meek knock 
           at the door, an AIDE pokes her head inside.

                                 AIDE
                        Sir, the foreign Presidents, Prime 
                        Ministers, and their delegations 
                        are here.  They’d like to thank 
                        you in person.   

           Kronau doesn’t respond.  He doesn’t even lift his head.

                                 AIDE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. President?

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        I don’t want to talk to anyone 
                        right now, Margaret.

           He never moves.

           EXT. SPACE (EARTH ORBIT) 

           The big blue marble stretches before us--the atmosphere’s 
           curvature fading into the black of space.  A satellite 
           streaks by, slowing into an orbit--solar panel “wings” 
           spreading.

           WE PULL BACK: It has friends.  A thousand of them--
           swarming around Earth like fireflies.

           One drifts past, perilously close.  Several cone shaped 
           objects protrude from the underside.  There must be MORE 
           THAN A HUNDRED of them sticking out.  

           The satellite corrects its orientation, giving us a full 
           glimpse of the cones...

           ...NUCLEAR FUCKING WARHEADS.
           INT. COMMAND AND CONTROL - NIGHT

           It’s a cacophony of voices and radio chatter.  A 
           kaleidoscope of HOLO-TERMINALS and MONITORS.  A HUNDRED 
           SOLDIERS work diligently at preparation.

           Footage from Smith’s memories is visible here and there--
           modified with overlying schematics and biological data of 
           The Dragons and Ships.  Guesswork.

           Standing over the Hologram of Planet Earth, we find 
           Admiral Malloy eyeing the red dots circling the planet.  
           Manipulating the air around the hologram, Malloy zooms 
           all the way in to Manhattan.

                                 ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        That’s not a secure area, General.  
                        I need you at the theater level 
                        here in C & C. 

           Bodette’s voice rings throughout the place--digitized, 
           mildly garbled.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE (O.C.)
                                 (On Radio)
                        Ain’t a secure area on this 
                        planet, Admiral.  Besides...

           EXT. TRANSPORT #1 CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS

           ATTACK HELICOPTERS soar overhead between the buildings.  
           TANKS rumble down the street.

           Bodette looks at the faces of the hundred or so survivors 
           with him.  Half of them are just AVERAGE JOE’S.  Some of 
           those are kids of sixteen, maybe.  

           They look lost and scared as Bodette’s eyes pass over 
           them.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE (CONT’D)
                                 (On Radio)
                        I’m needed more out here, Sir.  

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT

           Smith runs over an ARMORED HUMVEE, jumps across a TRENCH 
           of SOLDIERS in the middle of the street, and keeps on 
           trucking.

           Full gallop, and gasping air like they’re gonna stop 
           making it--hands clutching at a stitch in his side.  He 
           glances up at a monitor ticking down the time: 00:11:02 
           and falling like a Prom Dress.
           Eyes on the screen, he trips over a sidewalk and slides 
           across the pavement on his face.  Summoning what little 
           wind he’s still got, Smith runs on.

           Limping and cursing a blue streak.

           DOWN THE BLOCK:

           Smith rounds a corner and runs to us--his gait slowing.  
           Confused.  Disbelief splatters his face--he comes to an 
           unsure stop.    

           REVERSE ON SMITH:

           He’s looking at a CEMETERY.

           EXT. CEMETARY - CONTINUOUS

           Gravestone shadows dance to and fro from the SPOTLIGHTS 
           slicing through the sky.  It’s almost disorienting, not 
           that Smith cares.

                                 SMITH
                        No, God.  Not here...you’re not 
                        here.  

           Faster and faster he moves through the garden of dead.  
           Eyes scanning gravestones.  Hope battling despair.

           He stops--the air sucked out of his lungs.  Smith drops 
           to his knees before a gravestone:  RILEY HOLLAND.  APRIL, 
           9th 1982 - MARCH, 13th 1999.

           It’s a long, long moment before what he’s seeing connects 
           with what he’s hoping, and promptly slits hope’s throat.

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           A flickering light kinda sorta illuminates a cobweb 
           filled stair well.  A bright flashlight carves through 
           its shadowy shortcomings.

           A silhouette ascends the stairs--the unmistakable cut of 
           a Soldier in FULL BATTLE ARMOR.  A hand rips the cobwebs 
           away...

           EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           The knob on the stairwell door turns.  The rusted thing 
           creeps open, and out steps...

           Dr. Oro sporting the world’s most ill-fitting armor.  
           It’s way too big for him--the helmet is over his eyes.  
           In one hand, he’s dragging an XM-97 by the barrel.  In 
           the other, there’s a half-empty bottle of hooch.  
           He staggers over to the edge...

                                 DR. ORO
                        Front row seat for the end of the 
                        world.  Send me to the front line 
                        will ya?

           He ralphs over the edge.

                                 DR. ORO (CONT’D)
                        That’ll show ya...

                                 RILEY (O.C.)
                        Hey, Chess Club.

           Oro gives the bottle the skunk eye.

                                 DR. ORO
                                 (to Bottle)
                        What’d I tell you about that?

                                 RILEY (O.C.)
                        Oh my God.  Look up, man.  

           Oro aims his bloodshot eyes skyward.  There’s Riley, 
           hanging from the, now, dead Soldier, who’s wrapped up in 
           a rat’s nest of wires and hoses, that are tangled around 
           the Antenna Array atop the building.

           The whole damned thing is bent about 45 degrees--Riley 
           hangs like a wind chime from the waist.

                                 DR. ORO
                        That is one saucy pinanta.

                                 RILEY
                        Get me down, you Big Wienie!

           EXT. CEMETARY - NIGHT

           Smith reaches into his jacket and pulls out that bottle 
           of Old Crow he took from the Lush, and has a little 
           somethin’ for the pain.

           Strength just leaves him.  He sits--his back against the 
           Gravestone, as a gentle SNOW FLURRY begins to fall.  
           Giving up comes to mind.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT

           Shoulder deep in trenches, SOLDIERS wait silently.  Far, 
           far overhead jet engines can be heard.

           But, it’s remarkably quiet.  Like the whole city is 
           holding its breath.  
           Bodette’s hard eyes scan the sky.  Waiting.  He checks 
           out the COUNTDOWN MONITOR: 00:02:16.

           EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOF - NIGHT

           Oro creeps along the erector set construction of the bent 
           Antenna--inch by inch closer to Riley.  

           His helmet falls over his eyes again.

                                 DR. ORO 
                        They’re a thousand years ahead of 
                        us in technology...maybe two.  We 
                        had what?  Fifteen years?  To 
                        catch up with that?      

                                 RILEY
                        I thought...oh, I don’t know...we 
                        were trying to keep humanity from 
                        not getting a nasty case of dead!

                                 DR. ORO
                        No, they built a bunker.  An Ark, 
                        really...

           The wind sways the Antenna--Oro grips tightly.

                                 DR. ORO (CONT’D)
                        An underground facility.  Two 
                        million people from all over the 
                        world are down there.  If we can’t 
                        beat them, nuke the surface.  
                        Mankind lives on...in a...more 
                        gopher-like fashion than we’re 
                        accustomed, sure...  

           The Antenna GROANS uncomfortably--Oro gets a good look 
           down.  A REAL good look...

                                 RILEY 
                        Oh my God!  Are you looking down 
                        my shirt?

           Yes.

                                 DR. ORO
                        No.  

                                 RILEY
                        Pervy nerds.  Man eating growly 
                        things.  Bombs falling from the 
                        sky.  This is the worst Christmas 
                        ever!  

           Riley goes ballistic like an epileptic marionette.  The 
           Antenna shudders.  Groans.  Sways.  Uh-oh...
           It gives way under its own tilting weight--he entire 
           Antenna Array topples in a shower of sparks!

           Riley cuts loose a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM...

           EXT. CEMETARY - CONTINUOUS

           Smith stares at a pistol in one hand, and a SINGLE BULLET 
           in the other.  

           You know what he’s thinking.

           Then, barely audible, ever so faintly on the cool winter 
           wind...a SCREAM ECHOES through the concrete canyons from 
           somewhere.

           Smith leaps to his feet. 

                                 SMITH
                        Riley...

           Right about then, his watch alarm BEEPS.  A BEAT later, a 
           deafening KLAXON ALARM reverberates across NYC...

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           General Bodette stares at the Monitor Countdown as the 
           Klaxon alarm screams: 00:00:00.

           Soldiers hold their breath.

           White-knuckled hands grip guns.  Fingers tighten on 
           triggers.  Hearts POUND.  Waiting for it...

           EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           The Antenna Array lays on the roof, a fire burning on the 
           pedestal it stood upon from shorted electrical 
           components.  

           The top twenty feet protrude over the edge...

           And that’s where we find Riley, Oro, and that poor dead 
           Soldier--hanging on for dear life, 450 FEET OVER the 
           street below.  Petrified, Riley and Oro share a look as 
           the Klaxon Alarm’s echo fades.

                                 RILEY
                        Oh...crap...

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           An armored column stands at the ready--tanks, APC’s, 
           Armored Humvee’s.  Behind one of the latter, a GROUP OF 
           SOLDIERS waits.
           Suddenly, the Humvee starts up and roars away!  Leaving 
           them squatting and confused in the middle of the street 
           with no cover...

           INT. ARMORED HUMVEE - CONTINUOUS

           Smith drives it like he stole it.  Looking up through the 
           windshield.  Several blocks away, he spots a fire burning 
           atop a Skyscraper--a collapsed Antenna Array.

           He swerves hard around a tank, sending Soldiers diving 
           for cover.

           Then, A SOUND--like groaning metal, but not quite.  
           Almost sorrowful.  Louder...

                                 SMITH
                        Aw, no...not now.  Not now...

           The air seems to fracture, and...

           A FUCKING DRAGON APPEARS OUT OF THIN AIR RIGHT IN FRONT 
           OF SMITH!  Hard to tell who’s more surprised by that, 
           Smith or The Dragon.  Either way, he STOMPS the gas and 
           runs over the damned thing.

           As all hell, quite simply, breaks loose on Planet Earth.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

           Spotlights reflect off the bottom of THOUSANDS OF DRAGON 
           HARVESTER SHIPS, five-thousand feet up, and bleeding “M” 
           FIGHTERS.

           Barrage after barrage of SAM MISSILES streak skyward. 
           TRACERS ark from Anti-Air Batteries atop Skyscrapers into 
           the inky night.  Brilliant orange and green flashes 
           result, as Dragon ships come down in flames, crashing 
           into the city’s buildings.  Entire blocks are destroyed 
           in seconds...

           HUMAN FIGHTERS descend from the clouds, and maul the hell 
           out of everything that ain’t of this earth in a hail of 
           missiles and cannons.

           EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           Riley and Oro can’t get off that damned antenna fast 
           enough.  Something’s coming.  Something that stops them 
           cold.  Dear in the headlights style. 

           An M FIGHTER swoops towards them between the buildings, a 
           Human Fighter hot on its tail and firing.  Cannon rounds 
           ZIP through the air past their heads as the Dog Fight 
           STREAKS just below their dangling feet.
           They’ve barely got their hearts started again, when 
           another M Fighter comes--chasing the Human Fighter.

           It breaks off and comes directly for Riley and Oro!

                                 RILEY
                        Ohmigod, Shoot it...Oh. My. God.  
                        Shoot it..!

           Oro goes for the XM-97 on his back, fumbling like he’s 
           got hooves for hands--HE DROPS IT!

           Riley grabs the thing out of thin air as it falls, and 
           blasts the approaching M Fighter cockpit full of depleted 
           Uranium, screaming like a banshee.

           The ship careens out of control, spinning wildly by, just 
           feet over their heads.  It clips the Antenna!  Severing 
           the portion that Oro and Riley are on from the rest of 
           the structure.

           The whole ball of wax falls fifty feet, till cables and 
           wires go taut, SLAMMING them into the concrete building, 
           bouncing them outward, and back towards the building like 
           a pendulum...

           INT. SKYSCRAPER 30TH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Riley and Oro CRASH through windows, tumbling ass over 
           tea kettle across the floor.  

                                 DR. ORO
                        Damn!

           Riley freaks.

                                 RILEY
                        What?  What!

                                 DR. ORO
                        I left my bottle on the roof.

           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           Smith’s Humvee roars down an alley, careening into walls--
           trying to shake the TWO DRAGONS ON THE ROOF off.

           INT. ARMORED HUMVEE - CONTINUOUS

           Razor sharp claws punch through the roof, groping around 
           the cabin blindly.  Smith shoves his XM-97 against the 
           roof and blasts through it.  One of the Dragons falls 
           onto the hood.
           It ROARS--dagger fangs two feet from Smith’s face.  It 
           punches through the windshield, ripping the rifle out of 
           Smith’s hand and shoves its head through the hole.

           A face full of Dragon and weaponless, Smith grabs the 
           only thing he’s got...

           That bottle of OLD CROW.  He SMASHES it on the steering 
           wheel and stabs the snarling son of a bitch right in the 
           eye.  It jerks back screaming and Smith cuts the wheel 
           sharp around a corner--the Dragon topples off the hood.  
           The Humvee BOUNCES HARD, front wheels running it over.

           Sufficiently freaked the fuck out, Smith downshifts and 
           keeps on trucking.

           EXT. STREETS (WITH BODETTE) - NIGHT

           Bodette and his Soldiers pour the fire down a street from 
           their trench.  Dragons keep coming, firing their wrist 
           mounted PARALYSIS WEAPONS and a PLASMA WEAPON that puts a 
           hole in ANYTHING it hits, including Tanks.

           A Dragon APPEARS IN THE TRENCH WITH THEM, right between 
           two soldiers--its claws rip them to shreds.  They never 
           saw it coming.  

           Bodette blows the thing away--an OVERLY EXCITED SOLDIER 
           reaches for the Dragon’s weapons...

           Just like Smith said, the body disappears, taking a divot 
           of dirt and concrete with it...and the arm of the poor 
           overly excited bastard.

           Bodette calmly picks up a rifle, and slaps it into the 
           remaining hand of the screaming soldier.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        Hell, Son...he left ya one.  Use 
                        it. 

           MORE DRAGONS appear in the trench.  

           TRACKING WITH BODETTE:

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        Fall back!

           The General climbs out the trench, and seeks cover behind 
           a massive FLAME THROWING TANK, as his previous position 
           is OVERRUN.  

           Of the fifty Soldiers that went down here with him, maybe 
           twenty make it to Bodette’s position.    

           He screams into his radio...
                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                                 (On Radio)
                        Sector Seven, overrun.  Lima 
                        Company falling back to Rally 
                        Point Alpha Twelve...

           Bodette POUNDS the side of the Flame Tank--it spews a 
           stream of fiery napalm down the street, engulfing the 
           oncoming Dragons.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                                 (on Radio)
                        Say again, Rally Point Alpha 
                        Twelve.

           He catches the eye of another steely-eyed KILLING 
           MACHINE.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        Knew I shoulda joined the Navy, 
                        Son.

           About then, A SUBMARINE FALLS OUT OF THE SKY and SLAMS 
           into the street behind them, cracking like an egg.  

           Dragons are all over it in seconds.

           INT. SKYSCRAPER 30TH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Riley and Oro make for the elevator--pointing their guns 
           at anything that looks like might even be thinking of 
           moving.  

           The doors DING open...

           They come face to face with a SNARLING and ROARING Dragon 
           trapped in the elevator.  Oro and Riley vaporlock. 

           DING--the doors close.  

                                 RILEY
                        Uh...we’ll wait for the next one.

           Oro, with flagrant disregard for his own personal 
           safety...

           ...promptly faints.

           EXT. SKYSCRAPER (STREET LEVEL) - NIGHT

           Smith’s Humvee is wrapped around a light pole, bullet 
           ridden, and shredded.
           INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           It appears a battle moved through here from the bullet 
           holes, blood, and XM-97s on the floor.  

           WE FIND Smith limping across the marble floor, looking 
           like he was frisked by a mountain lion.  He picks up an 
           XM-97, wipes the blood out of his eyes, AND PRESSES THE 
           ELEVATOR BUTTON.  

           Catching his breath.  Waiting. 

           DING.  Slowly, the elevator doors open...

           It’s empty.  Smith steps in.

           INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           Just Smith and Winter Wonderland, Musak style.  

           Nothing else to do, Smith hums along.

           Still humming.  

           Suddenly, the elevator stops at a floor.  

           Oh shit.  Smith backs up, aiming his XM-97 at the doors.  
           Heart pounding.  He let’s loose a REBEL YELL as the doors 
           open, revealing...

           Oro and Riley yelling right back at him.  Guns aimed at 
           each other--it takes a BEAT to sink in.

           INT. SKYSCRAPER 30TH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Smith grabs her and lays a zinger of a kiss on her.  He 
           pours his heart and soul into that kiss.  Her knees 
           actually buckle, as they gaze into each other’s eyes.  

           Then...well, then she slaps him in the back of the head.

                                 RILEY
                        And where the hell have you been?

                                 SMITH
                        I...

                                 RILEY
                        You didn’t even come after me.

                                 SMITH
                        You fell out of a plane.

                                 RILEY
                        Oh, so it’s my fault? 
                                 SMITH
                        But...

                                 RILEY
                        I don’t wanna hear it.

           Oro puckers up for his turn with Riley.  Smith grabs him 
           by the ear.

                                 DR. ORO
                        Ow...ow...that’s attached.

                                 SMITH
                        Remember that little stroll down 
                        memory lane?

                                 DR. ORO
                        That wasn’t my idea!  You don’t 
                        tell Kronau no.  Not more than 
                        once anyway.  

                                 RILEY
                        Can you get slappy with the Muppet 
                        later?  You know that whole 
                        impending death and doom thing we 
                        got going on?  It just got doom-
                        ier.

           INT. COMMAND AND CONTROL - NIGHT

           The place is a din of TERRIFIED BATTLEFIELD VOICES 
           transmissions from the field.

           Admiral Malloy commands from the NYC Hologram.

           An ASHEN MAJOR delivers bad news...

                                 ASHEN MAJOR
                        Admiral, we just lost LA, Houston, 
                        and Detroit.  Miami and Atlanta 
                        are falling... 

                                 ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        Washington?

           BEAT.

                                 ASHEN MAJOR
                        Your wife’s company was lost two 
                        minutes in, Sir.  I’m told it was 
                        quick.

           Malloy sucks it up--looks back at the Hologram of NYC--
           it’s covered with RED Dragon BLIPS.  
           INT. ARK WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           At a massive glass and steel table sit the WORLD LEADERS 
           of every major nation on Earth.  Before each of them is a 
           REAL TIME HOLOGRAM of the battle unfolding in their 
           respective capitals.

           It ain’t lookin’ good for the home team.

           President Kronau sits at the head of the table.  He looks 
           positively ill--he’s aged ten years from when we last saw 
           him.

                                 RUSSIAN PRESIDENT
                        Berlin has fallen.  Paris.  
                        Beijing.  Tokyo.  Warsaw...  

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        Secondary cities and rural areas 
                        are holding.

                                 FRENCH PRESIDENT
                        Just a matter of time...

                                 RUSSIAN PRESIDENT
                        Launch the ArchAngels.  

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        Not yet...

                                 RUSSIAN PRESIDENT
                        The people in this Ark are the 
                        last hope of humanity, Mr. 
                        President.  

                                 ENGLISH PRIME MINISTER
                        London is holding.  As is, if I’m 
                        not mistaking, Moscow.  We still 
                        have a chance...

                                 RUSSIAN PRESIDENT
                        You’re delaying the inevitable, 
                        and each minute you wait places us 
                        in greater danger!  

                                 FRENCH PRESIDENT
                        They will locate this facility.

                                 SPANISH PRESIDENT
                        And it will become the focus of 
                        all their attentions.  It can’t 
                        withstand that...
                                 ENGLISH PRIME MINISTER
                        I’m not ready just yet to sign the 
                        death warrant of seven billion 
                        people.

                                 FRENCH PRESIDENT
                        Four billion.

           Murmurs and arguments ensue.  You can almost see the 
           knife twisting in Kronau’s gut.  He leaps up, slapping 
           the table hard.

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        Not yet!  Not yet...

           INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON THE TITANIUM ARK ENTRANCE:

           A single claw rakes down the polished metal door, leaving 
           a lengthy scar.

           PULL BACK:

           One Dragon.  Just one.  It eyes the massive blast door.  
           SNIFFS the air...

           Casting a reptilian eye upward, it inspects the roof of 
           the subway tunnel.  Then, kneeling, it runs a claw along 
           the ground.

           INT. SKYSCRAPER 30TH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Smith, Riley, and Oro.  Smith and Oro stare out the 
           windows.  The PARALYZED ARE RISING.  From up here, they 
           can see them by the thousands, disappearing into the dark 
           sky between tracer rounds and fiery explosions.  

           Riley paces like a caged animal.

                                 RILEY
                        Why the hell not?  

                                 SMITH
                        Even if I was suicidal enough to 
                        try to get another one, it 
                        wouldn’t matter.

                                 DR. ORO
                        The Devices draw power from the 
                        ships, remember?  They get burnt 
                        to cripsy critters today, they 
                        can’t go to yesterday... 
                                 SMITH
                        Which means we couldn’t leave it, 
                        and we’d just end up here again 
                        tomorrow.

                                 DR. ORO
                        Today.

                                 SMITH
                        Whatever.

                                 RILEY
                        We can’t let them launch.  We 
                        can’t let them destroy everything.

           An M-Fighter streaks by the windows, chasing a Human Jet.  
           Smith stares after it.

                                 SMITH
                        Damn that Old Man.

                                 RILEY
                        What?

                                 SMITH
                        Seven years today, an Old Man 
                        walked up to me on the street.  
                        Gave me The Device.  Showed me the 
                        sequence, and told me not to ask 
                        questions.  He didn’t have 
                        answers.  Just said he couldn’t do 
                        it anymore, and walked into the 
                        street.  Right in front of a bus.

                                 DR. ORO
                        He didn’t tell you who he was?

                                 SMITH
                        Didn’t have to...

           Smith turns to them.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        He was me.  An eighty year old 
                        version of me.  

           BEAT.

                                 DR. ORO
                        What if this isn’t the first time?  
                        I mean, they could keep going back 
                        all the way to Adam and Eve, so to 
                        speak.  Jump a hundred thousand 
                        years into the future, and start 
                        all over.
           The building QUAKES from a series of nearby EXPLOSIONS.  
           SHRIEKS of M Fighters.  Close.

                        They’ll keep comin’. Day after 
                        day.  Year after year.  Kronau was 
                        right, this is everything we can 
                        do.  This is it.  It’s the only 
                        way anybody can be saved.    

           EXT. NIGHT SKY - NIGHT

           A single M Fighter shrieks through the clouds, far away 
           from Manhattan.  Suddenly, its wings retract inward 
           several feet, narrowing its width before making a ninety-
           degree dive. 

           EXT. RESERVOIR - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON: A sign that tells us this is the HILLVIEW 
           RESERVOIR.  A helpful little map touts it’s purpose and 
           route--from this point to the heart of Manhattan.

           PULL BACK:  The moon reflects peacefully over the 164-
           acre man made reservoir lake.  Till, the M Fighter dives 
           directly into it, PLASMA CANNONS FIRING...

           INT. WATER TUNNEL NO. 3 - CONTINUOUS

           A twenty-four foot wide water filled tunnel--the M 
           Fighter streaks down it at an ungodly speed.

           INT. ARK WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           The WORLD LEADERS are bickering and shouting among 
           themselves, as Kronau speaks with a GENERAL across the 
           room from them.  You can actually see all the blood drain 
           from his face at the news he’s receiving. 

           He returns to his place at the head of the table, leaning 
           on it for support.  Quietly, he stands there.  The World 
           Leaders notice his expression--the bickering slows to 
           expectant SILENCE.

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU
                        New York...is the last city 
                        standing.

           It sucks the air out of the room.  

           WE MOVE STRAIGHT DOWN:

           Through the tile floor and the concrete...

           Through the dirt, conduits, and pipes that reside below 
           Manhattan...
           Further still, through eight-foot wide sewer pipes.  
           Down.  Down into the bed rock, to...

           INT. WATER TUNNEL NO. 3 (MANHATTAN) - CONTINUOUS

           Two hundred and fifty feet below the surface, a mere 
           hundred feet under the Ark Subway Tunnels, we enter the 
           massive Water Tunnel No. 3 once more.

           It’s dark and water filled.  But, a light approaches.  A 
           RED GLOW.  Fast.

           The M-Fighter we witnessed earlier blows by at an 
           incredible speed--small iridescent red globes fall from 
           it’s belly, like a trail of Christmas Lights...

           INT. ARK WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 RUSSIAN PRESIDENT
                        Please.  For the love of God, 
                        before it is too late!

           Kronau can barely stand.  Billions are going do die by 
           the next words out of his mouth.

           His body weighing down on him, he collapses into his 
           chair.

           collapsing it.  The pressure wave pulverizing the bedrock 
           around it...
           INT. COMMAND AND CONTROL - CONTINUOUS

           Admiral Malloy nods solemnly--he reaches for the 
           plexiglass covered touchscreen ArchAngel Launch Panel.  
           His fingers slide the plexiglass aside...

                                 PRESIDENT KRONAU (O.S.)
                        God have mercy on me.

           A THUNDEROUS RUMBLE sends Malloy across the room.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS

           A massive fissure, like a sink hole, rockets through the 
           park and out into the streets.  Every re-enforced water 
           tunnel, sewer tunnel, and subway tunnel collapsing under 
           the weight above it.

           The ground ruptures, sinking the accumulative distance of 
           the space in all those pipes--five or six stories down.  
           Steam, water, and fire burst forth from the ground...

           INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Smith, Riley, and Oro are nearly knocked form their feet 
           as the entire building trembles around them...

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Bodette watches in horror as an entire ARMORED COLUMN 
           falls into the fissure ripping down the street...

           INT. ARK WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Screams.  Confusion.  The strobe effect of lights 
           flicking off and on.  The room is half-caved in, and 
           listing to one side.

           Alarms and a COMPUTERIZED VOICE scream...

                                 COMPUTERIZED VOICE
                        Ark integrity compromised.  Non-

           So much for the last hope of mankind.  Dragons pour down 
           from above, through the open fissures from the surface.

           Two million people--it’s now a Dragon buffet.

           INT. ARK WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kronau comes to, legs crushed under a slap of concrete.  
           Pinned, he moans in agony.
           He locks eyes with THE DRAGON STANDING OVER HIM...

           INT. COMMAND AND CONTROL - NIGHT

           Soldiers are still picking themselves up off the floor,

           yells...

                        Re-routing emergency power...

           Admiral Malloy, bleeding from a gash across face, 
           staggers his way to the NYC Hologram--he manipulates it 
           to bore down to the Subway/Ark level.  Disaster.

                                 ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        Open all Ark channels.  Try to 
                        raise any survivors..!

           RADIO CHANNELS are opened.  BLOOD CURDLING SCREAMS 
           reverberate over loudspeakers through out.  Till, the 
           echoing screams cease, replaced by HISSING STATIC with a 
           jarring suddenness. 

           INT. SKYSCRAPER 30TH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           The building finally stops quaking.  Oro, Smith, and 
           Riley rush to the now SHATTERED windows.  From up here, 
           we can see--A MILE LONG TEAR right through the heart of 
           Manhattan...

                        Don’t tell me that was The Ark.

           Oro buries his face in his hand for an answer.  It’s a 
           gut punch that lingers.  No one speaks for a long moment.  
           Till...

                                 RILEY

                        message.

           Oro jerks like he was just bit on the nards by an 
           electric eel.

                                 DR. ORO
                        That’s it..! Oh my Elvis, that is 
                        it.

                                 SMITH
                        Yeah, I think that’s what she’s 
                        trying to say.
                                 DR. ORO
                        No, another message.  We send back 
                        a message to disregard the first 
                        message.  

           Smith and Riley just blink at him.

                                 DR. ORO (CONT’D)
                        We jump to yesterday, it’ll be 
                        like the last fifteen years have 
                        never happened!

                        go back!  They die here.

           Riley grabs Oro by the front of coat--jacks him up tough 
           guy style.

                                 RILEY
                        Everything would be normal?  Like

           M FIGHTERS streak from the black sky in formation on a 
           BOMBING RUN.  From their undersides fall iridescent BLUE 
           ORBS--PARALYSIS BOMBS.  City block sized concussions 
           circle from impact sites.

           God help anyone caught by them--RUNNING SOLDIERS drop 
           where they’re engulfed.  

           WE FIND Bodette taking cover behind the edge of a 
           building missing half its floors.  All in all, it’s a

           Smith rings off, before galloping to a halt.  Oro and 
           Riley don’t look much better--all leaning over, resting 
           hands on knees, and gasping like dying trout.

           ground away, revealing half its reptilian skull.

           And it has a major case of the ass.

           An M-Fighter swoops out of the pitch black above, cannons 
           blasting.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT

           It’s eerily quiet.  Dark.    

           A shadow moves.  A man.  A Soldier.  Quiet.  Stealthy.

           General Bodette glides from cover to cover alone--weapon 
           ready.  He halts at a street corner.

           He hears something.  Is that a siren?

           A BEAT LATER--a Fire Engine BLARES by lit up like 
           Christmas, half on fire, two Dragons on top of it, and 
           being chased by an M-Fighter.

           With a mighty “Why me?” sigh, The General heads after the 
           circus.
           INT. FIRE ENGINE - CONTINUOUS

           The windshield is full of Dragon, as one leans over the 
           cab and punches through the glass--reaching for Smith.  

           Riley and Oro are too busy leaning out the side windows, 
           and shooting at one on the back.

                                 SMITH
                        Gun...

                                 RILEY
                        What?

                                 SMITH
                        Gun!

           Riley tosses him her rifle--Smith, steering with one 
           hand, shoves the rifle into the Dragon’s face and 
           unloads.  A moment later, the headless Dragon disappears--
           TAKING THE ENTIRE ROOF WITH IT.

           Oro and Riley, hair now blowing in the breeze, glare at 
           him.

                                 SMITH
                        Whoops.

           BEAT.

                                 RILEY
                        Are you sure I married you?

                                 SMITH
                        Hey, you asked me, Cupcake

                                 RILEY
                                 (Gasp)
                        I did not!

                                 SMITH
                        I didn’t want anything to do with 
                        you, but somebody just wouldn’t 
                        take restraining order for an 
                        answer.

           Riley is on the verge of launching an ass chewin’, when 
           the Fire Engine SHUTTERS--Plasma rounds slam into the ass 
           end...

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           The M-Fighter scores a few more direct hits--ass end 
           blown to hell, the concussion sends the Fire Engine 
           careening onto its side...
           Sliding half a block, and coming to a smoking, flaming 
           halt in the center of WASHINGTON SQUARE.

           The M-Fighter streaks by, banking high for another run--
           Smith, Riley, and Oro crawl out of the wreckage and 
           stumble away into the shadows in the knick of time.

           A final pass of Plasma Fire, and the Fire Engine EXPLODES 
           into an inferno.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

           The thousands of HARVESTER SHIPS descend en masse--
           triangular shapes turning.  They look like gleaming black 
           shark fins as they turn a flat edge parallel to the 
           ground in unison.

           Shaking the foundations of the city, they land 
           simultaneously--each a thousand feet tall, and towering 
           over the smouldering wreckage of buildings.  

           EXT. NYU CAMPUS - NIGHT

           Familiar territory.  When we last were here, we were 
           looking at MARINE ONE, the Presidential Helicopter 
           sitting here.  Now, the flaming wreckage of a futuristic 
           Attack Chopper greets us.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Lights flicker.  Shadows jump.  Smith, Riley, and Oro 
           ease down the hallway--eyes wide and their guns ready.

           The place is a wreck.  Blood is splattered on walls.  
           Helmets lay here and there.  One still has a head in it.

           They round a corner.  There’s a large section of hallway 
           plunged into shadow just ahead--the overhead lights out.  

           The Trio slowly walks into the black shadow.  A SCUFFLE.  
           A SCREAM CUT SHORT.

           ...Oro’s helmet bounces into the light.

           Silence.

           INT. COMMAND AND CONTROL - NIGHT

           Under complete attack.  Tracer rounds and Dragon fire 
           whiz through the air, slamming into the once High-Tech 
           computers...

           C & C ENTRANCE:
           WE FIND Admiral Malloy with a DOZEN SOLDIERS behind a 
           barricade they’ve erected in front of the double door 
           entrance--firing down the hallway that leads to Command 
           and Control.

           The only thing saving their ass is the choke point of 
           that long hallway.  But, for every Dragon they blow away, 
           three more take its place.

           Malloy shouts over the battle.

                                 ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        Hold the line!  Last man standing 
                        launches the ArchAngel strike.  
                        And save a bullet for yourself.

           INT. SHADOW OF HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Bodette has a hand clamped over Riley’s mouth.  She yanks 
           the hand away.

                                 RILEY
                                 (Hisses)
                        You almost gave me a frickin’ 
                        heart attack, G.I. Jackass!

           INT. BASEMENT LAB - MOMENTS LATER

           Lights FLICKER on.  Smith and Company descend the stairs 
           into the place that hasn’t seen light in more than a 
           decade.  Everything is covered in dust.  And, what isn’t 
           dusty, has a blanket of cobwebs over it.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        This is a time machine?

                        DR. ORO
                                                         SMITH
           It’s not what you think.
                                              It’s not what you think.

           They share a quick look, shaking off the weirdness of 
           Deja Vu.

                                 RILEY
                        Oh my God, is it gonna work?

                                 DR. ORO
                        Of course it’s gonna 
                        work...probably.  Absolutely.  It 
                        might.

           Oro sets about pulling cob webs off, twisting dials, and 
           powering it up.

                                 DR. ORO (CONT’D)
                        But, somebody has to go up there 
                        and get a Device from a Dragon.
           Once again...

           Smith looks at Bodette.  Bodette looks at Smith.  They 
           raise the Rock, Paper, Scissor fists-- One, Two...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. NYU HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Smith creeps along quietly.

                                 SMITH
                        I gotta stop fallin’ for that.

           INT. BASEMENT LAB

           Riley is fit to be tied.  Pacing.  Hands wringing.  Fuck 
           it, she picks up a rifle and makes for the stairs.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        Where dya think you’re goin’?

                                 RILEY
                        I am so not about to let my future 
                        husband get ripped to Smith-
                        ereens.

           Bodette blocks her path.

                                 RILEY (CONT’D)
                        He’d do it for me.

           He cracks a smile.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        Boy has spent seven years tryin’ 
                        save you, guess I can see why.  Be 
                        a shame to let ‘em lose you now. 

           Bodette takes her rifle and heads up the stairs.

                                 RILEY
                        General...

           He stops at the top of the stairs.

                                 RILEY (CONT’D)
                        He’s the only good thing that’s 
                        ever happened to me.  Don’t let 
                        him die.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        Not today.
           INT. NYU HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Bodette doesn’t creep.  He doesn’t sneak.  He strides 
           down the hallway.  Game face on.  He pulls his radio.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE 
                                 (On Radio)
                        Admiral...

           INT. COMMAND AND CONTROL - CONTINUOUS

           Those double steel doors are now barred shut, and dented 
           to shit.  WHAM--another dent from the other side...

           WE FIND Admiral Malloy bleeding heavily from multiple 
           wounds.  A Soldier tightens a tourniquet around Malloy’s 
           leg, as another Soldier covers the door with his rifle.

           They’re the only ones left.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE (O.S.)
                                 (On Radio)
                        I need fifteen more minutes.

           WHAM--another bash at the door.  The Soldiers share a 
           look with Malloy.  Fifteen minutes?  No fucking way.

                                 ADMIRAL MALLOY
                                 (On Radio)
                        I hope you believe in miracles, 
                        Bo.  

           Malloy grits his teeth as the tourniquet is torqued 
           tight.

                                 ADMIRAL MALLOY
                                 (On Radio)
                        It’s been an honor, General.

           INT. NYU HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        It’s about to be.

           Bodette turns off the radio and tosses it over his 
           shoulder.  He sheds his body armor.  He drops his XM-97.  
           Never breaking stride, he cracks his neck and marches on.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT

           Near the apex of each Harvester Ship, openings have 
           appeared that stretch around the vessels like a band--
           emitting BRILLIANT light from within the ships.  
           Along each forty-five degree angle side, steps have 
           protruded from hull--giving them all the smack of step 
           pyramids.  And down these steps march THE REST OF THE 
           DRAGONS.

           Big ones.  Small ones.  

           All of them.  

           Millions.  

           WE PULL UP:

           New York from above.  Dragons move like swarming locusts.  
           Too many to count...

           INT. NYU HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Smith, a pipe in his hand, stares at a hallway door.  
           There’s the distinct SOUND OF SOMETHING EATING SOMETHING 
           emanating from the other side.  Bones crunch.

           Knuckles white, fingers tightening around the pipe, Smith 
           psychs himself up for it.  He backs up as far as he can, 
           and charges...

           Bodette reaches out of a shadow--grabing Smith, and 
           stopping him cold.  

                                 GENERAL BODETTE
                        Smith...

           The General pulls the only weapon he has, his sidearm and 
           racks the slide.

                                 GENERAL BODETTE (CONT’D)
                        Merry Christmas, Son.

           Bodette kicks open the door, and charges in--pistol 
           BLASTING...

           INT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Dragon never saw it comin’--it HOWLS as the rounds 
           rip into it.  Not slowing, Bodette tackles it.  Claws 
           tear into him.  Fangs snap.  But, the man never screams.  

           He rips THE BLACKBERRY mounted on The Dragon’s armor off, 
           and throws it to Smith.  Already as good as dead, Bodette 
           keeps blasting...  

           The Dragon disappears.

           Taking Bodette with it, still firing his pistol.
           INT. BASEMENT LAB - NIGHT

           Dr. Oro has Stella on--the Time Machine hums and sparks, 
           as he pecks away at a laptop.

           Riley stares at the door.  Waiting.

                                 DR. ORO
                        Cocked, locked, and ready to rock,

                                 DR. ORO
                        Him...

           Riley runs up the steps to meet Smith.

                                 SMITH
                        Let’s get the hell outta here.

           He tosses The Blackberry to Oro.

                                 RILEY
                        Wait a minute, where’s Bodette?

           He looks her in the eye--she gets it.

                                 SMITH
                                 (to Oro)
                        You know how to hook that up?

                                 DR. ORO
                        As long as you remembered it 
                        right.  

           Smith hands Riley his XM-97, and points to the door at 
           the top of the stairs.

                                 RILEY
                        Yeah, yeah.  Scales, right.

           As Oro hooks up The Blackberry, Smith pounds a few keys 
           on the laptop--we see the binary translation dancing 
           across the screen “001 11 010...”

                                 RILEY
                        What are you doing?

                                 SMITH
                        Keepin’ my word.
           INT. COMMAND AND CONTROL - NIGHT

           Malloy is propped up against the wall--deathly white from 
           loss of blood.  The two remaining Soldiers kneeling next 
           to him.

           The metal doors are giving way.  Creaking and moaning.  A 
           CLAW finally punches through.

           The men open up with their rifles on the door...

           INT. BASEMENT LAB

           Stella HUMS LOUDER...

                        Got it!  Uploading the message.  
                        Ready to send.

           Oro grabs Smith’s arm.

                        Bowls...

           Riley turns to them.

                                 RILEY
                        For cryin’ out loud!

           When she turns back to the door--IT’S WIDE OPEN!

                        Guys..?  Guys, the door is open...   

           Smith joins Riley.

                                 SMITH
                        Anything get in?

                                 RILEY
                        I don’t know.

                                 SMITH
                        I thought you were watching it.

                                 RILEY
                        I was watching it.

                                 SMITH
                        Then how can you not know if 
                        anything got in?  Like, maybe a 
                        nine-foot tall, intergalactic, man-
                        eating gecko...
           ORO SCREAMS behind them.  Yeah, something got in.  

           Smith and Riley turn just in time to see a Dragon rip Oro 
           apart.  They blow it to smithereens--jumping back as it 
           vanishes...taking half of Dr. Oro with it.

           They fall all over themselves getting to the Time Machine 
           controls, which they stare at blankly.

                                 SMITH
                        Which button?

           Five meek little buttons.

                                 RILEY
                        The blinking one.

                                 SMITH
                        They’re all blinking.

                                 RILEY
                        Well...pick one.

                                 SMITH
                        You pick one.

                                 RILEY
                        So you can hold that over my head 
                        if I’m wrong?  I don’t think so.

           Smith presses a button. Nothing happens.

           He tries another. Nada.

                                 RILEY
                        Come on, come on, come on...

           He presses a fourth button--the Time Machine VIBRATES to 
           life.  Electricity arcing.  Sparks flying.

                                 RILEY
                        That’s it!  It’s working!

           With a disheartening DRONE, the damned thing dies.  Just 
           goes off.  Smith presses the fifth button.  Nothing 
           happens.  Again and again.  Nothing.

           They stare at it in disbelief.

                                 RILEY
                        What happened?

                                 SMITH
                        I dunno.
                                 RILEY
                        It’s not working...

                                 SMITH
                        We...I...shit.

           Riley jumps up and down.

                                 RILEY
                        What the hell!

                                 SMITH
                        Well...we can still jump.

           Crushed, Riley shakes her head.

                                 RILEY
                        And yesterday will be like it was 
                        when we got here.  Only the 
                        Dragons won’t come.  The world 
                        won’t end...

           She drops her rifle.

                                 RILEY (CONT’D)
                        This time ain’t worth living for.  

           GROWLS.  Somewhere in the halls above.  

           They share a look.  Riley nods, the choice unspoken.

           Smith pulls her close--tears and lips touch, as he lays 
           the greatest kiss mankind has ever witnessed on her.  

           He brushes a tear from her eye.

                                 RILEY
                        I’m sorry.  I am so sorry.  For 
                        everything. You’ve risked your 
                        life a thousand times.  Just to 
                        save me, before I ever even met 
                        you.  I would’ve been proud to 
                        marry you, James Smith.  If I have 
                        to die, I want it to be with you.

           Smith has the vague expression of a man who has just 
           stepped in something rather unpleasant.

                                 SMITH
                        I have to tell you something, 
                        Riley.

           She leans in--doe-eyed and expecting the sweet.

                                 RILEY
                        Yes..?
                                 SMITH 
                        Well...I...I really...

                                 RILEY
                        Say it.  Just say it.

                                 SMITH
                        You didn’t marry me.  

           BEAT.

                                 RILEY
                        What.

                                 SMITH
                        I couldn’t even get you to go out 
                        with me.  You wouldn’t give me the 
                        time of day.    

           Riley is at a loss.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Look, I fell in love with you the 
                        moment I saw you.  Like you were 
                        the only woman in the world.  
                        Everything else just faded away 
                        when I looked at you.  I couldn’t 
                        let anything happen to you.  Even 
                        if you didn’t love me.    

           A smile creeps over her lips...

                                 RILEY
                        That is just so...so...

           And dies a horrible death.

                                 RILEY (CONT’D)
                        Wrong!

           Riley shoves Smith against the Time Machine--his ELBOW 
           HITS A SWITCH, and...

           The friggin’ thing COMES BACK ON with a hum!

           Their eyes go to the laptop--words across the screen: 
           “SPACE-TIME LOCK ENGAGED.  SENDING DATA...”

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. NYU HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Smith and Riley haul ass.  He fumbles with The 
           Blackberry, putting it back together.  She blasts 
           anything that even looks like it might be a Dragon...
           INT. COMMAND AND CONTROL - NIGHT

           Blood spatters the walls.

           A Dragon TOWERS over Malloy.  It grabs him by the shirt, 
           lifting him to its hideous snarling face.  

           Malloy, a breath from bleeding out anyway, smiles.

                                 ADMIRAL MALLOY
                        Ho, ho...

           There’s a bootlace tied to his finger...

           A STRING OF BOOTLACES--the other end tied to A BULLET.

           Which is holding up the butt of a rifle.

           Which is poised over the ArchAngel LAUNCH BUTTON.

           Malloy tugs his finger.  The rifle falls...

                                 COMPUTERIZED VOICE
                        ArchAngel launch initiated.

                                 ADMIRAL MALLOY (CONT’D)
                        Ho.

           EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE - NIGHT

           Smith and Riley tear ass out of the building--the air is 
           alive with the sound of Dragons.  The damned things must 
           be everywhere, though none are visible at the moment in 
           the flickering light of the burning Attack Chopper.

                                 RILEY
                        We get to yesterday, we are gonna 
                        have a big talk Mr...Mr. Lying 
                        Sack of...of Lies!

           Smith has his eyes on The Blackberry, pecking away 
           furiously, entering the sequence...  

                                 SMITH
                        Baby, you can...

           He looks up.  

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        No...

                                 RILEY
                        What?
           That fucking ONE-EYED DRAGON IS TOWERING OVER RILEY.  No 
           idea it’s behind her.  No idea it’s about to take her 
           head off. 

           Smith shoves her out of the way in the knick of time, 
           taking a vicious swipe meant for Riley--sending him 
           crashing into the building.

           Riley raises her rifle...CLICK.  Empty.  She throws it at 
           the thing, and steps back as it advances--right into a 
           wall.  No where to go.  Growling death three feet away...

           Smith, bloody and horribly wounded, blind sides the 
           salivating beast with a length of steel from the Chopper 
           wreckage, and keeps pounding away...

                                 SMITH
                        Go...

           The Blackberry is on the ground, right in front of Riley.  
           No.  She charges at the Dragon, intent on helping Smith.  
           He SHOVES her on her ass as the Dragon recovers and 
           pounces him.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Leave..!  Jump, Riley..!

           It’s killing him.  Tearing at him with claws.  Throwing 
           him like a rag doll.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Please...

           More SNARLS are coming.  Across the campus--more Dragons.  
           Riley barely dodges a blast from a Paralysis weapon--
           diving to the ground, grabbing up the Blackberry.

           Then, the night sky LIGHTS UP far away on the horizon.  
           THE NUKES!  Exploding in the sky, thousands of feet in 
           the air.  

           The One-Eyed Dragon looks up--a cloud of hellfire races 
           downward.  Same instant, Riley hits the button, the air 
           warps around her...

           She dives on top of Smith’s body, a split second before 
           NUCLEAR FIRE ENGULFS EVERYTHING IN SIGHT.

           EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE (DAY BEFORE) - DAY

           GRAPHIC: DECEMBER 22nd, 2011

           It’s Christmas time in New York.  Here’s the city we all 
           love.  In the middle of the square, the air begins to 
           warp...
           PEDESTRIANS, hands full of shopping bags, step back.  Out 
           of thin air, RILEY AND SMITH APPEAR.  Some people scream.  
           Some stare.  Some run.  Some shrug--it is New York.

           WITH SMITH AND RILEY:

           He’s laid out.  Bleeding a river.  Riley rolls him over 
           onto his back--holds his head.  He’s pale as a ghost.

                                 RILEY
                        Smith?  James..!

           Nothing.  She shakes him.

                                 RILEY
                        No..wake up.  We’re here.  We made 
                        it...  

           A crowd of shocked faces gathers around her.

                                 RILEY (CONT’D)
                                 (to Pedestrians)
                        What are you lookin’ at?  Call an 
                        ambulance!  

           She shakes Smith again.  And again.

                                 RILEY
                        Please wake up...I love you.

           He was dead before they jumped.  It takes her till this 
           moment to accept it.

           Tears running down her face, she takes the watch off his 
           wrist--clutches it tightly.  

                                 RILEY
                        Merry Christmas, James.

           Bloodied.  Filthy.  Crying.  Beat up.  Riley disappears 
           into the crowd...

                                                                 FADE TO:

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC (ABOVE) - NIGHT

           WE MOVE over America’s Capitol.  It most definitely “Tis 
           the Season”.  CHRISTMAS LIGHTS are everywhere.  Tinsel 
           and decoration gleam--monuments are bathed in green and 
           red flood lights.

           INT. CAFE - NIGHT

           Riley sits alone at a table--the cafe empty.  Her wounds 
           are bandaged.  Her clothes clean.
           A TV IS ON.  Something on it catches her eye--DR. ORO.

           CLOSE ON TV: Dr. Oro is embraced by PRESIDENT MALLOY at a 
           Press Conference.  The FIRST LADY and their DAUGHTER look 
           on.

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Though the Scientist refused to 
                        admit how he knew about the 
                        mechanical problem, his 
                        intervention kept the President’s 
                        family from boarding the doomed 
                        helicopter...   

                                 RILEY
                                 (dawning smile)
                        Keepin’ your word.

                        When asked how he could ever be 
                        repaid... 

           The video cuts to Oro shaking President Malloy by the 
           collar, as AGENT DAWES tries to pull him off.

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Dr. Oro demanded a one billion 
                        dollar grant to the SETI Search 
                        for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence 
                        program...  

           EXT. CAFE - CONTINUOUS

           You know, there’s something familiar about this cafe.  
           Maybe it’s that blown bulb in the strand of Christmas 
           lights.

           Riley exits--stares at the stars.  

           SOMEONE approaches, waving a note.  A smile parts Riley’s 
           lips.

           It’s SMITH.  The Smith from this day.  

                                 SMITH
                        You the one that bailed me out?

           She nods.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Do I know you?

                                 RILEY
                        Not yet.
           The OLD LADY from the beginning of our story comes out of 
           the cafe, and lays the skunk eye on that blown bulb.

                                 OLD LADY
                        Abner?  Abner?  Abner!  

           Our old pal Abner comes out, sporting his Santa hat and 
           carrying a ladder.

                                 OLD LADY (CONT’D)
                        There’s a light out.  Didn’t you 
                        hear me yelling for you?   

                                 ABNER
                        France could hear you yelling for 
                        me.

                                 OLD LADY
                        What did you say?

                                 ABNER
                        Nothing, Honey.

           As the Old Lady bitches at Abner...

                                 RILEY
                                 (to Smith)
                        How about a walk?

           He’s smitten.

                                 SMITH
                        I think I’d like that.

           The watch on Riley’s wrist, Dead Smith’s watch, BEEPS-- 
           blinking 00:00:00.

           She freezes.  Listening.  Waiting.  Looking around, as 
           ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENS.  She cracks a mile wide 
           smile.  They head off down the sidewalk.  

           Riley tosses The Blackberry into a trash can, wraps an 
           arm around Smith’s arm, and lays her head on his 
           shoulder.

                                 SMITH
                        You ever gonna tell me who you 
                        are?

                                 RILEY
                        James...we’ve got all the time in 
                        the world to get to that.

           Picture perfect.  Arm and arm, they stroll down the 
           sidewalk, as a gentle flutter of snow falls.  
           The lights and decorations blink.  They pass other 
           smiling couples.  Norman Rockwell couldn’t have painted 
           this ending...  

                                                                  CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON TRASH CAN:

           The Blackberry among empty coffee cups and newspapers.  
           As the Christmas Carols play in the background...

           ...it POWERS ON.

                                                            FADE TO BLACK.
