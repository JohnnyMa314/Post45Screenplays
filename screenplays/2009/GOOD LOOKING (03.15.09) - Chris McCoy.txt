ROMANTIC FOUNTAIN - GLORIOUS AFTERNOON

           An attractive middle-aged COUPLE sits on the edge of an 
           elaborately carved stone FOUNTAIN, holding hands and warmly 
           looking at the camera. Their names are PAUL and ELIZABETH, 
           and they are telling their LOVE STORY.   

           After this brief scene, Paul and Elizabeth won't appear in 
           the script again, because this is a COMMERCIAL. 

           The tone is like the tone of those eHarmony commercials - 
           perhaps bordering on saccharine, but this is definitely a 
           REAL COUPLE, not actors. 

                                 PAUL
                        Going to bars and being set up on 
                        blind dates never worked, but I 
                        always knew there was somebody out 
                        there for me. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I had tried dating services and 
                        dating sites, but they never seemed 
                        to get it right. I was starting to 
                        wonder if I was the problem. 

                                 PAUL
                        Then a friend told me about Good 
                        Looking. It sounded too good to be 
                        true, but I figured what did I have 
                        to lose? Of course I wanted to know 
                        who my soulmate was. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Later on, we realized that we had 
                        both gone to Good Looking on the 
                        same day. 

                                 PAUL
                        We were looking for each other. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And we never would have known it 
                        without Good Looking. 

                                         CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE SPACE

           The kind of borderless white room that is seemingly intrinsic 
           to all dating commercials.

           In the middle of the room, well-dressed and confident, is 
           THEODORE KENT. Theodore is a Steve Jobs type - an innovator 
           who is certain that his technology is revolutionary. 

                                 THEODORE
                        Hello. I'm Theodore Kent, and I'm 
                        the founder of Good Looking. 
                      (beat)
                        I started Good Looking in order to 
                        solve a question that people have 
                        been asking since the beginning of 
                        time. Who am I supposed to be with? 
                        Who is my soulmate? 

           Theodore's voice-over continues over a MONTAGE of HAPPY 
           COUPLES, covering the spectrum of races and religions: 
           couples chasing each other on the beach at sundown, slow-
           dancing on terraces with sweeping city views, and sitting at 
           home in the kitchen, sharing a bottle of wine. 

                                 THEODORE (CONT'D)
                        With over eight billion people in 
                        the world, it has always been 
                        impossible to know who your true 
                        soulmate is - until now. 

           Another montage: COUPLES kissing in slow-motion while the 
           DATE THEY GOT MARRIED flashes on the screen (i.e. JOHN + 
           MICHELLE, MARRIED JUNE 18th). 

           Some of the couples are combinations we wouldn't naturally 
           expect - a South American GAUCHO with a bleach-blond 
           CALIFORNIA GIRL, for instance. 

                                 THEODORE (CONT'D)
                        Decades in development, Good 
                        Looking has come up with a formula 
                        that guarantees we will match you 
                        to your soulmate. 

           The screen shows a clip of an ASIAN WOMAN at the airport 
           holding a sign that says AMEET. An INDIAN MAN nervously 
           emerges from the terminal, looks at the sign, looks at the 
           Asian woman, and EMBRACES her hugely.

                        somebody for everyone.™ 

           [Note: Whenever there is a trademarked Good Looking tagline, 
           a small 'TM' should pop up in the corner of the screen.]

                                         SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. JAMAICA PLAIN, BOSTON - A HALF-BEAT IN THE FUTURE

           This is Jamaica Plain, Boston, which is a trendy part of 
           Boston filled with young professional-ish apartments in three-
           decker apartment buildings.

           In this story, Boston is pretty much exactly the same as it 
           is now - with some differences that let us know we're a FEW 
           YEARS IN THE FUTURE. 

           For instance, the CARS all look advanced compared to modern 
           vehicles - more hybrids - and cell phones are different, 
           built straight into Bluetooth-esque devices. That sort of 
           shit.  

                                 EMMA (O.C.)
                        When you rolled over on me last 
                        night, I had a dream that I was 
                        being suffocated by David Bowie. 

                                 WILL (O.C.)
                        Compared to a lot of vegetarians, 
                        I'm not that thin.  

           And in one of the apartments in this neighborhood, OUR HERO 
           and his FIANCE are starting their day.

                                 EMMA (O.C.)
                        I feel like your whole body is 
                        turning into one, big elbow. 

           INT. WILL AND EMMA'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           Meet WILL HARWICH (early 30s), a fit man whose interests are 
           highbrow - you could talk to him about Cy Twombly's graffiti  
           paintings, but you wouldn't take him kickboxing.

           Will is standing in the bedroom putting on a TIE, and through 
           the open bedroom door he can see... 

           EMMA SMITHSON (early 30s) in front of the television, wearing 
           TIGHTS, bouncing on one of those HUGE INFLATABLE BALLS that 
           somehow help people exercise. 

                                 EMMA
                        It's like sleeping with a hairy 
                        Karen Carpenter.

                                 WILL
                        Karen Carpenter actually was hairy 
                        at the end of her life. Anorexics 
                        grow fuzz so their bodies stay 
                        warm. 

                                 EMMA
                        I feel like I need body hair to 
                        keep me warm in bed. What time were 
                        you up until last night? 

                                 WILL 
                        Three.

                        You should just get it over with 
                        and become a vampire. I love a man 
                        in velvet.  

                                 WILL
                        I'm not sure I could deal with the 
                        blood. 

                                 EMMA
                        You wimp. It's only a couple of 
                        little neck-holes.

           Another Good Looking commercial comes on the air. 

                                 WILL
                        Has anyone you known done that?

                        Everybody I know has done Good 
                        Looking. Julie is living in 
                        Zimbabwe with a freedom fighter. 
                      (beat)
                        Without the service, she would have 
                        never known he was the guy for her. 

                                 WILL
                        I hear it's expensive. 

                                 EMMA
                        I think people are chalking it up 
                        to a one-time investment. 

                                 WILL
                        Then I'm glad we get to save the 
                        money. 

                                 EMMA
                        Aw. You're sweet.
                      (beat)
                        I'm sorry we argued last night 
                        about the dance floor. I know you 
                        think hardwood would be classier. 

                                 WILL
                        But you want it to light up like 
                        Saturday Night Fever. 

                                 EMMA
                        I just want it to light up like 
                        Saturday Night Fever.

                                 WILL
                        Then it will. It's your wedding.  

                                 EMMA
                        Our wedding. 

           Will clips an old-school CASSETTE TAPE PLAYER to his belt and  
           searches a rack of classical CASSETTES - Mozart, Brahams, 
           Schupert - until he finds the one he wants. Caprice No. 24 by 
           the great Italian violinist PAGANINI. 

           The tape player is super out of place in this hyper-modern 
           age. 

           Emma KISSES Will again. We see that she is wearing an 
           ENGAGEMENT RING.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER

           SWEEPING VIOLIN MUSIC plays in Will's headphones as he walks 
           to the FOREST HILLS SUBWAY STATION. 

                                 HAPPY WOMAN (V.O.)
                        Faster! Mush! 

           Out of the corner of his eye, Will sees a HAPPY WOMAN 
           piggybacking on a THICKLY BUILT MAN wearing a business suit, 
           who is running down the street with a huge GRIN on his face.

           The Happy Woman blows a KISS at a CAMERA mounted on a LAMP 
           POST. 

           In this modern world, SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted

                        Best decision I ever made! 

           The Happy Woman and her new man disappear around a corner. 
           Will continues to walk.  

           In front of the entrance to the subway station, a DOZEN 
           COUPLES are saying goodbye to each other, KISSING and 
           EMBRACING and whispering DIRTY THINGS. 

           All people who have found TRUE LOVE.  

           Will hears the sound of the train. 

                                 WILL

           Will PUSHES through the lovers to make sure he gets on. Many 
           people miss the train because they are making out. They don't 
           care. 

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           All over the place in the train, there are COUPLES HOOKING 
           UP. 

           Will looks at a long LCD SCREEN above the windows. It 
           contains an image of a gray-haired couple on a beach at 
           sunset: 

           MAKE YOUR GOLDEN YEARS PLATINUM WITH GOOD LOOKING!   

           EXT. DOWNTOWN CROSSING - CONTINUOUS

           The epicenter of Boston. Will stops at a coffee stand where a 
           COFFEE GUY is working. 

           In the background, there is a LONG LINE of people outside 
           CITY HALL. Women in WEDDING DRESSES and men in RENTED 
           TUXEDOES. 

           It's like everybody in the world is getting married, all at 
           once. 

                                 WILL
                      (ordering coffee)
                        ...No sugar and a bit of cream, 
                        please. 

           A red-eyed BRIDE-TO-BE approaches the coffee stand. 

                                 BRIDE-TO-BE
                      (to coffee guy)
                        Do you have any napkins? I can't 
                        stop crying because I'm just so 
                        happy! 

           Will waits impatiently as the coffee guy hands the bride-to-
           be some napkins. The bride scurries away, dabbing her eyes. 

                                 COFFEE GUY
                        Happens all the time. 

           Will takes his coffee into a plain-looking building, and his 
           workday begins.

FOSTER'S AND ASSOCIATES - MOMENTS LATER

           Foster's and Associates is a mid-sized private equity firm, 
           like a thousand other companies that push money around. 

           The analysts - of which Will is one - work in glorified 
           cubicles. These are desks out in open space that don't have 
           actual walls, but still... they're cubicles. 

           Will takes a seat at his desk, where his neighbor HENRY (30s) 
           is looking at a TOPLESS GIRL on his WAFER-THIN COMPUTER.  

           Henry is an alpha male - husky but handsome. He gets laid a 
           lot by trashy girls. He is eating a MANGO. 

                                 HENRY
                        God I love mango. 
                      (re: topless girl)
                        Tits, man. If they were anywhere 
                        else on a woman's body... I mean, 
                        shit. Shoulder-tits? Ass-tits? 
                        Wouldn't be comfortable for 
                        anybody. Crap I love women. Women 
                        and mango.

                        -Were we speaking of women?

                                 HENRY 
                        You should see tonight's special 
                        lady.  

                                 WILL
                        I'm going to set a ground rule that 
                        I get to finish my coffee before 
                        you start talking about women.   

                                 HENRY
                        Fine. Have your coffee. Slurp it 
                        up.  

           Will sips his coffee. He stares at photograph of the CROATIAN 
           COAST attached to his computer, which he clearly tore out of 
           a magazine.  

           Beneath the picture of the coast is a picture of a VIOLIN in 
           a GLASS CASE.

           Will picks up his phone and dials. It rings on the other end. 

           INT. WILL AND EMMA'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           Emma is putting on an OFFICER UNIFORM. She is a COP. INTERCUT 
           Emma and Will as they talk. 

                                 EMMA
                        It still shocks me that you don't 
                        have a phone. How is that even

                        I'll get the boutonnieres. 

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, and I hate to do this to you, 
                        but I need you to pick up my 
                        grandmother's ring pillow from the 
                        upholsterer. You NEED TO DO IT, 
                        because she's going away. 

                                 WILL

                        You also need to research wedding 
                        bands. Make sure they're upbeat 
                        because I hate ballads. I want to 
                        dance.

                        So you want free-standing roman 
                        columns like they have on the

                        I'll come up with something. Maybe 
                        I'll sacrifice a virgin to the 
                        wedding Gods on top of one or 
                        something.

                        a mango pretty much is a breast.   

           EXT. TRAVEL AGENCY - AFTERNOON

           Will stands in front of a travel agency whose window display 
           is promoting trips to exotic places: SEE THE BEACH IN MALTA! 
           WITNESS THE WONDER OF BRAZIL'S IGUASSU FALLS! 

           Through the window, he sees several LAUGHING COUPLES sitting 
           with their TRAVEL AGENTS, planning trips. 

           INT. UPHOLSTERER - LATER 

           Will picks up Emma's grandmother's RING PILLOW from an 
           athletic-looking female UPHOLSTERER. The Upholsterer is 
           wearing KHAKI SAFARI CLOTHING.

                        That'll be... two thousand dollars.

                        I gave her a discount because I 
                        love weddings.

           In the near future, INFLATION has kicked in, in a big way.  

           EXT. ARNOLD ARBORETUM - LATER

           Will takes a walk home through Arnold Arboretum in Jamaica 
           Plain, holding the ring pillow.  

           All over the place, WOMEN in WEDDING DRESSES are having 
           twilight PHOTOGRAPHS taken with their NEW HUSBANDS. 

           A young FEMALE DJ wearing a neon tanktop runs up to Will with 
           her NEW BOYFRIEND - an older TWEEDY ACADEMIC. 

                                 FEMALE DJ
                        We just got engaged!

           Will puts down the pillow. The Tweedy Academic hands him an 
           advanced-looking CAMERA, which looks almost like a pencil-
           sized WAND.

           Will clicks a BUTTON marked OLFACTORY and snaps the PHOTO...

           INT. WILL AND EMMA'S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Will nervously enters the apartment holding a half dozen 
           BOUTONNIERES, as ordered. He tries to play things off like 
           everything is fine.  

           Emma walks into the room with her NIGHTSTICK.

                        I cracked it today breaking up a 
                        protest, and I need new one. But I 
                        thought I could keep this one 
                        around the house in case you get

                        I'm giving you the Saturday Night

                        No way. I'd have your groomsmen 
                        wearing atomic bombs if I could.

                        Fine. How about we drape your 
                        groomsmen in cloaking devices so 
                        that nobody sees them? When they 
                        give you the ring, it'll just be 
                        floating in the air above the 
                        altar, and we'll blow the minds of 
                        everybody in the vineyard.

           INT. WILL AND EMMA'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - LATER 

           In a half-bedroom that is essentially just a glorified nook, 
           Will is standing in front of a WORK BENCH. 

           On the work bench are various intricate-looking TOOLS and 
           pieces of WOOD, along with cans of VARNISH and a selection of 
           STRINGS. A shelf filled with books on STRADIVARI hangs above 
           the bench. 

           Will is finishing up ASSEMBLING A VIOLIN. He slides a TUNING 
           KNOB into place. Done. He picks up a bow.

           [Note: Will is not a good violinist. He took lessons when he 
           was a kid and knows what they should sound like, but he isn't 
           proficient. This isn't Sweet and Lowdown. Our actor will not 
           have to learn an instrument.]

           Will presses play on a STEREO - a tape of a STRADIVARIUS 
           being played sounds. He shuts it off. 

           He bows his violin. It sounds fine, but it isn't the same as 
           the Stradivarius. 

                                 WILL
                        Damn.  

           He picks up the bow to try again, but then loud music - i.e. 
           Pink Floyd's "Run Like Hell" - blasts from the other room, 
           drowning him out.

                        It was... stolen. 

                                 EMMA
                        How was it stolen? 

                                 WILL
                        I put it down on the ground to take 
                        a picture of a professor and a DJ.

                        Down on the ground? I just had it

                                 WILL
                        It was a couple. I think they were 
                        bonding over their love of 
                        stealing. 

                                 EMMA
                        You didn't even run after them.

                        Oh God. Ok. Maybe the upholsterer 
                        remembers the pattern and she can 
                        make me a new pillow so my family 
                        doesn't realize what happened.

                        No. Wait. The upholster is going 
                        out of town to Africa for six 
                        months. She was squeezing me in 
                        before she left tonight. Oh God.  
                        What are we going to do? 

                                 WILL

                        Maybe we should go to Africa. 

           Uh-oh. 

                                 EMMA
                        Did you say maybe we should go to 
                        Africa? That's your solution?

                        I just... I was walking by a travel 
                        agency tonight. 

                                 EMMA
                        Because you were planning our 
                        honeymoon? Were you flying in a 
                        calypso band for the reception?  

           Will says nothing. 

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        You lost my pillow and you forgot 
                        to research upbeat wedding bands. 
                        I'm going to kill you.

                        I was there... and just... thinking 
                        about the whole three months to the 
                        wedding thing, and I've been 
                        wondering if maybe we needed a few 
                        more adventures-

                        I mean, do you feel like you've 
                        experienced enough to know that 
                        this is where we should be? Maybe 
                        we should be trying new things.   

           Emma stares at Will. She doesn't seem to agree. 

                                 EMMA
                        I don't know Will. While we're in 
                        Africa, maybe I can think about it 
                        while the cheetahs help me feed our 
                        new babies bushmeat and you're out

                        I'm thirty-one years old. I've had 
                        plenty of adventures with all sorts 
                        of adventurous adventurers. But 
                        now, I want to get married and I 
                        want to start a family, and I hope 
                        that's what you want too. 

           Will pauses. He shouldn't have paused.

                        That pause wasn't meant to indicate-

           Emma grabs the NIGHTSTICK and ADVANCES, holding it above her

           Will picks up a PAYPHONE. A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA records him 
           making the call. 

                                 PAYPHONE

                        six... dollars.  

           Will scans a combination ID CARD/DEBIT CARD over the phone 
           and dials a number. It rings on the other end. Henry picks 
           up. 

           Will hears Henry cracking up and the sound of a WOMAN 
           GIGGLING.

                        And what do you call that move? 
                        Come on, you're not a teenager

                                 WILL
                        Emma kicked me out, and I was 
                        wondering if I could stay with you 
                        tonight.

                        He's aging poorly. He should

                        this girl gets weird on you.

           INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - LATER

           Will knocks on the door. Henry opens it looking like he is 
           having the BEST TIME OF HIS LIFE. 

                                 HENRY
                        You are about to see a great 
                        victory by a great man. 

                                 GIRL (O.C.)
                        That's not fair! 

           Henry walks into the apartment, and sees the GIRL that he has 
           been hearing in the background. Her name is AMINA (30). She 
           is a phenomenal looking MOROCCAN WOMAN.  

                                 AMINA
                        I'm out of practice.  

           She is sitting in front of a CHESS BOARD that only has a few 
           pieces remaining. What Will thought was debauchery was just 
           the sound of Will and Amina having the time of their lives 
           while PLAYING CHESS.

                        Hello.

                        -Was Morocco Junior Champion! 

                                 AMINA
                        I came in ninth place. 

                                 HENRY
                        And I, lowly president of the 
                        Cornell Chess Club, am on the verge 
                        of ruining everything she ever 
                        loved. 

                                 WILL
                      (to Henry)
                        You play chess? 

                                 HENRY
                        Every Sunday afternoon. 

                                 AMINA
                        He switched a knight and a rook 
                        while I was in the bathroom. 

                                 HENRY
                      (winking at Will)
                        These crimes of which I'm accused!  

           Will is confused. He has never seen Henry get along with a 
           woman, never mind a woman like this. 

           The remnants of a nice DINNER lay on the dining room table. 

           A bottle of nice WINE sits on the windowsill, where Henry and 
           Amina had obviously been sitting. 

           A collection of ASIAN BIRD PRINTS - cranes, loons, etc. - is 
           spread out on the coffee table, like Henry had been showing 
           them off. 

                                 WILL
                        What's with the Asian bird prints?

                                 HENRY
                        You didn't know I collected Asian 
                        bird prints? Have been for years. 
                        You don't come over here much.  

           Will is thunderstruck.

                      (moving rook into place)
                        And that... is checkmate! 

                                 AMINA
                        I demand an investigation! 

                                 HENRY
                        The FIDE rejects your appeal! 

                                 AMINA
                        The FIDE lost credibility with the 
                        Kasparov-Short scandal in 1993! I 
                        don't recognize them! 

           Henry and Amina CRUMBLE INTO LAUGHTER at this inside joke. 

           [The FIDE is chess's governing body, but Will has no idea 
           what the hell they are talking about, which is fine.] 

                                 HENRY 
                        Amina laid out a blanket and pillow 
                        for you on the couch. I asked her 
                        to call her sister to keep you 
                        warm, but she wouldn't do it. I 
                        said her brother would also be 
                        fine. 

                                 AMINA
                        I'm sorry you had a tough night. 
                        Things will get better. 

                                 HENRY
                        Look at that. Comforting. Bad at 
                        chess. From the jungle. 

                                 AMINA
                        Morocco is mostly desert. 

                                 HENRY
                        The perfect woman. 

           Henry walks not-so-inconspicuously into the BEDROOM.

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        I'm sorry I can't sit with you 
                        longer. I need to walk over here to 
                        my bedroom. I have to feed my 
                        cockatoo.  

                                 AMINA
                        You have a cockatoo? 

                                 HENRY
                        I have bird art, don't I? Of course 
                        I have a goddamn cockatoo. 

           Will watches Amina stand. She is smart and funny. She is 
           exotic and beautiful. What the hell is she doing with Henry?

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        Will, if you need anything to eat 
                        or drink, help yourself. Tea, 
                        bleach, Drano, whatever. 

                                 AMINA
                        Nice meeting you. 

                                 WILL
                        Nice meeting you too, Amina. 

           Amina disappears behind Henry's bedroom door. Will lies down 
           on the couch, wondering what he just witnessed. And then... 

                                 AMINA (O.C.)
                        That's not a cockatoo! 

                                 HENRY (O.C.)
                      (just whipped it out)
                        That is the finest cockatoo in the 
                        word. 

           Amina howls with laughter. Will tries to sleep.

           INT. FOSTER'S AND ASSOCIATES - THE NEXT MORNING

           Henry sits with his forehead on his desk, in the same clothes 
           as he was the night before.   

           He stands up and gets some coffee. Looking out the window, he 
           sees HENRY AND Amina walking towards the office building, 
           HOLDING HANDS.

           They blend in with all the other HAND-HOLDING COUPLES around, 
           some of whom are pushing advanced-looking BABY CARRIAGES with 
           built-in screens playing CHILDREN'S ENTERTAINMENT. 

           MOMENTS LATER - Henry BURSTS into the office, full of life 
           and energy.

                                 HENRY
                        Good morning good morning! 

           Henry SIDESTEPS his way over to his desk, Fred Astaire-style. 

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        Does the office smell like pine 
                        trees to anybody else? It's like if 
                        you had a pine tree whose bark was 
                        made of cinnamon.  

           Henry sees the bags under Will's eyes. 

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        Whoa, raccoon boy. Apologies if 
                        Amina and I kept you up last night. 
                        We were creating a master race of 
                        humans made of pure love. 

           Will goes back to his computer. 

           EXT. FANEUIL HALL - EARLY AFTERNOON

           It's lunchtime, and the hordes are filing out of their 
           buildings to find something to eat. 

           Will wanders down the street eating a CREPE, his mind 
           somewhere else.  

           And then, he sees Henry sitting alone at a CAFE, scribbling 
           something. There is no food or drink in front of Henry. 

                                 WILL
                        Not eating? 

                                 HENRY
                        I'm stuffed. With breastmilk. 

                                 WILL
                        I'm pretty sure Amina isn't 
                        lactating.

                                 HENRY
                        Fine. But I had them in my mouth a 
                        lot. 

                                 WILL 
                        What are you doing? 

                                 HENRY
                      (proud)
                        Writing a letter to her. 

                                 WILL
                        You've never written a letter in 
                        your life. 

                                 HENRY
                        I am now. I'm not sure the lunch 
                        break is going to be long enough. 

           Henry goes back to writing. 

                                 WILL
                        Henry, can I ask you a question? 

                                 HENRY
                        Of course. 

                                 WILL
                        Where the fuck did you find her? 

                                 HENRY
                        What, Amina? 

                                 WILL
                        No offense, we've known each other 
                        a long time, but you're by far my 
                        most sleazy friend. You've never 
                        had relationship last longer than a 
                        month, you read books on picking up 
                        women, you've had the clap three 
                        times. 

                                 HENRY
                        Twice. That last one was something 
                        else. 

                                 WILL
                        So where did you find a beautiful, 
                        intelligent Moroccan girl who seems 
                        to adore you? 

           Henry looks at Will like he's an idiot.

                        But you've never wanted to settle

                        I thought I would give it a shot to 
                        find out what "soulmate sex" was 
                        like and then move on to the next

                        some reason.

                        I'm not going to call.

                        and not be able to spend it with 
                        the person you're supposed to be

                        I'm just saying. It might be worth 
                        a call. 

           INT. WILL AND EMMA'S APARTMENT - LATER 

           Will walks through the door and sees on the couch, watching 
           RED HEAT staring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jim Belushi.  

           It is the opening scene, where Schwarzenegger fights a group 
           of bearded Russians in a unisex foundry steam bath.

           Will sits at his work bench staring at his imperfect violins, 
           finishing his container of Thai Food.

           with a varnish. In the other room, he can hear

                        want to make him talk! 

           Will can't concentrate. He grabs his coat and exits the small 
           room, heading for the front door. 

                                 EMMA

           He looks at the (slightly advanced-looking) cars driving past 
           - it seems like virtually every car has JUST MARRIED or some 
           variation thereof SOAPED onto the back window.  

           He sits down on a BENCH. A couple sits down next to him and 
           are immediately ALL OVER EACH OTHER. He gets up and walks 
           away. 

           Finally, he sees a SOLITARY MAN walking ALONE down the 
           street. Will nods at him.

                                 SOLITARY MAN
                      (gruff)
                        I got divorced today. My wife went 
                        to Good Looking. 

                                 WILL
                        I'm sorry. 

                                 SOLITARY MAN
                        All of these couples getting 
                        together means a lot of couples are 
                        falling apart. People gotta come 
                        from somewhere. 

                                 WILL
                        I'm sure it will be okay. Keep your 
                        head up. 

                                 SOLITARY MAN
                        Nah, I'm looking at the ground 
                        because I dropped the number for 
                        Good Looking, and I want to make an 
                        appointment.

                        Oh. 

                                 SOLITARY MAN
                        Me and my wife were never right for 
                        each other anyway. I hope they give 
                        me somebody prettier. 

                                 WILL

           Will continues on his way. Halfway down the block, he sees 
           something stuck in a SIDEWALK CRACK. He picks it up. It is 
           printed with this:

           It's the card the solitary man was looking for.

                        Mmm... Ooo... 

           Will looks over at a COUPLE that are hot and heavy on the 
           HOOD OF A CAR. 

           INSIDE the car, a hand SLAPS the window - not only is there a 
           couple making out on the hood of the car, there is a couple 
           getting it on in the BACK SEAT.  

           The world has gone MAD WITH LOVE. 

           Will stares at the card, thinking. 

           EXT. PAYPHONE - MOMENTS LATER

           Will exhales, and DIALS the number on the card. It rings.

                        I just had too much caffeine.

                        up? 

           Emma shoves the criminal into the cell with her FOOT. 

                                 EMMA
                        It wouldn't be ladylike for me to 
                        suggest such things. But I'm 
                        thinking we could maybe work off 
                        some of this recent weirdness.

                        Ooo, tough to do.  

                                 WILL
                        I... decided not to come in. 

                                 VOICE
                        And why is that? 

                                 WILL
                        It's not for me.

                        Come on. Your fiance won't be home 
                        for another couple of hours.  

                                 WILL
                        How do you know I have a fiance? 

                                 VOICE
                        A lot of people we deal with have 
                        fiances. 

                                 WILL
                        That's disheartening. 

                                 VOICE
                        Not really. Sometimes they come in 
                        for the peace of mind that they're 
                        with the right person.  

           Will thinks about this. 

                                 WILL 
                        How long does it take? The 
                        appointment, I mean. 

                                 VOICE
                        No time at all. There's a line 
                        outside, but I'll take you in. 

                                 WILL
                        How do you know what I look like? 

                                 VOICE
                        We know everything about you.

NEWBURY STREET - NIGHT

           Will stands in front of Urban Outfitters. There are signs in 
           the window for various items for sale in the store (i.e. 
           LEVI'S STOVEPIPE JEANS - NOW ONLY $2600!)

           Across the street is a smart looking building with an awning 
           marked GOOD LOOKING. 

           There is a LINE AROUND THE BLOCK with people waiting to get 
           in, and looking through the window, it's clear the inside of 
           the office is PACKED. 

                                 WILL
                        You've got to be kidding me. 

           Will gets in the back of the LINE, where he stands behind a 
           man on CRUTCHES, wearing an AIR CAST on his LEG. 

                                 WILL (CONT'D)
                        What happened to you? 

                                 INJURED MAN
                        Girlfriend broke my leg. Need a 
                        better one.  

           Will nods. Makes sense that this guy would be in line.

           All of a sudden, a NERDY-LOOKING MAN approaches Will in the 
           line. 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Um. Will Harwich? 

                                 WILL
                        Yes? 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I'm Benjamin. We talked on the 
                        phone.

           INT. GOOD LOOKING - MOMENTS LATER

           The lobby of the Good Looking offices is crowded - every seat 
           is occupied by NERVOUS INDIVIDUALS, some of whom are taking 
           off their WEDDING RINGS. 

           A service window in the lobby is marked with a sign that says 
           GOOD LOOKING BUYS RINGS! CASH FOR GOLD!

           A TRASHY YOUNG WOMAN slides her cheap-looking wedding band to 
           the RING BUYER, who weighs it and hands her back some CASH.

                      (re: ring selling)
                        That's a depressing sight. 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        It never takes long for people to 
                        get new ones. Right this way. 

           Benjamin leads Will through a DOOR into the BACK ROOMS of 
           Good Looking. He stops in front of an OFFICE. 

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                        Have a seat. 

           Will steps inside the office and Benjamin shuts the door 
           behind him. 

           INT. GOOD LOOKING - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           As soon as the door clicks shut, Will sees that he and 
           Benjamin are NOT ALONE. Behind the desk is a gray-haired man 
           whose confident face Will has seen before...

                                 THEODORE
                        I was in town to inspect the 
                        office, and I was walking past 
                        Benjamin when I heard him talking 
                        to you. I don't get much face time 
                        with clients any more - an 
                        unfortunate by-product of our 
                        success - but I thought perhaps I 
                        could allay some of the doubts you 
                        seem to be having. 

                                 WILL
                        I'm not having 'doubts,' I just 
                        don't think I want to do it.

                                 THEODORE
                        And why is that? 

                                 WILL
                        I think it might be a scam, and 
                        you're ruining a lot of lives. 

                                 THEODORE
                        We have a 100% success rate with 
                        putting people together. 

                                 WILL
                        But how many divorces have there 
                        been because you said a husband or 
                        wife was supposed to be with 
                        somebody else? 

                                 THEODORE
                        We've improved many more lives than 
                        we've ruined, and we offer a Half-
                        Price Spouse Special™ to clients 
                        whose husbands or wives have left 
                        them after visiting Good Looking. 

                                 WILL
                        Generous. 

                                 THEODORE 
                        And there is always a reason those 
                        spouses came to us in the first 
                        place. Like you did. 

           Will says nothing.

                        I understand. You don't know how my 
                        company works, and if you don't 
                        want to do it, that's completely 
                        fine. We have enough customers. 
                      (beat)
                        But before you go, I'd like to do 
                        something different: I'd like to 
                        give you a tour of our facilities, 
                        which I think might answer some of 
                        your questions. 

                                 BENJAMIN
                      (concerned)
                        Dr. Kent... 

                                 THEODORE
                        It's fine, Benjamin. We know that 
                        Mr. Harwich is able to keep 
                        secrets.  
                      (wink)
                        Unless it's lying to work about 
                        being sick, which you did eleven 
                        times last year, if I'm not 
                        mistaken.
                      (smiles)
                        Come on. Let me show you around 
                        downstairs. 

                                 WILL
                      (wary)
                        Alright. 

           INT. GOOD LOOKING - CONTINUOUS

           ELEVATOR DOORS open up into the NERVE CENTER of GOOD LOOKING.   

           The operation consists of SEVERAL ROOMS, each of which is 
           stuffed with DOZENS OF TELEVISION MONITORS. The televisions 
           are all picking up CAMERA FEEDS from ALL OVER THE WORLD: 

           A FRENCH WOMAN dining alone in the LEFT BANK OF PARIS... A 
           GELATO STORE EMPLOYEE zoning out in Little Italy in New York 
           City... A sexy JAPANESE GIRL wearing a modified HAUTE COUTURE 
           dress as a fashion statement in Tokyo's HARAJUKA DISTRICT. 

           TECH GEEKS man workstations in front of the monitors. The 
           COMPUTERS in front of them are flashing PATTERNS OF 
           INFORMATION - think "The Matrix."

           Theodore begins his tour, leading Will and Benjamin to a BANK 
           OF MONITORS. 

                                 THEODORE 
                        I started Good Looking in London in 
                        the 1990s, when cameras were 
                        installed all over the city to 
                        deter crime. Benjamin, pull up 
                        London please. 

           Benjamin taps a few keys and starts FLICKING through 
           different cameras, showing different city scenes in London - 
           HUSTLERS in Soho, a COUPLE on a stroll in Kensington Gardens, 
           DINERS in Notting Hill. 

                                 THEODORE (CONT'D)
                        London's CCTV cameras ran on a 
                        series of individual networks that 
                        I tapped. It seems almost quaint 
                        compared to today's world, but if 
                        you lived in London at the turn of 
                        the century, you were captured on 
                        camera more than 400 times a day.  

           Various SURVEILLANCE IMAGES flash on the screen as Theodore 
           rattles off samples of what CCTV is recording.

                                 THEODORE (CONT'D)
                        Where you went.

                        sites is that people lie about who 
                        they are, or only show what they

                        I was Good Looking's first

           A cluster of SATELLITES marked GOOD LOOKING float through the 
           heavens.  

           We see what one of the satellites is looking at - a beautiful 
           MONGOLIAN WOMAN traveling on horseback through the ZAVKAHN 
           REGION of the country. One of the most isolated places in the 
           world. 

           Back on Earth, we see that a Good Looking computer is 
           transcribing everything she is doing, for future reference. A 
           bored Good Looking employee looks at the readout: 

                    2:30:01: Riding Tuwinian Horse. 
                    2:31:07: Eating dried boar
                    2:24:14: Stopping to use restroom - third time today

           Each of the satellites is effortlessly monitoring millions of 
           such individuals at a time. 

           After all, in the near future, computer power is nearly 
           limitless.

           Will can't argue with that. He takes out his WALLET and hands 
           a CARD to Benjamin, who shuffles away. 

           Theodore sits there smiling blankly at Will. 

                                 WILL
                      (making smalltalk)
                        Nice neighborhood. 

                                 THEODORE
                        Great vegetarian. 

                                 WILL
                        I'm a vege-

                                 THEODORE
                        I know. 

           Benjamin returns, and hands back Will's card. 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Money went through with no problem. 

           Benjamin takes a POST-IT out of his pocket and gives it a 
           quick glance. 

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                      (nonchalantly)
                        Let's see here... It looks like the 
                        woman you're supposed to be with 
                        is... do do do... 
                      (beat)
                        ...Sophie Miller.

           And with that, Will's world is ROCKED. 

           He is supposed to be with a woman other than his fiance.   

           Benjamin hands him the POST-IT. 

                                 WILL
                        That's it? No file, no picture, no 
                        nothing? 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I wrote her address at the bottom. 
                        She's local. 

                                 WILL
                        Does she know I'm coming?

                        Of course not. You're the one who 
                        paid for the service, not her. 
                        Don't worry. You'll click. People 
                        always do. 

                                 WILL
                        You don't even provide an 
                        introduction?

                        If you can't get up the nerve to 
                        introduce yourself to the person 
                        you know you're supposed to be 
                        with, then you shouldn't be with 
                        anybody. 

           This is too much for Will to take. He is angry. He SHOVES the 
           post-it in his wallet. 

                                 WILL
                        Great scam you have here, 
                        gentlemen. Thank you for wasting my 
                        time. 

           Theodore and Benjamin don't react. They've seen such 
           outbursts before. 

                                 THEODORE
                        Sophie Miller is the one.  

                                 WILL 
                        You're wrong. I'm supposed to be 
                        with Emma. 

           Will storms out of the room. On the way out, Will passes the 
           CONFERENCE ROOM, where two GOOD LOOKING EMPLOYEES are handing 
           a NEW CUSTOMER the same kind of POST-IT that Will received. 

           The new customer reads the NAME on the post-it.

                        In the porn you like, it's never 
                        just a girl. You always need four, 
                        five dicks around. Why do you think 
                        that is?

           EXT. WILL AND EMMA'S APARTMENT - LATER 

           Will pays a CABBIE and walks to his front door, holding a 
           BAG. 

           He leans his head on the door - heavy with guilt - before he 
           goes inside. 

           INT. WILL AND EMMA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Will enters the apartment. Emma is on the couch, watching 
           OVER THE TOP starring Sylvester Stallone. 

           She looks great, in her pajamas, huddled under a blanket.

                        Is this the same boyfriend who 
                        somehow got us into the Museum of 
                        Fine Arts after hours so he could

                        quite a classy guy. 

                                 EMMA
                        Then it must be the boyfriend who 
                        came on a ride-along in my police 
                        car, and had a long discussion with 
                        a mugger about acoustic theory.

                        It sounds like your boyfriend has a 
                        natural empathy for the criminal 
                        class.

           Will is in his makeshift workshop, carefully GLUING the ribs 
           of a violin in place. It requires his full concentration, 
           which is being interrupted by the sound of Emma SNORING in 
           the other room.  

           Emma SNORTS abruptly, and then stops snoring. A moment later 
           she enters the workshop, bleary from sleep. She hangs herself 
           over his shoulders.

           out of the air and puts it in his shirt pocket.

                        It's remarkable how many deals 
                        you've been closing recently. 
                        You've never been more productive. 
                        How do you feel? 

           Sitting at his desk nearby, Will rolls his eyes. 

                                 HENRY
                        I feel like I could fuck a dragon, 
                        sir.   

                                 BOSS
                        Good good. Keep it up. 

           The boss walks away. Henry's phone RINGS.

                      (on phone)
                        Hello?... No, I love you. J'taime. 
                        I'm working on my Moroccan accent.
                      (beat)
                        No, you're my single serving of 
                        sugar. You say bye. Bye.

           Henry hangs up the phone. 

                                 WILL
                        You're going to kill me.

                        Slain by the sword of love. How did 
                        things go with Good Looking? 

                                 WILL
                        I never went. 

                                 HENRY
                        That's ridiculous. You've got the 
                        money. There's no reason-

                        -I'm not doing it!

                        Alright! Shit!

                        Well then, would you and Emma

                        Amina wants to meet some other 
                        couples, and it will give me a

                        fire looks like.

                        That's right, it isn't anymore. 
                        Thanks to a certain company.  

                                         SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. KOREAN BARBECUE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A busy Korean Barbecue place. COOKS work at a sizzling 
           griddle. SERVERS rush around with steaming plates.  

           Will and Emma sit across a table from Henry and Amina. 

           It is a tableau of a couple newly in love vs. a long term 
           couple: Henry and Amina have their legs pointed at each other 
           and are constantly touching, while Will and Emma are simply 
           sitting in their chairs, facing forward.

                        It was amazing. I was at the

                        Asian Cultural Center, when this 
                        amazing man walks up to me and 
                        starts talking to me about Hokusai 
                        Katsushika-

                        I'm sorry. I usually never talk 
                        about relationships, but it's hard 
                        not to. It's like Henry was built 
                        for me in a workshop.

                        How did he propose? 

           The question causes Emma's mood to change. This is a good

                        There's an inn near the beach in 
                        Penobscot, in Maine, that had been 
                        in my family for a hundred years. 
                        We had to sell it, but I used to go 
                        there when I was a little girl, and 
                        I used to love how remote it felt.

                        It was always like the rest of the 
                        world had exploded, and all that 
                        was left was this little inn, and 
                        me. And so Will-

                        He proposed to me on the porch.

                        That's amazing.

                        Unfortunately, I'm a novice when it 
                        comes to incredible relationships.

                        I'll make you a veteran. 

                                 AMINA
                        Can I get a long term contract?

           Amina and Henry kiss again, for a long time. Will and Emma

           INT. WILL AND EMMA'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

           A scene that is nearly identical to one we saw earlier in the 
           script: Will is standing in the bedroom putting on his tie, 
           while Emma is in the living room bouncing up and down on her 
           huge exercise ball. 

           Emma is watching DAYS OF THUNDER on television. TOM CRUISE is 
           in the middle of the climactic FINAL RACE. 

                                 TOM CRUISE
                      (intense)
                        I'm going to draft Wheeler! Make 
                        him pull me around!

                        Punch it Tom! 

           Cruise PUNCHES it and his race car ZOOMS. Emma switches to 
           push-ups, her eyes still on the screen. 

                                 WILL
                        Days of Thunder. This is one of

                        No. If I was on a desert island, I 
                        would bring Cast Away. It's the 
                        only thing that would make sense, 
                        because Hanks has already figured

                        That's true. The existence of Cast 
                        Away renders moot the desert island 
                        movie discussion.

                                 EMMA
                        Actually, I do. Remember what I was 
                        saying about the centerpieces for 
                        the tables?

                        You wanted them to be filled with 
                        seaglass. 

                                 EMMA
                        But I don't know what color sea 
                        glass. 

           Will realizes what Emma is suggesting. 

                                 WILL

           EXT. CARSON BEACH - AFTERNOON

           A hidden treasure in South Boston, completely deserted at the 
           moment. Will walks along the shore staring at the SAND. 

           He spots a piece of RED SEAGLASS tangled in some seaweed. He 
           reaches down to pick it up. It's beautiful. He holds it in 
           his hand, running his finger over it. 

           There is also a person with a METAL DETECTOR on the beach. 
           It's an awesome metal detector - all sleek lines and blipping 
           computer lights.  

           The Metal Detector-er is looking at the sand, the same as 
           Will. They are walking towards each other, but don't know it.

           Will and the Metal Detector-er nearly crash into each other, 
           but disaster is averted when the BOTTOM OF THE METAL DETECTOR 
           lightly taps Will's ANKLE. 

                                 WILL
                        Oh, I'm sorry- 

                                 METAL DETECTOR-ER
                        -No no, it's my fault! I didn't 
                        even see you! 

           The Metal Detector-er is a WOMAN, and when Will raises his 
           eyes to look at her, he is temporarily caught off guard.

                                 METAL DETECTOR-ER (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. I zone out pretty hard when 
                        I'm using my metal detector. 

           The woman looks like a flapper - short hair, easy grace, and 
           stunning.

                        I just found it.

                        You're lucky. Red is rare. 

                                 WILL 
                        Is it?  

                                 METAL DETECTOR-ER
                        Brown, white and green are the most 
                        common, and red and orange are the 
                        hardest to find. 

                                 WILL
                        I'm surprised there isn't more 
                        seaglass around. When I was a kid, 
                        this was the place to go.

                        Man, that means she's a freak in 
                        bed. I love it. 

                                 WILL
                        What could possibly be your

                        Have you ever seen a crystal? It's 
                        basically a cave dick. 

                                 WILL
                        I've never even thought about 
                        stones. I mean, maybe if I was

                        That's the point, though. Sophie's 
                        going to be interested in all this 
                        stuff that will complement all the 
                        shit you know, and you'll get 
                        interested in it too. 

                                 WILL
                        Is that what happened with you?

                        dressing like a sultan. I never

           EXT. THE STONE STORE - BROOKLINE - AFTERNOON

           The Stone Store is a little shop set back from the road in a 
           forgotten corner of Brookline. 

           As might be expected, there are a few FANCY ROCKS in the 
           front window, along with some RUNE NECKLACES. 

           Will stands across the street from the store, getting up his 
           nerve. Finally, he begins the walk to the front door. 

           INT. THE STONE STORE - CONTINUOUS

           The store is filled with more geology-oriented stuff. FOOL'S 
           GOLD, various FOSSILS of SKELETAL FISH and ancient 
           FOOTPRINTS, bricks of JADE, and so forth. 

           SOPHIE stands behind the counter, engrossed in a biography of 
           the Italian violinist PAGANINI. Which Will finds interesting. 

                                 WILL
                      (surprised)
                        Huh. 

           Will browses through some POSTERS - mostly TOPOGRAPHY MAPS 
           and ROCK CLASSIFICATION CHARTS. 

           He flips to the last poster, which doesn't fit with the 
           others - it is a COOL HAND LUKE promotional one-sheet. 

                                 WILL (CONT'D)
                        Does Paul Newman count as a rock? 

           Sophie looks up from her book and sees Will. She recognizes 
           him from the beach and smiles.

                      (beat)
                        I'm glad you came in.

                                 WILL
                        You promised me seaglass.

                        Behold. The nation's strategic 
                        seaglass reserve. 

           Sophie spreads her arms to a huge glass VASE that is chock-a-
           block FILLED with seaglass. It looks like a layer cake - all 
           the glass is organized by COLOR.

                        I'm almost reluctant to sell you 
                        any. I only finished filling the 
                        jar last week.

                        So if you found a piece of brown-

                                 SOPHIE
                        -I would pour out the entire jar to 
                        add it to the bottom level with the 
                        other pieces of brown. 

                                 WILL
                        And then you put them all back in, 
                        by color. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        I don't know if you noticed, but I 
                        own a stone store. I have the time.

                        No. But I will drink coffee and 
                        walk across the park with you. 

                                 WILL 
                      (huh)
                        Sure. Let's go. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        I wasn't talking about right now. 

                                 WILL
                        What were you thinking?

                        Saturday morning at 3:30? 

                                 WILL
                        In the morning? 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Sorry. Afternoon. I'm a night 
                        person, so I sleep late on the 
                        weekends, and sometimes 3:30 feels 
                        like the morning. 

                                 WILL
                        I'm a night person too. We'll have 
                        to do something late next time. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        I'm pretty sure we haven't even had 
                        a first time. 

                                 WILL
                      (smiles)
                        I'll meet you here Saturday. 

           Sophie waves goodbye and goes back to her book. Will exits. 

           EXT. THE STONE STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Will walks away from the store grinning like an idiot... and 
           then he remembers what he has done. A mixture of feeling 
           triumphant, and like complete shit.  

                                 WILL
                        Good Looking, I hope you know what 
                        you're doing.

           We're back in another COMMERCIAL like the one we saw in the 
           beginning of the story, with Theodore looking straight at us. 

                                 THEODORE
                        One of the things we hear all the 
                        time is, "Good Looking, I hope you 
                        know what you're doing." I can 
                        assure you that we do. But if 
                        you're one of those individuals who 
                        has doubts, well, I'd like you to 
                        listen to Damian and Mary's story.

           CAPTION: DAMIAN & MARY. WASHINGTON D.C. 

           Articulate black-clothing wearing Goth DAMIAN sits on a park 
           bench next to the pretty, pretty MARY, holding hands (in all 
           of these commercials, the couples must always be holding 
           hands). 

                                 DAMIAN
                        The first time I saw Mary, I 
                        honestly couldn't believe she was 
                        the woman I had been matched with. 
                        She seemed so different from me. 

                                 MARY
                      (southern accent)
                        I was the president of the Bible 
                        club at Boston College.  

                                 DAMIAN
                        And I was... not. When I saw Mary 
                        walking out of her Jesuit study 
                        group-

                                 MARY
                        -A great lecturer came in to talk 
                        about the Epistle to the Ephesians-

                                 DAMIAN
                        -I almost walked away, because I 
                        figured there was no way this was 
                        the right girl. But then I just 
                        said to myself, 'Good Looking, I 
                        hope you know what you're doing,' 
                        and I walked up to her.

                        There is an old saying that the

           As scheduled, Will waits outside the The Stone Store. He's 
           nervous about this.   

           And then... she appears. Holding two cups of coffee.

           Lars Anderson Park. Well-manicured fields that used to be 
           owned by the Ambassador to Japan, but are now public.  

           WEDDING PARTIES are everywhere - NEWLYWEDS posing for 
           pictures underneath trees, running through the long meadows, 
           being cheesy, etc. 

           Will is wearing a funky shoulder bag. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Are you wearing a big purse? 

                                 WILL
                        I was hoping it wasn't purse-ish. 

                                 SOPHIE 
                        What do you have in there? If 
                        there's a hand grenade or a ratchet 
                        set, it might be more masculine 
                        than I think. 

           Will opens the bag, revealing a six pack of SMIRNOFF ICE. The 
           bottles look like snazzy torpedoes.  

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Holy shit. You brought Smirnoff 
                        Ice. I didn't know they still made 
                        that. 

                                 WILL
                        I don't drink, but the woman behind 
                        the counter said it was lemony, and 
                        I like Sprite-

                                 SOPHIE
                        No. That's fine. I like Smirnoff 
                        Ice. I don't care what people say. 

                                 WILL
                        What do people say? 

                                 SOPHIE
                        They say... it's intense. 

                                 WILL
                      (not kidding)
                        I thought it seemed stronger than 
                        beer because of the vodka.

           LATER...

           Will and Sophie sit next to a JAPANESE GARDEN. Will reaches 
           into this bag and takes out the pieces of a PICNIC SET, which 
           he screws together to make a TABLE.

                        Whoa. Where did you get that? 

                                 WILL
                        I bought it from one of those 
                        SkyMall catalogues they have on 
                        airplanes.  

                                 SOPHIE
                        No way. Nobody has ever bought 
                        anything from SkyMall. 

           Will spreads his arms over the table - the proof is before 
           you. 

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        I used to think that they kept all 
                        the things in the SkyMall catalogue 
                        in the back of the plane.

           A scene of what Sophie used to think. 

           Sophie sits in her seat, holding the SkyMall catalogue up to 
           a FLIGHT ATTENDANT. She POINTS to something, and the 
           attendant walks into the rear cabin. 

                                 SOPHIE (V.O.)
                        Like, if you wanted a bigfoot 
                        garden sculpture, they would just 
                        have it right there.  

           The flight attendant struggles to drag a huge BIGFOOT 
           SCULPTURE out of the back of the plane. It must weigh 200 
           lbs.

                        So you thought that around 90% of 
                        the plane was devoted to SkyMall 
                        product storage. Pet beds, massage

           YOUNG WILL (9) stands in front of the MAP on the wall, 
           staring at the boldly labeled, strangely shaped state of 
           VIRGINIA. 

           He looks horrified. 

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        I couldn't believe someone would 
                        name a whole state after something 
                        like that. 

           Young Will looks at his TEACHER'S SKIRT, concerned about what 
           might be under there, and runs out of the room.

                        ...It certainly wouldn't be a 
                        puritanical thing for the Puritans 
                        to do.

                        Maybe they figured it was their 
                        country, so they could do what they 
                        wanted.

                        I think you and I have a strangely 
                        similar way of looking at things. 

                                 WILL
                        I guess that means you're not going 
                        to make a run for it. 

           Silence. 

                                 SOPHIE 
                        I prefer to travel rather than stay 
                        at home.

                        I stand outside of the same travel

                        I'm agnostic.

                        I hate cats. 

                                 WILL
                        So do I, but I only like big dogs.

                        Same here. I want a dog that can 
                        pull me out of the snow.

           Will looks at Sophie. She smiles, taking this as a 
           flirtatious remark, though it wasn't intended as such.

                        Who does? 

           It's a natural kiss moment... which SPOOKS Will, who LETS IT 
           PASS. 

                                 WILL
                        Wait. What time is it?

                        I don't carry a cell phone.

                        Neither do I. I'll ask somebody... 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Or you can lift me up and I'll see 
                        if there's a clock in that building 
                        over there.     

           Nearby is the LARZ ANDERSON AUTO MUSEUM, housed in an crazy 
           old CARRIAGE HOUSE. 

           Lifting Sophie up seems like a good, beverage-influenced 
           idea. They walk over to the building, and Will HOISTS Sophie 
           up so she can look through a WINDOW, but she only gets a 
           BRIEF GLIMPSE inside before they both come crashing down.

                        Will you be okay drinking alone in

           INT. WILL AND EMMA'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

           Will enters the apartment and catches Emma standing in the 
           middle of the room smoking a CIGARETTE, looking mellow. 

                                 WILL
                        Are you smoking in the Apartment? 

                                 EMMA
                        It's a one-hitter. I bought it.  

                                 WILL
                        You're a cop. 

                                 EMMA
                        I know. But I never bust anybody 
                        for pot and I needed some.  
                      (beat)
                        The caterer we wanted was shut 
                        down. A bridesmaid found a tooth in 
                        her Viennese Coffee Ball.

                                 WILL
                        It's good we heard about this now 
                        instead of a week before the 
                        wedding. 

                                 EMMA
                      (trying not to panic)
                        That's right. Better now. We'll 
                        find somebody new. 

           Emma walks over to Will. She puts her arms around him and 
           kisses him.

FOSTER'S AND ASSOCIATES - THE NEXT MORNING

           ...And on Monday, Will is thinking about it, and he feels

                        What's wrong with you?

                        Amina and I had a weird situation

           This gets Will's attention.

                                 HENRY
                        Nope. We've done other stuff, but I 
                        was holding off on boning. I mean, 
                        I was lying to everybody that we 
                        were, but I figured, why rush, 
                        we've got the rest of our lives. 

                                 WILL
                        Which isn't like you- 

                                 HENRY
                        -At all.

                        It was like fucking an evil

                        Good Looking. 

                                 EMMA
                        Hi, I'm due to meet Will Harwich in 
                        a few minutes, and I've misplaced 
                        his number. I was wondering if you 
                        had it in your system... 

                                 BENJAMIN (O.C.)
                      (on phone)
                        I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to give 
                        out information about a client. 

           Emma's face says it all - a client? 

                                 EMMA
                        Then could you give him a message 
                        for me in case he checks in? 

                                 BENJAMIN (O.C.)
                      (on phone)
                        Um. Sure. 

                                 EMMA
                        Great. Tell him that if he comes 
                        home and can't find me, it's 
                        because I've made a bonfire out of 
                        all his belongings, and I'm using 
                        it to keep warm while I fuck every 
                        member of the Boston Blazers 
                        lacrosse team.

                      (repeating what she says 
                      as he writes it down)
                        ...Fuck... the Boston Blazers. Got 
                        it. This is Sophie? 

                                 EMMA
                        It's Emma.

THE INTERESTING PERFORMANCE SPACE - LATER 

           The string quartet performance is over. Will and Sophie make 
           their way to a CAB. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        That was great. Where to now? 

                                 WILL
                      (waffling)
                        I need to get back home. I have 
                        work tomorrow. 

           Sophie rolls her eyes. She's not stupid. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        You have a girlfriend. 

                                 WILL
                      (long beat)
                        Yes. 

                                 SOPHIE
                      (disappointed)
                        Of course you do. From now on I'll 
                        have to remember to couple that 
                        particular question with my are you 
                        married question. 

                                 WILL
                        But-

                                 SOPHIE
                        This should be interesting. What's 
                        the but?

                                 WILL
                        I think I'm supposed to be with 
                        you. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        I'm sure that makes your girlfriend 
                        feel good. 
                      (beat)
                        Will. You seem like a wonderful 
                        man. We haven't even kissed yet, so 
                        your honor, or whatever it is, is 
                        pretty much intact. I would love to 
                        see you again. But I won't be the 
                        other woman.

           INT. WILL AND EMMA'S APARTMENT - LATER 

           Will enters the apartment. Emma is sitting on the couch in 
           front of the television, but the TV isn't on. 

                                 WILL
                        Hello. 

           Emma HOLDS UP the Good Looking business card.

                        Now that is a telling reaction.

                        I know you better than anyone, 
                        Will. I've already imagined every 
                        possible thing that you might say, 
                        so you don't need to say it.  

                                 WILL
                        This isn't anybody's fault. You've 
                        talked about it yourself - Good 
                        Looking is always right.

                        We're meant to be with other

                                 EMMA
                        I see. 

                                 WILL
                        It means there is somebody out

                        Fuck off, Will. 

           Emma puts her ENGAGEMENT RING on the table. Emma picks up a 
           packed bag and LEAVES. 

           And that's the end of the relationship.

           INT. WILL AND EMMA'S APARTMENT - SPARE ROOM - LATER 

           It is four in the morning. Will can't sleep, so he's working 
           on a violin. He delicately sands a piece of figure-eight 
           shaped wood - the back of the instrument. 

           He pauses and listens. The apartment is completely silent - 
           no SNORING. Which makes him sad. 

           INT. WILL AND EMMA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM

           Will tries to sleep on his side of the bed, even though the 
           other side of the bed is empty. He could spread out if he 
           wanted. He doesn't. 

           INT. WILL AND EMMA'S FLAT - MAIN ROOM

           Will TAKES DOWN framed photos of he and Emma together:  

           Riding a TANDEM BIKE in the countryside. At a BALL, looking 
           elegant in dress clothes. At the top of a FERRIS WHEEL, 
           acting goofy. 

           There is a picture of Emma standing on the PORCH of a 
           BEACHFRONT INN. She looks amazing. This is the spot where 
           Will proposed to her. 

           Will leaves the photo up.

THE STONE STORE - EARLY EVENING

           It's closing time. Will waits outside The Stone Store. Sophie 
           emerges from the store and locks the door behind her.

           She sees Will, and walks over to him. She knows. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Yeah?

                                 WILL
                      (sorta sadly)
                        Yeah. 

           Sophie smiles. She puts her arms around him and KISSES HIM, 
           and he returns in kind. 

           For a first kiss, it's a great kiss. 

                                 WILL (CONT'D)
                        What now? 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Should we go to your place? 

           Will thinks about the current state of his apartment.

                        It's still early. We could find

           Will and Sophie linger outside of a THEATRE, looking at their 
           choices. 

           The only film playing is an ACTION MOVIE called BOOM! 
           starring an elderly VIN DIESEL (or an equivalent modern 
           action star who is young-ish now, but wouldn't be young when 
           this story is taking place). 

                                 WILL
                        Should we see BOOM?

                        If it's the only thing playing.

           Will and Sophie sit side-by-side watching Vin Diesel in BOOM! 
           Vin Diesel is holding a BABY while firing a FLAMETHROWER at a 
           horde of CYCLOPSES.

                        having balance. So every time a bad

           Approaching them, heading to the next bar, are HENRY and 
           AMINA. They seem happy together, playing around and flirting. 

           Henry sees SOPHIE for the first time, and a huge GRIN spreads 
           across his face. 

           Amina is a little confused - this isn't the woman they had 
           dinner with - but Henry gives her a look to let her know it's 
           fine.

                        Sophie, this is my degenerate co-

                        I'm actually keeping her firmly at 
                        "special friend" status. 

           Amina smacks Henry. 

                                 WILL 
                        Henry is a bad human being, but 
                        Amina is changing him. 

                                 HENRY
                        We're going to the bar. You're 
                        coming. I need to know this 
                        beautiful woman I will never have. 

                                 AMINA
                        Henry! 

                                 WILL
                        We're actually-

                                 HENRY
                        Bar time! Let's go!

           INT. BAR - LATER 

           Will and Sophie are sitting across from Henry and Amina. Will 
           drinks a bottle of COKE. Sophie drinks WINE.

                      (drunk)
                        -I'M THE LUCKIEST MAN ALIVE. Look 
                        at this WOMAN I'm with... 

           Amina rolls her eyes. 

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        I'm not going to lie. It took me a 
                        little while to get used to some of 
                        Amina's techniques... 

                                 AMINA
                        Henry! Shut up! 

                                 HENRY
                        But then, lying there after she 
                        really scared me once, I started 
                        thinking about The Exorcist, and I 
                        just thought, at some point that 
                        priest needed to learn how to 
                        exorcise the devil, and then it 
                        probably got more natural for him 
                        as he did it over and over. 

                                 AMINA
                      (embarrassed)
                        Oh God. 

                                 HENRY 
                      (re: Will)
                        And THIS guy - and MAN I love him - 
                        he's been a reserved intellectual 
                        guy for so long that it's nice to 
                        finally see him taking risks! 
                      (beat)
                        I mean, not that it's a risk to go 
                        to Good Looking, but still...  

           Sophie looks at Will. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        You went to Good Looking?

                                 THEODORE
                        People sometimes ask me how long it 
                        takes to fall in love with 
                        somebody. There's no cut-and-dry 
                        answer to this question, but we 
                        find that our clients tend to fall 
                        in love very quickly indeed...

                        But I'm sure that baby clock thing 
                        will kick in with you eventually. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        I'm not sure. There are so many 
                        jerks in the world, when I see a 
                        baby, I start thinking - when you 
                        look at the statistics - the baby 
                        is probably going to be a dick when 
                        he gets older. 

                                 WILL
                        Which makes the baby less cute. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Right. I sometimes see them as 
                        little, balding insurance agents 
                        who cheat on their wives. 
                      (beat)
                        So I'm glad you want a few 
                        adventures first too. 

           Will nods, but there's something about the look on his face 
           that seems unsure.

                        Speaking of adventure... 

           One of the Boston DUCK BOATS rolls past, filled with 
           tourists. 

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Oh, hell yes we're doing it. 

           INT. DUCK BOAT - LATER 

           Will and Sophie ride in a DUCK BOAT that is heading towards 
           the choppy CHARLES RIVER. The boat has been retrofitted a 
           SOLAR SAIL to power it along. 

           The boat is crowded with COUPLES celebrating their HONEYMOONS 
           and LOVERS all over each other, sitting on each other's laps, 
           feeling each other up, paying no attention to the tour, etc. 

           Will and Sophie are sitting up front in the exposed 'splash' 
           seats. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Is the Charles polluted?

                                 WILL
                        My dad used to swim it.   

                                 SOPHIE
                        And he didn't grow any extra 
                        appendages or anything? 

                                 WILL 
                        He did have a little nubbin of a 
                        sixth toe. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Then the river made him radioactive 
                        and he sprouted a nubbin. 

                                 WILL
                        I can't prove it didn't. 

                                 SOPHIE 
                        Excellent. I'll grow a third boob 
                        and you'll get another dick, and 
                        we'll make movies. 
                      (to driver)
                        Damn the torpedoes! Faster! 

           The boat steams forward and SPLASHES down into the Charles 
           River. Torrents of water SPRAY over Will and Sophie. They are 
           DRENCHED. Sophie HOWLS with laughter. 

           Once the boat is in the river, it floats calmly along. Sophie 
           wipes water out of her face and looks at Will. 

           He looks at her. Her makeup is smudged and she is smiling 
           hugely... it's one of those moments that SHOULD make him go, 
           I love this girl - a perfect moment.   

           But for some reason... he isn't feeling that.

           And he is aware of it. 

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                      (laughing)
                        I think we got the worst of the 
                        splash. 

                                 WILL
                      (throwaway)
                        I think so...

           Will looks out at the river, letting the moment PASS. He 
           seems confused.

                        Two please.

                        Do you want combination tickets? 
                        They include the Planetarium. 

           Will and Sophie look at each other. 

                                 WILL
                        Combination tickets would be great. 

           Sophie slides a PIECE OF PAPER to the ticket vendor. It’s 
           Summit’s permission slip that she found in the couch. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        This is his permission slip, in 
                        case you need it.  

                                 TICKET VENDOR
                        That'll be thirteen hundred 
                        dollars. 

                                 WILL
                        What's playing at the Planetarium?

           Will and Sophie are lying on their backs in the Museum of 
           Science’s PLANETARIUM, beholding the LASER PINK FLOYD SHOW. 

           Lasers dance across the theatre’s curved ceiling, accompanied 
           by the band’s “Goodbye Blue Sky."    

           Will and Sophie watch.

                        Man. Pink Floyd sucks.

           it looks like Will just shoved anything that had to do with 
           her in the corner and threw a SHEET over it to hide it. 

           Will and Sophie are on the couch, MAKING OUT like we haven't

                                 WILL
                        I haven't got one right yet. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        How will you know when you've got

                        I'm... trying to replicate the 
                        sound of a Stradivarius. 

           Sophie BURSTS OUT LAUGHING. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Come on. Nobody has done that in 
                        three centuries. That's the reason 
                        they're priceless.  

                                 WILL
                        I think I can do it. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        I've read about this. They can't be 
                        replicated because those 
                        instruments were made from wood 
                        that grew under weird weather 
                        conditions in the 1600s. 
                        No matter what you did, you'd never 
                        get it right.

                        I'm afraid you need to give it up.

           The scene we saw earlier in the WORKSHOP, with Emma hanging 
           over Will's shoulders late-night as he worked.

           Will examines Sophie's face.  

           And in this moment, Will knows that he has royally fucked up.

                        Don't look so stricken. You just 
                        need a new hobby.

                        And I may have a suggestion...

                      (beat; low)
                        I think... you... should leave.

                        Somebody is sensitive about his 
                        violins.

                        It's not that. Well, in a way it 
                        is, but- I'm sorry. You need to... 
                        go. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        You're kidding. 

                                 WILL
                        I... made a mistake.

                        -I know it does. And I'm perfectly, 
                        outrageously compatible with you - 
                        I mean, the fact that you've read 
                        extensively about Stradivarius 
                        violins says something. Without 
                        question, Good Looking did its job.

                        So what's the problem?

                        I was born in the wrong time. Think

                        in, like, 2010. 

           Will nods. Nothing left to say, Sophie LEAVES the apartment.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Will CALLS Emma on his HOUSE PHONE. It rings. 

                                 WILL
                        Come on... 

           He gets her VOICE MAIL.

                        case, you know how I never shot 
                        anybody? YOU will be my first. You

POLICE STATION - LATER 

           Will enters the police station and approaches the front desk, 
           where a FEMALE OFFICER is standing. 

                                 WILL
                        Hi. I was wondering if Officer 
                        Smithson is working tonight. She 
                        usually pulls night shifts on the 
                        third Friday of the month. 

                                 FEMALE OFFICER
                        And your name is... 

                                 WILL
                        Will Harwich. 

                                 FEMALE OFFICER
                        Oh. Jesus. You're Will. 
                      (serious)
                        She's not working. 

                                 WILL
                        But she usually-

                                 FEMALE OFFICER
                        She's ON LEAVE.
                      (beat; low)
                        She hasn't taken your breakup well. 

           Will looks at the OTHER OFFICERS behind the desk. All of them 
           are SHAKING THEIR HEADS. 

                                 OFFICER #2
                        She's on leave. 

                                 OFFICER #3
                        Needed to go on leave, man. 

                                 WILL
                        How do I know you're telling me the 
                        truth?  

                                 FEMALE OFFICER
                        I hear you're not good with truth.

                                 WILL 
                      (beat)
                        Is there a payphone in here?

SMALL ELECTRIC CAR - LATER 

           Will rides through a BAD NEIGHBORHOOD in the passenger seat 
           of Henry's SMALL ELECTRIC CAR. Henry drives. 

           Will sees three TOUGH LOOKING GANGBANGERS through the window. 

                                 HENRY
                        I can't believe you broke up. 

                                 WILL
                        She was the most compatible person 
                        for me in the world. But I wasn't 
                        going to love her. 

                                 HENRY
                        You should have at least got a 
                        handjob. 
                      (concerned)
                        Why are we here again? 

                                 WILL
                        This neighborhood is Emma's beat. 
                        Stop the car. 

           Henry STOPS the car. The gangbangers reach into their COATS, 
           ready to take out guns. Will rolls down the window. 

                                 WILL (CONT'D)
                        Excuse me there!

           The gangbangers look at each other. 

                                 GANGBANGER #1
                        Where you from? Who you with? 

                                 WILL
                        A private equity firm. 

           The gangbangers walk over ominously. 

                                 GANGBANGER #1
                        Private equity?  

                                 WILL
                        I'm looking for information. 

           Will hands several ten-thousand-dollar bills to the 
           gangbanger.

                        There's an officer that sometimes 
                        works this neighborhood. Smithson. 

           The gangbangers recoil at the name. 

                                 GANGBANGER #1
                      (concerned)
                        Oh, shit. Officer Smithson was 
                        crazy a few days ago. Like some 
                        sort of banshee. 

           Gangbanger #1 gestures to the HEADS of his two buddies. They 
           are wearing BANDAGES on their SCALPS. 

                                 GANGBANGER #2
                        That's a pretty lady with an ugly 
                        club. 

                                 GANGBANGER #3

                      (re: his buddies)
                        She kept calling them Will while 
                        she was beating on them. 

                                 WILL
                        I am. Will, I mean.

                        That bitch needs to go on leave.

                        Take that money back. We ain't 
                        messin' with Officer Smithson. 

           The gangbangers walk away from the car. Henry drives away 
           down the street. 

                                 HENRY
                      (matter-of-fact)
                        Emma's angry. 

                                 WILL

                        Look. If you want to find Emma, 
                        there's one place to go. You might 
                        have to pay for it though. 

           EXT. GOOD LOOKING - LATER 

           Will and Henry are parked outside of the Good Looking office 
           on Newbury Street.  

           There are still LIGHTS on inside the office and HORDE of 
           people outside, drinking and laughing. 

           CUSTOMERS exit Good Looking triumphantly holding pieces of 
           paper with the names of their soulmates on them. Some are so 
           excited they announce the names to the throng. 

                                 MALE CUSTOMER
                        Kathleen Constantino! 

           The mob ROARS its approval. Another customer exits the 
           building.

                                 FEMALE CUSTOMER
                        Robert Holt!

           The mob ROARS again. 

           Will and Henry watch from the car. 

                                 HENRY
                        Good Looking attracts a night

                        in, find out your soulmate. It's 
                        our generation's equivalent of the 
                        drunk tattoo. 

           Will stares at the Good Looking office, thinking. 

                                 HENRY
                        They've got all the information in

                        she is. 

           Will continues to stare at the office. And then...

           EXT. ROUTE ONE - DAYBREAK

           Will drives the car down Route One towards MAINE. 

           EXT. BEACHFRONT INN - MAINE COAST - MORNING

           Emma is sitting on the porch of a beachfront inn we recognize 
           from the photograph. This is the place where she and Will got 
           engaged. The beach is huge and empty. She is in her pajamas 
           with a bathrobe wrapped around her, looking out at a whale in 
           the ocean through some high-tech BINOCULARS. 

           Then, she hears the sound of a CAR.  

           Emma focuses the binoculars in the direction of the back road 
           that is the only way to get to the inn, and sees the car 
           coming. Through the windshield, she sees that Will is behind 
           the wheel. 

           She puts down the binoculars and takes a sip of her morning 
           tea. She puts down her cup and then picks up her trusty GUN, 
           lying on the table nearby. 

           Will's car gets closer...

           Emma takes aim... 

           And POP POP POP! Emma BLOWS OUT the FRONT TIRES of the 
           electric car. 

           The car swerves off the road into a SAND BANK. 

           Satisfied, Emma takes another sip of her tea. 

           Will cracks open the WINDOW of the car and climbs out, dazed 
           and bruised and bloodied. He stumbles up the beach towards 
           the inn, his hands above his head in surrender.

           Will tentatively walks closer to the porch.  

           Emma fires again - POP POP POP! - and Will DANCES to get out 
           of the way. 

                                 WILL

                        I don't need technology to tell me 
                        what I know. And what I know - what 
                        I've always known - is that I'm 
                        supposed to be with you.

           Emma seems touched - or at least, touched enough to PUT DOWN 
           THE GUN. And then, we hear FOOTSTEPS.

           With that, a MUSCULAR HANDSOME MAN walks out of the front 
           door of the inn, also wearing a BATHROBE. He SNIFFS Emma's 
           hair and kisses her on the top of the head.

                        I figured that if you had such luck

                        I don't care. Good Looking can tell

           Will is moved. He gets down on ONE KNEE and takes out the

           The VINEYARD where it is all taking place is immaculate, with 
           rows of vines extending forever in all directions. 

           Dozens of Will and Emma's friends and family are milling 
           around, eating and dancing on a floor that lights up like 
           SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER. 

           Henry stands in the center of the reception with Amina, 
           drinking wine and taking it all in. He is wearing a 
           boutonniere that verges on being TECHNICOLOR. 

                                 AMINA
                        This is really nice. 

                                 HENRY
                        It is really nice, but let me point 
                        some things out for you... 

           Henry gestures at a SHORT BUS parked nearby. 

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        A short bus to take the guests to 
                        the reception? What kind of message 
                        does that send? And look at that... 

           A GUEST quietly spits her vegetable hors d'oeuvre into a 
           NAPKIN. 

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        Bok choi hors d'oeuvres? Nobody 
                        wants that healthy crap at a 
                        wedding. And check it out... 

           Henry points to the BAND that is playing for the guests. It's 
           an excellent, lively wedding band, with a half-dozen 
           VIOLINISTS jammed into the act.     

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        A band with six people fiddlin'? 
                        This is Boston. We don't have 
                        hootenannies. 
                      (beat)
                        All parts of the wedding that Will 
                        planned. 

                                 AMINA
                        Everybody knows you should never 
                        let a man help plan a wedding.
                      (beat)
                        They do look perfect together 
                        though.

           On the DANCE FLOOR, Will and Emma are whirling wildly to the 
           music, having the time of their lives. They look incredible. 

                                 WILL
                        Mrs. Harwich. 

                                 EMMA
                        Mr. Smithson. 

           Will pulls her close, and whispers to her. 

                                 WILL 
                        I'll be a good guy, I promise. 
                      (beat)
                        Ain't gonna do nothing wrong. I 
                        ain't gonna leave no hair in the 
                        sink or nothing like that. 
                      (beat)
                        I think this is gonna be great, you 
                        know that?  

           Emma thinks about what Will has just said... and she gets an 
           odd look on her face. 

                                 EMMA
                        Wait. Is that from Rocky II?  

                                 WILL
                        One of your favorites. 

                                 EMMA
                        You're sweet. 

                                 WILL
                        We should do this more often. 

                                 EMMA
                        Get married?

                                 WILL
                        Dance. 

                                 EMMA 
                      (re: the band)
                        You've made it easy. The violins 
                        sound fantastic. 

                                 WILL
                        They're not perfect.

                        A peculiar situation has come to 
                        the attention of Good Looking, in 
                        which we made a match, yet a member 
                        of the pairing decided to stay with

           EXT. FOUNTAIN - DAY

           Another fountain, much like the one from the commercial at 
           the beginning of our story. 

           But this time it's MAXIMILIAN and SOPHIE who are sitting on 
           the edge of the fountain, holding HANDS.

                        I too had lost a woman who vuz 
                        supposed to be mine, but vith 
                        Sophie, I have love. 

                                 SOPHIE
                      (kidding, maybe)
                        Not to say he isn't a little 
                        muscular for my taste... 

                                 MAXIMILIAN
                      (kidding, maybe)
                        And she does not vant to see my 
                        movies, though I vould like her 
                        to... 

                                 SOPHIE
                      (kidding, maybe)
                        And I'm not sure what he's saying 
                        all the time, but I'm glad to be 
                        with somebody so close to ideal.

                        Eet is true vat they say... 

           Sophie goes in for a quick peck of a kiss on Maximilian, 
           while goes in for some open-mouthed French action, and they 
           press their faces together awkwardly.  

                                 SOPHIE
                      (back to camera)
                        ...There's somebody for everyone.™

           A final trademark 'TM' pops up in the corner of the screen, 
           the commercial turns off with a quick ZZZZT! and with that 
           we...  

                                                BLACK OUT.
