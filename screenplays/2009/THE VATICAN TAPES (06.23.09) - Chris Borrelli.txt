           TITLE CARD

           White letters over black read:

           For two thousand years the Catholic Church has 
           investigated cases of alleged demonic possessions.

           The Vatican now documents these events to disprove, study 
           and better explain them within a contemporary, scientific 
           context.

           The following is one such recording.

                                                           TO BLACK:

                                                             CUT IN:

           INT. AN AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING

           Out of focus.  The colors muted as if the operator of 
           this video camera forgot to white balance.  (NOTE TO THE 
           READER: This entire film will be shot on video, 
           documentary style.)

           A BOOMING LOUDSPEAKER announces something in a Slavic 
           language.

           The frame goes dark, then blinding white as the aperture 
           is opened.  Balances itself, focuses and settles on 
           several equipment cases at the operator’s feet.  

           Baggage claim tags from Rome and Boston are on them.  
           “Lowel Light” is written on their sides.

           As we ZOOM IN on a jagged new crack on one case.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                              (flicks the crack)
                        ...I don’t believe it.  Shit.

           More CURSING as he searches through the case, finding 
           slight damage to the lights inside.

                                 MATT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Damn it!  Shit.  Damn it...

                                 ANTONIO (O.S.)
                        Father Matt?

           Highly polished black shoes enter frame and camera tips 
           up to find FATHER ANTONIO.  The priest has lived in Rome 
           long enough to become Italian, early 50’s with a clean, 
           no-nonsense look.  Solid of build, his blond hair short 
           and orderly.

           CONTINUED:

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        ...Our ride should be here any 
                        moment.
                              (moves off screen)
                        Perhaps we could check the 
                        equipment somewhere else?

           Just then a LAUGHING VOICE comes over the camera, the 
           accent Eastern European...

           OUR POV changes, now through another camera noticeably 
           lower in quality moving through the crowd of Eastern-
           European TRAVELERS.

           This camera finds FATHER MATT, showing him to be 30’s, 
           black, American.  His open coat reveals a priest’s 
           collar.

                                 VOICE / KARL (O.S.)
                              (laughing)
                        I’m shooting you now!  How do you 
                        like it?

           Karl zooms in on Matt, now storing his camera.

                                 VOICE / KARL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Father Matt, you are not a local, 
                        are you?  You don’t look Polish to 
                        me!

                                 MATT
                        I’m from Chicago...
                              (gets the joke)
                        Oh.

           Camera now focuses on Antonio who looks annoyed.

                                 VOICE / KARL (O.S.)
                        Good to meet you, Father Antonio, 
                        Correct?  Karl Jaworski.

           Karl’s hand enters frame, and as Antonio moves to shake 
           it...  

           ...Karl holds the camera out at arm’s length to encompass 
           both of their faces as if capturing this moment - it’s 
           doubly awkward.

           We get our first look at FATHER KARL, 20’s, Polish but 
           very western with his shaved head and a smattering of 
           stylishly unkempt facial hair.

                                 KARL
                        Follow me gentlemen- Eight hours 
                        of driving ahead of us!
           EXT. DACIA AUTOMOBILE - MOMENTS LATER

           A close cousin of the Yugo.  

           Karl’s camera films Matt stuffing his equipment in the 
           trunk.  The Airport in the B.G., Antonio waits nearby.

                                 KARL
                        ...We go to a very remote area.  
                        Some of their church practices 
                        predate Vatican two.  How you 
                        would say “backwards.”

           Antonio seems distracted by Karl’s filming.

                                 ANTONIO
                        We brought our own cameras to 
                        document events.

                                 KARL (O.S.)
                        I wanted mine here - for myself.  
                        In case we get a little 
                        excitement, yes?

           Antonio frowns at this but Karl gives a little cheer 
           anyway.  Then asks Antonio...

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        Tell me, what are the chances?

                                 ANTONIO
                        Chances?

                                 KARL
                        That it is real?  A real demon.

                                 ANTONIO
                        This case?  In my decades of 
                        experience?
                              (then)
                        Zero point zero.

                                                            MOVE TO:

           EXT. RECTORY - DAY

           Through Matt’s camera now.  Twin spires reach skyward.  
           The rural church might seem surprisingly ornate to a 
           Westerner, though it could still use a coat of paint.  It 
           dwarfs the few structures around it.

           Only one other parked vehicle besides the Dacia, a three-
           wheeled truck of some sort, it’s body actually made out 
           of wood.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           We stay on this establishing shot a moment longer than 
           seems necessary, hearing only the WIND. 

           Then camera tilts down, jolts as it turns off...

                                                             CUT TO:

           INT. RECTORY 

           Shot of a chair.  A large crucifix hangs in the B.G. - 
           It’s of the older style with painted-on-blood, making for 
           a gory rendition of Jesus on the cross.  

           We hear movement off screen.

           Creaking wood as FOOTSTEPS approach.  Then a single NEW 
           VOICE speaks POLISH, seems kind of upset...

                                 KARL (O.S.)
                        He is wondering why you film him?

                                 ANTONIO (O.S.)
                        As a matter of record we document 
                        everything to do with these cases.  
                        It helps preserve the integrity of 
                        the church to disprove possessions 
                        for what they are, usually some 
                        form of mental illness.
                              (As Karl translates 
                               this)
                        I don’t enjoy it either but Father 
                        Matt will be quick.

           A SIGH and then FATHER JANUSZ blocks camera for an 
           instant before sitting in the chair.  He’s 70’s, thinning 
           hair and well-fed.  He wears a more traditional priest’s 
           robe and collar, something from an older era.  

           Karl sits down next to him, unconsciously pats his hair 
           down.  He translates for the older priest.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                              (behind camera)
                        Okay, Father.  Please state your 
                        name.

           Karl translates, relays...

                                 KARL
                        His name is Father Janusz 
                        Ostrowski.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Ost-ro-owski?

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 KARL
                        ...Father John.

           The older priest looks from Matt to Karl.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Okay, Father John.  The Girl.  
                              (then)
                        Tell us about The Girl.

           Karl repeats and the old priest stares at camera.  
           Gathers himself, like he’s recounting a traumatic event, 
           SPEAKS...

                                 KARL
                              (word for word)
                        “It would be better if you were to 
                        go and see.”

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Yes, Father.  But for our records, 
                        we’d like you to tell us what you 
                        know.

                                 KARL
                              (translates as fact)
                        “Inside The Girl lives a Demon.”

           Karl smirks at his own translation.  Now Antonio’s voice 
           comes, steady.

                                 ANTONIO (O.S.)
                        Father, I know of your communiques 
                        with the Vatican.  As to 
                        possession - The Girl has 
                        exhibited symptoms that, in a 
                        modern light, could also suggest a 
                        variety of worldly causes.

           The old priest listens to Karl’s translation with 
           building anger.  

                                 KARL
                              (translates)
                        “...I have to convince you as 
                        well?”

           Karl shifts, suddenly uncomfortable.

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        “...All the calls I made.  I 
                        pleaded.  I still beg.”

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ANTONIO (O.S.)
                              (Interrupts)
                        Don’t worry - We are on our way to 
                        see The Girl.  But first Father 
                        Matt and I must gather information 
                        to determine if...

           The older priest now turns to Karl, sounds like he is 
           CURSING him out.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        Karl?

                                 KARL
                        ...He’s insulted that we think he 
                        doesn’t know the difference 
                        between - mental --
                              (gesturing, searching 
                               for the word)
                        When someone is, how is it 
                        said...?

           At this, Janusz abruptly gets up and leaves the chair, 
           leaving Karl staring like a deer in headlights.

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                              (Janusz speaks again)
                        He says “you can go without me.”

           EXT. DACIA, PARKED / CHURCH - DAY

           A simple shot of the little car.

                                                         JUMP CUT TO:

           EXT. DACIA, PARKED / ROAD

           The car occupies the same position in frame but the 
           surrounding area has instantly changed.  It’s a throwback 
           to an old Buster Keaton camera trick.

           The shot now PANS from the car to reveal we are no longer 
           at the church but:

           A SLUM - CONTINUOUS

           Eastern European version.  Low farmlands abut rows of 
           packed together shanties -- pre cold war housing.

           DOGS bark in the far distance.

           There’s not a soul in sight.

           The three priests make their way through the ghost town.  

           A cow pokes its head over the fence of a tiny backyard.

                              (chuckles)
                        Found somebody...

           MOVING THROUGH - MOMENTS LATER

           Matt’s camera is following Karl and Antonio.  Karl holds 
           a hand-drawn map scribbled on the back of a church 
           hymnal.  

                                 KARL
                        Was a mining town decades ago, 
                        drilling for gas.  Gas ran out.

           Puddles of stagnant water dot the streets.  A stray dog 
           crosses in our path.  

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        This should be it.

           EXT. THE HOUSE

           The shot is surprisingly lifeless.  The house is a 
           crumbling two storey cement structure.  Torn curtains or 
           towels cover the windows.

           At one time this place was a lived in home - carved out 
           of a soulless cold war building.  Now it is neither.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Ghost town.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Hmm?

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Lots of homes packed into this 
                        area but there aren’t any people.

           Karl KNOCKS on the door.

                                 KARL
                              (laughs)
                        Perhaps they moved out.

           Matt moves to a torn curtain, peers through.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           THROUGH THE CURTAINS - a TV plays snow. A FIGURE is lying 
           on the floor in front of it.  Its the SILHOUETTE of a big 
           man but misshapen - as if he has two heads.

           Matt focuses --

           -- revealing it’s TWO PEOPLE - the first is LESLAW, late 
           40’s, three hundred pounds of salt-of-the-earth farmer 
           stock.  He’s passed out drunk.

           Crawling over him is his SON, 4 years old, a toy fire 
           truck in hand.  The boy sees them, looks afraid.

           Karl’s hand enters frame - RAPPING on the window.  He 
           YELLS in Polish, then English...

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        Wake up!

           The kid begins to WAIL but Leslaw doesn’t stir.

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        What should we do?

           Before Matt can answer, the door is KICKED in by Antonio.

                                                             CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

           Antonio walks through the house.  Silently looking at 
           everything, hands behind his back.  

           Sees no reason to stop, now heading for the stairs.

           INT. SON’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bunk bed with a mattress only on the bottom.  A few toys 
           are scattered on the bare top bunk.  The place is a mess.

           Antonio moves through.  He accidentally steps on a toy 
           and it SQUEAKS.

           INT. THE GIRL’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Antonio enters the brightest spot in the house.  Pink and 
           light blues, stuffed animals.

           Matt PANS the room.  Sees the four poster bed has been 
           stripped of sheets.  Oddly just a frame.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           PANS further to find an eerie kid-sized doll in a 
           chair... 

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                              (surprised, laughs)
                        ...Jeez.

           Now Matt finds a photo collage of TWO GIRLS, 16, one is a 
           blond - the other a bit Goth-looking.  Every shot has 
           them either smiling wide or pouting, arms around each 
           other in assorted shots.  

           Other photos include one of the blond girl and Leslaw - 
           father and daughter.  She’s very pretty, striking blue 
           eyes.  He is looking at her.

           PAN a few more pictures, the last one is a flash-assisted 
           shot of the exterior of a stone cave or catacombs.

           Slight hold on this dusky image.  Then Matt turns to see 
           Antonio is already heading downstairs, into darkness.

           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

           Good-sized living room.  The furniture is in a terrible 
           state, falling apart, the table’s legs don’t match each 
           other and so on.

           Even so, there are splashes of color, cross-stitched 
           tapestries and blankets, chipped crystal glasses and the 
           son’s toys.  Like specks of brightness in a fog.

           Leslaw is seated on the couch, his rounded shoulders 
           slumped forward.  A sense of shame about him.

           Antonio has been given the best seat.  Faces Leslaw.  
           Karl stands and TRANSLATES.

                                 ANTONIO
                        ...When did your daughter begin 
                        showing signs of a - change?

           Karl SPEAKS POLISH to Leslaw.  The big man ARGUES at 
           first.

                                 KARL
                        He says it’s not his daughter.

           Leslaw can’t meet their eyes, looks down as Karl 
           explains...

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        What is inside her is not his 
                        daughter any more.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           At this a WHIRLING is heard.  The boy’s remote-control 
           toy fire truck has turned on, wheels spinning off the 
           ground.  Leslaw reaches underneath the toy, shuts it off.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Now ask him “when did this start?”

           Karl speaks to Leslaw again.  The man thinks for a 
           moment, it actually seems to mellow him out.  SPEAKS and 
           Karl translates...

                                 KARL
                        ...About six weeks ago.  But it 
                        came - he is saying it came on, 
                        uh, gradually.
                              (more from Leslaw)
                        At first she was not this bad...

           But even as Karl translates the last part, Leslaw has his 
           head in his hands.  Weeping.

           Confused, Karl tries to verbally prod the man.  But to no 
           avail.

           Then Karl shrugs to Antonio.  “What to do?”

                                 ANTONIO
                              (finally)
                        ...Let’s see her.  Let’s see The 
                        Girl now.  Is she at a neighbor’s 
                        home?

           Gesturing, Karl ASKS Leslaw where she is.  When Leslaw 
           answers, Karl seems surprised.

                                 KARL
                        ...She is here.

           Without waiting for Antonio, Karl asks Leslaw where.  The 
           big man moves off the couch, scoots only a few feet. 

           Leslaw reaches down to the floor, revealing...

           A trap door.

           Leslaw pulls up on a small latch, opening the hidden door 
           in the ground...

           Matt MURMURS, concerned.

           INT. STAIRWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           We’re behind Karl and Antonio.  About to descend when 
           Leslaw CALLS for Karl to wait.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He hands the priest a bag.  Raw potatoes are inside.

           Karl SIGHS, heads down.  Antonio behind him, Matt’s 
           camera close as we move into darkness.

           INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           FOOTSTEPS.  A little light through the trap door.  The 
           group can see now, camera is adjusting...

           At the bottom of the stairs a dirt floor lines the long 
           basement.  There’s a maze of junk down here including 
           rusted farm equipment and tools on the wall and 
           workbench.

           Antonio rounds the staircase and goes to his left, stops.  
           Karl is next, Matt’s trying to see...

           Matt zooms in on a hazy shot at the other end of the 
           sizeable basement, some light here as well.  Camera 
           focuses as it discovers...

           THE GIRL 

           Under a naked HUMMING light bulb.  Filthy blond hair 
           obscures her face.  It’s the formerly pretty girl from 
           the collage.  

           She is lying on a holed mattress held up by wooden 
           pallets.  Rags and towels make up the sheets. 

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Oh, no...

           The trio hurries to her.  Antonio takes a pulse.

           He moves aside her hair, revealing her young face.  It 
           has a gaunt, Nosferatu look.

           Checks her pupils.  No reaction.  The Girl is motionless.  
           Catatonic.  

           Matt PANS the room, a filthy bucket in one corner.

           PANS her body next.  Sees...

           A rusty chain looped around her ankle.  The foot looks 
           infected.

                                 MATT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                              (quietly)
                        Father Antonio?

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Antonio sees the chain, JIGGLES it, finding it wrapped 
           around a cement post. 

                                 ANTONIO
                        Where is the key?

           Antonio glares at Karl who has found a cup of water, 
           tries to get her to drink.  Antonio is composed but can’t 
           hide a certain level of disgust in his voice.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        You knew about this?

                                 KARL
                        I did not!  Father Janusz told me 
                        she would be in her room, 
                        upstairs. 

           But Antonio is not satisfied.

                                 ANTONIO
                              (softer to The Girl)
                        It will be alright.  We will get 
                        you out here.  

           No reaction comes from The Girl.  Antonio moves off 
           camera...

           Matt focuses close on The Girl.  Still motionless as Karl 
           TRANSLATES what Antonio has said.  Then suddenly...

           WHAM!  The sound makes Karl and Matt jump.  

           Shot turns to reveal Antonio has found a hammer and iron 
           among the tools.  Going to work on the chain.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                              (ripping it out)
                        We are going to leave you for a 
                        moment but then we will return.
                              (smashes)
                        Help is here now.

           He SLAMS the iron again.  The chain breaks.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Antonio sits at the long kitchen table.  Karl is nearby 
           along with Leslaw’s son, constantly underfoot, crayons in 
           hand.

           Karl brings Leslaw in from a back room, bottle of 
           homemade vodka in hand, guilt on his face, a battered 
           down man. 

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Leslaw drops himself at the kitchen table.  Antonio 
           speaks in a stern, unwavering voice.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Lack of food, dehydration.  
                        Terrible conditions.  You are her 
                        father, for shame.

           The boy now coloring nearby, Leslaw’s eyes lower as Karl 
           translates.  Even without hearing every word, Antonio’s 
           tone is humbling him.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        We are now forced to contact the 
                        local police.

           Leslaw hears this, denying something as Karl 
           translates...

                                 KARL
                        He says - he says the police TOLD 
                        him to put her down there.  
                              (surprised)
                        Said it was safer for everyone.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        ...What?

           But Antonio’s gaze doesn’t waver.  States...

                                 ANTONIO
                        There is no demon here. 

                                 KARL
                              (almost disappointed)
                        You are sure, Father?

                                 ANTONIO
                        I would have felt its presence 
                        when walking through the house.

           Karl almost sighs.  Matt notices...

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Sorry to disappoint you.

           Antonio turns back to Leslaw.  Matt slightly changes 
           camera angles.

                                 ANTONIO
                        I know for a long time you have 
                        had no woman in the house but for 
                        your daughter. 

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Karl translates as Leslaw seems to wonder where this is 
           going...

           But Matt notices something on the bookshelf near the 
           boy’s reach - A Russian-made pistol on top a pile of 
           paper.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                              (under breath)
                        Shit!

           Antonio hasn’t seen it, continues with Leslaw.

                                 ANTONIO
                        I must ask you now - for your own 
                        soul - tell me honestly, have you 
                        had an improper relationship with 
                        your daughter?

           Karl hesitates, as he begins to translate he seems to be 
           asking timidly, while --

           The boy picks up the gun, moving it to get to the paper 
           beneath.  Matt hurries to the gun, grabbing it out of the 
           boy’s reach.

                                 MATT
                              (mumbles)
                        Father of the year...

           As Karl’s translation finishes, Leslaw stands up - 
           Suddenly angry - begins SHOUTING at Antonio.  Even with 
           all the machine-gun-speed Polish, “no” is repeatedly 
           heard in English.

           Karl motions for calm.  Gets Leslaw to sit back down.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Tell him we will sit with her 
                        regularly.  
                              (points at Leslaw)
                        We will be watching until we can 
                        move her to hospital.

           Karl passes this on, Antonio pauses, then continues 
           speaking over him.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        And tell him to pray for help.  
                        I’ve seen many in his daughter’s 
                        state who fully recover.

           As Karl repeats, Leslaw seems to have questions...

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 KARL
                              (to Antonio)
                        He wants to know what you mean by 
                        “state.” 

                                 ANTONIO
                        Catatonic.

           Karl takes more than a few words to explain this to 
           Leslaw.  To everyone’s surprise Leslaw CHUCKLES.  It’s a 
           sad, ruined sound.

           Finally Leslaw explains to Karl, translation...

                                 KARL
                        He says she’s not that way.  Not 
                        catatonic.
                              (Leslaw says more)
                        “You will see.”

           As the priests try to understand...

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        “She’s watching us.  It’s watching 
                        us.”

           Antonio doesn’t blink.

           INT. STAIRS - MINUTES LATER

           Antonio is carrying The Girl upstairs, toward her room.  
           The nails on her bare feet are curled black.

                                                             CUT TO:

           INT. THE GIRL’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The bed has been hastily made.  Antonio gingerly lays The 
           Girl on her mattress.

           He looks to the others, motions that they should leave.

                                                             CUT TO:

           BLACKNESS

           Then an image FLICKERS to life.  Matt’s face - so close 
           it makes up the frame.  

           He pulls away from this locked-off camera, revealing we 
           are...
           INT. THE GIRL’S BEDROOM

           The Girl is on her bed.  Unmoving.  Her presence makes 
           the room less cheery now.

           Matt speaks to her.

                                 MATT
                        We’re pretty much on our own with 
                        the authorities here - So at least 
                        we’ll have some kind of record.
                              (laughs at himself)
                        I’m sure this would mean a lot 
                        more to you if you spoke English.

           Matt moves out into the hallway.  We hear NOISES from 
           him.

           Hold on The Girl.  A little longer than is comfortable.

           Low 1950’s American ROCK MUSIC plays from somewhere 
           nearby.  It fades off.

           She still doesn’t move.  A SWISHING sound is heard.

           Matt enters frame again, he’s holding a big bowl of water 
           and a rag.

           Sets it down, about to bathe her.

           He looks at camera, conscious of it.  Decides...

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        ...Little privacy.

           Matt gets up, turns off the camera.

                                                             CUT TO:

           INT. THE GIRL’S ROOM - LATER

           The same shot.  The Girl now wears a different nightgown.  

           The grime has been cleaned off, but in doing so it has 
           only exposed how very rough she really looks.

           Her skin seems to be dying.  A wizened look to her.  She 
           still doesn’t move.

           Even so, there’s a human being here now.  With kindness, 
           Matt straightens out her hair.

           A clump of it comes out in his hands.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           FOOTSTEPS are heard.

                                 KARL (O.S.)
                        Matt?

                                 MATT
                        Up here.

           Karl enters, looks at Matt and The Girl.

                                 KARL
                        Did you get her to speak?

           There’s something kind of rude about asking this in front 
           of her, but Matt only shakes his head.

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        I will help.

           Matt frowns.  Undeterred, a thought comes to Karl.  He 
           takes out his wallet.  

           A tribal design on the leather.  Karl reaches in, pulls 
           out a photo.  Hard for us to see the image but it looks 
           like a teenage girl...

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                              (holds it up to her)
                        I tell her a story.

           Karl speaks Polish to The Girl, as he shows her the 
           photo. 

           He finishes.  She blinks.

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                              (to Matt)
                        I just tell her about my baby 
                        sister.  About the same age.  She 
                        had a rough time, too.  A teacher, 
                        he did some very bad things to 
                        her.

           Karl notices the camera.  Decides to stop, when...

           The Girl turns her head slightly.  

           Encouraged, Karl continues on.

           The Girl is staring at the picture.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                              (now to Matt)
                        But the man who hurt her - He’s 
                        been put away.  And Lidia's doing 
                        just fine now.

           Now The Girl puts out her hand for the picture.  Karl is 
           only too happy to hand it over.  

           He says a few more words in Polish, explains to Matt...

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        I just invited her, someday, to 
                        come to my house, meet my sister.

           The Girl looks over at Karl.

           Karl smiles at the progress, nods to Matt.

           Still grasping the photo The Girl licks it.

           Karl snatches back the picture, both priests see...

                                 MATT
                        ...Blood?

           The Girl opens her mouth.  Blood everywhere, COUGHS some 
           up...

           Matt holds her face, looks...

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        She’s bit her tongue!

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Antonio seems to be preparing for Mass.  He holds a 
           Bible.  A red stole around his neck. 

           Karl looks on, speaks to Matt / camera.

                                 KARL
                        If there is no demon, why say a 
                        Mass?

           Antonio has overheard...

                                 ANTONIO
                        If The Girl believes she’s 
                        possessed, it may speed her 
                        recovery to have - not an exorcism 
                        - but a Mass performed.

           Karl still looks confused.  Matt WHISPERS...

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        ...Placebo.

           Antonio GRUMBLES at this, takes a very simple wooden 
           crucifix from his pocket.  

           Then he nods, motions to be followed.  They head up the 
           stairs.

           INT. STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

           Moving up and toward The Girl’s room.

           INT. THE GIRL’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Antonio is the first inside.  He freezes.  Right behind 
           him, Karl also stops.  Matt can’t see what they’re 
           looking at.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Guys?  What is it?

           Matt nudges his way through, sees that the bed is empty.

                                 MATT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        The Hell...?

           The men search, Karl moves down the stairs.  Antonio 
           begins looking around the upper floor.

           MOVING THROUGH THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Being searched, the trio looking...

           Hurrying back down the STAIRS, then into the LIVING ROOM. 

           Matt pans toward the KITCHEN as well.  No Girl.

                                 KARL
                        ...She go out the window or 
                        something...?

           Suddenly Matt stops.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        You hear that?

           That 50’s music is being played faintly.

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                        Sounds like it is coming from...

           Karl points below and the men head for the stairs.

           INT. STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

           Following Antonio and Karl down.  The MUSIC gets louder 
           as they approach.

           The trio enters...

           INT. BASEMENT

           ... And see The Girl is here.

           The music comes from a a broken-looking radio on a nearby 
           workbench.  It FIZZES with static.

           The Girl stares off.

                                 MATT
                        What the Hell...?

           Antonio looks at Matt with a face that could stop a 
           clock.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Keep in mind this goes to the Holy 
                        Father.

           Antonio turns and moves toward The Girl.

                                 MATT
                              (under breath)
                        Yeah.  Edited.

           The radio FIZZES again and cuts out.

           INT. BASEMENT - LATER

           The three priests are saying a Mass.  That lock-off 
           camera has been moved down here.

           Antonio speaks Latin, blessing bread.

           While we might not understand his words, Antonio’s 
           delivery has passion to it...

           Amen.
                                           Amen.

           Antonio gives the bread - now the Eucharist - to The 
           Girl, holding it in front of her mouth.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        The body of Christ.

           But rather than eat it, The Girl’s mouth stays closed.  
           She blinks.  Turns and looks up at the men.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                              (quietly)
                        Take it.  Take it and be cleansed.

           Karl TRANSLATES as Antonio still holds it out.  The Girl 
           just stares, everyone wondering if she’ll accept it.  
           Finally...

           She opens her mouth and takes the Eucharist.

           A silence, then.

                                 THE GIRL
                        Wodny.

           There’s a chipped crystal glass filled with water nearby.  
           Karl holds it for The Girl.

           She drinks.  Then her eyes shut.

           Her chest lowers and falls.

                                 ANTONIO
                              (whispers)
                        Bene.

           Antonio motions for them all to leave.  They exit..

           Just The Girl now.  We hold on this shot as the men’s 
           footsteps die out.

           The Girl COUGHS.  Then spits up...

           The Eucharist.  It never made it past her mouth.

                                                            MOVE TO:
           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Matt’s just turned on his camera.  Everyone else seems to 
           be asleep but an odd RUSTLING can be heard. 

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        What is that...?

           He picks up a small monitor in one hand, turns it on, 
           groans...

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Glorified baby monitor.

           ON THE MONITOR is a night vision shot of The Girl.  A red 
           button announces she is being recorded.  He zooms in 
           closer on the monitor --

           -- As The Girl sits up faster than seems possible.

                                 MATT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Whoa!

           Now she MUMBLES something indecipherable.  

           Matt’s hand clicks on the monitor, turns up the levels of 
           the mic with a slight HISS.

           The Girl is on all fours now, MUMBLES again.

           She begins to sniff at the ground.  Snuffles around like 
           a pig after a truffle.

                                 MATT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        ...Hell she doing?

           The MUMBLING continues.  Matt turns the volume controls 
           to maximum, it HISSES away.

           She looks right into the monitor as if she can see him.  
           Opens her mouth...

           And SCREEAAMMMS!  Amazingly loud, BLOWING out the mic!

                                 MATT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Jeez!

           The ROARING echoes through the house.  Around Matt OTHER 
           sounds are heard as the house wakes up. 

           Leslaw’s Son begins to CRY, FOOTSTEPS on the stairs.

           Matt pans to see Antonio.  Karl not far behind.

                                 ANTONIO
                        What is it?

           ON THE MONITOR: The Girl begins to SNORT.  Strange 
           PORCINE noises.

                                 KARL
                        I’ll go down there.

           Karl leaves.

           Antonio picks up the monitor.  Concerned.

           Now Karl appears on the monitor’s screen, moving toward 
           The Girl.

           INT. BASEMENT - SAME

           Karl stops, he is looking at something we can’t see.  
           Finally...

                                 KARL
                        ...Father Antonio!?  Come quick, 
                        you must see this! 

           INT. BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Handheld shot of the dirt floor.  Small stains are here, 
           hard to make out.  Antonio and Karl are looking around.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        We couldn’t see what she was doing 
                        in the dark.

           Matt zooms out and we realize blood stains are all over 
           the floor.  A two-foot deep hole with a few stray black 
           fingernails can be glimpsed as well. 

                                 KARL
                        She was digging?

           Matt moves again, now to The Girl.  See her fingers are 
           bleeding.  Antonio is here inspecting them when -- 

           The Girl turns her head.  Opens her mouth --  

           And with amazing speed she CHOMPS down on Antonio’s index 
           finger!

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Father!

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The Girl puts up a fight.  Like a pitbull she won’t 
           release her lock on Antonio’s finger.  Karl puts her in a 
           head hold, surprised by her strength.

           She releases Antonio’s finger, then easily tosses the old 
           priest down, begins to strangle him!

           Matt DROPS the camera and runs to help.

           Camera lays on its side filming Karl, Antonio and now 
           Matt wrestling The Girl.  The men SHOUT to each other, 
           The Girl makes those inhuman pig-noises.

           Together they manage to pin The Girl (barely).

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        ...She’s so strong!  Heavy!

           Antonio squeezes out of the fight.

           Holding his badly bleeding finger, he hurries upstairs.

                                 KARL
                        Where you go?!

           Karl and Matt are barely holding their own against The 
           Girl, both men perspiring, BREATHING hard.

           Wooden pallets under The Girl’s bed CRACK from her 
           incredible strength.  She’s getting free when...

           ...Antonio hurries back into frame.  He holds a small 
           leather case in one hand, a barely-filled syringe in the 
           other.  

                                 ANTONIO
                        Hold her.

                                 KARL
                        You think so?!
                              (then)
                        ...Sorry.

           Antonio injects her as The Girl ROARS - the voice is 
           chilling, sounds as if it comes from a wild animal.

                                 ANTONIO
                        She will be out quickly.

           But to the men’s surprise, she keeps struggling, now 
           holding all three men at bay.

           Antonio shakes his head in disbelief.  He refills the 
           syringe, just a fifth of the way.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        I’ll give her a little more...

                                 KARL (O.S.)
                        Don’t we need a doctor for this?!

                                 MATT
                        ...He is a doctor!

           Antonio preps the needle.

                                 ANTONIO
                        ...Enough for a two hundred and 
                        fifty pound man!  Any more could 
                        kill her.

           He injects The Girl.

           Finally she relaxes.  Still MUMBLING, her face goes 
           slack, eyes roll up.

           Leslaw enters frame as the Priests carefully release The 
           Girl.  They’re sweating, breathing harder than she is.

           Leslaw scowls at the Priests.  He moves to that cement 
           pillar.

           Holds up the chain.

           Matt SIGHS when he sees it.  Antonio is forced to nod as 
           Leslaw re-fastens it...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAWN

           The sun is coming up.

           Antonio has bandaged his finger, some blood has leaked 
           through.  Karl seems unharmed but Matt holds his own 
           fingers in front of the lens, they are bandaged as well.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        You okay?

                                 KARL
                        My back is sore.

                                 ANTONIO
                         Let me see.

           His front to Matt, Karl untucks his undershirt, lifts up 
           the rear.  Antonio steps behind him.

           The old priest’s eyes register surprise.  He hurries by 
           Matt and off.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 KARL
                        What?  What is it...?

                                 ANTONIO (O.S.)
                        Wait there.

           He faces Matt and we see that...

           Deep red scratches graph Karl’s entire back!  Hell’s own 
           road map, it’s horrible.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Shit...!

                                 KARL
                        What?!

           Karl wipes off a dusty mirror and checks his injuries, 
           staring in shock.

           Antonio returns with his small medical kit.  Takes out a 
           bottle of rubbing alcohol. 

                                 ANTONIO
                        This is going to...

                                 KARL
                              (still staring)
                        Yeah.

           Antonio rubs the alcohol onto cotton, then onto Karl’s 
           back.  He’s too dazed to wince.

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        How’d that happen?  Without 
                        ripping my shirt...?

           Antonio shakes his head he doesn’t know.  

           He looks to Matt, motions to turn off the camera and it 
           abruptly cuts out...

                                                             CUT TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Sun comes through the torn curtains, dust in the air.  A 
           girl sits on the couch, this is NIKA, the goth-looking 
           sixteen-year-old from the photo collage.  She wears a 
           heavy crucifix.

           Her MOTHER sits nearby, a local, eyeing the proceedings 
           with disapproval.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Karl sits next to Nika, his mind elsewhere.  Antonio is 
           in the chair facing her.

           Nika speaks to Karl in Polish, she sounds defensive and 
           combative.

                                 KARL
                              (relays)
                        She says she doesn’t know why 
                        you’ve called her here.  Didn’t do 
                        anything.  Cannot help us.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Nika doesn’t speak English?

                                 KARL
                        Not a word.

                                 ANTONIO
                              (casually)
                        Oh?  Then take her outside and 
                        slap her in the mouth a few times.

           You can almost hear the air leave the room.  Nika’s eyes 
           go wide, shaking her head.  Her Mother seems to not have 
           understood.

                                 NIKA
                        No, no!

                                 ANTONIO
                              (chuckles)
                        Oh, you understood that, eh? 

           Nika looks caught.  Puts on a heavy accent...

                                 NIKA
                        My English not so good.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Then this will be practice.

           Nika nods to Antonio, a little impressed with him.  She 
           lights a cigarette.  Offers one to each of the priests.  
           They refuse.  Then Antonio reconsiders...

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        Alright.
                              (explains to group)
                        ...Twenty years in Rome.

           She lights one, touches it to Antonio’s cigarette.  
           Slightly sexual.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 KARL
                        You know, I think I will have one 
                        too.

           Without looking, Nika tosses Karl the lighter.

                                 ANTONIO
                        She is your good friend, yeah?

           Nika’s English and accent are better than she first 
           admitted...

                                 NIKA
                        Since we were babies.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Her father, Leslaw.  Anything she 
                        might have told you about him?
                              (off her confusion)
                        Anything she might have confided 
                        in you but no one else?

           Nika shrugs, still confused.  Shakes her head.  Antonio 
           moves on.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        The changes in your friend - they 
                        were gradual.  When did you first 
                        notice them?

                                 NIKA
                              (quietly)
                        After our trip.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Trip?

           Nika looks back to her mother, frightened.

                                 NIKA
                        To the catacombs.

           At this, her Mother perks up, somehow understanding.  
           Begins QUESTIONING her daughter in Polish.  Grilling her, 
           pissed off.

           Antonio looks to Karl...

                                 KARL
                        Her mother is saying she should 
                        know better than to go there.  It 
                        is a very old place...
                              (trying to keep up)
                        Ancient superstitions about it - 
                        older than the gypsies...

           CONTINUED: (3)

           Nika now PLEADS to her mother in Polish.

           Her Mother answers her, the volume in the room rising to 
           a fever pitch...

           Antonio almost rolls his eyes, cuts in on them...

                                 ANTONIO
                        Enough!  
                              (they stop, to Nika)
                        Why were you down there?

                                 NIKA
                        ...We just went to look.  

                                 ANTONIO
                        I know there is something you are 
                        not telling me.  What is it?
                              (she still protests)
                        I’m not going to get you in 
                        trouble - I give you my word as a 
                        priest.

           Nika pauses.  Then quiet and serious, like confession...

                                 NIKA
                        I’m afraid of what lives down 
                        there.  Of crossing it - that it 
                        would find me.

                                 ANTONIO
                        And what is it that lives there?

           Nika is silent.  Antonio changes his tone.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        Nika, it is a modern age.  Science 
                        and religion can coexist.  There 
                        is an explanation for everything, 
                        barely any miracles anymore.   
                        Nothing to be afraid of.

           Nika breathes.  Even something seductive in the way she 
           looks at Antonio.  

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        What happened in the catacombs?

           As her Mother’s eyes bore into her.

                                 NIKA
                        I saw my friend... Floating.  Off

           But to everyone’s surprise, Antonio SNAPS his fingers, 
           energized by this.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Now we’re getting somewhere...

                                                             CUT TO:

           EXT. TOWN STREETS - DAY

           Overcast sky.  Bad weather is rolling in.

           Nika stands over a manhole cover, PRIES it off with a 
           lever as Antonio looks on.

                                 NIKA
                        ...This is how she was told to do 
                        it.

           Nika nods to Antonio before turning and hurrying to her 
           Mother, waiting nearby.

           Her Mother looks pissed off, grabs Nika’s shoulder and 
           steers her away without a word.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        And there they go.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Just as well.

           It starts to rain.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        Karl said this was an old mining 
                        town.  Methane leaks.  If the 
                        gasses came up through the home’s 
                        dirt floor it could lead to 
                        hallucinations, affected those 
                        nearby into seeing things - 
                        strange colors, levitation...

           Matt moves to the sewer hole and looks...  

           A ladder leads down into darkness. 

           Then a RAINDROP falls on his lens.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Starting to rain.

                                 ANTONIO
                        That won’t matter where we’re 
                        going.

           As Antonio prepares to climb in...

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        You’re kidding, right?

                                                            MOVE TO:

           INT. BASEMENT - SAME

           It’s quiet.  Only the HUM of that naked bulb.  Alone, The 
           Girl sits up in bed.  Stares off.  

           That lone bulb begins to HUM louder.

                                                            MOVE TO:

           INT. SEWER TUNNEL

           A light shines from the camera, illuminating Antonio from 
           the back.   

           Bits of garbage are strewn around, old candles,  bottles.  
           Rodents SCAMPER in the shadows, fighting over something.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Should be just up ahead.

                                                             CUT TO:

           EXT. CATACOMBS - MOMENTS LATER

           Matches the collage photo.  A mix of cement and ancient 
           rock gives a grim color palette to the area.  There’s an 
           entrance to an older tunnel, five feet high and narrow. 

           At the entrance, Antonio looks back at Matt.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Wait...

           But Antonio disappears inside.  Matt comes up to the 
           entrance, points in...

           INT. CATACOMBS, MOUTH - CONTINUOUS

           Almost blackness.  Moving inside, the camera searches for 
           light.  Sounds of nearby WATER.  An image comes back up 
           showing a rock floor, we can hear Matt’s BREATHING.

           Matt moves through a very narrow opening...

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Tight space.

           It’s said with a bit of a stutter, as if he’s getting 
           claustrophobic. 

           The space ends and Matt breathes a sigh of relief.  He 
           pans up to show the high natural roof of this cave.

           Antonio is already up ahead.  

           A foreign Graffiti is scrawled on the walls and ceilings 
           in an odd, faded paint.  Matt pauses to notice. 

                                 ANTONIO
                        Film all this, the Holy Father 
                        will wish to see it.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Any clue what it says?

           But Antonio doesn’t answer, keeps moving, already out of 
           sight.

                                 MATT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Okay...The language looks like 
                        Polish but - something’s different 
                        about it.

           There is a thin rivet of water cutting across the ground.  
           Matt straddles it on higher rocks.

           INT. CATACOMB PASSAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Matt comes to a low entrance into another passage.

           Camera goes dark as he moves inside, GRUNTING, BREATHING 
           HARD.

           Then, pinpoints of light appear.  Camera still pointed 
           low.  Now Matt’s footsteps make a CLINKING sound, then 
           AGAIN.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        ...What?

           Matt steadies himself, uses the camera’s light...

           INT. CATACOMB, TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

           A shot of the ground reveals: coins.

           They litter the ground far as the eye can see, not a 
           patch of earth or rock visible...

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        ...Thousands of them!

           Matt searches the room, finds Antonio, his back and 
           slight right profile to us.

                                 MATT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Father Antonio?

                                 ANTONIO
                              (dreamlike)
                        Nika said they just came here to 
                        look...

           Matt pans to see what Antonio is staring at:

           Something on the wall, blurry...

           It takes a minute for Matt to focus, then reveal we’re 
           close on a - 

           HORRIBLE SHADOW FIGURE

           Whether this SHADOW MAN is burned into the rock by man or 
           a natural acheropite it’s hard to say.  The antithesis of 
           discovering an image of the Virgin Mary.

           Matt comes up to Antonio, asks:

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        It’s so... unique.
                              (then)
                        The coins?  Why?

                                 ANTONIO
                        Wishes.  You come here, give the 
                        money as an offering...  Gray 
                        witchcraft. 

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        What do the people wish for?

                                 ANTONIO (O.S.)
                              (tosses coin)

                        It is very, pagan.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Poor town like this and no one 
                        steals them?

           INT. BASEMENT - SAME TIME

           The room’s naked bulb HUMS louder, flickering.  

           Once, twice.

           Then it EXPLODES with a POP.

           It’s dim, though some light still comes through the trap 
           door.  

           FOOTSTEPS upstairs / off screen as Karl has obviously 
           heard....

                                 KARL (O.S.)
                        Aw...
                              (calls out)
                        Leslaw?

           Karl YELLS a few more words in Polish.  Gets no answer 
           from Leslaw.

           INT. BASEMENT - MINUTES LATER

           FOOTSTEPS as Karl TROMPS down, holding a light bulb, 
           still in its package.

           Karl steps in, lets his eyes adjust.

           He approaches The Girl.

           She STIRS.  Karl hesitates.  

           He gets to the bulb.  With his bandaged hand he unscrews 
           it.

           Karl carefully picks the bulb out, puts in the new one, 
           tries to screw it in...

                        road.

           No luck.  He turns it again - CRACK!  The bulb breaks in 
           his bandaged hand!

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        Ah!

           Karl shakes out his hand, bleeding from the glass.

           Behind him, The Girl opens her eyes.

           It’s a moment before he senses it, turns to her as... 

           Above him - Oddly, the prodded open trap door rattles, 
           then - SLAMS SHUT!

           With a THUNK the world is blackness.

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

           SFX of a panicking Karl trying to find his way to the 
           stairs.  

           The shot CLICKS to night vision and we can see Karl stop, 
           trying to get his bearings, when...

           ANOTHER SOUND is heard - SCURRYING.

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        Hello?!

           Something else in the room.  More scurrying.

           We hear / barely see Karl TRIP.  Really beginning to lose 
           it now...

                        Hey - Upstairs!  HELP!  OPEN THE 
                        DOOR!

           To his left and to his right, SOMETHING is SCURRYING 
           around Karl -- The camera can’t see it, can barely see 
           him.

           As the SCURRYING builds to a crescendo...

           Karl runs blindly in the opposite direction, TOWARD The 
           Girl’s bed.

           BLACKNESS

           Hold on this for a few beats.  

           And then the frame goes WHITE.

           The aperture adjusts, we are in...

           INT. BASEMENT

           Light from the just-opened trap door reveals a FIGURE 
           huddled in the corner.  

           It’s Karl.  The Girl seems to be sleeping but is poised 
           at Karl’s ear - as if she has been whispering in it.

           Antonio and Matt practically jump down the stairs.  Rush 
           to him.

                                 MATT
                         Karl!  Are you alright?

           Karl uncurls, his words seem to take too long.  Thousand 
           yard stare.

                                 KARL
                        I was - dreaming.

                                 ANTONIO
                        ...Dreaming?

           Karl nods, remembering something...

                                 KARL
                        Bad dreams of my little sister.  
                        She looked like...
                              (looks over)
                        The Girl.

           Looking a bit lost himself, Antonio tries to comfort.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Just a dream.  Nothing to worry 
                        about.

                                 KARL
                        It took her.  The thing took my 
                        sister as well.

                        He’s had a shock.

           Antonio motions and Matt helps Karl up.

           Then Antonio looks back at Karl, tries to give him some 
           encouragement.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        Father Matt and I will take it 
                        from here.  And we won’t leave you 
                        again.  You go upstairs and rest.  

           Karl nods, looks up at the skylight.  Begins moving up.

           Antonio turns and looks at The Girl, her eyes still 
           closed.

           She shifts a bit, as if in a dream.

           INT. BASEMENT, FAR CORNER - MOMENTS LATER

           As far as Matt and Antonio can get from The Girl and 
           still be in the basement.  Antonio looks at Matt.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        What is it?

           Antonio paces, looking nervous and pained.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Karl shouldn’t have been alone 
                        with it.  Never be alone with 
                        it...

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Father...?

                                 ANTONIO
                              (finally)
                        There is a demon here.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        What?!  You’re sure?

           Antonio nods, paces.  We can hear Matt’s BREATHING.

           Matt SIGHS, worried.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MATT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to need help, right?

                                 ANTONIO
                        We are the help.

           Antonio opens his coat, we catch a glimpse of a scarf-
           wrapped box he gingerly touches it.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        I will begin a fast.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        So, that’s our plan...?

                                 ANTONIO
                        The black fast, to do an Exorcism.  
                        A true exorcism.

           From his bag Antonio finds what he’s been looking for, a 
           small medal.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        Saint Benedict.  
                              (turns it over)
                        Only Catholic medal with an 
                        Exorcism prayer on the back.  
                        Carry him with you.

           He hands the medal to Matt who reaches out and takes it.

           He SIGHS as if to say “that’s our plan?”

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Okay, okay but - have you dealt 
                        with this kind of thing before, a - 
                        real one?

                                 ANTONIO
                              (nods, quietly)
                        Don’t tell Karl, but once - Back 
                        in Norway.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Norway?  Wait - Not the Oslo Case?

           Antonio gives a slight nod...

                                 MATT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        The possessed kid?  Went on for 
                        months but - the priests won, 
                        right?  They defeated it, got the 
                        demon out... 
                              (Antonio nods)

                        But I thought that was in the 
                        1950’s.  How could you have...

           Antonio looks right at Matt, struggles to say...

                                 ANTONIO
                        I was the boy.

                                                            MOVE TO:

           INT. BASEMENT, STAIRS - MINUTES LATER

           Back in front of The Girl’s bed, Matt fiddles with the 
           chain bulb.  He clears the broken glass out as Antonio 
           waits with him.

           Very little light comes through the trapdoor and Matt and 
           Antonio are silhouettes.

           The Girl can be heard SNORING lightly.  The CLINK of her 
           chain.

           Matt replaces the bulb and CLICKS it on, revealing...

           GRAFFITI now covers the walls and ceiling - the exact 
           style as at the cave!

           Both men try to hide their shock.

                                 MATT
                        What language is it?  

                                 ANTONIO
                        Not sure - it’s written right to 
                        left.

                                 MATT
                        I could get a mirror...

           Antonio looks at The Girl with pointed disgust.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Don’t bother.  I don’t care what 
                        it has to say.

           Matt turns on his camera.  Antonio takes out his bible, 
           kicks the bed - ready to confront the demon. 

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        Wake up.

           Now The Girl does wake - but she is very animated, 
           looking around, scared. 

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           When she speaks her voice is normal - the voice of a 
           regular sixteen-year-old girl. 

                                 THE GIRL
                        Pomagaja mnie!

           Antonio looks at Matt, seems a little confused.

           The Girl continues to rant, rapid fire, begging.

                                 THE GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Pomagaja - Pomagaja mnie!

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        I think she’s asking for our 
                        help...

           SCURRYING is heard, far off but COMING CLOSER...

                                 ANTONIO
                        Where is that?

                                 MATT  (O.S.)
                        What is that?!

           The Girl BEGS for another instance as the SCURRYING 
           approaches the bed --

           Then it abruptly cuts out as The Girl’s body jumps, jerks 
           up, shaking faster than seems possible.

           She lies still.  

                                 MATT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        What’s happened...?

                                 ANTONIO
                        Shh.

           The Girl opens her eyes - Matt ZOOMS IN to see they are 
           now darker, something reptilian about them.

           Now The Girl speaks, her voice is man-ish but not 
           especially deep - 

                                 THE GIRL
                        Wy mieliscie pozna uzna mni.

           - the voice rings with a metallic depth, every syllable 
           grates at the tiny body uttering it.  Every sentence 
           damaging the vessel that contains this thing.

           Antonio is trying not to show any emotion, almost 
           succeeds.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ANTONIO
                        Ah, there you are.

           The Girl begins to CHUCKLE in an odd, GRATING VOICE.

           She doesn’t stop.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        What now?

           Now Antonio looks at Matt, almost scolding Matt in a 
           harsh whisper...

                                 ANTONIO
                        Now?  Now we treat the demon like 
                        a naughty child with a temper 
                        tantrum.  We show it that our 
                        faith is stronger than its damn 
                        circus act. 
                              (then)
                        There is a poor innocent girl deep 
                        in there  - you heard her BEGGING 
                        for our help - and without it she 
                        will most certainly die.
                              (then)
                        The threat is not to us.  It is 
                        the demon, not us who should be 
                        worried.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Do we need anything from the local 
                        Church?  Holy water?

                                 ANTONIO
                        I carry my own.

           The Girl smiles at them, she’s ready.

           Antonio meets her eyes.

                                                           SMASH CUT:

           INT. BASEMENT - LATER

           Matt and Antonio are by the bed, in the middle of their 
           exorcism.  The Girl is HOWLING - the sounds are not 
           feminine or even human.

           Matt clutches that wooden crucifix as Antonio holds a 
           heavy book, reciting the ancient exorcism rite - The 
           Rituale Romanum.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ANTONIO
                        ...instigator of envy, font of 
                        avarice, fomenter of discord, 
                        author of pain and sorrow...

           Suddenly, 1950’s MUSIC BLARES from that workbench radio.  
           The Volume INCREASES...

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                              (shouting)
                        ...Why then do you stand and 
                        resist, knowing as you must that 
                        Christ the Lord brings your plans 
                        to nothing? 

           Matt moves to the radio and YANKS the plug out.  

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        Fear Him, who in Isaac was offered 
                        in sacrifice, in Joseph sold into 
                        bondage, slain as the paschal 
                        lamb, crucified as man...

           As Antonio makes the sign of the cross The Girl SPEAKS a 
           sentence in Latin.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                              (ignores her)
                        Yet triumphed over all the powers 
                        of hell...

           AGAIN - The Girl SPEAKS another sentence in Latin.

                                 MATT
                        She just...?

                                 ANTONIO
                        Corrected me in Latin.

           The MUSIC again blares from the radio...

           Matt SMASHES it into pieces.

           Antonio frowns, speaks louder...

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        Lord heed my prayer...

                              (reading)
                        ...And let my cry be heard by you.

                        Father and the Holy Spirit, God, 
                        forever and ever.

                                 MATT
                        Amen.

           The Girl holds up something, it’s the photo of Karl’s 
           sister.  The blood has dried, obscuring the face.  

           She SPEAKS, it’s only a whisper.  Karl smiles, leans in 
           to hear her repeat...

                                 THE GIRL
                        ...Nastepny.

           Matt yanks the picture from her and pockets it.

                                                             CUT TO:

           CLOSE SHOT OF A RIGHT HAND - SAME TIME

           - Liver spots and wrinkles on it.  The edges of a peeled 
           off bandage.  A smooth left hand enters frame, the 
           difference in age is startling.

                                 KARL (O.S.)
                        It’s... aged.

           Realize Karl is using his own camera, balanced on his 
           stomach, he lowers both hands, revealing he is in...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           We can HEAR the Exorcism distantly, whether it’s coming 
           from the baby monitor or through the floor is unclear.

           In the B.G. the TV quietly comes on, playing snow.  Karl 
           doesn’t seem to notice, then --

           A KNOCK on the front door and Karl jumps.

                                 KARL (O.S.)
                        Halo?

           The KNOCK comes again, POUNDING now...

           Karl rises, turns off his camera.

                                                            MOVE TO:
           INT. BASEMENT  - SAME TIME

           Antonio continues...

                                 ANTONIO
                        ...Give place to the Holy Spirit 
                        by this sign of the holy cross of 
                        our Lord Jesus Christ...

           Antonio ignores this all, picks up the holy water.  

           Antonio blesses The Girl with it and she SCREAMS!

                                 THE GIRL
                        Gdzie jest Mój Chiopiec?  Mój 
                        Chiopiec?!

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        What’s she saying?  Is she looking 
                        for something...?

                                 KARL
                              (shakes head)
                        When we go upstairs we’ll ask 
                        Father Karl.

                                                            MOVE TO:

           INT. POLICE CAR, MOVING - DUSK

           That lower-quality camera comes on and takes in the 
           surroundings.  TWO POLICEMEN are in the front seat of 
           this small vehicle.

           Camera rides in silence for a moment.  Then Karl’s voice 
           is heard.

                                 KARL (O.S.)
                              (whispers)
                        This would be fun under different 
                        circumstances.  They have 
                        something they want to show me but 
                        won’t tell what.

           The car slows.  A CROWD is up ahead.

           It pulls over.

                                                            BACK TO:

           INT. BASEMENT - SAME TIME

           Antonio and Matt are continuing with their exorcism.

           The Girl COUGHS.

           Keeps COUGHING.  Antonio stops speaking as Matt edges 
           closer.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Careful, a trick.

                                 MATT
                              (suddenly realizes)
                        No trick - she’s got something 
                        caught in her throat!

           Matt moves closer to The Girl.

                                                            MOVE TO:

           EXT. SLUM, GARBAGE DUMP - SAME TIME

           Outskirts of the area.  Karl exits the squad car along 
           with the two Policemen, both milling around. 

           Karl is now looking at the back of a CROWD, separated 
           from the garbage dump by a high fence.  Among the 
           townspeople, Nika’s Mother can be seen.

           Karl moves around the townspeople, gets to an opening in 
           the fence to allow vehicles in as --

           -- The flashing lights of an ambulance ROAR through the 
           gate, almost clips him!

                                 KARL (O.S.)
                        Woah!

           Karl zooms in to follow the vehicle...

           The Girl HACKS...

                        I’m going to reach in and get it.

           Antonio raises his bandaged finger:

                                 ANTONIO
                        Not a good idea!

                                 MATT
                        She’ll choke if I don’t...

           The Girl opens her mouth, showing teeth, stains of blood.

           The hint of a grin on her face.

           EXT. REFUSE DUMP - SAME TIME

           Karl is zooming in on one of the big piles of trash.

           We hear MURMURS in Polish from the surrounding crowd.

           Our POV searches - sees EMERGENCY WORKERS gathered around 
           a SHAPE in the trash.  Hard to make it out...

                                                            BACK TO:

           INT. BASEMENT - SAME TIME

           Matt’s bandaged fingers are right in front of The Girl’s 
           mouth.  Hesitates.  

           Then he BREATHES DEEP and reaches in with his finger...

                                 ANTONIO
                        ...Don’t!

           The Girl meets Matt’s eyes.  

           Matt takes a breath, reaches in further.

                                 MATT
                        Got it...

           From deep in her throat, Matt pulls out a dark clump of a 
           knotted, vaguely metallic substance.  The Girl HACKS and 
           COUGHS UP more - building a black pile the stuff...  

           Like the floodgates have been released she keeps 
           COUGHING, HACKING UP pounds and pounds of it. 

           Matt backs up and films the sickly pile - an impossible 
           amount. 

           The Girl gives a final COUGH -- Then seems to breathe 
           again.

                                 MATT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        She’s ok...

           Matt puts what he first took out of her throat in front 
           of the lens.  Picks a tiny section off the mysterious 
           clump.

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                        What is it?

           Matt dips his fingers in that nearby glass of water.  
           Rubs the black bile until it shines - finally realizes 
           what he’s holding...

           An ancient coin.

           EXT. REFUSE DUMP - SAME TIME

           TIGHT SHOT of that garbage.  Muted colors, still can’t 
           make out what the Emergency Workers are gathered 
           around...

           Until they move it and SOMETHING rolls out...

                                 KARL (O.S.)
                        Oh God...!

           NIKA’S BODY tumbles from the pile.

           As the workers cover her face...

                                 KARL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Shit.  Shit, you bastard...!

           Karl’s swearing continues, now in Polish...

           INT. LIVING ROOM, COUCH - NIGHT

           The three are reunited.  Antonio watches Karl pace, 
           nervous and unfocused.

           Camera catches Matt’s arm for a moment, the Saint 
           Benedict medal is looped around it now.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        ...But how could it kill her?  
                        Without leaving the basement?

                                 KARL
                        Same way she left her room.  The 
                        police said Nika committed suicide 
                        but I know it got to her!  How 
                        long until she gets to us?

           Karl stops, takes a breath.  Matt lowers the camera long 
           enough to dig in his pocket.

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                        Karl?  Found this downstairs...

           He hands an object over to Karl - the photo of his 
           sister.

                                 MATT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Must have fallen out of your 
                        pocket, when you were...

           Matt trails off.  Doesn’t feel like remembering.

           Karl’s concern begins to build.

                                 KARL
                        The Girl had this?
                              (building)
                        She touched it, remember?  She 
                        was, fascinated with it.

           Matt pipes back in, sounds awkward.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Karl?  She said something - What 
                        does... Nas-tepny mean?

                                 KARL
                        It means, next.

           Karl gets up.

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        Next!  Kill her next - like she 
                        did that Nika girl!?  Or take her 
                        over next...?  
                              (realizing)
                        Oh, God.  I invited it - Invited 
                        it to visit my sister...

           Antonio tries to hide his reaction as Matt asks -

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Invited?

                                 ANTONIO
                        An old belief that a demon has to 
                        be welcomed in.  It is not 
                        something that you have to worry 
                        about, father...

                                 KARL
                        How would you know?!

           Antonio moves to answer.  But he stops, holds his tongue.

           Karl shakes his head looks at both men, something they’re 
           not telling him.  Adds something else.

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        My sister, she isn’t even 
                        Baptized.

           Suddenly the TV BLARES on.

           Matt moves to unplug it but Karl KICKS IN THE SCREEN!

           Antonio yells with a voice that could shake the walls...

                                 ANTONIO
                        Enough!   Father Karl you will 
                        control yourself!

           The TV sparks once more, dead.  All three men take a 
           breath.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Look, we shouldn’t even be 
                        listening to the demon, right?  
                        What it says are all lies meant 
                        to...

                                 KARL
                        We FAILED - Failed that Nika girl.  
                        Promised her she was safe but 
                        couldn’t protect her.  
                              (desperate)
                        How can we beat a demon...?

           Antonio cuts in.

                                 ANTONIO
                        I heard the victim.  She was 
                        begging for help.  We have to 
                        rescue her.

           Matt nods, but Karl is still reeling.

           Karl shakes his head, leaves the room.  Antonio lets him 
           go, looks to Matt.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        One hour and we resume our work.  

           With both hands, Antonio holds up that scarf-wrapped box.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        And - I will have something else 
                        to use against it.

           Karl looks at the box and EXHALES.  Getting nowhere he

           Antonio takes a breath.

                                 ANTONIO
                        It is a thing of another realm, no 
                        motivations we can assign to it or 
                        understand.  The best I can say is 
                        it’s kind are the opposite of what 
                        life is - thriving on destruction 
                        and hate.  
                              (then)
                        But what this one wants?  I don’t

           INT. KITCHEN

           Karl is sitting by himself.  Absentmindedly he picks up 
           the little monitor.

           Something wrong with it, he shakes it.

           Noticing Matt is filming him, Karl holds up the monitor.

                                 KARL
                        Hey Matt, what did I do?

           Karl holds up the monitor - it shows a black, though not 
           off, screen.

           Matt comes up to the monitor, reaches out a hand.

                        The basement camera’s still

                        covering it.

           Leslaw has stumbled into frame.  Drunk, SHOUTING for his 
           son.

                        But - why’d she use it?

           Karl shrugs, turns to the matter at hand.

                                 KARL
                        I go find your camera.

           Karl leaves for the basement.

           Leslaw almost trips over a few stray toys.  Now SHOUTS 
           louder, angrier.

           INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Karl hurries down the stairs, begins poking around for 
           where the camera just was.  The Girl lies silent.

           Karl slows as he sees her, hesitant to get too close.

           KITCHEN - SAME TIME

           Matt is playing with the monitor.

           He rolls the small toggle -- 

           ON MONITOR: It ZIPS back in time to when the camera had 
           feed and an image comes up, of --

           The Girl in bed.

           Then, she looks up, moves her head...  

           A moment later something comes CLUMPING down the stairs --

           -- The boy’s toy fire truck.  Hitting every stair before 
           rolling to a stop at the bottom.  A YELL gets Matt to 
           turn to -

           INT. FRONT DOOR - THE PRESENT

           LESLAW, he has opened the front door.  YELLING into the 
           street...

                                 LESLAW
                        Chlopiec!

           We notice the fire truck is missing from the stray toys.

           PAN BACK TO MONITOR:

           ON SCREEN - THE PAST

           ...The truck rolls up and gently BUMPS The Girl’s bed.  
           Her eyes are shut.

           Now the Son appears at the top of the stairs.  He 
           hesitates.

           WITH KARL - THE PRESENT

           Near The Girl’s bed.  Keeping his distance.

           Antonio gazes down the stairs.  

                                 ANTONIO
                        Boy?!

           Then Antonio stops, realizing something...

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                              (quoting The Girl)
                        Boy - My Boy...

           Karl keeps searching, accidentally KICKS something.  
           Looks down and picks it up.

           The toy fire truck.

           ON SCREEN - THE PAST

           ...As the Son starts down the stairs.  

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Oh shit...

           Matt hits the toggle and ZIPS ahead...

           ON SCREEN

           The image JUMPS, too far and the Son disappears into thin 
           air.  Just The Girl remains.  Lying in the same position 
           as before.

           But subtly, her bed sheets look different, a blanket is 
           missing. 

           Matt GRUMBLES.  He rewinds and the feed ZIPS back 
           halfway.

           ON SCREEN - THE PAST

           The Son is now at the bottom of the stairs.  Right by The 
           Girl’s bed.  His truck just out of reach.

           He wants to approach.  Knows he’s not supposed to.

           The Girl opens her black eyes --

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        No - Don’t!

           Gingerly, the little boy takes a step forward.

           Puts his hand on his truck...

           WITH KARL AND ANTONIO - THE PRESENT

           In the basement, noticing...

                                 ANTONIO
                        The hole.  What is that?

           Karl looks at that hole The Girl dug.  It has been 
           covered by a blanket -- 

           -- A lump is there.

           INT. BY THE MONITOR / ON SCREEN - THE PAST

           INTERCUT between past and present as Matt watches The 
           Girl get out of bed and --

           -- Reveals her chain is longer than she’s led anyone to 
           believe --

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Playing us - She’s been playing us 
                        all along...!

           She moves behind the camera.

           In a moment the camera is airborne.  In another moment 
           the lens has been covered up.

           Matt BANGS the keyboard. In the B.G. Leslaw is still

                        Oh, no...

           Sweating, Matt toggles all the way, to the dark, present 
           feed shot...

           INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Antonio and Karl move toward the covered hole.  That 
           lump.

           The Girl ROARS, SHATTERING GLASS!

           The whole house seems to shake. -- Karl instinctively 
           jumps back but Antonio charges forward and --

           -- RIPS off the blanket.

           Matt watches as his dark screen comes to light...

           POV OF THE REMOTE CAMERA

           As the camera focuses on Antonio’s face.  A horrified 
           expression on it...

           The Girl can be heard LAUGHING.

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Mój Chlopiec!

                                 ANTONIO
                        ...Sweet Lord.

           Matt YELLS at his monitor...

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        What?  What do you see!?

           INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Lock off shot reveals that, under the camera, the body of 
           Leslaw’s son is curled in the hole.

           Antonio is already feeling the child’s pulse.

           Then Antonio shakes his head.

           SCREAMING as Leslaw nearly leaps down the stairs.  Runs 
           to the bed, no translation needed as he WAILS.

           The Girl LAUGHS louder, strokes the boy’s head, showing 
           him off.

                                 THE GIRL
                        Mój Chlopiec.

           Leslaw throws his arms around her neck - SQUEEZES!

           Antonio struggles to subdue Leslaw but the big man tosses 
           both of them - continues to throttle The Girl.

           A winded Antonio calls to Karl for help...

                                 ANTONIO
                        Stop him!

           Karl starts for Leslaw but freezes.  Doesn’t move to 
           subdue him.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                         He’ll kill her!  Karl - STOP HIM!

           But Karl - shakes his head.

           It look like Leslaw is about to kill her when --

           -- Matt runs in, sees something nearby, Antonio’s leather 
           case...

                                 MATT
                        Father!

           He tosses the case to Antonio who, still on the floor, 
           catches it deftly...

           ...Whips out the needle, barely preps it before JAMMING 
           it into Leslaw’s calf.

           Leslaw weakens.  Collapses.

           The Girl is silent for a moment.  Then begins to COUGH 
           and COUGH, miserable, her windpipe almost crushed...

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. BASEMENT - LATER

           The Girl’s arms and legs are being tied to the bed by 
           Matt.  He pulls the thick rope TIGHT...

           He hears YELLING far off.  Stops...

                                                            MOVE TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM, FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Camera comes on and heads for the open front door.  
           Antonio is there, waiting.  POLISH YELLING is heard from 
           the street.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                              (re: the yelling)
                        Leslaw?

                                 ANTONIO
                              (shakes head)
                        He’s run off.

           Antonio motions outside.  Curious, Matt keeps moving out 
           into the street.  Flips on the night vision:

           EXT. HOUSE / STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Camera zoom in to the end of the street to find Karl is 
           the one yelling.  He holds the covered body of the Boy in 
           his arms.  Seems to be going house to house.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                              (yells)
                        Karl!  Come back inside!

           Karl ignores Matt.  KICKS and BANGS on different doors. 

           No answer comes.

                                 MATT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                              (gently)
                        Karl?  C’mon man, there’s no one 
                        around.  This isn’t going to work.

           Karl just stands there.  It’s quiet, only the sound of 
           WIND.

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Antonio and Karl are on opposite side of the table.  Karl 
           looks rough.  Matt’s voice comes...

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        I put the boy up in his room.

                        Just us now.  Us and her.

           Karl slumps forward, already bad posture getting worse as 
           he speaks to Antonio.

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        The Kid - Nika.  Hell, two kids.  
                        We have blood from two bodies on 
                        our hands.  How many more? 

           Antonio speaks up. 

                                 ANTONIO
                        I think I know what you are 
                        suggesting -  It is terrible for 
                        so many reasons... including that 
                        if she dies - her soul could be 
                        dammed.

                                 KARL
                        I don’t believe that!  You believe 
                        your own shit?!  Damned?

                                 ANTONIO
                        If The Girl bears some 
                        responsibility for welcoming the 
                        Demon in, her soul could be damned 
                        forever.

           Karl gets in Antonio’s face.

                                 KARL
                        She’s laughing at us.  IT’S 
                        laughing at us!

           Antonio POUNDS the table making everyone jump.  He glares 
           at Karl.

                                 ANTONIO
                        There is a young, innocent girl in 
                        there.  Don’t you ever forget 
                        that.

           Pushed to his limit, Karl shakes his head.

                                 KARL
                        My sister is a young girl too.

                                                             CUT TO:
           INT. LIVING ROOM, COUCH

           Karl has jammed his few belongings into and on top of a 
           duffel bag.  Matt enters, sees this.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                         Karl?

                                 KARL
                        Sorry.  I must do this.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                              (already knows)
                        What?  What must you do?

                                 KARL
                        Drive back to Krakow.  Get my 
                        sister Baptized whether my asshole 
                        brother wants to or not.  

           Karl zips up his duffel, done packing.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        We - need you.

                                 KARL
                              (chuckles)
                        Doubt that.

           Something hits Karl.  Conscience or guilt.  He looks 
           physically weaker for a moment, near tears.

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        Matt - I’m sorry.  I’m...

           Karl’s voice trails off.

           Then he says no more, moves out the door.

                                                            FADE TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM, COUCH - NIGHT

           Antonio is on the couch.  A bottle of Leslaw’s homemade 
           vodka near him.  Antonio holds one of those crystal 
           glasses, light from a nearby lamp plays off it.

           Antonio turns the glass and the reflected light stretches 
           onto the nearest wall.  His mind is elsewhere as he plays 
           with it, lets the mesmerizing pattern climb and dance.

           Then Antonio finally says what’s on his mind.

           CONTINUED:

                                 ANTONIO
                        Are you going to leave, too?

           Matt seems surprised by the question.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        No.  No way - Not until this is 
                        done.

                                 ANTONIO
                        You’re sure?  Demons are shrewd 
                        and calculating.  Older than the 
                        human race.  I never recovered 
                        from the one that took me.  And, 
                        I’ll wager this one is stronger. 

           The glass shakes a little in Antonio’s grip.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        You were just a kid.  You’re 
                        stronger too...

                                 ANTONIO
                              (shakes head)
                        I am?  I should’ve been able to 
                        sense this demon but I failed to.  
                              (quietly)
                        Evil’s strongest weapon is 
                        disbelief and I was oblivious.  I 
                        didn’t recognize the threat until 
                        it was too late for Leslaw, his 
                        son and - Karl. 

           A moment before Matt answers, then...

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Maybe it’s not too late for us.

           Antonio is touched, nods.  Matt’s voice comes again.

                                 MATT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Father?  Is it time to head back 
                        down?

           Antonio takes a breath, an idea forming.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Besides your cameras, you brought 
                        some other equipment along, 
                        correct?

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        A few things...?

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ANTONIO
                        I thought I saw something that 
                        might help us...

                                                            MOVE TO:

           INT. BASEMENT - MINUTES LATER

           The trap door opens but adds almost no light at all. 

           The Girl begins CHUCKLING as Antonio and Matt, camera 
           capped and slung around his neck, come downstairs.  Her 
           voice is scratched and ruined.

                                 THE GIRL
                        Witamy powrót!

           Both priests are lugging something - those Lowel light 
           cases.  They open them, revealing camera lights and 
           stands.

           They quickly set them up on either side of The Girl.

                                 ANTONIO
                        That will do.

           Antonio CLICKS on his light.  So does Matt...

           And the basement is bathed in pure, white light.  It 
           floods over everything, seems to even change the air down 
           here.

           The Girl sneers at this, then tries to cover it with a 
           hollow LAUGH.  Both priests are unfazed.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        That’s better.  If you are ready 
                        father?
                              (Matt nods)
                        Let’s begin.

                                                             CUT TO:

           INT. BASEMENT - LATER

           In the middle of the exorcism.  The Girl is SCREAMING.  
           Antonio and Matt seem invigorated.

           The Girl ROARS and lashes out her hand --

           -- And ten feet away - a BLOODY RIP appears on Matt’s 
           shirt! 

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MATT
                              (I’m ok)
                        ...not deep!

           The Girl SLASHES the air again, this time hitting Antonio 
           in the stomach!

                                 ANTONIO
                        Enough tricks.

           Antonio takes out that scarf-wrapped box.  Suddenly The 
           Girl SHRIEKS IN PAIN --

           -- GLASS SHATTERS as a cellar window crumbles --

                                 THE GIRL
                        NO!

           Antonio unwraps the box.

                                 THE GIRL (CONT’D)
                        No - NO!

           The Girl writhes and SCREAMS.

           Opens it.  Even Matt is curious as Antonio takes out...

           A human bone.

                                 ANTONIO
                              (off Matt’ surprise)
                        A holy artifact.  The Vatican 
                        entrusted me with it.  Ordered me 
                        to always carry it.  
                              (then)
                        From the body of Saint Benedict.
                              (wry)
                        A bit pagan, perhaps...

           As Antonio moves it near The Girl, she SCREAMS...

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                              (reads, almost sings)
                        Do not remember o lord, our sins 
                        or those of our ancestors...

                                 MATT
                        And do not punish us for our 
                        offenses.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Our Father, who art in heaven...

           Antonio looks at Matt, motions and Matt says.:

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 MATT
                        ...Hallowed be thy name.

           Now both men together...

                                 ANTONIO AND MATT
                        Thy kingdom come, thy will be 
                        done...

           In fury The Girl rips through her bonds, rears up and 
           RUSHES at Antonio - CLANG - the chain stops her.

           The Priests continue their prayer, Antonio again shows 
           her the saint’s bone and she withers back from it.

           Matt looks at Antonio, they are winning.

           Antonio nods and they wrap up the prayer.  Now Antonio 
           starts on psalm fifty-three:

                                 ANTONIO
                        The fool hath said in his heart, 
                        their is no God.

           At this The Girl begins to climb the walls.

           She has a tortured, pained look.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        ...Corrupt are they and have...

           Antonio pauses for a moment, witnessing The Girl climbing 
           like a spider up the vertical wall, the chain taught.  

           Matt looks at Antonio, concerned.  He unslings his camera 
           and begins to film.

           CLOSER on The Girl, climbing.

           But Antonio only takes a step forward, reaches out his 
           free arm and casually gives the chain a yank - pulling 
           The Girl down off the wall --

           -- She CRASHES back onto the bed.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                              (continues on)
                        Corrupt are they and have done 
                        abominable iniquity.

           The Girl covers her ears and oddly, her mouth. 

           She looks exhausted.  Seems small and wounded.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                              (blurts)
                        YES!

           Matt realizes, stops himself.

           Antonio doesn’t give him a hard time, just motions to be 
           handed the wooden crucifix.

           The crucifix is removed and placed on The Girl’s 
           forehead.  She SCREAMS, trying to shake it off.

           Now The Girl WHINES, helpless. 

                                 ANTONIO
                              (breathes)
                         I see you now Demon.  In the 
                        light your evil is nothing.

           He begins to read again.

           She calms, twitching but passive for the moment.

           Matt takes an audible breath.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Did we do it?

           Antonio shakes his head but seems enthused.

                                 ANTONIO
                              (breathing hard)
                        Not quite yet.  But soon I think.  
                        We are strong enough!  
                              (then)
                        Time to prepare the Eucharist.  
                        Get bread and wine.

           Matt hurries upstairs, camera by his side as he goes.

           INT. LIVING ROOM / STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS

           On Matt’s feet as he comes up the stairs.  Almost trips 
           on those toys.

           Keeps moving.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Matt hurries past the table and into the kitchen.  His 
           camera at hip level as he rifles through the cupboards, 
           finding bread for the mass.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He’s oblivious as...

           A SHADOW falls across the floor!

           Matt fills his hands as the Shadow moves closer.

           Finally Matt sees the Shadow and freezes...

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        No, wait...!

           But the Shadow is upon him!  Camera DROPS on the ground, 
           the sounds of STRUGGLE.

           Then silence.  Only a CLINK as if a COIN has hit the 
           ground.

                                                           TO BLACK:

           INT. BASEMENT

           Lock off camera.  Antonio stands over The Girl.  Rosary 
           beads in hand.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Holy Mary, mother of God...

           FOOTSTEPS come down the stairs.

           Antonio pays them little attention at first.  Then...

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        Hurry - it’s time.

           That Shadow figure moves behind Antonio.  Still the 
           priest doesn’t turn.

           The Figure steps into the light...

           It’s Karl!  He’s a shell of his former self.  Eyes wide 
           and fearful.

           He holds Leslaw’s pistol in one hand.  Moves up on 
           Antonio.

           Finally Antonio turns and sees Karl.  Stares at him, 
           silent.

                                 KARL
                        Didn’t get.  Too far.

           Karl speaks quickly now, pained...

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        Wherever I drove she was ahead of 
                        me.  Floating in the road.  I 
                        tried Father - I just wanted to 
                        leave...

           Antonio looks at the pistol, lets Karl talk further.  The 
           man’s speech is erratic.

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        ...But she wouldn’t let me go.

           Antonio’s eyes fall on the blood on Karl’s face...

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        And I know - I KNOW, she won’t let 
                        my sister alone.  So fuck it, I’m 
                        just going to kill her.

                                 ANTONIO
                              (looking at the gun)
                        There is no need to be afraid...

                                 KARL
                        Bullshit!  We weren’t afraid 
                        enough!

           In one quick move, Karl yanks the holy artifact from 
           Antonio.

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        This is worthless!

                                 ANTONIO
                        No, Father!

           Karl POUNDS the artifact into dust!

           Antonio looks crushed.  Asks...

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        Where is Father Matt?

           At this a thought comes to Karl but he shakes it off.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                              (sternly)
                        Karl - What have you done with 
                        Father Matt?

           With the gun, Karl waves Antonio back toward the stairs.

                                 KARL
                        Go see.

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Then Karl looks to The Girl.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Don’t kill the child...

           Antonio is being backed toward the stairs now, trying in 
           vain to change Karl’s mind.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        We can beat it.  The evil inside 
                        this poor girl...

                                 KARL
                        Poor girl?!
                              (chuckles)
                        She - invited it in.  It told me.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Told you?

                                 KARL
                        She and Nika went to the 
                        catacombs.  Woke it up.  They had 
                        wishes to make.  
                              (then)
                        Know what the problem is with 
                        wishing?
                              (grins)
                        The things we wish on.  Once in a 
                        while, they make a wish of their 
                        own.

           Antonio is chilled.

                                 ANTONIO
                        What’s the wish?  What does it 
                        want?

           Karl looks like he wants to answer - about to speak.  But 
           suddenly, like a switch has been flipped, he looks over 
           at The Girl, raises his gun at Antonio --

           Karl grabs a hammer off the workbench as he backs Antonio 
           up the stairs and out of camera’s view.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        Please, Karl... Don’t do this.  I 
                        promise there is a way back.

                                 KARL (O.S.)
                        Not for me...

           The SLAM of the trap door.  A SCRAPE as Karl’s wedges it 
           shut with the hammer.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           FOOTSTEPS come back down the stairs and Karl re-enters 
           frame, alone.  He raises the gun...

           The Girl turns and looks at him.

                                                        SMASH CUT TO:

           THROUGH MATT’S TIPPED CAMERA - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           FOOTSTEPS hurry toward frame.  Antonio’s feet come into 
           view.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Father Matt!  

           Matt GROANS.  Begins to move around and Antonio helps him 
           to his feet, bringing the camera up with him.

                                                           SMASH CUT:

           INT. BASEMENT

           Karl has the pistol leveled at The Girl, takes the 
           crucifix off her forehead about to shoot her...  

           Then he freezes.  His face loses all expression.  Lowers 
           the gun.  

           Still as a statue he asks...

                                 KARL
                              (is that you?)
                         ...Lidia?

           Now Karl nods as if answering a question.  Hypnotically 
           begins to disassemble the gun.  

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Camera still slung around his neck, Matt is at the trap 
           door now, pulling hard.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        He wedged something in there!
                              (BANGS on it, then)
                        I’m going to take it off its 
                        hinges!

           Matt looks over, sees Antonio is looking at the baby 
           monitor.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Karl’s not moving.  
                              (quickly)
                        But she is!

                                                        MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. BASEMENT - SAME

           As The Girl gets on all fours.  Begins crawling for Karl.

           Inexplicably, she WHINNIES like a horse.

           She SNORTS, a LAUGH buried in the sounds...

           WITH MATT AND ANTONIO - SAME

           Matt has shaken off his camera and out of a corner of 
           frame we see both Priests working on the trap door with 
           tools - Matt gets one of the two hinges loose, Antonio 
           almost has his one free.

                                 ANTONIO
                        ...Karl!  Hold on, we’re coming!

           INT. BASEMENT - SAME

           The Girl comes to the edge of the bed, her still bound 
           hands keep her inches from Karl.  But then...

           The Girl FLIPS her body over, somehow leaving her hands 
           still tied but her head is now at the foot of the bed.

           Her tongue extends, long - then impossibly long.  It 
           licks Karl’s face.

           He squirms, but still hardly moves, hypnotized.

           The Girl looks right at us, at camera.

           And RIPS through her ropes!  Her hands make SICKLY 
           CRACKING noises but she doesn’t care

           IMAGE PIXILLATES - close on The Girl’s face, as...

           ...Her neck elongates.  Then even further, impossibly. 

           She withdraws her neck, smiles at her own trick...
           INT. LIVING ROOM / STAIRWAY

           -- As Matt finally gets the door off its hinges.

           He tosses it aside.  Runs down the stairs --

           ON THE GIRL

           She reaches out for what’s left of that leg chain and 
           swings it, SMASHING one of the soft lights!

           Karl seems to awaken.  She smiles, feeding off his fear 
           and realization.

                                 KARL
                        ...NO!

           SMASHES the second, plunging the world into darkness. 

           As Karl HOWLS --

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        Help!

           INT. BASEMENT, STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

            -- Matt charges into the pitch.

           INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           One of the soft lights is flickering - illuminating the 
           room for brief moments before going dark again.

           Matt hurries in, sees Karl is hysterical.  As the scene 
           goes dark we hear...

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Karl, I’m here now!  I’ll get you 
                        out...

           The soft light flickers to life again.  Matt looks at the 
           empty bed...

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Where is she?!

           The Girl is nowhere to be seen.  Karl shakes his head.

           Matt reaches to pull Karl to his feet as we pass back 
           into darkness.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           IN THE DARK:  Only SOUNDS of Matt heaving Karl toward the 
           stairs.  Then...

                                 MATT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Can’t see...

           The light flickers on.  Karl and Matt are grateful for 
           it.

           Unbeknownst to them, a SHADOW moves on the wall above, 
           touches the ceiling, as...

           THE GIRL side-shuffles across the upper wall!  Ten feet 
           off the ground!

           She edges closer as we go DARK.

                                 KARL
                        I hear her!

           The SOUND of SKITTERING.  LIGHT flickers on again and we 
           see Karl and Matt looking to where she just was.  Nothing 
           there.

           But in a flash, she has appeared perched at the other end 
           of the wall...

           Karl SCREAMS!

           DARKNESS - Karl YELLS louder --

           OUR POV

           The camera automatically SWITCHES to night vision in this 
           longer interval.  In green, the men are in the center of 
           our shot, trying to find their way to the stairs through 
           all that twisted junk, when...

           The Girl SKITTERS in from above - a lighter/colder glow 
           to her heat signature - now much closer to the hapless 
           men.

           She reaches out her arm for Karl, GRABS HIM AND -- 

           LIFTS HIM OFF HIS FEET!

                                 THE GIRL
                        Mój Chlopiec!

           -- Matt tries to pull Karl back, grabs his legs --

           Matt tries to fight off The Girl in this bizarre struggle 
           for Karl’s soul --

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           But The Girl wins, YANKING Karl up to her, then --

           -- tosses him like a rag doll.  BASHING him against the 
           wall!

                                 MATT
                        NO!

           Karl’s crumpled body falls in a heap.  He’s dead.

           The Girl backs into the darkness.

           Matt stares into the pitch.  Hears her CHORTLING from 
           somewhere.

           Finally knows he has to leave, fumbles trying to find the 
           exit, turned around.

           A SKITTERING sound as THE GIRL moves in above Matt.  

           He can hear but not see her.  She is almost upon him 
           when...

                                 ANTONIO (O.S.)
                        Father Matt - ABOVE YOU!

           Matt pivots and ducks.  The Girl HISSES and looks off 
           screen, as --  

           HANDHELD CAMERA

           Comes racing down the stairs, held by Antonio, he’s using 
           the night vision to see.

           He runs through the basement, calls --

                                 ANTONIO (O.S.)
                        Matt?!

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Over here!

           Antonio makes his way across the room - the SKITTERING 
           somehow coming from everywhere at once.

           BUMPS into something, keeps going, then--

           Matt appears in frame --

                                 ANTONIO (O.S.)
                        Come on, quickly!

                                 MATT
                        Where is she!?

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           At this, the SKITTERING abruptly cuts out.  Antonio 
           doesn’t answer, turns and leads the way back to the 
           stairs.

           Running, BREATHING HARD.  

           For a moment all sound drops out completely - Antonio is 
           unwittingly covering the camera’s mic.

           At the stairs, when sound returns, and just then -

           THE GIRL APPEARS right in front of camera!  ROARS!

           Antonio sidesteps her, runs by and up the stairs --

           The men flee the room as the soft light comes on again, 
           WASHING the frame BRILLIANT WHITE...

           INT. LIVING ROOM, COUCH - CONTINUOUS

           The two priests hurry upstairs.  Matt SLAMS the trapdoor 
           behind him.  Then realizes...

                                 MATT
                         Karl...

                                 ANTONIO (O.S.)
                        He’s gone.

           Antonio dumps the camera on the couch, breathing hard.

           Then Matt realizes something is wrong with the old 
           priest.

                                 MATT
                        Father...

           Antonio collapses.  Matt runs to him...

                                 ANTONIO
                        I’m alright.

           Matt wants to help him up but Antonio sits up, motions he 
           needs a minute.   Matt kneels by him.

                                 MATT
                        I’m sorry...

                                 ANTONIO
                        I’m the one who is sorry and 
                        always will be.  

           Antonio begins to gently steer Matt toward the door.

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                        Drive back to the little church.  
                        They will know what to do.

                                 MATT
                        ...What can they do that we 
                        haven’t?

           Antonio is silent.  Matt feels there’s something 
           Antonio’s not telling him, tries...

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Come with me.

                                 ANTONIO
                              (shakes head)
                        Hurry on, Father.

                                 MATT
                        I want your word you won’t go back 
                        down there.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Matt, get going...

                                 MATT
                              (steely)
                        Your word father.

           Antonio takes a long breath.

                                 ANTONIO
                              (nods)
                        My word as a priest.

           Matt nods.  Looks at the door.

                                 MATT
                        Back soon.

           Matt hurries out the door.

           A long moment as Antonio looks at the door.  He is 
           slumped forward.  Something he has to do.

           He reaches up to his priest’s collar.  Touches the 
           vestigial tab inside...

           And RIPS it out.

           Lays it on a nearby table.

                                                             CUT TO:
           INT. BASEMENT

           The Girl sits on the bed.  Karl’s body is curled at her 
           feet, surprisingly peaceful.

           The formerly flickering soft light is working fine now.  
           The Girl’s shadow is cast behind her.

           FOOTSTEPS as Antonio comes down the stairs.  He holds a 
           lit flashlight even though he doesn’t need it.

           He looks from Karl’s body to The Girl as if expecting 
           some trick.  But she only waits quietly - actually looks 
           nervous. 

           Antonio moves closer, looks her in the eyes, which are 
           normal.

                                 ANTONIO
                        I speak not to the demon but to 
                        the real girl inside there.  Can 
                        you hear me?

           At this The Girl nods as if she understands him 
           perfectly.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        I cannot do any more.  I cannot 
                        rescue you. It is you who must 
                        take this fight.  Fight this evil 
                        as hard as you can...

           Her face gets softer, she’s nodding...

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        Don’t give up.  This evil can only 
                        rot us from the inside.  We are 
                        stronger than...

           Antonio stops himself, notices The Girl starting to 
           smile...

                                 THE GIRL
                        Pomagaja mnie!  Pomagaja mnie!

           The Girl grins.  And her voice sounds even younger, 
           mocking him...

                                 THE GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Pomagaja mnie, Antonio!

           The Girl shakes her head and LAUGHS.  All a ruse.  
           Antonio looks as if he’s been socked in the gut.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           A PIXILATED ECU of The Girl’s eyes - they are dark, 
           reptilian.

           At the end of his rope, Antonio yells --  

                                 ANTONIO
                        WHAT DO YOU WANT?!

           The Girl LAUGHS LOUDER.  And then she speaks Norwegian

                                 THE GIRL
                        Vil du anerkjenne meg nå?

           Antonio is stunned as he realizes...

                                 ANTONIO
                        It’s you.  You came back!

                                 THE GIRL
                        Det er meg. 
                              (the voice echoes)
                        Det er meg. Det er meg. 

           Antonio almost collapses.  The Girl continues to rant.

                                 THE GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Du var bare en liten smule gutt 
                        når JEG igjen du. Bortsett fra 
                        I’ve komme igjen. 

                                 ANTONIO
                        ...Back for your boy.  

           A CHORTLE of LAUGHTER comes from The Girl.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        Me.

           Antonio pulls on his own hair, grinding his teeth.  With 
           a thousand yard stare he nods, a decision made. 

           Fumbles in his pocket and takes out that case with the 
           needles.

           He preps one, fills it up all the way.  Has to be five 
           times what he gave her before.

           Before The Girl seems to realize, Antonio’s grabbed her 
           by a leg, JAMS her with the needle!

           The Girl ROARS.  Antonio pulls it out, quickly fills a 
           second needle.

           She tries to crawl away from him but seems sluggish.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Shakes her head.

                                 THE GIRL
                        No.

           But he grabs her by the arm this time, raises the second 
           needle.  

                                 ANTONIO
                        Yes.

           Her voice becomes that of a young girl for a moment, 
           BEGGING...

           He injects her.

           She pulls away her arm.  Flailing, the bed frame 
           CRACKING...

           The Girl lets out a SHRIEK and then it catches in her 
           throat.

           She tenses, relaxes and is still.

           Antonio looks at camera.  Right into us.

           He sits down on the mattress, drops the needle.

           And sits there for what seems like a long time, a broken 
           man.

           That (smashed) radio comes on, weak MUSIC warbling 
           through the room.

           Antonio doesn’t even hear it, makes the sign of the 
           cross.

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                              (into camera)
                        My name is Father -
                              (stops)
                        My name is Antonio Paladino 
                        Glesnes, it has been two weeks 
                        since my last confession...

           Behind him, something moves -- 

           -- The Girl!

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                              (oblivious)
                        ...And this is my sin.  I was 
                        complacent, unaware, naive.  There 
                        was evil right in front of me...  

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           The Girl floats up behind an unaware Antonio...

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        ...And I did not recognize it.

           Finally hearing her, Antonio stops, turns --

           -- As she attacks - Arms around his throat, throwing him 
           to the ground --

           As Antonio falls he drops his flashlight, right into 
           camera frame - FLOODING IT WHITE.

           We hear the SOUNDS OF STRUGGLING.  CHOKING.  

           Then all is still.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

           A WHIRLING SOUND

           Blurry.  Camera slowly auto focuses, in and out, settles, 
           revealing we are in...

           INT. DACIA, DRIVING - NIGHT

           In the passenger seat Karl’s abandoned camera, laying on 
           top of his packed duffel, has just turned on.  But this 
           time no one is operating it.

           The shot is askew, shows most of Matt’s arms and legs and 
           the windshield.  Matt hasn’t noticed it’s on.

           Hold on this shot for an uncomfortable length.  Then --

           The radio BLARES ON without him touching it.

                                 MATT
                        ...The Hell?

           Matt punches it off.

           Then the wipers turn on by themselves.  The heater.  The 
           RADIO again...

           Matt deals with the controls, CURSING as...

           A REFLECTION appears at the bottom of his windshield.  We 
           see it before he does --

           -- The Girl.  Floating in the road.  Growing larger as he 
           approaches her --

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Now, Matt sees her too, his face goes slack.  

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        SHIT!

           He cuts the wheel --

           -- And we are SKIDDING then ROLLING - CRASHING - the 
           SHATTER of glass, TWISTING steel...

           Finally the car comes to a rest.  The tossed camera 
           stares through a cracked window, woods outside.  

           Then, a GASP as Matt crawls into frame, he’s a mess, one 
           eye mangled shut, blood on his face and hands.  

           Matt looks down at his forearm and realizes his radius 
           bone is broken and sticking through it!

           He HOWLS...

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Oh, shit, oh, shit...

           Then Matt stops as if sensing a presence, looks outside 
           as -

           The Girl’s bare feet float outside the window!  A foot 
           off the ground...

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        No, no, NO!

           The Girl floats by camera and is gone.

           Matt looks for her, checking all around.  Begins to crawl 
           out the other side of the car, but --

           -- A SKITTERING is heard.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                              (freezes)
                        Help me!  SOMEONE HELP!

           But the woods are silent.

           AGAIN the SKITTERING comes.  Matt retreats out of frame, 
           as--

           -- A shadow falls over camera.

           Matt SCREAMS!  He struggles - for an instant his hand 
           reenters frame, clawing for purchase --

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 MATT  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        GET AWAY!

           His hand is suddenly yanked off - as if he’s being 
           dragged.  He SCREAMS one final time...

           Then silence.

           Only the WIND.

                                                           TO BLACK:

           END
