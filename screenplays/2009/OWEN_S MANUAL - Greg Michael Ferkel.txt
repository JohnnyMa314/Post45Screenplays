           INT. APARTMENT - MORNING

           We OPEN on a big ball of COVERS.  Bunched together in the 
           middle of a queen size bed.  As an ALARM CLOCK wails, 
           like a truck backing up, a HAND emerges from the sheets.  
           Just enough to feel around.  And smack the SNOOZE.  

           Minutes later the alarm goes again.  Again the hand 
           sneaks out.  Smacks the snooze.  It goes on like this: 
           Alarm, snooze, alarm, snooze.  Finally, from under the 
           pile, a soft GROAN. The covers are pulled down:

           We get our first look at OWEN GRAY.  Tangled mass of 
           hair.  Lazy, thick scraggly beard.  And a look on his 
           face.  Not sadness so much as, though his day is all of 
           ten seconds old, DISAPPOINTMENT.

           Owen rolls out of bed.  Strips off boxers and a t-shirt.  
           Shows us a well-sculpted body.  Or at least what happens 
           when you have one and don’t exercise for nine years. He 
           examines his gut in the mirror. Sucks it in, lets it out.

           Does get in a certain kind of morning workout - 
           masturbating over the toilet.  With about the same level 
           of enthusiasm he had for getting out of bed. 

           He turns on the shower.  Water DRIBBLES OUT.  He jiggles 
           the showerhead.  Nothing.  Stares up at it blankly.  Gets 
           in anyway.  Stands under little droplets of water...

           Rifles through a pile of clothes on the floor.  Chooses 
           the least wrinkled shirt and paint combo.  They don’t 
           really match, but Owen doesn’t really care.  His socks 
           have holes.  His shoes are tattered and old.  

           He throws on a ridiculous Elmer Fudd winter hat and is 
           out the door...   

           SUBTITLE: MONDAY

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - GARAGE - MORNING

           Owen walks out into bitter cold to find a three inch 
           layer of ICE on the windshield of his 1996 Saturn. 

           INT. OWEN’S SATURN - MORNING

           Through a tiny HOLE he’s scraped off the windshield, Owen 
           looks out into parking lot like traffic.  Passes a sign:

           - WELCOME TO HIGH POINT, WISCONSIN. POPULATION: FRIENDLY!

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Owen picks up his cell.  Calls WORK VOICEMAIL.  Punches 
           in his password.  Hears the VOICEMAIL LADY say:  

                                 VOICEMAIL LADY
                        “You have one new message.”  

           Owen sighs.  Hits a button.  Hears the distinctive nasal 
           drone of NED NASH, his boss:

                                 NED NASH
                        Owen, it’s Ned.  Timmy’s laptop 
                        crashed again.  Take it home this 
                        weekend and bring the files back, 
                        k?  We’ll be in by nine Monday.    

           He looks at the clock on the dash.  8:49.  

                                 VOICEMAIL LADY
                        “Received Friday 4:59 p.m.”

                                 OWEN
                        Sweet.

           INT. OWEN’S SATURN - MORNING

           Owen’s now off the freeway, in entirely different but 
           equally painful traffic.  He comes up on a McDonalds.  
           Looks at the clock.  8:52.  Hesitates.  

           INT. MCDONALDS DRIVE THRU - MORNING

                                 OWEN
                        One McGriddle, and uh, one...other 
                        McGriddle.  

           INT. MCDONALDS PARKING LOT - MORNING

           Owen sits in the parking lot, scarfing down McGriddle 
           number two.  It’s 8:56.

           INT. OWEN’S SATURN - MORNING

           Owen rides the ass of a car in front of him.

                                 OWEN
                        Oh my God!! GO!!!

           He cuts a guy off, who HONKS and FLIPS HIM OFF.  Owen 
           gives the guy a deadpan THUMBS UP.  
           INT. OFFICE BUILDING - ELEVATOR - MORNING

           Owen rides up with SUSAN and BECKY, two bleached blonde, 
           vapid girls in their 20s.  They ignore Owen.  Focus on 
           EDDIE, big, beefy, ex-lineman like.  The girls hang on 
           his every word.  And he knows it.  

                                 EDDIE
                        My article on pre-game playlists 
                        for top high schools?  Homestead 
                        gave me this insane external hard 
                        drive.  60 gigs, 10,000 songs.  

           He smiles at them both, flirting with them equally.

                                 EDDIE (CONT'D)
                        You should come over sometime, 
                        check it out.  

                                 BECKY
                        I’d love to.

           Susan shoots Becky a nasty look.  Owen rolls his eyes. 
           The elevator stops at the top floor, at...  

           INT. OFFICE BUILDING - TOP FLOOR - MORNING

           A glass building the length of a football field.  Maze of 
           cubicles in the middle.  MAGAZINE COVERS, blown up and 
           framed, line the walls.  Enormous block letters etched 
           into the lobby wall say:

           - HIP PARENT MAGAZINE: The Know. You’re Soooo In!

           A hundred or so writers, researchers and interns are 
           running frantic, trying to meet deadlines, including:

           The WOMEN KNITTING, who don’t talk or ever look up from 
           their needles. 

           The YOUNG MOMMIES holding BABIES in Bjorn carriers:

                                 YOUNG MOMMIE
                        A nanny has to speak some language 
                        that will be useful for my kids to 
                        learn.  Guatemalan does not count.

           Eddie and other SPORTS GUYS tossing a nurf football, 
           talking high school sports:

                                 EDDIE
                        They have to be juiced.  The third 
                        graders had mustaches.  They all 
                        looked like 70s porn stars...

           CONTINUED:

           Susan & Becky babbling about middle school trends:

                                 SUSAN
                        Lipstick that color totally like 
                        invites rainbow parties, girls 
                        wearing different lipsticks, boys 
                        trying to get rainbows on their -  

           Owen walks past them all.  Looks at a clock.  9:04.

           INT. NED NASH’S OFFICE - MORNING

           He comes up on a large corner office.  Peeks his head in.  
           It’s dark.  He grabs a laptop off a chair.  Waits for it 
           to boot up.  Looks out the window:

           Sees a balding, ruddy-faced little MAN coming into the 
           building.  His fat, ruddy-faced little son waddling 
           behind him.  They are NED NASH, 40s, and TIMMY NASH, 10. 
           Owen starts punching keys on the laptop. 

                                 OWEN
                        “Gee, Owen, I don’t know what 
                        could be wrong with little Timmy’s 
                        laptop.  All he does is type up 
                        his school work, check espn.com, 
                        and occasionally- ”

           From the computer, we hear a PORN GIRL shriek:

                                 PORN GIRL
                        OH JAM IT IN MY DIRTY LITTLE HOLE!

           On the laptop Porn Girl’s getting reamed by a half dozen 
           PORN DUDES.  As Owen hits keys, she narrates:

                                 PORN GIRL (CONT'D)
                        OH THAT’S THE DIRTY HALF DOZEN!

                                 OWEN
                                 (off the monitor)
                        Update security settings?  Yes.  
                        Recover all docs?  Yes.  Kill 
                        little Timmy for being the world’s 
                        dirtiest 10 year-old?  Yes.

                                 NED NASH (O.S.)
                        Owen.

           Owen wheels around to see Ned and Timmy come in.  He 
           hands Ned the laptop.  Nonchalant.  Cool.

                                 NED NASH (CONT'D)
                        The hellsa matter with it?

           CONTINUED:

           Owen looks right at Timmy.  

                                 OWEN
                        Something keeps getting jammed in 
                        there...

           Timmy picks his nose, ignores Owen’s stare.

                                 NED NASH
                        It’s the fourth time you’ve “fixed 
                        it” this month. Once more and I’ll 
                        have tell Alex.  Cole. 

           Ned holds up a FORBES MAGAZINE.  On the cover is an 
           extraordinarily good looking man surrounded by stacks of 
           MAGAZINES.  Next to him are the words THIS IS ALEX COLE. 

                                 NED NASH (CONT'D)
                        Doubt the big boss would be too 
                        happy to hear the magazine he gave 
                        his brother-in-law to run has an 
                        IT guy who can’t fix a laptop...

           Owen forces a fake smile.  Asshole.  

                                 NED NASH (CONT'D)
                        Hey have a look at the copier, k?

           INT. HIP PARENT - COPY ROOM - MORNING

           Owen is surrounded by angry CO-WORKERS as he stands 
           before an enormous COPIER-FAX-SCANNER-MAKE YOUR LIFE A 
           LIVING HELL machine.  This one talks to you:

                                 COPIER
                        Paper jammed...paper jammed... 
                        paper jammed...paper jammed...

           In a stunning FLASH, Owen punches two buttons, opens 
           three drawers, and yanks out a single sheet of paper from 
           somewhere deep within the core of the thing.  Immediately 
           the machine stops talking.  Until:

                                 COPIER (CONT'D)
                        Ready...ready...ready...

           As his Co-Workers look at him with awe, Owen walks off.  
           Clearly the days of deriving any satisfaction from fixing 
           shit have long since passed.  He looks at a clock on the 
           wall.  Wanting the day to be over.  It’s 9:06.
           INT. OWEN’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Owen comes into his office.  A supply closet/server room.  
           Behind him is a shelf filled with TOILET PAPER, a MOP and 
           CLEANING PRODUCTS.  The rest of the room is filled with 
           computers, servers, blinking and beeping devices.  

           It’s all pouring data into three giant MONITORS on Owen’s 
           desk. The second Owen sits, his phone starts ringing.  A 
           lot.  Most people calling think Owen’s name is IRWIN. 

                                 KNITTING WOMAN (V.O.)
                        IRWIN!  Why’s my email so slow?

                                 YOUNG MOMMY (V.O.)
                        Irwin, I can’t log on to IM.

                                 SPORTS GUY (V.O.)
                        Irwin, my blackberry won’t sync 
                        with my computer!

           Owen scans one of his monitors.  His phone still ringing 
           incessantly.  Then it dawns on him.  He grabs his phone:

                                 OWEN
                        Eddie.  Please tell me you’re not 
                        downloading that entire 60 gig 
                        hard drive onto your computer 
                        here, which has 40 gigs of space.

           INT. EDDIE’S CUBICLE - MORNING

           Eddie’s kneeling in his cube.  Susan’s at his chair. 
           ITUNES on his computer: DOWNLOADING SONG 23 OF 10,404.

           INT. OWEN’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Owen slams the phone down.  His other lines have not 
           stopped ringing.  He types an email:

                                 OWEN 
                        A required server maintenance will 
                        be performed this morning.  Email 
                        access will be slow and sporadic.  
                        Apologies for any inconvenience.  
                        Sincerely yours, this job’s 
                        awesome, life’s really working out 
                        for me, OWEN in the IT department.

           He hits send.  The phones simultaneously STOP ringing.  
           Silence for a moment.  Then they ALL START RINGING AGAIN.  
           Owen puts his head on his desk. A second later, looks up:  

                                                              (CONTINUED)

           CARA KLEIN is sitting there.  Whip smart, curvy in a way 
           that makes it hard not to stare, genuinely funny, and 
           somehow vulnerable enough to want you to want her.  And 
           you do.  Owen sure as hell does.  Which he deals with by 
           simultaneously sabotaging and trying to ignore: 

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        If you’re here about the email, 
                        I’m never talking to you again.

                        Don’t I get a little credit?

                                 OWEN
                        Sorry.  What’s up?

           She’s clutching a notebook to her chest.  He fights the 
           urge to look up her skirt as she swings her legs around 
           like a little kid.  

                                 CARA
                        It’s my lead for this article.  It 
                        might be the worst lead in the 
                        history of the written word.

                                 OWEN
                        Worse than last month’s?

                        Now that’s just mean.

                        Read it to me.

                        How about if I email it?  Email 
                        will be up again in what, like,

           Owen leans his head out into the hallway.  Watching Cara 
           walk back to her office.  Doesn’t notice Eddie swing by.

           INT. INSIDE TEEN WEEKLY - ELEVATOR - DAY

           Owen’s at the elevator with Becky, Susan, the Young 
           Mommies, and the Knitting Women, who talk to each other.  
           No one talks to Owen. Until Cara comes around the corner.   

                                 OWEN
                        I was getting nervous.

                        into some amazing hotel suite, 
                        talk to someone who’s actually 
                        done something with their life.

                        without the birthday boy... 
                        otherwise we can’t expense it.

           Owen follows Becky into the elevator. Looks back at Cara.

           INT. BECKY REYNOLDS’ YUKON - DAY

           Owen’s crammed in the way back of an SUV, face pressed 
           against the window.  Surrounded by babies and knitting 
           needles.  Becky and Susan are singing along, in fever 
           pitched unison, to MY MILKSHAKE.

           INT. BENNIGANS - DAY

           At a booth in a crowded Bennigans, Owen’s in the center 
           seat, staring straight ahead.  Blank.  The Knitting Women 
           knit, the Young Mommies tend to their little ones, and 
           Becky and Susan engage in deep conversation:    

                                 BECKY

                        a personal shopper, and I totally 
                        shouldn’t have to, like, apologize 
                        for it or whatever.

                        You are so generous.

           MY MILKSHAKE comes on in the place.  The girls erupt all 
           over again.  The WAITRESS appears with CAKE. The girls 
           artfully roll MILKSHAKE right into “Happy Birthday.”

           They’re joined by the BENNIGANS’ STAFF, who all think 
           Owen’s name is IRWIN.  Happy Birthday, dear Irwin.  Happy 
           Birthday to you.  Owen reluctantly blows out the candles.  

                                 BECKY  
                        We have something for you...

           He can hardly wait.  Becky takes a CARD from her purse.  
           The girls pretend to be excited.  Owen tears it open:

           - On the front is picture of the most wrinkled OLD GUY 
           you’ve ever seen.  He’s got one foot in an actual GRAVE.  

                                 OWEN
                        “You’re a year older, but don’t 
                        worry, soon it won’t matter...”

           He looks inside the card:

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        “Because you’ll be dead.”  

           Owen’s not amused.  

                                 BECKY
                        We all signed it.  

           Owen scans the mindless crap they wrote.  But then his 
           fake smile fades.  In the corner of the card, he sees:

           - TO MY SECRET WEAPON. HAVE A HAPPY ONE. YOUR BUD, CARA.

                                 OWEN

                                 BECKY
                        So, how old are you today?

                                 OWEN

           Becky GASPS like he said 130.

                        something wrong with him, and 
                        they’d be worried about him 
                        marrying their daughters.

           Owen has no idea how to respond to that.

           We’re CLOSE on a WEDDING INVITATION.  Beautiful, elegant, 
           expensive.  Addressed to OWEN GRAY and GUEST.  Owen’s on 
           his couch, about to open it, when the phone rings.  He 
           spies the caller ID.  Pauses.  Sighs.  Gives in.

           ON HIS 12TH BIRTHDAY.”  Inside, 3 dollars.

                                                              (CONTINUED)

                                 OWEN
                        Very thoughtful.

                                 OWEN’S MOM  (V.O.)
                        And you know your father and I 
                        made a donation to plant a tree in 
                        your name.

                                 OWEN
                        How could I forget?

                                 OWEN’S MOM (V.O.)
                        Did anything else exciting come? 

           Owen looks at the INVITATION.  

                                 OWEN’S MOM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Hayden Bell’s wedding, honey!

           Owen opens the invitation.  A half dozen other little 
           cards inside.  All elegant, all perfect.  

                                 OWEN’S MOM (V.O.)(CONT'D)
                        New Year’s Eve.  In Kauai, Hawaii!  

           Owen’s just staring at the invitation.

                                 OWEN’S MOM (V.O.)(CONT'D)
                        Her husband-to-be does a lot of 
                        work there. He’s a very successful 
                        real estate, um, what’s the word? 

                                 OWEN
                        Ditch digger?  

                                 OWEN’S MOM
                        Mogul!  A very successful real 
                        estate mogul.  And of course you 
                        know how well Hayden’s doing...

           INSERT:

           We’re CLOSE on HAYDEN BELL, achingly beautiful.  And in a 
           regal, flowing silk cap and gown, as she receives the 
           NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.  A PHOTO of the moment becomes the 
           front page of THE NEW YORK TIMES, under the headline:

           CLEAN WATER INVENTION GETS NOBEL PEACE PRIZE FOR CHEMICAL 
           ENGINEER & YOUNGEST RECIPIENT EVER!  

           The photo of Hayden becomes an endless stream of MAGAZINE 
           COVERS.  Ending on the COVER of PEOPLE’S 50 MOST 
           BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE. She’s certainly that.  Half the world’s 
           in love with her.  The other half just don’t have TV.

                        It’s going to be quite the affair.  
                        I saw a whole special on E! about 
                        who’s coming - heads of state, 
                        celebrities, not to mention your 
                        father and I.

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

                                 OWEN
                        You guys are invited?

                                 OWEN’S MOM 
                        Yes, we’re invited, thank you very 
                        much.  I see Hayden whenever she 
                        comes home.  Which is a lot more 
                        than once every five Christmases, 
                        like someone I know...

           Owen just watches that one sail past.

                                 OWEN’S MOM (CONT'D)
                        So I RSVP’d yes for all of us -

                                 OWEN
                        YOU WHAT!?

                                 OWEN’S MOM
                        What?  Hayden didn’t have your 
                        address so she sent your 
                        invitation here.  You don’t return 
                        phone calls, she needed an answer -

                                 OWEN
                        Mom, it’s New Year’s Eve.  Did you 
                        stop to think I might have plans?

                                 OWEN’S MOM
                        Well do you?

                                 OWEN
                        Well, no, but -

                                 OWEN’S MOM
                        What could be better than a 
                        wedding in Hawaii for your oldest 
                        and dearest friend?

                                 OWEN
                        Mom, I haven’t talked to Hayden 
                        since...
           INT. DORMITORY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Owen, 21, thin, is on ONE KNEE in a small dorm room.  
           Holding out a MICROSCOPIC DIAMOND RING to Hayden, who’s 
           in just a ROBE.  She WINCES as SWEATY HOT GUY comes in 
           the room in just a towel.  Carrying bottles of Gatorade.  
           Owen looks at Hayden, utterly devastated...

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

                                 OWEN
                        College.

                                 OWEN’S MOM 
                        Hang on, honey...

           She pauses as we hear a MAN’S VOICE in the background.

                                 OWEN’S MOM (CONT'D)
                        Your father wants me to tell you 
                        Hayden invited you with a “Plus 
                        One,” so I RSVP’d for you and a 
                        “friend.” 

                                 OWEN
                        Mom, for the last time, I don’t 
                        have a “friend.”

                                 OWEN’S MOM
                        Friend, partner, whatever they’re 
                        calling it these days -

                                 OWEN
                        Mom, I don’t have a partner!

                                 OWEN’S MOM
                        Oh, honey.  I hope you’re being 
                        careful...

                                 OWEN
                        Mom, I’m not -

                                 OWEN’S MOM
                        Listen noodle, I have to run. I 
                        gave Hayden your number.  She 
                        wanted to know all about you.  I 
                        said you don’t tell us a thing.  
                        She should call you herself.

                                 OWEN
                        Unbelievable.

           CONTINUED:

                                 OWEN’S MOM
                        I know, it’s so exciting, isn’t 
                        it?  Happy Birthday, you old man!

           Owen hangs up the phone.  Does a face plant into the 
           couch.  Doesn’t move for a long moment.  Finally lifts 
           his head up.  Eyes a set of DUMBBELLS in the corner.  And 
           above it on a bookshelf, a JOINT and book of matches.  

           He walks over.  Looks at the dumbbells.  And the joint.  
           Wavering.  Settles on the dumbbells.  Picks one up.  And 
           immediately puts it back down.  Lights the joint.  Goes 
           to the fridge, which is filled with:  

           Four beers, a bag of OREOS, a small container of HALF & 
           HALF, and a two month old lime.  He snags two of the 
           beers.  Then the third.  And the fourth.  

           Sits back on the couch.  Puffs on the joint.  Cracks open 
           a beer.  Flips on the TV.  The MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL 
           jingle begins.  The first smile we’ve seen on Owen 
           spreads across his face as he picks up the phone:

                                 OWEN 
                        Yeah for delivery?  Large meat 
                        lovers, and cheesy bread with 
                        extra garlic butter dipping sauce.

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           We see Owen go through a typical night, stoned and alone 
           in his apartment:

           - On the couch, really really into FINDING NEMO.

           - Dancing around, rapping in perfect sync to NUTHIN’ BUT 
           A G THANG (”It’s the capital S, so yes, I’m fresh, N-
           Double O-P, D-O-Double G-Y, D-O-Double G, ya see”)

           - Perusing MATCH.COM.  Stopping on a PRETTY GIRL’S 
           profile.  Agonizing over emailing her.  Hitting the WINK 
           AT HER option instead.   

           - SURFING PORN.  Going into the bathroom.  After a few  
           moments, we hear the TOILET FLUSH.  He comes back out.  
           Sits back at the computer.  Goes back to MATCH.COM.  

           - Pouring Oreos into a bowl.  Adding HALF & HALF. Eating 
           the cookies as if they were cereal...  

           - Asleep on the couch.  FIGHT CLUB on TV.  Waking up.  
           Stumbling into bed...  
           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           SUBTITLE:  TUESDAY

           MONTAGE:

           - In a rapid BLUR of images, we see Owen go through the 
           EXACT SAME ROUTINE as yesterday.  Slapping the snooze.  
           Dribbling shower.  Traffic.  McDonalds.  Phone ringing 
           incessantly at work.  Watching the server.  Fixing the 
           COPIER and someone’s BLACKBERRY.  Until...  

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Owen’s back on the couch.  Flipping channels, eating 
           Oreos.  Empty beer cans and a half smoked joint in front 
           of him again.  He starts to nod off when the TV booms:

                                 INFOMERCIAL VOICE (V.O.)
                        Are you tired of the life you’re 
                        leading?  Do you find yourself 
                        wondering, “How did I get here?  
                        Is this all life is about?”  Well, 
                        wonder no more!  

           ON TV, an attractive BUFF GUY is on a couch, a thick BELT 
           around his waist and dozens of little WIRES hooked up to 
           his bare chest and head.  All of them PULSING...

                                 INFORMERCIAL VOICE (V.O.)
                        The SVELTE-BELT is here!  Other 
                        exercise equipment promises to 
                        change your life, but this is the 
                        only one that will! Scientifically 
                        proven, patent pending, to change 
                        the way you look and feel...

           The Buff Guy walks around a picturesque neighborhood with 
           the belt and electrodes still attached to his body.

                                 INFOMERCIAL VOICE
                        As you sit on your couch or walk 
                        through your neighborhood, the 
                        Svelte-Belt sends an electric 
                        current pulsing through your body, 
                        causing your muscles and 
                        neurotransmitters to respond. 
                        Helping you to look, think and 
                        feel better almost instantly. 

           Owen snickers at how ridiculous this is.

           Buff Guy pops a few pills from a bottle that says DR. Z’S

           Owen looks around his apartment.  At the dumbbells he 
           never uses.  At the Oreos and beer cans at his feet.  At 
           the WEDDING INVITATION on the table.  His superiority 
           fading.  He reaches for the phone.  Muttering:

                                 OWEN
                        Seriously. What do I have to lose?

           We hear an AUTOMATED VOICE answer...

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - NIGHT

           SUBTITLE: TWO NIGHTS LATER

           Owen comes home and checks his mailbox.  Empty but for a 
           UPS slip.  Signed for by M. MCGREEVY.

           INT. MRS. MCGREEVY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Owen knocks on a door.  It opens just enough for one 
           beady little EYE to poke out.  The eye belongs to MRS. 
           MCGREEVY, Owen’s 80-something landlady. She’s very sweet.

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        What the hell do you want?

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        Why not?  You religious?  

                                 OWEN
                        No, Mrs. McGreevy, I’m just at a 
                        point in my life where I can tell 
                        in the first 20 seconds whether a 
                        girl is...

           He trails off.  But she knows what he means.

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        No girls like that?  How about at 
                        work?  I understand young people 
                        meet at work these days...

                                 OWEN
                        I’m not allowed to date at work.

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        Because you’re the janitor?

                                 OWEN
                        I’m not the janitor, I’m the IT 
                        guy.  And it’s company policy.  It 
                        applies to everyone.  

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        Maybe you should quit.  

                                 OWEN
                        Or maybe I’m just one of those 
                        people who isn’t supposed to end 
                        up with anybody.

                        Who just dies alone in some tiny 
                        apartment with no water pressure.  

           Mrs. McGreevy pauses.  Opens the door all the way.  Owen 
           follows her inside...

           INT. MRS. MCGREEVY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Owen looks around her dark, cluttered apartment.  Every 
           inch of it - walls, shelves, everything - filled with 
           photos and little trinkets.  He hears something odd in 
           the kitchen.  High-pitched WHIMPERING.

                                 OWEN
                        What’s that sound?

           He heads towards her tiny kitchen.  Stops on seeing a 
           chubby DACHSHUND in the corner.  STUFFED ANIMAL DOG in 
           his mouth.  A pretty well-worn one, too.  And in an 
           instant we see why:

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        Wrinkles, don’t even think about -

           WRINKLES drops the stuffed animal right at Owen’s feet.  
           MOUNTS it and starts HUMPING the crud out of it.

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY (CONT’D)
                        Wrinkles, stop that this instant!

                                 OWEN
                        I thought we couldn’t have pets in 
                        the building?

           Mrs. McGreevy gives Owen a dirty look.  Shoves a UPS box 
           at him and hurries him out the door.  Slams it shut 
           behind him.  He calls back to her as she locks it:

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        Always a pleasure, Mrs. McGreevy.
                        And nice meeting you, Wrinkles...

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Owen rips open the UPS box.  Inside is NOTHING.  Not even 
           the little peanut things.  Just the MANUAL.  He tosses 
           the box aside in disgust.  Then thinks better of it.  
           Picks up the manual, looks at the back of it.  

           Grabs the phone.  It rings and rings until a GUY answers.  
           He talks like a smart-mouthed 8th grader, with the accent 
           of Ghandi.  Not quite SHORT CIRCUIT, but close:

                        Who the hell is this?  How do you 
                        know my name?  

           INT. MANUAL CALL CENTER - NIGHT 

           We’re CLOSE on a pleasant-faced INDIAN GUY.  Dark, 
           thoughtful eyes.  We stay CLOSE on him.  And so have no 
           idea where he actually is.  He is RAJEESH. 

                                 RAJEESH
                        ‘Sup bro?  I’m Rajeesh.  Your

                                 OWEN
                        The trouble is I ordered this 
                        thing and it didn’t come.

                                 RAJEESH
                        Do we me a favor, bro.  Peep the 
                        table of contents.

                                 OWEN
                        You don’t understand.  I don’t 
                        need help putting it together.  
                        There’s nothing to put together. 

                                 RAJEESH
                        Dude, just trust me.  The T-O-C.  

           Owen opens the manual.  Looks at the TABLE OF CONTENTS:  

           - HOW TO DEAL WITH YOUR BOSS & HIS SON’S LAPTOP

           - HOW TO ASK OUT & TAKE OUT THAT GIRL IN YOUR OFFICE

           - HOW TO GET TO WORK FASTER

           - HOW TO STOP BEING EVERYONE’S PERSONAL I.T. BITCH

           - HOW TO FIX THE WATER PRESSURE IN YOUR SHOWER

           Owen flips through it.  It’s dense, complicated.  
           DIAGRAMS, DRAWINGS, WARNINGS, CAUTIONS.  He slaps it 
           shut.  The cover says OWEN’S MANUAL.

                        Then it’s the pot.  I’m 
                        hallucinating.

                                 RAJEESH
                        It’s not the pot.  This is really 
                        happening.  Just be cool, okay?  
                        Don’t freak out on me.

                        you to tell me who the hell you 
                        are, and how you know all this 
                        about me?!!

                        Bro, this is nothing to be afraid 
                        of.  Happens all the time.  

                                 OWEN
                        Oh really?!  You send out a lot of 
                        these things?

                                 RAJEESH
                        We do.  Most people don’t even 
                        look at ‘em.  They throw ‘em away 
                        or put ‘em in a drawer with their 
                        other manuals. 

                                 OWEN
                        So why me?  Why did I get this?

                                 RAJEESH 
                        There are certain triggers which

                        of my imagination cuz I’m a little 
                        too stoned.  Nice talking to ya. 

           Owen hangs up on Rajeesh.  Then looks at his phone to see 
           who’s calling on the other line:  NED NASH.

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        Asshole is calling me at home!

           Owen’s not going to answer it.  But then he pauses.  
           Slowly, nervously looks in the manual.  Finds: HOW TO 
           DEAL WITH YOUR BOSS & HIS SON’S LAPTOP.  Flips to that 
           page.  Phone’s still ringing.  He reads:

           Unsure, and a little frightened, Owen answers.

           In a DRIVING BLIZZARD, Owen is hanging off the side of 
           Ned’s house, one hand holding on for dear life to the 
           DIRECTV SATELLITE, the other waving wildly, trying to get 
           the attention of the PARTYGUESTS enjoying Thanksgiving 
           turkey and a warm fire inside.

           Ned leaps off the couch to find his wife, GAIL NASH, well 
           put together, 40s, standing behind him.  Horrified at 
           what she sees on the computer screen in his hands.

                        Honey, it’s not me!  It’s Timmy.   
                                 (yelling upstairs)
                        Timothy, you get down here and 
                        admit what you’ve done!

                                 GAIL NASH
                        So this is what you’re doing in 
                        the basement all night?  Checking 
                        our portfolio, my ass!

           Ned suddenly remembers he’s holding the phone.

                                 NED NASH
                        Owen?

                                 OWEN (V.O.)
                        How’s it going?

                                 NED NASH
                        Uh, I’ll, uh, call you back.  Or 
                        just see you tomorrow...

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Owen hangs up, stunned.  Puts the manual down.  Picks up 
           a half-smoked joint.  SMELLS it.  Puts it back down.

                                 OWEN
                        I’ll sleep it off.  This will all 
                        be fine in the morning...

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Owen comes into the living room.  Sees the MANUAL on the 
           couch.  It wasn’t a dream.  Or a hallucination.  He walks 
           out of the apartment.  A second later comes back in.  
           Takes the MANUAL with him...

           INT. OWEN’S SATURN - MORNING

           Owen’s looking at the same shitty traffic through the 
           same tiny HOLE he’s scraped off his windshield.  And then 
           it dawns on him.  He opens the manual.  Reads: 

                                 OWEN
                        “How to Get to Work Faster:  Stop 
                        taking the freeway.”  No shit.

           He looks at the manual again.  

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        “Drive 35 and take side streets.  
                        It’s faster than riding people’s 
                        asses on the freeway.  And it’ll 
                        add 4.7 years to your life by 
                        lowering your blood pressure...”

           EXT. FREEWAY - MORNING

           We see Owen’s Saturn exit the freeway.  Then take a 
           series of turns, slowly winding through neighborhoods.
           INT. OWEN’S SATURN - MORNING

           Owen takes one last turn and stops, no idea where he is.  
           But then he looks up to see - his OFFICE BUILDING.  He’s 
           stunned as he pulls into the parking garage...

           INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

           Owen mumbles to himself as he reads:

                                 OWEN
                        “In general, you have to relax. 
                        Try being nice to everyone you 
                        meet or interact with.”  

           Owen laughs.  Goes back to it:

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        “Don’t laugh. It’s a revolutionary 
                        idea.  If everyone woke up and did 
                        it tomorrow, the world would 
                        instantly be a better place.”

           INT. HIP PARENT - MORNING

           Owen walks into the office to find everyone milling 
           around, goofing off.  A strange energy in the place.  He 
           passes Eddie’s cubicle.  He’s there again with Susan.  

                                 OWEN
                        Eddie, what’s going on?

                                 EDDIE
                        Check your email, man.

           INT. OWEN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Owen flips on his computer.  Before he can even sit, MS. 
           PATTERSON, Ned’s SECRETARY, pops her head in:

                                 MS. PATTERSON
                        You’re wanted in Ned’s office.

           Owen looks at her with dread.

           INT. NED NASH’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Owen cautiously enters Ned’s office.  Ned’s chair is 
           turned around so Owen’s staring at the back of it.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 OWEN
                        You wanted to see me, Mr. Nash?

           Ned’s chair swivels around.  Cara is sitting in it.

                                 CARA
                        Actually, I did.

                                 OWEN
                        What are you doing in here?

                                 CARA
                        Waiting for you.  You wanna tell 
                        me what happened last night?

           Owen clutches the manual, suddenly suspicious.

                                 CARA (CONT'D)
                        Why Mrs. Nash thinks Ned was using 
                        little Timmy’s computer to check 
                        out some pretty nasty porn?

                                 OWEN
                        How do you know that? 

                                 CARA
                        She emailed her brother about it.  
                        Only she didn’t just email Alex 
                        Cole, she cc’d every one of his 
                        employees.  All 2,408 of us.

                                 OWEN
                        On purpose?

           Cara shrugs.

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        So where’s Ned?

                                 CARA
                        Enjoying the first of his many 
                        days off.

                                 OWEN
                        He got canned?

                                 CARA
                        Leave of absence.  Forced.  And 
                        indefinite.

           Owen realizes the chain of events he started.  Just by 
           opening the manual.

                        Alex Cole asked me to take over. 
                        Temporarily.  As of today, I’m 
                        sort of running the magazine.

           He beams at her.  Genuinely happy for her.  She can sense 
           it, and it calms her a little.  Ms. Patterson, now Cara’s 
           secretary, comes in, holding CARPET SWATCHES.

                                 MS. PATTERSON
                        Ms. Klein, the decorators sent 
                        these over for you.

                                 CARA
                        Thanks.  You can leave them on the 
                        desk, Ms. Patterson.

           Ms. Patterson does and then goes.  Cara turns to Owen.

                                 CARA (CONT'D)
                        So?!  What happened?  Did you 
                        finally just decide to tell Ned 
                        his son is a dirty little pervert?

                                 OWEN
                        Uh...

           Ms. Patterson pops back in.

                                 MS. PATTERSON
                        Ms. Klein, Alex Cole for you -

                                 (to Owen)
                        Sorry.  I have to -  

           She gets up and walks him out.

                                 OWEN
                        So this makes you my boss now?

                                 CARA
                        For now.  But don’t worry.  I 
                        watch all my porn on DVD.  

           He laughs.  She really is amazing.

                        And don’t think you’re off the 
                        hook.  You’re telling me how this 
                        happened.  I know you had 
                        something to do with it...
           INT. OWEN’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Owen comes into his office, losing it.  Sits at his desk.  
           Starts scanning the table of contents in the manual.

                                 OWEN
                        What the hell else is in here?!

           He stops on HOW TO ASK OUT & TAKE OUT THAT GIRL IN YOUR 
           OFFICE.  Reads:

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        “Make sure you’ve already helped 
                        Ned with little Timmy’s laptop.”

           INT. CALL CENTER - DAY

           Rajeesh is playing online POKER in a small cube.  He’s 
           surrounded by other TELEMARKETER-looking types.  We see 
           him clearly for the first time.  Mid-20s, handsome.  Feet 
           up on his desk.  Headset on his head.

                        on these Harvard Law douchebags.  
                        I swear my friend’s 6 year-old is 
                        smarter than all these Ivy League 
                        bitches.  So, how much you loving

                        Not that much, Raj.  I got Ned 
                        fired.  I’m following this thing 
                        that came from God knows where.  I 
                        don’t have a clue who you are -

                        Yeah but where are you?  How is 
                        this happening!?  What if I don’t 
                        want to use the manual?  What if I 
                        just want things to stay the way 
                        they are?

                        I just said “what if.”  Obviously, 
                        I wish...things were better.  Used 
                        to think they would be.  At some 
                        point, stopped believing I guess.

                        Nobody does.  Maybe it has 
                        something to do with the wedding.

                                 OWEN

                        So I’ll give him a manual to make 
                        sure he doesn’t screw it up.”  

                                 OWEN
                        You really think that’s true?

                                 RAJEESH
                        I have no idea.  There’s also a 
                        theory it’s just someone here in 
                        the call center fucking with 
                        people.  My money’s on Vindalu.  
                        That cat is straight up crazy.    

                                 OWEN
                        But it might be from God?  

                                 RAJEESH
                        God, the universe, Vindalu. 
                        Someone gave you a manual.  All 
                        you have to do is use it.   

                                 OWEN
                        And it’s gonna change the course 
                        of history once I do?

                                 RAJEESH
                        It already is.  God winks, my man.  
                        If we only pay attention, it’s 
                        happening all the time.  I’m 
                        telling you, bro, your life’s 
                        about to change...

           INT. BARNES AND NOBLE - DAY

           Owen’s at a table in the bookstore chain.  Reading a book 
           entitled HEARING GOD & OTHER PSYCHOTIC DELUSIONS.  Next 
           to him is a STACK of other books: THE CHOSEN; THE BIBLE 
           FOR DUMMIES; 100 MEN WHO CHANGED HISTORY...

                                 OWEN
                                 (reading)
                        “You might be insane.  But beware!  
                        History is rife with those who 
                        ignored the legitimate call of a 
                        deity. In each case, they were...”

           Owen puts the book down.  And:

                                 OWEN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        SMOTE, Raj!?  SMOTE?!  You think 
                        maybe you shoulda mentioned that!?
           INT. CALL CENTER - NIGHT

           As Owen screams at him, Rajeesh plays HALO on XBOX 360, 
           which he’s hooked up to his monitor.  Rajeesh starts 
           furiously pounding his keyboard, which Owen can hear.

                                 OWEN (V.O.)
                        What the hell are you doing?!

                                 RAJEESH
                        I got the beta for Halo 4, bro.  
                        It’s so genius!  

                                 OWEN (V.O.)
                        Raj, if there are serious 
                        consequences for not doing what’s 
                        in the manual, I need to know!

                                 RAJEESH
                        Why?  You’re gonna do everything 
                        in there anyway, right?  Or you 
                        back to looking for excuses to 
                        avoid making your life better?

           INT. OWEN’S SATURN - NIGHT

           Owen’s driving home past kids having snowball fights.

                                 OWEN
                        That’s not what I’m doing.

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        Oh really?  You ask Cara out yet?  
                        Or you worried about that No 
                        Fraternization policy?

                                 OWEN
                        That shit is real!  Just like my 
                        fear of being smote!

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        Do you even know what smote means?

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Owen’s at his COMPUTER, reading from DICTIONARY.COM:

                                 OWEN
                        “Smote. To damage, demolish, 
                        destroy, or inflict a heavy blow, 
                        often by a supreme being...”

           Owen pauses.  Looks up at the sky.  Grabs the manual:

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                        Girl in Your Office.”

           The PHONE RINGS.  He steals a look at the manual.  Then:  

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           EXT. KAUAI BEACH - SUNSET

           A middle aged black WOMAN is walking along a white sandy 
           beach.  She’s wearing a BLUETOOTH HEADSET and carrying a 
           CLIPBOARD.  Her tone is tight, officious, vaguely bitchy:

                                 BLAIR
                        Owen Gray?

                                 OWEN (V.O.)
                        Um...who wants to know?

           Blair stops.

                                 BLAIR
                        Please, honey, I was with Madge on 
                        Material Girl.  So you can check 
                        the ‘tude at the door, umk?  Now 
                        are you Owen or not?

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

                                 OWEN
                                 (pause)
                        Yes.

                                 BLAIR (V.O.)
                        Lovely.  I’m Blair, Hayden Bell’s 
                        chief assistant and wedding

                        special request for you re: the 
                        nuptials.  And she wants to tell 
                        you herself.  So call her cell.  I 
                        just texted you the number...  

           Owen’s cell phone BUZZES.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        FYI, we have ex-Navy Seals working

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Owen’s in bed, staring up at the ceiling.  Mumbling:

                                 OWEN
                        Special request?  To get back 
                        together?  For me to be her last 
                        before...?  I mean I was gooood...   

           INT. HAYDEN’S BEDROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           With a DEPECHE MODE POSTER on the ceiling above him, 
           Owen, 18, is on top of Hayden, 18.  He THRUSTS, COMES, 
           and APOLOGIZES.  Pretty much all at once:

                                 OWEN
                        Ugh! Oh! Sorry!

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Owen collapses onto the couch.  Switches on the TV.  
           Grabs his cell phone.  Looks at the TEXT from Blair: 
           HAYDEN’S CELL #.  Dials it.  As a CNN story comes on: 

                                 CNN ANCHOR (ON TV)
                        Nobel Prize Winner and People’s 50

                        Bell will be married in Kauai on 
                        New Year’s Eve in what is sure to 
                        be the wedding of the year...

                                 HAYDEN BELL (V.O.)
                        Hello?

           Owen immediately hangs up his phone.

                                 OWEN
                                 (softly)
                        Shit.  

           He looks at his phone.  Debating.  Looks at the manual. 

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        This is ridiculous.  I used to 
                        take baths with this girl.  I 
                        don’t need a manual to call her...

           He dials her again.  Straight to VOICEMAIL:

                                 HAYDEN BELL
                        Hi, it’s Hayden.  Sorry I missed 
                        you.  Leave a message and I’ll get 
                        back to you as soon as I can...

           CONTINUED:

                        Hayden.  Sorry about, I was in a 
                        bad cell...been a long time. Your 
                        assistant said to call so here I 
                        am.  Calling.  I guess you have a 
                        special request for me.  So, call 
                        me...this is Owen.  Gray.

           He hangs up the phone.

                                 OWEN
                        And Owen and his mom and dad...

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Owen’s staring at himself in the mirror.  Looks over and 
           scans the manual on the counter, hearing Rajeesh’s voice:

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        With that hair and beard combo, 
                        you’re basically telling the world 
                        “I give up.”  What’s next?  You 
                        start wearing sweats everywhere?

           Owen grabs a SCISSORS.  Takes a final look.

                                 OWEN
                        Fuck it.

           He starts chopping off the BEARD.  As his face 
           transforms, MUSIC corresponds to each new look:

           - Starting with THE LIFE & TIMES OF GRIZZLY ADAMS, then 
           KUNG FU FIGHTING for the Fu Man Chu, 70’S PORN CHICKA-WOW-
           WOW for the mustache, Jimmy Buffett’s PENCIL THIN 
           MUSTACHE, to BABYFACE (you got the cutest little)...

           Owen then turns the scissors on his hair.  Again we see a 
           series of different looks as he wets it down and plays 
           with it: ED GRIMLEY, the FAUX-HAWK, COUSIN IT.  Until:  

           EXT. OWEN’S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

           Owen walks out to his car again in the morning.  Without 
           the Elmer Fudd hat.  He looks like a totally different 
           person.  Short, sheared hair.  Clean shaven.  For the 
           first time, we see how genuinely handsome he is.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He’s carrying a big POT of BOILING WATER.  

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        “How to Clean Off Your Ice-Covered 
                        Windshield.”

           Owen tosses the water onto the WINDSHIELD...which 
           COLLAPSES under the weight of the snow and ice.  Falling 
           in one solid piece right into his front seat.

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)(CONT’D)
                        Make sure you clean off all the 
                        snow first.  That shit is heavy.

           INT. OWEN’S SATURN - MORNING

           Owen, now driving a car with no windshield - or one in 
           the back seat to be exact - is still scanning the manual 
           as he drives.

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        Be really nice to everyone you 
                        interact with.

           Owen stops at a four-way stop just as a MINI COOPER does.  
           He is about to gun it when he thinks better of it. WAVES 
           the guy ahead...

                                 OWEN
                        No, no.  Go right ahead...  

           The little Mini turns right.  Owen follows it thru side 
           streets.  Whoever’s driving is doing so like a blind 
           grandmother.  Owen starts getting annoyed:

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        DRIVE YOUR FUCKING CAR!!

           Owen glances at the manual next to him.  Takes a deep 
           breath.  Trying to stay calm...

           EXT. GAS STATION - MORNING

           Owen pulls into a gas station behind the Mini Cooper. As 
           Owen gets out, so does the Mini’s driver: Blonde hair.  
           Blue Eyes.  6’5” and JACKED.  He is THOR.  

           Owen takes one look at him and quietly thanks the manual 
           for not freaking out on the guy while driving behind him. 
           As they pump gas next to each other, Thor leans over and:

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 THOR
                        Sorry I was driving like a jackass 
                        back there.

                                 OWEN
                        Oh, no worries, man.

                                 THOR
                        Starting a new job today.  Still 
                        trying to find my way around.  I’m 
                        a trainer at that gym down the 
                        street.  We’re giving away free 
                        training sessions if you’re 
                        interested...

           Owen notices a giant LIGHTNING BOLT TATOO on Thor’s 
           enormous bicep.  He looks at it oddly.  Like he’s seen it

           INT. OWEN’S SATURN - MORNING

           Owen’s frantically flipping through the manual.  Stops.  
           On a PICTURE of a LIGHTNING BOLT.  

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        Follow the lightning where it 
                        takes you...

           INT. GYM - MORNING

           Owen is following Thor around an upscale gym.   Full of 
           tight, beautiful bodies.    

                                 THOR
                        So first off, you gotta stop 
                        playing with yourself so much.  

                                 OWEN
                        Excuse me?

                                 THOR
                        I tell all my clients.  Makes you 
                        lazy.  Think about it.  How are 
                        you right after sex?  Asleep in 
                        what, 5, 10 seconds?  

                                 OWEN
                        I’ve never fallen asleep after 
                        whippin’ up a batch.

                                 THOR
                        Still takes a lot out of you.  
                        Every time you get the urge, come 
                        here instead.  Use that energy for 
                        something positive.  Have you 
                        lifted weights before? 

                                 OWEN
                        Yeah dude.  I lifted all the time 
                        in college.  

                                 THOR
                        How long ago was that?

           Owen sucks in his gut.  Puffs out his chest.

                                 OWEN
                        Not that long.

                                 THOR
                        Don’t worry.  We’ll start easy.

                                 OWEN
                        We don’t have to start easy.  I 
                        think I can handle one workout...

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - MORNING 

           Owen’s on his couch, every inch of his body covered with 
           ICE PACKS.  Clearly unable to move.  Paging through the 
           manual.  When the PHONE RINGS.  Owen groans.  Rolls off 
           the couch.  CRAWLS over to the phone.

                                 OWEN
                        Hello?

           INT. CARA’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Cara is hanging pictures in her newly decorated office.

                                 CARA
                        Are you playing hookey? 

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

                                 OWEN
                        A personal trainer tried to kill 
                        me.  I think he might be a Nazi.  
                        Or a Viking.

           Cara starts laughing.

                        It’s not funny.  I really screwed 
                        up my back.  

           She starts laughing harder.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m just going to rest today.

           Still harder.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Okay.  Really glad you called.  
                        I’m hanging up now...

                                 CARA
                        Wait!  I’m sorry.  I actually 
                        thought you were skipping because 
                        I’m your boss now and you figured -  

                                 OWEN
                        I wouldn’t do that to you.

           She smiles, loving that about him.

                                 CARA
                        So SI’s gonna print my hockey 
                        story, but they have notes.  Which 
                        are a complete mystery.  Why did 
                        it have to be hockey?  Any other 
                        sport.  Badminton, skydiving -

           His CELL PHONE buzzes.  Across the room.  He groans 
           again.  Slowly moves towards it.

                                 CARA (CONT’D)
                        Maybe we could go over them when 
                        you’re feeling better?

           Owen looks at his cell.  HAYDEN BELL.  He’s frozen.  Says 
           nothing.  Which makes Cara think he’s not interested.

                                 CARA (CONT’D)
                        Or not.  

                                 OWEN
                        No, it’s just, someone’s -

                                 CARA
                        I should let you rest.  Feel 
                        better, okay?

           She hangs up.  Just as Owen grabs his cell.  Which now 
           says:  MISSED CALL.

                                                              (CONTINUED)

                        Fantastic.

           His cell buzzes again - NEW MESSAGE.  He listens as 
           Hayden says:

                                 HAYDEN (V.O.)
                        Hi Owen.  I didn’t want to leave 
                        this on a message, but we keep 
                        missing each other, and the 
                        wedding’s getting so close... 

           Owen sits up expectantly.

                                 HAYDEN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It was initially going to be small 
                        and now it’s huge and last minute 
                        and you’re the only person coming 
                        who’s really known me since all 
                        this whatever happened...

           A pause.  Owen’s nervous, excited.

                                 HAYDEN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It’d mean a lot if you’d...give a 
                        toast.  

           Owen’s face falls.  THAT was the special request?

                                 HAYDEN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Also your mom said you’re bringing 
                        someone.  I can’t wait to meet... 
                        them.  And I need their name for 
                        the place setting.  So call me.  

           He clicks his phone shut.  Sits down at his computer.  
           Pulls up a CALENDAR.  Counts the days to New Years.  
           There aren’t many.

                                 OWEN
                        Oh I’m in trouble...  

           He opens the manual.  HOW TO ASK OUT & TAKE OUT THAT GIRL 
           IN YOUR OFFICE.  He hesitates.  Flips ahead a few pages. 
           Forces himself to get up and head out the door...    

           INT. WHOLE FOODS - PRODUCE - DAY

           Owen’s in the crowded upscale grocery store.  In the 
           produce section.  Manual in hand.

           The Clerk looks at him like he’s insane.  Nods.

           INT. WHOLE FOODS - FROZEN FOODS - DAY

           Owen is in front of the frozen foods.  Staring longingly 
           at the BEN N JERRY’S.  The young Clerk walks by and -

                                 CLERK
                        You’re drooling, sir.

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

           Owen is standing over the toilet.  CRYING.  Holding a 
           little PLASTIC BAGGY of POT, and dumping it out.  He 
           flushes it down.  Crying harder...as he PUFFS ON A JOINT.

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Owen tosses out Oreos.  Still crying.  Replaces them with 
           fruits and vegetables, still PUFFING on a JOINT...  

           EXT. SIDE STREETS - MORNING

           Cruising through minimal traffic, Owen sees McDonalds in

           Owen’s bedroom is transformed.  His bed against the 
           opposite wall, facing the window.

           Sun breaks through the blinds.  Light softly hits Owen’s 
           face.  BIRDS CHIRP outside the cracked window.  Owen 
           opens his eyes.  Wakes up.  Easy.  Jumps out of bed.  
           Looks down at his substantial morning wood.  And...

           INT. GYM - DAWN

           Owen is on the Elliptical Cross Trainer machine in a 
           nearly empty gym.  The clock on the wall says 5:45 am... 

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

           Owen’s on his back in his shower.  Wrench in one hand.  
           Manual in the other.  Studying a DIAGRAM.  He takes the 
           wrench to the shower head.  Turns it once.  Stands up.  
           Satisfied.  Turns the water on and -

           WATER EXPLODES out of the showerhead like a FIRE HOSE. 
           TILES SHATTER everywhere...

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

           Owen’s head is sticking out of the now SIX FEET of WATER 
           in his bathroom.  Mrs. McGreevy is there, standing on the 
           toilet.  Screaming at him.   

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY 
                        I don’t care how, just fix it!

                        I’m impressed.  Now SHUT IT OFF!

           Reluctantly, Owen swims over to the wall. Sticks his arm 
           in a hole where the tile was.  Searches for a pipe.  
           Finally, just closes his eyes and PULLS.  We hear the 
           WATER STOP.  Relieved, Owen looks up at Mrs. McGreevy.

                        I didn’t do it on purpose.

                        Wrinkles...

           Wrinkles swims by, doing the doggy paddle.  Giant STUFFED 
           ANIMAL DOG in his mouth.  Owen looks at Mrs. McGreevy.

           INT. MRS. MCGREEVY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Owen comes into Mrs. McGreevy’s apartment carrying a 
           BROWNIE PAN.  Mrs. McGreevy walks out in a new dress, and 
           wearing make-up for the first time that we’ve seen.  She 
           looks nervous, but really pretty.

                                 OWEN
                        You look nice, Mrs. McGreevy.

           She feels like she does and so she allows herself to 
           believe him.  And she glows.

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        I shouldn’t be too late.  It’s 
                        just dinner and a movie.  

                                 OWEN
                        Don’t worry about me.  I’m got 
                        this brownie mix I’ve been saving.  
                        I’m just gonna throw ‘em in the 
                        oven and watch some TV.  

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        I already fed Wrinkles, so he 
                        shouldn’t be a bother.  He likes 
                        to keep to himself...

           INT. MRS. MCGREEVY’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Owen is taking the brownies out of the oven.  Wrinkles is 
           in a corner of the kitchen, humping his stuffed animal 
           like mad.

           Owen flexes.  He actually does look thinner.  More toned. 

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        And this is the last of my famous 
                        pot brownies.  God can smote me 
                        all he wants.  I wasn’t throwin’ 
                        these babies away -

           Wrinkles stops humping and runs to the door.  Just as 
           Mrs. McGreevy comes through it.  

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Hi, you’re back early.

           He sees from her face that it didn’t go well.  She’s 
           trying to hide it.  He sets the brownies on the stove as 
           she comes into the kitchen.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

           She nods, but clearly isn’t.  Then, quietly:

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        He said I looked a lot different 
                        than my picture.

                                 OWEN
                        Oh God.  Oh I’m so sorry.  

           Owen finds himself going over and giving Mrs. McGreevy a 
           hug.  She fights tears.  Clearly devastated.

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        The brownies smell good.

           She goes to the stove and cuts herself a square. 

                                 OWEN
                        Don’t um -

           She devours a big piece.  Sees the look on Owen’s face.

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        What?  What’s wrong?

                                 OWEN
                        Nothing, it’s just...don’t be mad, 
                        but these are pot brownies.

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        Pot?  You mean like grass?

                                 OWEN
                        If it makes you feel any better, 
                        tonight is the last time I’m doing 
                        it.  My life’s about to change.

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        I never tried it before.  How will 
                        I know if it’s working?  

           INT. MRS. MCGREEVY’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Mrs. McGreevy and Owen are on her couch, LAUGHING 
           HYSTERICALLY.

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        Oh, Owen.  This is the most fun 
                        I’ve had since my Ralph died. 

                                 OWEN
                        How long ago was that?

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        17 years this May.  He was my best 
                        friend, my lover.  My whole life.

                                 OWEN
                        So how do you deal with it? 

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        It’s worst around the holidays.  
                        At least I got to have it though.    
                        Most people don’t ever know what 
                        it’s like.  Loving someone who 
                        really loves you.  They’d be too 
                        afraid of anything that good...

           Owen takes that in, and...

           INT. HIP PARENT - MORNING

           Owen is walking purposefully through the Hip Parent 
           halls.  Focused.  He arrives at Cara’s office door.  
           Takes a last glance at the manual, a deep breath, and...

           INT. CARA’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Owen comes in and looks right at Cara.  She barely 
           recognizes him, with his new hair and clean shaven face, 
           as he blurts out:

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 OWEN
                        You want to have dinner with me 
                        tonight?  We can go over the SI 
                        notes, celebrate your promotion.  
                        It’s overdue.

           Bam.  He nailed it.  Confident.  Strong.  Perfect.  She 
           has a strange look on her face as she smiles and:

                                 CARA
                        Um, no.  Thanks.

           Owen’s face falls.  Cara points to the couch behind him.

                                 CARA (CONT'D)
                        Owen Gray, this is Alex Cole.

           Owen turns to see the guy from the Forbes cover sitting 
           on Cara’s couch.  He’s even better looking in person.  
           And is wearing a suit and camel hair coat that costs more 
           than Owen makes in a year.  He is ALEX COLE.  

                                 ALEX COLE
                        Irwin?  How are ya?

           INT. OWEN’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Owen walks back into his office.  Equal parts humiliated 
           and enraged.  Calmly picks up the phone.  Dials.  And:

                                 OWEN
                        Rajeesh, you lousy lying motherf -

                        Owen.

           Owen stops.  Looks behind him.  At Cara.  And then:

                                 OWEN
                        Call you back.

           He hangs up with Rajeesh.

                                 CARA
                        Sorry about that.  You surprised 
                        me.  And Alex just popped in - 

                                 OWEN
                        I understand.  Company policy -

                                 (pointed)
                        But since I am your boss now, we 
                        should get together to discuss IT 
                        stuff, right?  

                                 OWEN
                                 (finally getting it)
                        Absolutely!    

                                 CARA
                        Great.  So I’ll call you later.
                                 (mock official)
                        Now get back to work.

           He nods.  She walks out.  Then pokes her head back in:

                                 CARA (CONT’D)
                        Love the new look, by the way.

           Owen looks at the manual...and beams.

           INT. CARA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Cara is walking around her bedroom in a bra and panties. 
           On the phone with Owen.

                                 CARA
                        Owen, I have to know where we’re 
                        going so I know what to wear.

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Owen is walking around his apartment.  In his underwear 
           as well.  Reading the manual:  FIRST DATE. 670 WRIGHT 
           BLVD.  6:15 P.M.  MAKE SURE YOU PEE FIRST.

                                 OWEN
                        It’s, uh, a surprise.  Just make 
                        sure you pee first...

                                 CARA (V.O.)
                        What?  Why?

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

                                 (reading the manual)
                        I really can’t say.  If it helps, 
                        I’m dressing “casual cool.”  

                                 CARA
                        Oh, are you?

           She laughs.  

                                 CARA
                        See you in a bit...

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Owen stands in front of his closet.  Manual in hand:

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        How to Dress Casual Cool for First 
                        Date.  One:  Buy new clothing.  

           The rest of the page is BLANK.  Owen turns to the next 
           page.  It’s BLANK too.  He turns to the next page: 

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        If no time for Number One, wear 
                        your dark jeans.   

           Owen puts on the dark jeans.

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Without the silk boxers.  P.S. 
                        What the hell are you doing with 
                        silk boxes?

           Owen takes off the dark jeans.  Takes off the SILK BOXERS 
           he’s got on underneath.  Puts on regular boxers.  Puts 
           back on the dark jeans... 

           EXT. CARA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Owen’s walking up the steps of Cara’s cute brownstone.  

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        How to Be On Your First Date.

                        If you have to talk about you, be 
                        brief and completely honest about 
                        absolutely everything.  She’s way 
                        too smart for your bullshit.   

           She opens the door.  Wow.

                                 OWEN 
                        You look amazing.

           CONTINUED:

           She’s startled by the compliment.  And the honesty.  And 
           loves both.  She’s also startled to see good he looks.  
           And means it when she says back, almost shy:

                                 CARA
                        You too...so what’s this big 
                        surprise?  Dinner and a movie?  

           INT. DHC-6 TWIN OTTER PLANE - DUSK

           Owen and Cara are sharing the passenger seat of a small 
           plane.  Flying over the city as the sun sets.  It’s 
           impossibly beautiful.  Piloting the plane is NORM, a 
           Guatemalan guy. Cara and Owen talk through HEADSETS:

                                 CARA
                        This is magnificent!  But why’d I 
                        have to pee first?

           INT. DHC-6 TWIN OTTER PLANE - MINUTES LATER

           Cara and Owen are at the edge of an open door to the 
           plane.  Wearing PARACHUTES.  Norm is there with them, 
           going over last minute instructions.  Which Owen and Cara 
           are too terrified to pay any attention to.

                                 NORM
                        You’re strapped together, but hold 
                        on tight.  Once you’re out, count 
                        ten and pull.  You’ll get yanked 
                        up good.  Then just head towards 
                        the big red pillow.  Questions?

           Owen and Cara both just stare out the door, giving no 
           indication whatsoever they heard a word Norm said. Owen 
           looks at Cara.  Shouts over the deafening sound of the 
           engine and wind coming in through the open door:

                                 OWEN
                        I’m afraid of heights.

                                 CARA
                        I’m afraid of death!  If we die, 
                        I’m gonna be pissed at you in 
                        heaven.

                                 NORM
                        On three.  Uno, dos...THREE!

           Cara and Owen don’t move for a long moment.  Until they 
           LOCK EYES, GRAB ON TO EACH OTHER TIGHTER, and ROLL OUT 
           THE DOOR...
           EXT. THE OPEN SKY - DUSK

           Owen and Cara are FREE FALLING, holding onto one another.  
           They count to ten, quickly, and Owen pulls the cord. 
           Their PARACHUTE shoots out and yanks them up in the air.  

           Slowly, their terror gives way to disbelief, and then to 
           childlike, unbridled ecstasy.  They glide through the 
           bright orange sky.  Owen steering as Cara wraps her arms 
           around him.  

           EXT. LANDING TARGET - DUSK

           Owen guides them towards a giant inflated RED PILLOW sort 
           of target.  Lands them softly in the center of it.  They 
           get up and stare at one another in disbelief of what 
           they’ve just seen and done.  

                                 CARA
                        Oh my God!!  That was -

                                 OWEN
                        Unbelievable!

                                 CARA
                        My adrenaline is still... 

                                 OWEN
                        How do you top that?

                                 CARA
                        I don’t know.

                                 OWEN
                        Seriously.  What do we do next?

           INT. CARA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           Off Cara’s primitive, guttural ORGASMIC SCREAMS, we’re 
           CLOSE on a big ball of covers in her bed.  Owen sneaks 
           out from under them and checks the MANUAL.  Cara squeals 
           with pleasure as he heads back in...

           INT. CARA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 

           Owen and Cara are in her bed.  The first moments after 
           the first time.  They’re both in exhausted, sweaty bliss. 

                                 CARA
                        I’ve had this body for 28 years, 
                        and even I don’t know how to do 
                        what you just did to it.

           Owen glances at the manual he’s stowed under the bed.

                                 CARA (CONT’D)
                        I have to go to New York in the 
                        morning.

                                 OWEN
                        Just use me for sex and run away.  
                        I see how it is.

           She laughs, kisses him.

                                 CARA
                        All of the magazine heads are 
                        meeting with Alex Cole.

                                 OWEN
                        How is that guy?

                                 CARA
                        I don’t know him very well.  He’s 
                        a fan of my writing though, so 
                        he’s clearly a genius.  

           Now it’s Owen’s turn to laugh.  And to kiss her.

                                 CARA (CONT’D)
                        I really do have to get some 
                        sleep, okay?

           She shuts off the light.  They lay in silence in the 
           dark.  Until:

                                 CARA (CONT’D)
                        Owen?

                                 OWEN
                        Yeah?

                                 CARA
                        We should probably keep this 
                        between us for now, okay?

                                 OWEN
                                 (pause)
                        Sure.  You’re the boss.

                                 CARA
                        Some boss.  First week running the 
                        magazine and I do -  

                                 OWEN
                        The IT guy?

                        How’d that happen anyway?  You 
                        becoming the IT guy for Hip Parent 
                        Magazine?

                                 OWEN
                        After college I got a computer 
                        consulting job.  Seemed okay.  Get 
                        out on my own, travel.  They send 
                        you all over the world.

                                 CARA
                        Where’d they send you?

                                 OWEN
                        China.  

                                 CARA
                        Really?  How was that?

           We’re CLOSE on Owen as he recalls...

           INT. OFFICE BUILDING - CHINA - FLASHBACK

           A sprawling office space.  Thousands of CHINESE MEN and 
           WOMEN, all at tiny desks, typing furiously at computers.  
           Shouting Chinese at one another.  Owen in the midst of it 
           all.  The only non-Chinese person in the entire place.  

           INT. CARA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 

                                 OWEN
                        I wasn’t there long.  A headhunter 
                        said Ned was looking for an I.T. 
                        guy. I wanted to move back so...  

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        Always steer the conversation back 
                        to her.  Women want to feel heard.  
                        Like you are listening.  Like you 
                        understand them.

                                 OWEN 
                        How about you?

                                 CARA
                        I was in school and snuck into 
                        this conference in New York.  Met 
                        Ned and somehow convinced him to 
                        hire me.

                                 OWEN
                        And now you have his job.

                        Because you wouldn’t tell him his 
                        son was a compulsive masturbator.

                                 OWEN
                        I didn’t have the heart.

                                 CARA
                        Such a nice boy. 

           She yawns.  Closes her eyes.

                                 CARA (CONT’D)
                        Good night, nice boy.

                                 OWEN 
                        Good night.

           Owen watches Cara in the little bit of light from the 
           window.  A few seconds later, she starts to breath 
           deeply.  Asleep.  Owen grabs the manual from under the 
           bed.  Gets up quietly.

           As Owen heads into the kitchen, we stay on Cara.  Once 
           Owen’s gone, she opens her eyes, wide awake...

           INT. CARA’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Owen’s alone in Cara’s kitchen, whispering with Rajeesh:

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        Did you do it, you sly dog?  Bury 
                        the bone in her backyard?  Show 
                        her something in her size?  Take a 
                        dirt road and put in a highway?

                                 OWEN
                        It was amazing, okay?  But she got 
                        weird afterwards.  Asked me not to 
                        tell anyone.  I think this is a 
                        bad idea, Raj.  She’s my boss now!

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        Stop ruining this.  Just cause one 
                        girl stuck it in your ear ten 
                        years ago doesn’t mean they all 
                        will.

                                 OWEN
                        How do you know about that?

                                 RAJEESH
                        Just keep following the manual.  
                        Tomorrow morning’s huge, bro.

           Owen flips through the manual.  Reads.  Stops.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Are you sure about this, Raj?

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        What did you just get done doing?  
                        Now either grab your sack and do 
                        this or stop calling me.  The 
                        choice is yours...

           INT. CARA’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Cara comes in to find the table set for breakfast.  

                                 CARA
                        What’s all this?

                                 OWEN
                        Breakfast.  Sit.

           He slides a perfect omelette onto her plate as she sits.  
           Pours her hot coffee. 

                                 CARA
                        I have to go in -

                                 OWEN
                        25 minutes.  I called you a cab.  
                        Would’ve taken you myself but I’m 
                        having a small windshield problem.  
                        I can pick you up when you get 
                        back on...

                                 CARA
                        Friday.  

                                 OWEN
                        It’s a date.

           She’s obviously impressed.  Takes a bite of her omelette.

                                 CARA
                        You cook too!

                                 OWEN
                        I can follow a recipe...turns out.

           Owen checks his watch and turns up the TV in the kitchen.  
           Almost instantly, Hayden Bell and her WEDDING PREP pops 
           up on the TV.

                        She moved next door to me in 2nd 
                        grade.  We kinda grew up together.

                                 CARA

                        It’s weird she’s getting married.  
                        I actually proposed to her once.

                        WHAT?!

           Woops.

                        It was like ten years ago.  Just a 
                        stupid college thing.  Like 
                        streaking or taking a Women’s 
                        Studies class.  

           Cara doesn’t look so convinced.

                        Come with me.  Be my plus one. 

           She hesitates.  Long enough for it to be uncomfortable.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        You do realize I’m just asking you 
                        to go to the wedding, not to 
                        actually get married there?

                        It’s not that.  I just worked

           BRIGHT YELLOW TUXEDO.  We PULL BACK to find him in FUBU, 
           the hip hop clothing store.  The only white guy in there.  
           He’s already on his cell phone:

                        Raj, is there a reason I have to 
                        show up to this wedding looking 
                        like Cedric the Entertainer?

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        My bad, dude.  Apparently the Fubu 
                        opened last weekend.  There was no 
                        way we could have known at time of 
                        printing.  There is an Addendum I 
                        can send you -

                                 OWEN
                        I don’t have time for an Addendum, 
                        Raj.  Just tell me where to get 
                        the tux...

           INT. ELIAS TAILORS - DAY

           Owen’s in a little hole in the wall tailor shop.  ELIAS, 
           an elegant Italian man in his 70s, is pinning and pulling 
           at Owen’s pants.

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           Owen, now wearing the tux he got from Elias, is looking 
           at himself in the mirror.  He looks fantastic.  But his 
           smile fades as he realizes:

                                 OWEN
                        Me?  I’m the IT guy for Hip Parent 
                        magazine.  I work in a windowless 
                        storage closet.  Sometimes I fix 
                        the copier.  And you?  The King of 
                        Sweden.  Really?  So lots of 
                        windows where you are then...”

           INT. HIP PARENT - OFFICE KITCHEN - DAY

           The communal Hip Parent kitchen is filled with Knitting 
           Women, Young Mommies, Becky and Susan, all having lunch, 
           gossiping, feeding their babies.  Judging each other. 

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        How to Stop Being Everyone’s 
                        Personal I.T. Bitch.

           Owen bounds into the room.  Conversation stops.  He looks 
           and acts like a different person.  The hair, the body, 
           the confidence.  

                                                              (CONTINUED)

                                 OWEN
                        Hi.  Just wondering if anyone 
                        needs an extra pair of eyes on a 
                        story?  I’ve helped Cara a little 
                        bit, and I’d love to do the same 
                        for any of you.  So let me know.

           He walks out.  The ladies all look at each other.  

                                 YOUNG MOMMIE 
                        Who was that?!

                                 SUSAN
                        I think it was Owen.

           She and Becky exchange glances.

           INT. OWEN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Owen’s shooting baskets with a little mini hoop and nurf 
           ball.  Draining shots from all over the room.  On 
           SPEAKERPHONE.  With his Mom.

                                 OWEN’S MOM (V.O.)
                        Oh, honey, we are so excited to 
                        see you.  Did you call Hayden?

                                 OWEN
                        Left a message with her assistant 
                        this morning.  And guess what? I’m 
                        bringing someone.  My plus one.

                                 OWEN’S MOM (V.O.)
                        Oh, Owen.  That’s so nice.  Now 
                        what’s his name?

                                 OWEN
                        Her name, Mom.  Her name is Cara.

                                 OWEN’S MOM (V.O.)
                        Really?  A girl?

           We hear a MAN’S VOICE in the background.

                                 OWEN’S MOM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Hang on, honey...your father wants 
                        to know if she’s your...beard?  I 
                        don’t know what that means.

                                 OWEN
                        I’ll see you guys soon.  Tell Dad 
                        I said hi.  And I‘m not gay.

                        you no matter what.

           Owen turns off the speaker.  Keeps shooting hoops.  Then 
           senses he’s being watched.  Turns to see a LINE out the 
           door of various women, all holding ARTICLES...

           INT. OWEN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Owen happily tapes a sign outside his door:

           - ARTICLE HELP: FREE; PERSONAL GADGET TECH SUPPORT: 
           $10,000/15 MINUTES.

           A few of Owen’s CO-WORKERS, holding their Blackberries 
           and Ipods, frown as they read the sign... 

           INT. HIP PARENT - SUSAN’S CUBE - DAY

           Owen’s with Susan at her desk, pouring over her article. 
           Becky passes by.  Susan sees her and says, loudly:

                                 SUSAN
                        Let me buy you a drink tonight.  
                        For all your help...

                                 OWEN
                        I can’t tonight.  I have plans...

           EXT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

           Owen is walking towards his car, manual in hand. Scanning 
           the table of contents.

                                 OWEN
                        Second date, second date...

           He gets to his car, which is on FIRE.  And has been for 
           some time.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit!

                                 EDDIE (O.S.)
                        I called the fire department!

           Owen turns to see Eddie behind him.  

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        They’re on their way...

           The fire explodes a little.

                                 EDDIE
                        Dunno.  Who’d you piss off?

                                 OWEN
                                 (dawning on him)

                        What?  You know who did it?

                                 OWEN
                        No.  Maybe.  I don’t know...
                                 (beat)
                        What am I gonna do?  I have a date 
                        tonight.

                                 EDDIE
                        Guess you can make Susan drive.  

                                 OWEN
                        I’m going out with Cara.

                                 EDDIE
                        Cara?  Isn’t she dating our boss?

                                 OWEN
                        Cara is our boss, Eddie.  Unless 
                        you mean Ned?

                                 EDDIE
                        Nah.  She never dated Ned.  She 
                        blew him, but she never dated him -

                                 OWEN
                        WHAT?!

                                 EDDIE
                        You never heard that?  She went 
                        down on him in the bathroom of the 
                        Midtown Hilton at some convention.  

                                 OWEN
                        Bullshit.  She’s not like that.

                                 EDDIE
                        I don’t know.  I think you get a 
                        few mint juleps in her, it’s a 
                        whole other Kentucky derby...

                                 OWEN
                        No way.

                                 EDDIE
                        How else do you think she got 
                        hired as a feature writer right 
                        out of school?  And became head 
                        story editor so fast?

                                 OWEN
                        So who’s she dating now? 

                                 EDDIE
                        Alex Cole.
                                 (off Owen’s look)
                        Think about it.  He gave her the 
                        hockey story for SI.  I play pick-
                        up with All-Americans.  She 
                        doesn’t know the blue line from 
                        blue balls.  Then he put her in 
                        charge...

           Owen starts to have a sinking feeling maybe Eddie’s not 
           so full of shit after all.

                                 OWEN 
                        I’m supposed to pick her up at the 
                        airport.

           Eddie and Owen look at Owen’s smoldering car.  

                                 EDDIE
                        I’ll take you.  If you don’t mind 
                        Alex Cole’s sloppy seconds. And... 
                        you stay away from Susan.  

                                 OWEN
                        She’s all yours, Eddie.

                                 EDDIE
                        Cool.  So you want a lift? 

           Owen fingers the manual in his pocket.  Hears SIRENS in 
           the distance.

                                 OWEN
                        Thanks.  I’ll figure it out...

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT 

           As a FIRE TRUCK douses his car, Owen’s scanning the table 
           of contents.  Scanning.  Scanning.  Flipping pages.  
           Getting nervous.  Panicking.  It’s not there.  He reaches 
           for his phone...

                        Someone set my car on fire, Raj.

           INT. CALL CENTER - NIGHT

           Raj is throwing darts at a PARIS HILTON, BRITNEY SPEARS & 
           LINDSAY LOHAN DARTBOARD he’s got up in his cube.

                                 RAJEESH
                        Who?  

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

                                 OWEN
                        You tell me.  God, the universe, 
                        Vindalu -  

                                 RAJEESH
                        Aren’t you doing everything in the 
                        manual?

                                 OWEN
                        I thought I was.  But my manual’s 
                        fucked again anyway.  There’s 
                        nothing in here about my car or my 
                        second date with Cara.

                                 RAJEESH
                        Because those are problems arising 
                        post-manual publication, bro.

                                 OWEN
                        Um, what?

                                 RAJEESH
                        The manual can’t predict the 
                        future.  It only applies to things 
                        that existed when it was printed.  
                        Asking Cara out, getting a date 
                        for the wedding.  That’s why 
                        there’s a date/time stamp on back.   

           Owen looks at a DATE/TIME STAMP on the back of the 
           manual.  WEDNESDAY 2:13 A.M.  Right around when he 
           ordered the Svelte-Belt.

                                 OWEN
                        What about the stuff that’s

                        that?  Cara’s expecting me to pick 
                        her up.  I don’t have her cell.  
                        She’s just going to be waiting for 
                        me at the curb.

                                 RAJEESH
                        Maybe you should call a cab.

                                 OWEN
                        How’s that going to help me?  
                        Where am I supposed to take her 
                        after?  What am I supposed to 
                        wear?  How do I get around now!?

                                 RAJEESH
                        All good questions.

                                 OWEN
                        What about me being chosen?!  What 
                        about the universe wanting all the 
                        things in the manual to happen?

                                 RAJEESH
                        Looks like the universe wants you 
                        to figure it out on your own now.    

                                 OWEN
                        Dammit, Raj!  You said if I did 
                        everything in the manual my life 
                        would change.  

                                 RAJEESH
                        It did.  It has.  

                                 OWEN
                        You said something amazing would 
                        happen to me at the wedding.

                                 RAJEESH
                        I think maybe it will.  

                                 OWEN
                        Maybe?!  And what if I can’t 
                        sustain all this stuff without a 
                        manual?  Could that amazing thing 
                        be that I get malaria and die?

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 RAJEESH
                        That would be pretty amazing.  
                        Especially cause there’s no 
                        malaria in Hawaii.

           Owen SNAPS his phone shut.  Tries to stay calm. 

                                 OWEN
                        Okay.  I can do this.  I’ve been 
                        on second dates before without a 
                        manual.  They always went fine...

           INSERT:

           - A GIRL PUKES all over Owen just as he goes to kiss her.

           - Owen’s in bed with another GIRL after sex.  He’s 
           staring up at the ceiling.  She’s SOBBING UNCONTROLLABLY.

           - Owen walks another GIRL to her front door.  

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        Your husband?

           The door opens to reveal a HUGE MEATHEAD GUY, he sees 
           Owen, snarls and PUNCHES HIM IN THE FACE.  

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

                                 OWEN 
                        I’m so fucked.  

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Owen is pacing in front of his building.  Keeps checking 
           his watch.  Then sees car lights careening towards him...   

           It screeches to a halt.  Inches from Owen. A LIMO. Or at 
           least it was back in the 70s.  From the rust on the door 
           and two missing hubcaps, it’s had a rough go of it since.    

           The driver’s side door opens.  Out steps MORTY GOLD.  In 
           a CHAUFFEUR’S SUIT and HAT that’s at least as old as the 
           car.  And four sizes too small.  Morty himself has got to 
           be 90.  But he’s spry. 

                                 MORTY
                        Whaddaya say, kid?

                                 OWEN
                        You’re with Gold Plated Limos?

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MORTY
                        With?  I am Gold Plated Limos.  
                        Morty Gold, at your service.  
                        Started the company with my 
                        brother Milton back in ‘72.  Took 
                        it over when Milt moved to Boca in 
                        ‘83.  Now she’s all mine.

           Morty pats the car.  A hubcap falls off.

                                 OWEN
                        She’s a beaut, Mort.

                                 MORTY
                        Tell me about it.  The kids today 
                        go crazy for her.  Have a look see 
                        inside...

           He tries to open the door for Owen, but it’s jammed.  He 
           tugs and tugs on it.

                                 MORTY (CONT'D)
                        She’s a little temperamental.  
                        Might want to try easing in 
                        through the moon roof...

           INT. MORTY’S GOLD PLATED LIMO - NIGHT 

           Owen falls into the limo through the roof.  Picks himself 
           up and looks around:

           It’s like your grandmother’s Lauderdale condo.  Avocado 
           shag carpet.  Orange curtains.  Plastic on the seats.  A 
           tiny little TV.  Morty gets in front.  Puts on a pair of 
           GLASSES six inches thick.  Calls back to Owen:

                                 MORTY
                        Airport, right?  Picking up 
                        someone special?

                                 OWEN
                        Until this car scares her away.

                                 MORTY
                        Leave it to me.  This is my town.  
                        I got connections everywhere.  The 
                        name Morty Gold is like...

                                 OWEN
                        Gold?

           CONTINUED:

                                 MORTY
                        Just like this baby.  Many men 
                        wooed their sweethearts in the 
                        back of this sweet chariot, if 
                        you’re picking up what I’m putting 
                        down.  My own kids were conceived 
                        not far from where you’re sitting.

           Owen looks around, disgusted.

                                 MORTY (CONT’D)
                        And don’t fret about music.  I got 
                        just the thing to set the mood.  
                        The kids today go crazy for it...  

           Morty pops in an old 8 TRACK.  Cranks it up.  It’s VAN 
           HALEN.  PANAMA.  

           EXT. AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - NIGHT 

           Cara’s at the curb in front of baggage claim.  The High 
           Point airport is tiny, almost deserted.  A single squad 
           car is there, with a COP asleep in the front seat. The 
           limo pulls up along side Cara.  Morty yells out to her:

                                 MORTY
                        Hop in, young lady!  The flatfoots 
                        don’t let you dilly-dally.

           She gives Morty a horrified stare.  Owen pops his head 
           out the moon roof.  

                                 OWEN
                        Cara, it’s me!  Come in through 
                        here.  The doors don’t work.

           She gives him a look, clearly in no mood for this. 

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        Hand me your bags.

           Owen reaches for her bag just as she tosses it.  Tagging 
           him square in the face.

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        OW, SHIT!

                                 CARA
                        Sorry.  Did I hit you?

                                 OWEN
                        Just in the face.  Take my hands.

           She grabs Owen’s hands.  He pulls her up and...
           INT. MORTY’S GOLD PLATED LIMO - NIGHT 

           Cara falls head over ass into the limo.  On top of Owen.  
           As she climbs off him, he sits up.  Wipes his nose.

                                 OWEN
                        I’m bleeding.

                                 MORTY
                        Don’t you bleed on my seats!

           Cara looks around into the bizarre limo.

                                 CARA 
                        What is this thing?

           Morty pulls out of the airport, Van Halen still blaring.  
           He sings the breakdown part of the song:

                                 MORTY
                        “Yeah, we're runnin' a little bit 
                        hot tonight.  I can barely see the 
                        road from the heat comin' off...I 
                        reach down between my legs n' ease 
                        the seat back...”

           He looks at Cara and Owen in the mirror.

                                 MORTY (CONT’D)
                        You two lovebirds have a 
                        destination?  Or should Uncle 
                        Morty show you his old haunts? 

                                 CARA
                        This guy’s your uncle?

                                 OWEN
                        Somebody blew up my car.  I had to 
                        rent one.  

                                 CARA
                        From the set of Sanford and Son?

                                 OWEN
                        It was kind of last minute.  Where 
                        do you want to go? 

                                 CARA
                        Um, home.

                                 OWEN
                        Oh.  You don’t want to go out?

                                 CARA
                        I’m exhausted, Owen.

           CONTINUED:

           Awkward, uncomfortable silence.  Owen starts bleeding 
           again.  He wipes the trickling blood from his nose.  
           Holds his head back.  Pinches.    

                                 MORTY
                        So what’ll it be?  Smokey hip jazz 
                        club?  Take in a show?  We’re just 
                        an hour from the Windy City.  You 
                        name it, Morty’ll make it happen.

                                 CARA
                        Just drop me off at home.

           The smile on Morty’s face disappears.  Owen pinches his 
           nose harder.  Winces.  Pissed.  The TV is showing more 
           Hayden Bell wedding prep.  Owen and Cara both see it.  
           Try not to.

           EXT. CARA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Morty stops in front of Cara’s building.  She climbs out 
           from the roof.  Owen hands her all her bags.  Not knowing 
           whether he should bother getting out.  Not knowing 
           anything.  Cara gives him a half-hearted wave.

                                 CARA 
                        Thanks for picking me up.

                                 OWEN
                        Yeah.  It was a blast.

                                 CARA
                        Don’t make me feel guilty.

                                 OWEN
                        I wasn’t.  Maybe you’re feeling 
                        guilty about something else...

                                 CARA
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 OWEN
                        Nothing.  Good night.

                                 CARA
                        Owen, I told you.  I’m just not in 
                        the mood to go out tonight.  I’ll 
                        call you over the weekend, okay?

           Owen watches her disappear inside.  He looks at Morty.

                                 OWEN
                        Feel like getting a drink?

                        Somewhere we can talk...

           INT. CLUB - NIGHT 

           A dark club.  Music BLARING.  Dance floor packed with 
           gyrating pretty people.  In the middle of it, Owen and 
           Morty.  Completely shitcanned.  Owen’s pouring his heart 
           out, at the top of his lungs:

                                 OWEN
                        How do you just blow off the 
                        second date?!

                                 MORTY
                        The second date’s a biggie.

                                 OWEN
                        It’s everything!  We’re actually 
                        not supposed to date in the first 
                        place.  Everybody gives me shit 
                        about caring, but I didn’t make 
                        the rules.

                                 MORTY
                        Can’t dip your wick in the company 
                        ink, kid. 

                                 OWEN
                        Yeah, only guess what I just found 
                        out?  

                                 MORTY
                        She’s been getting dipped? 

                                 OWEN
                        One convention center bathroom at 
                        a time...

                                 MORTY
                        She sounds like bad news, kid.

                                 OWEN
                        Yeah....the thing is, I really 
                        like her.  The other night, we 
                        were talking.  She starts kissing 
                        me -

                                 MORTY
                        She kissed you!?

           CONTINUED:

                                 OWEN
                        Yeah, but this voice in my head 
                        went, “wait.”  I actually wanted 
                        to keep talking!  Or, I at least 
                        wanted to talk to her just as much 
                        as I wanted to get it on! You ever 
                        felt like that about anybody?!

                                 MORTY
                        Once.  I married her!

                                 OWEN
                        She’s funny too.  How many women 
                        do you know who are really funny?!

                                 MORTY
                        Carol Burnett.

                                 OWEN
                        You know her?!

                                 MORTY
                        No. 

                                 OWEN
                        Fuck it.  Let’s get another round!

           Owen turns and runs right into Susan.  She lights up on 
           seeing him, and is clearly just as drunk as Owen is.

                                 SUSAN
                        Hey!  You made it!

           Owen’s excited to see her in that drunk, recognizing a 
           familiar face kind of way.  They lean in close and shout 
           at each other.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        I thought you had plans!

                                 OWEN
                        They fell through!

                                 SUSAN
                        Lucky me for!  

           They smile drunkenly at each other.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        Wanna do shots?

                                 OWEN
                        Great idea!
           INT. OWEN’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Owen opens one eye.  Tries to remember where he is.  What 
           happened the night before.  It all hits him at once. 
           Along with the drymouth and pounding headache.  

           He slowly feels around the bed, trying to determine if 
           there’s anyone next to him.  Doesn’t feel anything.  
           Relieved, he looks over.  No one.  He’s alone.

                                 OWEN
                        Oh thank God.

           He lays there a moment.  Hears VOICES in the kitchen...

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           He staggers out of the bedroom.  Stops when he sees Morty 
           making PANCAKES.  Susan, in a t-shirt and Owen’s SILK 
           BOXERS, is on the couch.  She jumps up when she sees 
           Owen.  Kisses him good morning.

                                 SUSAN
                        Hey sleepyhead!

                                 MORTY
                        Hungry, kid?  First batch of 
                        hotcakes will be up in a jiff.

           Owen looks around his place.  Still trying to remember 
           what happened last night.  Still not having much luck.

                                 SUSAN
                        Morty was just telling me how he 
                        and his wife met.  They worked in 
                        the same office.  Like us.

           Owen glances at Susan.  

                                 OWEN
                        Wife?

                                 MORTY
                        She passed seven years ago this 
                        May.  Looked a little like your 
                        landlady, tell the truth.

           Owen’s too baffled to process this.

                                 SUSAN
                        Mrs. McGreevy.  She came by last 
                        night, remember?

           He doesn’t.

                        You must have already passed out.  
                        I tried to wake you up.  I was 
                        right about to make the magic 
                        happen.

                                 OWEN
                        So we didn’t -?

                                 SUSAN
                        Next time.  I told Morty how we’re 
                        not supposed to date.  Becky was 
                        in the club though.  Eddie too.  
                        Sure they’ll blab to the office...

                                 OWEN
                        Eddie?

                                 SUSAN
                        I hear Cara’s pretty cool about 
                        that stuff, if you know what I 
                        mean.

           Owen’s head hurts.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Guess we’ll find out on Monday...

           INT. HIP PARENT - MORNING

           Owen walks into the office.  Sees Cara coming towards 
           him.  He tries to be friendly, upbeat:

                                 OWEN
                        Hey.  How was your weekend?

           She walks past him without a word.  Towards her office...

           INT. CARA’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Owen comes into Cara’s office.  She’s arranging papers on 
           her desk.  Doesn’t even look up at him.

                                 OWEN
                        Look, I don’t know what you heard, 
                        but I did not sleep with Susan.

                                 CARA
                        I’ll alert your biographer.

                                 OWEN
                        So you’re just gonna be the boss 
                        now?  That’s what this is?

                        Maybe if I do my job you’ll 
                        actually do yours. Instead of 
                        writing articles for my real 
                        writers.  Telling everyone you 
                        write all mine.

                                 OWEN
                        I never said that.

                        Well they all think it.

                        Why do you care what they think?

                                 CARA
                        Cause my reputation here matters -

                                 OWEN
                        Your reputation is that you blow 
                        all your bosses -

                                 CARA
                        What!?

                                 OWEN
                        Oh c’mon.  I heard about you and 
                        Ned.  Hopefully with Alex you’ve 
                        upgraded to the floor of his limo.

           That stops her cold.  

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        You should have at least been 
                        honest with me.

                                 CARA
                        I - look who’s talking!  You think 
                        I don’t know you’re still in love 
                        with her?

                                 OWEN
                        With who?

                                 CARA
                        Oh please.  I do everything but 
                        show up naked in your office for 
                        two years and you never once ask 
                        me out. Suddenly the girl you 
                        proposed to is getting married and 
                        you’re all over me?!

                                 OWEN
                        That’s not what this is about.

                                 CARA
                        Right.  I’m sure you were really 
                        worried about company policy.

                                 OWEN
                        I asked you to the wedding because 
                        I want to go with you.

                                 CARA
                        Then why’d you ask Susan, Owen?  
                                 (off his look)
                        She told the whole office.  Spent 
                        the morning talking to Vera Wang’s 
                        assistant.  Vera’s gonna hook her 
                        up with a dress, so you should 
                        probably take her.

           Owen obviously doesn’t remember inviting Susan.  Has no 
           idea what to say.  And can’t believe this is happening.  

                                 OWEN
                        So that’s it?  You and I are just 
                        done?

           Something makes him walk over to her.  He can see how 
           hurt she is.  Tries to get her to look at him.  Finally 
           she does.  Actually looks like she might kiss him.  So he 
           leans in closer.  And she SLAPS him ACROSS THE FACE.

                                 CARA
                        Now we are.

           INT. OWEN’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Owen’s on the floor of his office.  Staring up at the 
           ceiling.  Talking to Raj on speaker phone.

                                 OWEN
                        What the hell do I do now?

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        Fight for her!  

                                 OWEN
                        She’s dating Alex Cole!  And she 
                        blew Ned in a hotel bathroom.

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        I don’t care if she blew him in a 
                        truckstop and streamed it online.  
                        That girl cares about you, man.  

                                 OWEN
                        She hit me!

                        you avoiding this like you avoid 
                        fixing shit -

                        Because you genuinely don’t want 
                        to do it, or because you’re so 
                        used to being miserable you can’t 
                        handle being good at anything or 
                        having anything good in your life?

           Owen doesn’t respond for a long moment.  Until:

                                 OWEN
                        I’m sorry, what?  I was picturing 
                        Cara blowing Ned in a truckstop.

                                 OWEN
                        You know from here it’s like your 
                        voice is coming right outta the 
                        ceiling.  Kind of like you’re God.

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        I am.

                                 OWEN
                        Really?  Then can you smote me 
                        now?  Get it over with?  It can’t 
                        get any worse, right?

           Owen’s computer PINGS, indicating a NEW EMAIL arrived.  
           He gets off the floor and checks it.  Subject line:  

           - THIS CHICK IS THE REAL DEAL.

           He shrugs, clicks on it.  Having a hard time giving a 
           shit about anything at this point.  The email opens and a 
           BEAUTIFUL GIRL fills the screen.  Saying:

                                 BEAUTIFUL GIRL
                        Hi there.  I’m here to tell you 
                        about Owen Gray...

                                 OWEN
                        Uh oh.

                                 BEAUTIFUL GIRL 
                        Owen Gray gave me the CLAP! He’s a 
                        dirty man-whore with a tiny dick!  
                        Stay away from him! Anytime you 
                        hear the name Owen Gray, just 
                        think: BURNING WHILE YOU PEE!

           MUSIC starts.  TALKING HEADS’ BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE, 
           only with Beautiful Girl singing BURNING WHILE YOU PEE.  
           Over and Over.  Owen immediately hits delete.  The song 
           stops.  But then his email starts FLASHING - MESSAGE 
           SENT, MESSAGE SENT.  Owen tears out of his office.

           INT. HIP PARENT - MORNING

           He comes into the cube area.  And can only watch as each 
           computer gets the email.  BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE/BURNING 
           WHILE YOU PEE fills the office.  Everyone is laughing 
           hysterically and eyeing him with disgust.  

           Owen spots Eddie standing at his cube.  Celebratory grin 
           on his face.  Gleefully FLIPPING OWEN OFF.  Ms. Patterson 
           walks out of Cara’s office, humming the tune. Owen sees 
           Susan in a conference room, on the phone...  

                                 SUSAN (V.O.)
                        I’ve been on hold for three hours, 
                        Owen!  With Vera Wang’s head 
                        assistant!  Three!

           INT. HIP PARENT - CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

           Owen’s in the conference room with Susan.  Who’s pointing 
           at a speakerphone and losing it.  The speakerphone is 
           playing YOU CAN’T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT.

                                 OWEN
                        Uno, dos, three.

                                 SUSAN
                        What?!

                                 OWEN
                        I’m really sorry.

           The speakerphone music stops.  Susan is getting more and 
           more hysterical.

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re...sorry?  You’re fucking 
                        SORRY?!  How could you do this to 
                        me, you FUCK?!

           CONTINUED:
                                         SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        I already told everyone I was 
                        going.  I posted it on my Myspace 
                        page!  

           Silence for a long moment.  Until, from the speakerphone:

                                 VERA’S ASSISTANT (V.O.)
                        Susan?  Uh, I have Vera on the 
                        other line.  But it sounds like I 
                        should tell her to forget it now?

           Susan and Owen freeze.  Both staring at the speakerphone.  
           And then Susan picks up the PHONE and WHIPS it across the 
           room.  TAGGING Owen with it right SMACK in the head.

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Owen’s on the couch, BLOODY PAPER TOWEL to his head, half-
           heartedly flipping through the manual, still holding out 
           a hope.  He realizes none of this is in there.  CHUCKS it 
           across the room.  The TV’s on CNN:

                                 CNN ANCHOR
                        The Hayden Bell wedding is days 
                        away -

                                 OWEN
                        Does anyone report real news 
                        anymore?!

           He switches the channel and:

                                 INFOMERCIAL VOICE
                        Tired of the life you’re leading?  
                        Do find yourself wondering, “How 
                        did I get here?  Is this all life 
                        is about?”  Well, wonder no more!  
                        The Svelte-Belt is here!

           Owen sits up, energized.  Grabs his credit card.  Dials.  
           Hears the familiar AUTOMATED VOICE...

                                 OWEN
                        Yes!  My fucking problems are 
                        solved!!!

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Every inch of Owen’s apartment is filled with UPS BOXES.  
           Stacked to the ceiling.  Actual SVELTE-BELTS and bottles 
           of DR. ZERO’S P-PILLS strewn everywhere.  NO NEW MANUALS.

           CONTINUED:

           Owen’s on the couch.  Popping P-PILLS from a huge jar.  
           SVELTE-BELT hooked up to his chest and head. His phone 
           rings.  He doesn’t even flinch.  The machine picks up:

                                 BLAIR (V.O.)
                        Owen, it’s Blair from Hayden’s 
                        office.  Calling to confirm the 
                        spelling of your plus one: C-A-R-A 
                        K-L-E-I-N.  Also you need to call 
                        Hayden A-S-A-P about the toast.  
                        Don’t make me call again.  We do 
                        have other guests, you know.  I 
                        for one -

           Owen gets off the couch and casually walks over to the 
           phone.  RIPS it out of the wall.

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Owen wakes up by the perfect light of the sun.  Birds 
           chirping.  He turns on the shower, watches hot water pour 
           out.  Takes off his shirt.  Examines his thinner, more 
           muscular self.  And sighs, utterly miserable.

           INT. OWEN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Cara’s in Owen’s office.  She’s got her winter coat on, 
           and is holding a black wheeler carry-on suitcase.  He’s 
           at his desk, popping P-PILLS.   

                                 CARA
                        You don’t have to do this.

                                 OWEN
                        It was a significant security 
                        breach.  I have to deal with it 
                        when no one’s here. I’ll start 
                        tonight, be done by New Years.
                        It’s my job, remember?  

                                 CARA 
                        What’s that smell? 

           Owen looks at the P-Pill bottle.

                                 OWEN
                        Might be my new cologne.  You 
                        likey?

                                 CARA
                        It smells like cat pee.

                                 CARA
                        Owen, it’s Christmas -

                                 OWEN
                        Eddie left me no choice.

                                 CARA
                        He’s feels bad.  About the virus.  
                        And your car.  

                                 OWEN
                        What about my car?

                                 CARA
                        He’s the one who blew it up.  He’s 
                        very sorry.

                                 OWEN
                        So it wasn’t...

                                 CARA
                        How’ve you been getting around 
                        anyway?

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - GARAGE - DAY

           Owen and Cara are staring at Morty Gold’s LIMO.

                                 OWEN
                        I’m watching it for Mort while he 
                        visits his brother in Boca.  Then 
                        he’s going to watch my place while 
                        I go to the wedding.

                                 CARA
                        I heard you disinvited Susan.

                                 OWEN
                        Yeah, well, I never wanted to go 
                        with her...

           He says it, asking her.  She pretends otherwise:

                                 CARA
                        I‘ll be following-up on my 
                        cheerleader story.  Apparently 
                        there was some popping incident.  
                        Sort of defeats the purpose of 
                        Alex giving us the week off, but -

                        Alex make it up to you.  

           She turns to go.  He calls back to her.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        I would’ve quit this job for you!

           She stops.  Turns back. 

                                 CARA
                        Me too.  But it’s a little late 
                        for that now...

           Owen watches as Cara disappears into the parking garage.

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Owen opens the door to his apartment.  Comes in.  Lonely.  
           Dejected.  Walks into the living room to find candles lit 
           everywhere.  Soft music on.  And Mrs. McGreevy on the 
           couch.  In GARTERS.  

                                 OWEN
                        Mrs. McGreevy?

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        I could smell you all the way from 
                        my apartment.  

           Owen looks at the P-Pills bottles scattered around.

                                 OWEN
                        You could?

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        Ummm.  Your scent.  It’s driving 
                        me wild.  

                                 OWEN
                        It is?

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        It calls to me in my sleep.  

                                 OWEN
                        What does it say?

                                 MRS. MCGREEVY
                        That the turkey isn’t the only 
                        thing that needs stuffing this 
                        Christmas.

           CONTINUED:

           Owen hears a muffled PANTING in the corner.  Sees 
           WRINKLES there, pumping away at his STUFFED ANIMAL.  Owen 
           turns and walks out...

           INT. OWEN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Owen’s in his office, watching the server hum.  Picking 
           at the FROZEN CHRISTMAS DINNER on his desk.  Listening to 
           the radio play CHRISTMAS SONGS.  As IT’S THE MOST 
           WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR ends, the DJ says:

                                 RADIO DJ
                        Next, why we can expect more 
                        suicides than usual this 
                        Christmas...

           Owen switches off the radio.  Walks out of his office...

           INT. HIP PARENT - NIGHT 

           Owen comes into the main room.  Walks around the various 
           cubes.  Enjoying that strange feeling of being the only 
           person in a place usually filled with people.  He ends up 
           in front of Cara’s office. 

           INT. HIP PARENT - CARA’S OFFICE - NIGHT 

           Owen sits at Cara’s desk. Sees the new Sports Illustrated 
           open to her hockey article.  Even though it’s done, in 
           print, Cara has marked it up with RED PEN in the margins 
           with things like: WEAK. COULD BE BETTER. BORING.

           Owen’s about to get up when Cara’s phone rings.  He 
           jumps, startled.  Doesn’t recognize the caller ID. 
           Pauses, hesitating.  Finally picks it up.

                                 OWEN
                        Hello?

           INT. TOWN CAR - NIGHT 

           We’re with LAUREN GOLDSTEIN, 30s, corporate hot.  She’s 
           on her phone in the back of a black town car.  Cruising

                        Hello, this is Lauren Goldstein 
                        from Rolling Stone magazine.  I’m 
                        trying to reach Cara Klein.

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

                                 OWEN 
                        Cara’s not here now.  Can I -

                                 LAUREN GOLDSTEIN
                        Are you her assistant?  

                                 OWEN
                        No, we work together.

                                 LAUREN GOLDSTEIN
                        Do you know where she is?  It’s 
                        nothing bad.  She’s getting a shot 
                        at becoming a contributing editor.  
                        Sort of a tryout.

                                 OWEN
                        For Rolling Stone?

                                 LAUREN GOLDSTEIN
                        Yep.  But she won’t know who she’s 
                        meeting beforehand. It’s how we do 
                        it.  Give you a hotel and a room 
                        number and say go talk to who’s 
                        there and write up 1000 words 
                        about it.  

           Pause.

                                 OWEN
                        Does the interviewee know who’s 
                        interviewing them?

                                 LAUREN GOLDSTEIN
                        Just that they’re from Rolling 
                        Stone.  

           Owen gets a mischievous look on his face.

                                 LAUREN GOLDSTEIN (CONT'D)
                        So, I have to tell her where to 
                        go.  Do you have her cell -

                                 OWEN
                        You can give me the info.  She 
                        checks in with me all the time.

                                 LAUREN GOLDSTEIN
                        You sure?  It’s really important 
                        she gets this. 

                                 OWEN
                        Oh she’ll get it all right.

                                 LAUREN GOLDSTEIN
                        Okay, tell her it’s room 223 in 
                        the Drake Hotel Chicago.  Friday 
                        at 10:30 a.m.  

                                 OWEN 
                        Is Alex Cole buying Rolling Stone?

                                 LAUREN GOLDSTEIN
                        No.  Alex just got her the 
                        interview.  So, Merry Christmas.

           Owen hangs up the phone.  He looks up at the ceiling.  

                                 OWEN
                        Happy fucking New Year!

           INT. MORTY’S GOLD PLATED LIMO - MORNING

           Owen’s driving Morty’s limo on the freeway when he passes 
           a sign that says CHICAGO 42 MILES.  

                                 OWEN
                        Me?  I a writer for Rolling Stone 
                        magazine.  Yes, it is cool...

           He remembers something.  Excitedly grabs his cell.  
           Dials.  It rings and rings...

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Hayden, it’s Owen.  Blair asked me 
                        to call. I’m on my way to Chicago.  
                        I got a gig writing for Rolling 
                        Stone.  Anyway, sorry I keep 
                        missing you.  I’ll be happy to do 
                        the toast.  Call me back...

           INT. DRAKE HOTEL - LOBBY - MORNING

           Owen’s in the lobby, testing TAPE RECORDERS, EXTRA TAPES, 
           NOTEBOOKS, PENS.  Out of habit, he pages through the 
           manual.  Nothing.  He stuffs it in his bag...

           INT. DRAKE HOTEL - HALLWAY OUTSIDE ROOM 223 - MORNING

           He comes down the hallway.  Before he can even get to 
           Room 223, two huge SECURITY GUYS stop him:

                                 SECURITY GUY 1
                        Can we help you?

           CONTINUED:

                                 OWEN
                        Owen Gray.  From Rolling Stone.

                                 SECURITY GUY 2
                        Is she expecting you?

                                 OWEN
                        Uh, yes.  She is.  

           Security Guy 1 taps on the door to Room 223.  A SECRET 
           SERVICE looking guy answers.  

                                 SECURITY GUY 1
                        Rolling Stone.

           Secret Service slams the door.  Owen just stands there, 
           waiting.  After a long moment, the door opens again.

                                 SECRET SERVICE
                        You’re from Rolling Stone?  

                                 OWEN
                        Yep.

                                 SECURITY GUY 1
                        You want me to frisk him?

                                 SECRET SERVICE
                        No, it’s fine.

                                 OWEN
                        Maybe some other time.

           Security Guy 1 snarls as Owen follows Secret Service in.

           INT. DRAKE HOTEL - ROOM 223 - MORNING

           Owen walks in to the massive suite.  Sees the magnificent 
           views of the lake.  Beautiful fresh cut flowers on every 
           table.  Tray after tray of delectable food.  The whole 
           room flawless.  He instantly feels terrible.

                                 OWEN
                                 (to himself)
                        What am I doing here?

                                 SECRET SERVICE
                        She’s almost ready for you.  We 
                        don’t have a lot of time, as you 
                        can imagine it’s very busy today.

           CONTINUED:

                                 OWEN
                        Right.  This might sound strange, 
                        but I’m actually not supposed to 
                        be here.

                                 SECRET SERVICE
                        What do you mean?

                                 OWEN
                        I’m just filling in.  The real 
                        interviewer is - 

                                 HAYDEN BELL (O.S.)
                        Owen!?  Is that you!?

           Owen turns to see HAYDEN BELL come out from the bedroom.  
           In her WEDDING GOWN.  Looking absolutely radiant.  
           Surrounded by gushing BRIDESMAIDS.

                                 OWEN
                        Hayden?

           Blair, Hayden’s bitchy assistant, is there too.

                                 BLAIR
                        Wait, Owen?  As in wedding Owen?

                                 HAYDEN BELL
                        I just got your message.  You’re 
                        writing for Rolling Stone?!  About 
                        me?  Did you know -

                                 OWEN
                        Not until now.

           Blair gets a phone call and rushes out.

                                 HAYDEN BELL
                        That’s amazing?!  Guys, this is 
                        Owen.  We grew up next door to 
                        each other.  Come give me a hug!

           Owen goes over to her and does. As she wraps her arms 
           around him, he spots her ENGAGEMENT RING.  Easily 5 
           karats.  Blinding.  She catches him looking at it.  
           Immediately feels uncomfortable.  Tries to hide it.

                                 HAYDEN BELL (CONT’D)
                        Give me a sec and we can get 
                        started.  I can’t believe this!  

                                 OWEN
                        Actually, Hayden, there was a mix 
                        up.  I’m not the one who should -

                        Hayden.  Your flight’s getting 
                        pushed up.  There’s weather coming 
                        in and they want to get you out 
                        now.

                                 HAYDEN BELL
                        Now now?

                        They’re saying wheels up in 
                        thirty.

                                 HAYDEN BELL
                        All right.  Jeez, Owen, well - do 
                        you want to fly down with us?

                                 OWEN
                        Uh, I still have some things I 
                        need to do.

                                 BLAIR
                        Hello, like confirming the 
                        spelling of your plus one?!

                                 OWEN
                        Yeah, about that?

           More ASSISTANTS swarm Hayden, helping her out of her 
           dress and leading her towards the bathroom.

                                 HAYDEN BELL
                        Listen, don’t worry.  We’ll find 
                        time at the wedding to do the 
                        interview, okay?  

                                 OWEN
                        No, you don’t understand.  I’m not 
                        the one who’s supposed to do the 
                        interview.  Cara Klein is.

                        Cara Klein?  So what are you the

                        checking messages because I don’t 
                        have your cell.  Rolling Stone 
                        wants you to interview Hayden 
                        Bell.  There was a mix up, and...  

           Owen sees a sign for GAS CITY.  Turns off at the exit...

                        It’s a long story so just call me, 
                        okay?  I left a message for Lauren 
                        Goldstein at Rolling Stone to call 
                        you, and I’m on my way to try and

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM - DAY

           Owen’s in the bleachers of a high school football 
           stadium, watching FRESHMAN CHEERLEADING practice.  Each 
           of them has the most enormous FAKE BOOBS.  All in a line, 
           big, bigger, biggest...

           Next to Owen in the bleachers is SALLY, who has one giant 
           fake boob and GAUZE where the other used to be.

                                 SALLY
                        She left a few hours ago.

                        Did she say where she was going?  
                        Or anything about Rolling Stone 
                        maybe?

                        Sorry.

           Owen nods.  Lost.

                        She did say something about going 
                        to meet this guy from work.

                                 OWEN 
                        Did she tell you his name?

                                 SALLY
                        No, but I thought you said you 
                        worked with her?

                                 OWEN
                        I do.  But, I’m not the only one.

                                 SALLY
                        Are you her boss?

                        Other way around.

                                 SALLY
                        Oh.  

                                 OWEN
                        She’s going to meet her boss?

                        I think they’re spending New 
                        Year’s together.  

           Owen gets up to go.  Then stops.  Turns back.

           INT. MORTY’S GOLD PLATED LIMO - DAY

           Owen’s driving home.  Pleading with Rajeesh.

                                 OWEN
                        I’m asking you to help me!  You 
                        got me into this.  I was happy 
                        before the manual.

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        You were miserable.

                                 OWEN
                        I was miserable, but at least I 
                        was happy...
                                 (beat)
                        You know what I mean.

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        You did this because you wanted 
                        to, bro.  Because you wanted your 
                        life to mean something.  Or to at 
                        least believe it could again.

           Owen pauses.  Then, a little more calm:

                                 OWEN
                        I can’t be the first person in 
                        history to freak out, Raj.  There 
                        has to be something you can do.  

                                 RAJEESH (V.O.)
                        There is one thing...

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           Owen’s in a dimly lit high school gym.  With a dozen MEN 
           and WOMEN on metal folding chairs in a big circle.  One 
           by one they each stand and tell their stories.  The first 
           is ALLAN, bald, wire rim frames, jittery:

                                 ALLAN
                        I spent last year re-creating my 
                        old problems.  Using the manual to 
                        solve them again. Got back with my 
                        ex-wife so I could use the manual 
                        to realize I should divorce her 
                        again. I loved realizing that...

           JANICE is 29, cute.  And a total basket case.

                                 JANICE
                        I’m know I’m supposed to meet the 
                        one, I just don’t know who the one 
                        is.  When I meet a guy, I always 
                        call Sanji, my rep.  Ask him if 
                        the guy’s the one.  Sometimes I 
                        think Sanji’s the one...

           ED is 60.  And long gone.  

                                 ED
                        Can you tell me what to do?  Can 
                        you tell me what to do?  Can you 
                        tell me what to do? 

           And then MAUREEN, 50s.  Kind, maternal.

                                 MAUREEN
                        I know how many of you feel about 
                        this, but I just want to say: I’m 
                        going to find my Happiness 
                        Addendum.  

           The group reacts with MURMURS and SHOUTS of approval and 
           disapproval.  

                                 MAUREEN (CONT'D)
                        We’ve all heard the rumors.  But I 
                        have it from a reliable source 
                        that it’s true.  Each manual was 
                        written with an Addendum.  Tells 
                        you to do three things and you’re 
                        happy for the rest of your life.  

                                 ALLAN
                        I heard that doesn’t apply to all 
                        manuals!

                                 MAUREEN
                        If the back of your manual says, 
                        “printed on recyclable paper in 
                        Gary, Indiana,” then I know where 
                        your Happiness Addendum is.  

                                 JANICE
                        Sanji told me this is a bunch of 
                        bullshit.  A hoax!

                                 MAUREEN
                        Believe what you want. I’m leaving 
                        in the morning.  Anyone who wants 
                        to come with me, meet here at 
                        eight.

           Ned Nash is walking towards his car.  Trying to keep a 
           low profile by wearing huge SUNGLASSES at night. Corey 
           Hart style.  Only succeeding in drawing stares from 
           everyone he passes.

                                 NED NASH

                        Don’t worry about it.  If it makes 
                        you feel any better, I helped 
                        Eddie torch your car.  So maybe we 
                        call it even...?

                                 OWEN
                        Sounds fair.

                        So how’s work?  I heard Alex put 
                        Cara in charge.  She’s a sweet 
                        girl.  Talented.  You know I met 
                        her when she was still in school?

           Owen snaps his phone shut. A group of CAROLERS walk past, 
           singing I’LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS.  Owen sees them 
           and...

           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           Owen walks back into his apartment to find his door open.  
           Suspicious, he pushes it open carefully.  Peeks his head 
           inside.  And sees....Morty and Mrs. McGreevy GOING AT IT 
           on his couch.  Wrinkles mimicking them in the corner.  
           Without a word, Owen walks right back out the door.

           EXT. OWEN’S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Owen’s on the floor outside his apartment.  Leaning 
           against the wall.  Having a heart to heart with Fran.

                        I don’t think life works like 
                        that.  But we can give it a shot.

                        Fine, lets.  First, if I don’t go 
                        to the wedding, am I gonna be 
                        struck by lightning or fall down 
                        an elevator shaft or otherwise be 
                        smote by God or anyone else?

                        Well, Rajeesh probably let you 
                        believe that to light a fire under 
                        you.  But I’ve never heard of it 
                        actually happening to anyone.

                                 OWEN (V.O.)
                        So did the manual come from God?  
                        Or was it just Vindalu?

                        I don’t know.  That cat is crazy.

                        And me being chosen?  Is that 
                        bullshit too?  I mean how many 
                        manuals are even out there?

                                 FRAN
                        They just hit 20 in circulation.   
                        But almost no one reads them.

                                 OWEN (V.O.)
                        20 manuals?  That’s it?

                                 FRAN
                        20 million.  Not counting the 
                        MidEast and North Korea, where 
                        they basically send one to 
                        everybody, hoping one will get 
                        through.  Mostly they go to the 
                        U.S.  A bunch to England, but 
                        those are really just about 
                        orthodontia.  
           INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Owen gets quiet for a moment.  Considering this.  Mrs. 
           McGreevy and Morty are still going strong inside.

                                 OWEN
                        What if Rajeesh was right?  What 
                        if something monumental’s supposed 
                        to happen to me at the wedding?

           EXT. KAUAI - DUSK

           Off the incredible beauty of an entire PHILHARMONIC 
           ORCHESTRA playing VIVALDI’S FOUR SEASONS, we get our 
           first look at Hayden Bell’s wedding:

           Under a giant white silk TENT, hundreds of tiny lights 
           line pathways through a sea of tables filled with the 
           most breathtaking array of flowers, food, and drink.  All 
           of it right in the sand, literally feet from the ocean.

           Owen walks in, looking dashing, James Bond-like in his 
           tux.  He takes in the unreal beauty of the scene.  The 
           sun setting over the ocean.  The music.  It’s remarkably 
           peaceful, serene.

                                 BLAIR (O.S.)
                        Where the hell have you been!?

           Owen turns to find Blair at his side.  Clipboard in hand, 
           headset on.  A complete twittering disaster.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        We are seconds away from speeches!

           Owen looks behind Blair and finds two familiar faces in 
           the crowd: Owen’s Mom and OWEN’S DAD, who’s basically an 
           older, thicker version of Owen.  

                                 OWEN
                        Okay.  Just let me say hello to 
                        some people first.  

                                 BLAIR
                        Uh, excuse me, we are not on your 
                        schedule here, selfish.

                                 OWEN
                        Just give me a minute and I’ll be 
                        there, okay?  I promise.

           Owen leaves Blair and heads off towards his parents.  
           Working his way through the crowd to their table.  They 
           light up at seeing him.

                                 OWEN’S MOM
                        Hi honey, how are you?  You look 
                        terrific, my goodness!  So thin!  
                        Are you eating?

                                 OWEN
                        Not right now.

                                 OWEN’S DAD
                        How are ya, son?

           Owen’s Dad KISSES HIM ON THE MOUTH.  Owen notices his Dad 
           has a RAINBOW FLAG PIN on his lapel.

                        Your mother’s drunk off half a 
                        champagne cocktail.  She keeps 
                        threatening to go over and pinch 
                        Ted Koppel’s ass.

                        It was a whole one, not a half! 

           Owen’s Dad introduces Owen to a big, good-looking blonde 
           guy in the chair next him.  He’s CHIP HESTER.

                                 OWEN’S DAD
                        Owen, say hello to Chip Hester.  
                        He was down here on business, so 
                        Hayden said to bring him along.  

           Owen and Chip shake hands.  Owen’s Mom introduces Owen to 
           the table.  All of them are OWEN’S PARENTS’ FRIENDS:

                                 OWEN’S MOM
                        And you remember the Ozbarts, the 
                        Kaplans, Dr. and Mrs. Snow, the 
                        Fergusons.

           All these couples, the same age as Owen’s parents, wave 
           at Owen.  Owen’s Dad focuses Owen on Chip.

                                 OWEN’S DAD
                        Owen, Chip’s Dad Phil and I are in 
                        the same golf league together.

           Owen nods at Chip.  Then the couples start asking Owen 
           questions.  Talking over one another.  Owen tries to 
           answer as much as he can.  It’s like a Jeopardy lightning 
           round about your life.  

                                 MR. FERGUSON

                        They say she can barely go outside 
                        without being mobbed.

                        I fell last year and broke my hip.  
                        You don’t even want to know...

                                 MRS. KAPLAN
                        I saw the Rolling Stones in 
                        Cleveland once.  

           Across the room, in her gown, is Hayden.  Looking like a 
           40s movie star.  Classy.  Elegant.  Stunning.  

                                 OWEN
                        Would you excuse me please?  I 
                        need to say hello to the bride.

           He heads off towards Hayden.  She sees him and rushes 
           over.  Blair is behind her, shadowing her every move.

                                 HAYDEN
                        There you are!

                        Thanks.  You too.  Great tux.  

           They look at each other, neither of them saying a word.  
           Both knowing that in another lifetime, all this could 
           have been about them.

                                 BLAIR
                        Hayden, if we don’t do speeches 
                        now, we’ll have a cake melting 
                        fiasco on our hands and girl, 
                        there isn’t enough Xanax on this 
                        island for me to deal with that.

           Owen offers Hayden his arm.  She takes it and he escorts 
           her towards a big stage right at the water’s edge....  

           EXT. KAUAI BEACH - WEDDING STAGE - DUSK

           Hayden gets up on stage and joins RON, her strapping 
           fiance.  They hold hands and together look like the 
           poster couple for genetic engineering.  Owen stands 
           behind them, in front of a JAZZ BAND setting up.  

           Hayden clinks her glass into a mic.  The crowd hushes as 
           all eyes turn to her and Ron.

                                 HAYDEN
                        Hi everyone.  Ron and I want to 
                        thank you all for coming so far to 
                        celebrate with us.  We feel very 
                        loved.  And we want to keep that 
                        feeling going, so we’re forcing 
                        people to come up here and say 
                        nice things about us.  In other 
                        words, lie.  

           Genuine laughter from the crowd.  

                                 HAYDEN (CONT’D)
                        The first person who’s going to 
                        lie to you is Owen Gray.  I’ve 
                        known Owen since second grade.  He 
                        was my best friend and, truth be 
                        told, the first boy I ever kissed.  
                        He’s here tonight with someone 
                        named Chip though, so I don’t know 
                        what that says about my kissing...

           Big laugh from the crowd.  Owen freezes at this.  WHAT!?  
           He looks out at the crowd, at his parents.  And Chip, who 
           gives him a little waive. 

                                 HAYDEN BELL
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, Owen Gray...

           Owen walks up to the stage.  Shakes Ron’s hand.  Gets a 
           hug from Hayden.  She covers the mic as she hands it to 
           him, and whispers in his ear:

           CONTINUED:

                                 HAYDEN
                        You’ll always be my first... 
                        everything. 

                                 OWEN
                        I don’t have a speech.

                                 HAYDEN
                        So wing it.  Just say something 
                        from your heart...

           Hayden walks off to join Ron by the band.  Owen takes the 
           mic.  Looks out over the crowd.  A thousand of the most 
           famous faces ever assembled.  From every industry.  All 
           looking up at him: 

                                 OWEN 
                        Uh, I’m Owen Gray... 

           Owen pauses.  Looks back at Hayden.  Then out into the 
           crowd again.  This time he sees:

           CARA.  Staring up at him.  Something happens to him the 
           moment he sees her.  His entire face changes.  He locks 
           in on her so intensely, he barely notices she’s next to 
           Alex Cole.  After a long silence, Owen says:

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        I wasn’t sure I was going to make 
                        it here tonight.  But now I know 
                        why I was supposed to.  I -

           A loud POP! interrupts Owen.  Followed immediately by all 
           the POWER going off at once.  It’s instantly almost pitch 
           black under the tent.  The sound of the waves crashing is 
           deafening.  Ron yells out, but can barely be heard:

                                 RON
                        Everyone please be calm!  I’m sure 
                        we just blew a fuse.  We’ll have 
                        it back up shortly.  

           The waves continue to crash.  People quickly get anxious, 
           frightened by the darkness.  Soon half the crowd is on 
           its feet, shouting for loved ones, moving towards a house 
           in the distance with its lights on.  

           Owen can sense people leaving.  He calls out into the 
           crowd:

                                 OWEN
                        CARA?!

           Nothing.  He looks down at the mic in his hand.  Yells to 
           where he thinks Ron might be:

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the generator?

           The voice calling back to him is Blair’s:

                                 BLAIR
                        It’s not the generator!  The 
                        entire system is computerized.  
                        There must be a glitch with the 
                        software.

           Owen looks up at the sky. 

                                 OWEN
                        Fine!  I get it!!
                                 (beat, to Blair)
                        Show me where it is!

                                 HAYDEN BELL
                        Owen?  What can you do?! 

           Owen cries out into the darkness:

                                 OWEN 
                        I’m the IT guy for Hip Parent 
                        magazine!  

                                 BLAIR
                        I know where it is.  I helped the 
                        band hook up their gear by it 
                        earlier.

                                 OWEN
                        Show me!

           Owen follows Blair’s voice.  Finds him and they jump off 
           the stage, wind their way through tables.  Owen can sense 
           the crowd thinning out.  Shadows of guests are visible 
           heading towards the house in the distance.  

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Where is it?  Hurry!

                                 BLAIR
                        It’s right over here!

           They come up on a maze of snake-like wires all running 
           through a central COMPUTER.  Owen stands over it, trying 
           to see in the dark.  He feels around.  Tinkering.  The 
           waves still crashing loudly behind him.

           After a moment, Owen grabs the mic he’s still holding 
           onto.  And yells out into the darkness again:

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 OWEN
                        CARA KLEIN!

           A pause, and then faintly in the distance:

                                 CARA
                        What?

           Owen POUNDS the computer.  And as the POWER and LIGHTS 
           FLASH back on, Owen says into the mic, his voice booming 
           over the crowd: 

                                 OWEN
                        I love you.

           The crowd erupts as the beautiful lights glow again under 
           the tent.  Owen looks back at Hayden.  Then turns and 
           heads off in the other direction...

           Owen scans the crowd for Cara.  Finally finds her.  
           Standing next to Alex Cole.  He pushes his way through 
           the people now making their way back to their chairs.  
           Finally gets to her.  They stare at one another.  Until:

                                 CARA
                        Alex, can you...?

           Alex gives Owen a cold stare.  Reluctantly walks off.

                                 OWEN
                        So?  How’d you like my speech?

                                 CARA
                        I’m moving to New York.

                                 OWEN
                        Was it that bad?

                                 CARA
                        I got the Rolling Stone job.  

                                 OWEN
                        Congratulations.  How did you -

                                 CARA
                        Alex knows Jann Wenner.  I met him 
                        here this morning.  Right before I 
                        interviewed Hayden. Had to explain 
                        why I missed her in Chicago -

                                 OWEN
                        I’m sorry.  It was an incredibly 
                        shitty thing to do and I just...

                                         OWEN (CONT'D)
                        didn’t know what I was doing or 
                        what really mattered.  I tried to 
                        fix it, but -  

                                 CARA
                        Well, luckily Alex did.

                                 OWEN
                        Alex is a powerful guy.  

                                 CARA
                        Yeah, he’s kinda perfect.

           A slight pause.  She looks back at Alex across the room.

                                 CARA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t love him though...

           A sly smile creeps across Owen’s face.

                                 OWEN
                        I know exactly what you mean.

           He leans in and kisses her.  Softly at first.  Until it 
           becomes something more. They lose themselves in each 
           other.  Forgetting everything and everyone around them.  
           Owen’s Mom turns to Owen’s Dad, as they watch this:

                                 OWEN’S MOM
                        You owe me fifty bucks.

           Owen’s Dad shrugs apologetically to Chip.

           INT. BEACH ESTATE - MEN’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Owen comes into the bathroom and sees the only open 
           urinal is next to Alex Cole.  He walks over to it.  
           Unzips.  Alex looks over at him.

                                 OWEN
                        Sorry about...everything.  I love 
                        her.  Have for a while.

                                 ALEX COLE
                        That it?

                                 OWEN
                        What else is there?

                                 ALEX COLE
                        You tell me.

                        I quit.  

                                 ALEX COLE
                        Well, saves me having to fire you 
                        I guess...

           Alex Cole flushes.  Walks over and washes his hands.  
           Ignores the ATTENDANT there.  Takes a mint.  Looks at 
           Owen in the mirror.  

                                 ALEX
                        So what’s the story with that Chip 
                        guy?

           Owen pauses, dealing with his considerable surprise.  
           Then:

                                 OWEN
                        I could probably introduce you...

                                 ALEX
                        I’ll be at the bar.

           Alex Cole walks out.  Then the door to the one of the 
           stalls opens.  OPRAH WINFREY walks out.  Looking regal in 
           a beautiful couture dress.  

           She washes up.  Tips the Attendant.  Who Owen notices for 
           the first time is a good-looking young Indian guy.     

           As Owen walks over to the sink, Oprah leaves.  Smiling at 
           the Attendant and calling back as she goes:

                                 OPRAH
                        Night, Raj.  Talk to you soon...

           Owen freezes.  Stares at the Attendant.

                                 RAJEESH
                        What?  Oprah?  She has to use the 
                        men's bathroom.  Girl cant get a 
                        moment's peace in the women’s.

                                 OWEN
                        Raj?!?

           It’s him.  In a uniform, with a t-shirt underneath that 
           says ESCAPE. TRAVEL. LIVE.    

                                 RAJEESH
                        Told you it was something big.

                                 RAJEESH
                        Everything we do, every moment we 
                        do it.

                                 OWEN
                        That’s all you’re gonna give me?

           Rajeesh extends his hand.  The moment Owen touches it, 
           shaking it, something extraordinary happens:

           A WAVE of IMAGES rushes over Owen.  Too fast to process, 
           he can only get a sense of it.  We see it with him, the 
           outcome of all the choices he’s made with the manual, and 
           the interconnectedness of it all: 

           - Owen and Cara moving into their New York apartment... 
           laughing hysterically as they shower together with no 
           shower curtain...

           - Owen and Cara in the crowd at a small wedding for Morty 
           and Mrs. McGreevy...showering them with rice...

           - Owen proposing to Cara in central park...Cara walking 
           down the aisle at their own wedding...being showered with 
           rice themselves...

           - Owen and Cara in a hospital, holding their new baby 
           boy...

           - Owen and Cara singing to their infant son in his 
           crib...

           - Owen front row with Cara at a concert, watching the 
           lead singer...backstage as Cara interviews the band... 

           - Owen reading Cara’s articles for her...then beaming as 
           they open Rolling Stone to see her name in print...

           - Owen teaching computers to his young son...

           - Owen, an older man now, a professor teaching computers 
           at NYU...one STUDENT raising his hand...

           - Owen’s Student putting on a SPACE SUIT, walking out to 
           board the SPACE SHUTTLE...a much older Cara and Owen 
           watching it proudly on TV...   

           - Flashes of dozens of other tiny moments and monumental 
           events that make up a life.  Owen’s life.

           Rajeesh pulls his hand back and the images evaporate like 
           smoke.  Owen takes a long moment to recover.  Looks at 
           Rajeesh, finally understanding.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Oh my...God?

           Rajeesh smiles.  Looks Owen in the eye.  And then, 
           Rajeesh WINKS.

                                                            FADE TO BLACK.

                                 THE END
