                             Based on the novel If I Stay

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Black asphalt meets the horizon of a dove grey sky.  

           All’s calm.  And then - a PINK DODGE DART flies into 
           view, splitting the horizon like a Pepto-colored comet. 

           PUNK MUSIC blares from the OPEN CAR WINDOWS.  CUT TO:

           INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

           A DELICATE FEMALE HAND raises a BOW to meet the strings 
           of a CELLO, then eases into the first notes of a 
           Beethoven sonata.

           A SILVER CELLO CHARM dances off her metal bracelet.

           We cut back and forth between the Dodge blasting punk and 
           the refined cello, both pieces of music getting louder 
           and louder until - 

           The disparate melodies merge into one cacophonous wall of 
           sound as the Dodge disappears behind a curve.

           And then SILENCE.  Followed by the calm voice of MIA, 18. 

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        There’s no one to blame.  Except maybe 
                        the snow...

           The grey sky gets WHITER and WHITER until...

           EXT. HALL HOUSE - ESTABLISHING

           A few half-assed SNOWFLAKES fall from the morning sky.

           We follow the flurries down a modest street of WEATHERED 
           BUNGALOWS, the kind of houses that always need fixing. 

           We move up the steps of the HALL HOUSE.

           At first-glance, it seems like every other quaint abode, 
           but a closer look reveals -

           The porch is painted ACID GREEN and overrun with thrift 
           store lawn furniture.  And, instead of potted plants, we 
           find a family of GNOMES PAINTED LIKE THE MEMBERS OF THE 
           SEX PISTOLS. 

           PUSH IN on the “SID VICIOUS” GNOME, a safety-pin in his 
           cheek, UNION JACK SHIRT, AND SMOKING A BLACK PIPE.
           INT. HALL HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

           We pull out on the PIPE of DENNY SMITH, 40, as he reads 
           the morning paper while NPR drones quietly from a 
           RESTORED STAND-UP RADIO. 

           Denny is dapper in his 50’s CARDIGAN and RETRO GLASSES, 
           but the MINOR THREAT TATTOO on his forearm is a giveaway 
           to his punk rock youth.   

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        That’s Dad.  Seven years ago, he got his 
                        teaching degree and went all Father Knows 
                        Best with his wardrobe.  

           In stumbles KAT, 39, a vixen in a torn T-shirt and 
           yesterday’s eyeliner.  

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        And that’s Mom.  She didn’t.

           Kat plops down and reaches for the FRENCH PRESS COFFEE.

                                 MIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        If you went into a lab and created the 
                        perfect mix of two of them, you’d get 
                        Teddy.

           PAN to TEDDY, an exuberant seven-year-old wildly drumming 
           on his bowl of oatmeal, while Kat pours her coffee.

                                 TEDDY
                        Me too, Mom.  I want some coffee.

                                 KAT
                        No way.  I’m not giving crack to someone 
                        who’s already on speed.  

           As Teddy continues to drum, a chunk of oatmeal flies off 
           his spoon and lands in Kat’s hair.  

                                 KAT (CONT’D)
                        Dude, not before I’m awake.

           She gives him a look, then chucks it back.  But Teddy 
           ducks and the oatmeal blob sails across the table to...

           An oblivious MIA, 18, quietly reading her textbook and 
           listening to CLASSICAL MUSIC on her iPod.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        And that’s me.  Mom and Dad swear I’m 
                        theirs, but I’m still waiting on the DNA 
                        test.
           The oatmeal nails Mia on the forehead.

                                 KAT
                        It was Teddy!  He started it! 

           Mia wipes away the oatmeal with a napkin.  

                                 MIA
                        You people are animals.

           She’s a sport, but is probably more comfortable playing 
           her cello than with her food. 

           Denny looks up from his paper.

                                 DENNY
                        Hey, Mia.  Faceplant got a mention in the 
                        Calendar section.

           He slides the newspaper across the table.  Mia suddenly 
           perks up.  Her anxious eyes search and land on A GRAINY 
           PHOTO OF:  

           A LANKY BOY in a mid-air split with a guitar - ADAM (19).  
           Even in a still shot, the boy has swagger.

           Teddy climbs on the table to get a better look.

                                 TEDDY
                        Look at him, Mia.  Our Adam is famous! 

           Mia’s gaze wanders to a HUGE AD on the facing page for 
           THE BROOKE VEGA CONCERT, with a PHOTO of the smoldering 
           rock goddess herself, MS. BROOKE VEGA. 

           And a line that says - OPENING BAND: FACEPLANT.

                                 DENNY
                        Are they really opening for her?      
                        Man, that’s huge.

                                 MIA
                        It could be.  If she likes them, she’ll 
                        take them on the whole tour.  
                                 (then, a little melancholy)
                        Even Europe.

                                 DENNY
                        Ah, fame.  Wasted on the young.

           Denny stands, gathers the breakfast dishes.  Kat glances 
           at the photo of Adam then back to Mia.
                                 KAT
                        Seems like this is the most we’ve seen of 
                        him since summer.  You going tonight?

                                 MIA
                                 (suddenly defensive)
                        Yeah.  Why wouldn’t I?

                                 KAT
                        Nothing, I just thought maybe...
                                 (then, changing the subject)
                        Ugh.  This news crap is putting me back 
                        to sleep.  Mama needs some real jams --

           Kat reaches for the radio, but there’s a breaking 
           announcement.

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCEMENT
                        ...further weather advisory on that 
                        storm, the Clackamous County School 
                        District is now calling for a snow day.

                                 DENNY
                        Wait -- turn it up, Babe.

           Everyone stops and listens -

                                 NEWS RADIO
                        ....All Clackamous County schools will be 
                        shut down for the day.

           Denny breaks into a slow smile.

                                 DENNY
                        Well, ain’t that a bitch.

           Teddy immediately starts singing and dancing.

                                 TEDDY
                        Schooooool’s out forevah!

                                 DENNY
                        Really?  Alice Cooper.  Son, you’re 
                        killing me.

           Kat slumps.

                                 KAT
                        I can’t believe this.  You’re all just 
                        gonna play hookey without me?  

                                 DENNY
                        It’s not hookey if it’s a snow day.  
                                 KAT
                        So not fair.

                                 TEDDY
                        Life isn’t fair.

                                 KAT
                                 (starting to scheme)
                        True.  But sometimes you can give it a 
                        little nudge.
                                 (starting to cough)
                        It would be terrible to go to work with 
                        this cough...spreading all my germs...

           Kat grabs the PHONE and heads into the other room, past 
           Mia still at the table, lost in the photo of Adam.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        The first time I saw Adam...

           INT. BOOK BARN - DAY

           FLASHBACK - Mia (16), in all her shy preppy glory, 
           clutches a stack of RECORDS.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        ...was at Bookbarn - this dusty, used 
                        bookstore that sells classical records 
                        for twenty-five cents in the back.  
                        Nobody buys them.  Except for me.  
                                 (beat)
                        Not exactly the kind of thing you want to 
                        advertise.

           Mia looks up as ADAM, a budding rock god, and his posse 
           of COOL BANDMATES, walk towards her.

           When they pass, Adam glances down at Mia’s selection of 
           classical records.  He raises an eyebrow.  

           Mia turns and walks into a shelf.

           INT. HALL KITCHEN - DAY 

           Mia’s reverie is broken as Kat dances back into the 
           kitchen, twirling the phone with a wicked grin.

                                 KAT
                        I’m off the hook.
                                 (off Denny’s look)
                        Don’t judge.  I happen to love my family.   
                        So, what are we doing today?
                                 TEDDY
                        Let’s make a snow monster!

                                 DENNY
                                 (glancing out the window)
                        You can make a valiant try, but it’s not 
                        even sticking yet.

                                 KAT
                                 (getting an idea)
                        I know!  Let’s drive out to the farm to 
                        see Henry and Willow and the baby.  
                        Luna’s got to be what -- eleven months 
                        now?   How does that even happen?

                                 TEDDY
                        Can I climb their Hobbit Tree?

                                 DENNY
                        Of course.  

                                 MIA
                        Have fun.  I have to study.

           Mia stands, heads for the hall.  Kat furrows her brow.

           INT. TINY BATHRROOM - DAY

           In the one bathroom of the old house, an impromptu 
           gallery of FAMILY PHOTOS covers every inch of the faded 
           pink wallpaper.

           Kat sits on the sink, trying some blue nail polish as Mia 
           showers behind molted glass.

                                 KAT
                        No one studies on a snow day, Mia.  
                        Not even you.

           The water stops.  Mia steps out in a towel.  

                                 MIA
                        I have to practice.

                                 KAT
                        Listen.  Before you know it, you’ll be 
                        off at college getting a bad haircut and 
                        racking up credit card debt you’ll spend 
                        the rest of your life trying to pay off, 
                        but for now, you’re still my baby, and we 
                        should savor any chance we have to hang 
                        as a fam --  oh, god.  I sound like a 
                        Lifetime movie, don’t I?
                                 MIA
                        You’re not going tell me you have cancer, 
                        are you?

                                 KAT
                        Nope, I check my melons.  I’m good to go.

                                 MIA
                        Perfect.  Then I’m staying here.

           Mia kisses her mom on the cheek then heads down the hall.  

                                 KAT
                                 (calling after her)
                        You can play car DJ.  Any muzak you want.

                                 MIA
                        You’re just bribing me.

           Denny passes Mia in the hall.

                                 DENNY
                        Honey, bribes are the glue that’s kept 
                        teenagers and parents connected for 
                        generations.  Don’t fight tradition.

           Mia sighs.

           INT. FAMILY BUICK - DAY

           On a cold Pacific Northwest road, a brown hand-me-down 
           BUICK drives through a tree-lined road, headed for the 
           country.

           Classical music plays on the stereo.  Everyone sits in 
           pained silence.  Kat squints, trying to make herself like 
           it.

                                 MIA
                        Nevermind, just turn it off.  I know you 
                        guys hate it.

                                 KAT
                        No.  It’s just...an acquired taste.  Like 
                        stinky cheese.

                                 TEDDY
                        You have to picture a story because there 
                        are no words.  Like, I think this song’s 
                        about robots.

                                 MIA
                        Really?
                                 TEDDY
                        Yeah.  It’s about a robot named Lance.  
                        He’s an orphan raised by humans so he 
                        thinks he’s a human too, but then one day 
                        all the robots from space attack all the 
                        humans. 

           The classical piece suddenly gets dark and dramatic.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        And, right here, see this is when Barvo 
                        has to battle the other robots to save 
                        his human family.

                                 MIA
                        I thought his name was Lance?

                                 TEDDY
                        He has two names.  A robot name and a 
                        human name.

           Kat and Denny exchange a look.  

                                 DENNY
                        Mia, you could write this as an opera 
                        when you’re at Juilliard.

                                 MIA
                        Dad - shh! - I haven’t gotten in.

                                 DENNY
                        Oh right.  We’ll all just pretend it’s a 
                        “big mystery”.

           As Teddy continues, Mia’s gaze drifts outside as she 
           traces her finger over the fogged up windows, getting 
           lost in the music.

           She catches Denny observing her in the rearview.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        They would never admit it, but I think my 
                        parents secretly regret putting me in 
                        music class so early.  

           INT. CHILDREN’S ROCK MUSIC CLASS - DAY

           A bunch of SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS get acquainted with rock 
           instruments - guitars, drums, bass, tambourines, etc. 
                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        They were probably expecting me to be 
                        some guitar playing badass like Kim 
                        Gordon...

           FLASH - AN IMAGE of SONIC YOUTH’S KIM GORDON in her early 
           90’s days.  Bass slung low, raw and sexy.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        But instead...

           MIA (7) wanders away from the group and makes a bee line 
           for a DUSTY CELLO slumped in a corner. 

           She slowly reaches out and plucks one of the cello’s 
           chords.  A low haunting sound comes out of it.  

           Mia jumps, scared.  Then...plucks it again.  And grins.

                                 MIA V.O.
                        I loved how human it seemed.  Like you 
                        could play it.  Or crawl inside of it and 
                        it would take care of you.

           INT.  MUSIC CLASS - DAY

           A younger DENNY (spiky hair, leather jacket) and a 
           younger KAT (mod mini dress, combat boots) enter as the 
           class disperses.  

           They stop in their tracks when they see tiny Mia 
           clutching the giant cello...then start laughing.   

           Mia just stares back at them, blankly.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        When they realized I wasn’t kidding, they 
                        found a guy who knew a guy who would  
                        rent us a cello so I could learn to play.  

           EXT.  NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

           Denny, riding his SKATEBOARD, balances the CELLO across 
           his shoulders.

           Kat and Mia ride BIKES on the sidewalk next to him.   
           Mia’s helmet has a “No Blood For Oil” sticker on it.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        And a girl from the local college to give 
                        me cheap lessons. 
           INT. - HALL HOUSE - DAY

           The front door opens.  An unassuming ASIAN GIRL (20) is  
           startled to see Denny.  He leads her inside. 

           The living room is an explosion of INDIE CONCERT POSTERS, 
           INSTRUMENTS and TOYS. 

           Kat’s collection of CREEPY DOLL HEADS lines the mantel.

           Despite the seeming-domestic chaos, Mia is in a chair 
           ready to go with her rented cello.

                                 KAT
                        So, do you guys need anything or...?

                                 MIA
                        Mom, Su-Chen and I can take it from here.

                                 DENNY
                        Right, cool.  Holler if you need us.

           Kat and Denny back away, respectful, but bewildered.    
           Kat whispers as they make their way down the hall.

                                 KAT
                        Are you sure she’s my kid?

                                 DENNY
                        Are you sure she’s mine?

           She kicks him in the ass with her boot.  

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        So, I practiced and practiced...

           EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

           Kat, Denny and a handful of their PUNK SCENE FRIENDS, 
           including HENRY (20s) and WILLOW (20s), barbecue in the 
           summer sun and drink PBRs.

           Their fun is eclipsed by the SCREECHING CELLO bleeding 
           through the house’s open windows.

                                 HENRY
                        Man, Den.  She’s almost ready for our 
                        band.

           Denny throws a guacamole-loaded chip at Henry.
                                 KAT
                        I love her, but I’m this close to 
                        stabbing my eyes out.

                                 WILLOW
                        See. This is why I could never have kids.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        And after three years of torturing them, 
                        I was finally ready for my first concert. 

           INT. MUSIC RECITAL HALL - BACKSTAGE - DAY

           A couple dozen KIDS warm up backstage - a painful aria of 
           screechy violins and clunky fingers on the piano.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        Well, sort of.  I wasn’t a natural 
                        performer.

           MIA (10) hides in the folds of the stage curtain, her 
           terrified eyes peeking out.  She looks left, then right - 
           then runs out.

           EXT. MUSIC RECITAL HALL - DAY

           Denny, still wearing his leather jacket, but now with 
           longer hair, wanders around calling out for Mia.

                                 DENNY
                        Mia!..Mia!...

           He rounds the corner near a row of bushes and then --

                                 MIA
                        Dad.  Psst.  Over here.  

           Denny turns and spots Mia crouched in the bushes.

                                 DENNY
                        Oh.  Hey, Lambchop.  What’s up?

                                 MIA
                        I can’t do it.  I can’t perform.

           Denny parks himself on the ground.

                                 DENNY
                        Really?
                                 (after a long beat)
                        Well, that’s kind of a shame.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DENNY (CONT'D)
                        We already got you a bitchin’ recital 
                        present and everything.

                                 MIA
                        You can give it to someone else.  
                                 (beat, then)
                        I’m just not like you guys.  

           Mia looks up as Kat approaches wearing a vinyl mini, 
           spider web tights and NEWBORN TEDDY in a black BABY-
           BJORN, with his hair in natural faux hawk.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Even Teddy’s cooler than me.

                                 DENNY
                        Are you kidding?  I used to get the most 
                        gnarly jitters before a gig.

                                 MIA
                        You’re just saying that.

                                 DENNY
                        Nope.  Could barely hold my drumsticks my 
                        hands would shake so much.

                                 MIA
                        Really?  But then, how did you play?

                                 KAT
                        He got wasted.  A couple of forties 
                        before every show.  
                                 (then)
                        I don’t recommend that for you.

                                 DENNY
                        Yeah, social services frowns on drunk ten-
                        year-olds.  Besides, when I puked on 
                        stage, it was punk.  I don’t know if that 
                        goes over so well with the classical 
                        music crowd.

           Mia laughs.  She comes out of the bush, plops down next 
           to her dad, thinking.

                                 MIA
                        What if I screw up?  What if I’m 
                        terrible?

                                 DENNY
                        I got news for you, Mia.  There’s gonna 
                        be all kinds of terrible on that stage, 
                        so you won’t really stand out.
                                 (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DENNY (CONT'D)
                        The truth is, there’s no cure for the 
                        jitters.  You just hafta play through ‘em 
                        like everybody else.  That’s what we do.  
                        We’re musicians. 

                                 MIA
                        I was hoping you’d get me a beer.

           Denny stands, musses her hair.

                                 DENNY
                        You wish.  Get in there, Ludwig.

           INT. RECITAL HALL - DAY

           Onstage, Mia plays with her eyes closed, getting through 
           her first recital.  She’s...decent.  Not great.

           But the second she finishes, Denny, Kat (and baby Teddy) 
           are on their feet cheering, throwing the devil horns.

           Other parents - classical music types - just stare.

           EXT. RECITAL PARKING LOT - DAY

           Denny, Kat and Teddy and Mia walk to their GRUNGY FIRST 
           CAR.  Denny pauses...then ceremoniously opens the back 
           door, revealing a CELLO on the seat with a giant bow.  

                                 DENNY
                        And this one’s not a rental.  This baby’s 
                        yours.

                                 MIA
                                 (a gasp)
                        I love it!  

           She throws her arms around the cello.

           LATER, as their car chugs out of the parking lot blasting 
           the NEW YORK DOLLS, we see Mia riding in the backseat, 
           hugging her new cello.  MORPH TO -

           INT. FAMILY BUICK - DAY

           Mia in the back of the car with her family now.  
           Beethoven’s now playing, Teddy is wrapping up his story.  

                                 TEDDY
                        ...and that’s just the first part.  It’s 
                        really a robot trilogy.
                                 DENNY
                        It’s Shakespearean, Ted.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        It’s weird how quickly your whole life 
                        can change.

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Up ahead, around a bend, an OLD GREEN PICK-UP is driving 
           towards them, unnoticed.

           INT. BROWN BUICK - DAY

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        One minute you’re riding in the car with 
                        your family, daydreaming about whether it 
                        will be weird to see Adam tonight.      
                        And the next...

           Denny’s tires hit a patch of ice and SWERVE towards the 
           other lane.  Before there is a even a second to react -

           The GREEN Pick-Up is suddenly there and --

           The SCREEN GOES WHITE.  We don’t see it.  But we hear it:

           SCREECHING TIRES, METAL GRINDING AGAINST METAL and GLASS 
           SHATTERING.  

           A symphony of someone’s whole world being ripped apart.  

           And then nothing...

           But the soft, aching sounds of BEETHOVEN STILL PLAYING ON 
           THE CAR RADIO...drifting into the cold outdoor air.

           MIA’S POV - her eyes slowly flutter open, looking up at 
           the web of tree branches and sky overhead.

           After a moment, Mia sits up on the side of the road, 
           confused, shaken.

           She looks down - not a scratch on her.  She dusts herself 
           off, then turns back to the road.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Mom!  Dad!  
                                 (beat)
                        Teddy?!  

           Nothing.  Just Beethoven on the radio.    
           It’s starting to snow again.  Everything’s foggy.

           And then Mia spots SOMETHING MOVING on the other side of 
           the road.  She runs over.

           As she gets closer...she sees it’s a BLOODY HAND moving, 
           a hand with a little CELLO CHARM BRACELET.             
           It’s HER hand!

           Mia, untouched, is now standing over her own body, which 
           lies twisted in a ditch, her hair covering her face. 

           DARK RED BLOOD starts to ooze through her sweater onto 
           the fresh white snow.  Mia jumps back.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit.

           She takes a deep breath, then exhales in the cold air. 

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        I can’t see my breath.

           She spins around, getting scared.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        MOM!  DAD!  ANYBODY!  TEDDY!  

           The distant wail of SIRENS interrupt her thoughts.             
           RED SPINNING LIGHTS are fast approaching.  CUT TO:

           EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY

           AMBULANCE DOORS burst open and TWO PARAMEDICS JUMP OUT.

           Mia has to dart out of the way as A MALE and FEMALE EMT 
           go to work on her unconscious body, shining a FLASHLIGHT 
           into her unconscious eyes.

           They get busy sticking IVs in her arms.  Mia looks away 
           as they plunge a TUBE in her chest.

           They don’t seem to notice the other Mia watching.

                                 FEMALE EMT
                        Her Glasgow coma is at eight.  Let’s bag 
                        her now!   

           The Female EMT pulls out an inflatable bag with a balloon 
           and starts pumping by hand.
                                 FEMALE EMT (CONT’D)
                                 (calling out)
                        What’s the ETA for Life Flight? 

                                 MALE EMT
                        Um...Twenty?

                                 FEMALE EMT
                        No.  We have to get her there in fifteen.  
                        Tell Portland to be ready.   

           They jump up with Mia’s body on the gurney and rush 
           towards the Ambulance.  MIA, not knowing what to do, runs 
           along with them.

           We get quick, peripheral glimpses of other EMTs on the 
           scene.  Mia overhears one calling in to dispatch.

                                 OTHER PARAMEDIC
                        ...one female, late teens, critical, en 
                        route to Portland now.  One seven year 
                        old male - conscious.  A thirty-something 
                        Male...

           Mia’s paramedics load her body and climb into the 
           ambulance.  And just as the doors are about to shut, Mia 
           jumps into the ambulance with them. 

           INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

           The female paramedic looks down at Mia’s lifeless body, 
           still hand-pumping the air bag and barking at the driver.

                                 FEMALE EMT
                        Damn, Dimitri.  You drive like this is a 
                        golf cart at an old folk’s home.  Let’s 
                        go.

                                 MALE EMT
                        It doesn’t do her any good if we get in a 
                        wreck on the way.

                                 FEMALE EMT
                        And it doesn’t do her any good if she’s 
                        dead before we get there.  

           The siren’s wail slowly MORPHS into the sound of Mia’s 
           cello.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        I had plans to meet Adam in Portland 
                        tonight.  I doubt this is how he’s 
                        expecting me to arrive.
           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - SOUND PROOF REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

           Mia (17) practices her cello in a solo rehearsal room.   
           She’s definitely gotten better over the years.  CUT TO:

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DIFFERENT REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

           In a different solo rehearsal room, Adam (18) practices 
           guitar.  He’s not bad either.  

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        It was the fall of my junior year.  
                        Adam’s senior year.  We both spent a lot 
                        of time in the music wing.

           PULL OUT to the HALL to reveal the practice rooms are 
           side by side, Adam and Mia both attacking their 
           respective instruments, oblivious to one another.

           The SCHOOL BELL rings.  Adam stops playing, gathers his 
           backpack.  Mia, lost in her music, keeps going.  

           INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY 

           Adam watches Mia through her window as she continues to 
           play.  When she looks up - he quickly ducks out of view.

           Mia checks the walls clock, makes a face and quickly puts 
           her CELLO away.  

           As she gathers her books, she looks out into the all and  
           notices Adam being joined by his POSSE of COOL FRIENDS.

           Including LIZ (18), a lithe, teenage Helen-of-Troy in 
           black skinny jeans.  

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

           Mia steps out as Liz throws her arm around Adam.  They 
           walk away with their friends, all cutting up.

           Adam looks back over his shoulder, laughing as he gives 
           Mia a look.  She’s flustered...and maybe more intrigued 
           than she wants to admit.

                                 KIM (O.S.)
                        Ugh.  Just ignore them.

           Mia looks up as her best friend KIM (17), a wry, take-no-
           shit yearbook nerd, wanders up.
                                 MIA
                        I know.  Like I’m not supposed to notice 
                        they’re totally making fun of me?

           Kim and Mia start walking down the hall as Adam and his 
           friends are several paces ahead.  

                                 KIM
                                 (watching Adam)
                        Whatever.  Nobody cares about his stupid 
                        little band and his stupid little club 
                        shows. 

                                 MIA
                        Or his cooler-than-thou friends.

                                 KIM
                        Or his stupid T-shirts with whatever 
                        obscure band on the front.

                                 MIA
                        Seriously.

           She watches Adam and his posse turn down another hallway.

                                 KIM
                        You know, Mia, there are two kinds of 
                        girls.  Those who have boyfriends in high 
                        school...

           They pass AN AMOROUS COUPLE MAKING OUT by a stairwell.  

                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        ...and those who have boyfriends in 
                        college.  Good ones.  That’s us.

           They pass ANOTHER COUPLE with their hands in each others’ 
           back pockets.

                                 MIA
                        One can hope.

                                 KIM
                        So, did you finish the Trig homework?

                                 MIA
                        Yeah, but number four was brutal --

           Mia stops.  Shocked - and maybe intrigued - to see Adam 
           leaned against her locker.   

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        -- What is he doing at my locker?
                                 KIM
                        I’m going to assume he’s lost.

                                 ADAM
                                 (smiles)
                        I’m not lost.

           Mia swallows.  Awkwardly whispers to Kim.

                                 MIA
                        Um, Kim?  I’ll...catch up.

           Kim reluctantly heads to the cafeteria.

                                 KIM
                                 (a firm whisper to Mia)
                        Two kinds of girls, Mia...

           Kim glares at Adam as she exits.  Adam smiles at Mia.

                                 ADAM
                        You’re Mia, right?  Hey.  Adam.

                                 MIA
                        Yeah.  I know.
                                 (then, looking around)
                        Is this some kind of prank?  It is, isn’t 
                        it?  It’s one of those talk-to-the-weird-
                        girl things, right? 

                                 ADAM
                        Wow.  You’re a little paranoid, huh? 

                                 MIA
                        No.  I just happen to notice you and your 
                        friends always laughing at me and --

                                 ADAM
                        -- “Laughing at you?”  
                                 (gives her a look)
                        Mia, we may laugh, but I wouldn’t say 
                        it’s at you.

           The sound of him saying her name suddenly makes her more 
           flustered.

                                 MIA
                        Oh.  Sorry.  I just thought...nevermind.

                                 ADAM
                        No worries. 
                                 (beat, then)
                        So, listen.  I have a question for you.  
                        Do you know who this Yo-Yo Ma cat is?
                                 MIA
                        Of course.  He’s the greatest cellist 
                        alive. 

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah, but what’s with the name?  Is it 
                        short for, like, “Yo Mama” or something?

                                 MIA
                        It’s Chinese.  Don’t mock The Master.

                                 ADAM
                        I wouldn’t dare.  
                                 (beat)
                        But what would you say if I told you I 
                        had tickets to see “The Master?”

                                 MIA
                        Really?  How did you get them?  They’re 
                        like 80 bucks a piece. 

                                 ADAM
                        A friend of the family gave them to my 
                        mom, but she can’t go.  I thought you 
                        might be interested.  In going.  With me.    

                                 MIA
                        Wait.  You’re...asking me out?

                                 ADAM
                        Try not to look so shocked.

           Mia’s flattered, but still unsure.  

                                 MIA
                        I’m not just some novelty, y’know.

                                 ADAM
                                 (a wry smile)
                        Neither am I.  See you at seven.

           Adam pushes off her locker and heads down the hall.  

           Mia watches him, a tiny smile spreads across her face.  
           Mia quickly recomposes as Kim walks up.

                                 KIM
                        OK, what was that about?

                                 MIA
                        Nothing.  He just had a Trig question.

                                 KIM
                        Liar.
           INT. MIA’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Teddy is flopped on Mia’s bed, cracking himself up with 
           old Calvin and Hobbes books.

           Kat leans in the doorway casually eating a yogurt as Mia 
           nervously sorts through her clothes, hating everything.

                                 KAT
                        He’s just a guy, Mia.

                                 MIA
                        I know.  But he’s the first one I’ve ever 
                        been on a maybe-date with.  I don’t know 
                        if I’m supposed to wear date-clothes or 
                        hanging-with-friends-clothes.

                                 KAT
                        Just wear something you’re comfy in.  
                        That way you’re covered.  

           The doorbell RINGS.  

                                 MIA
                        I think I’m gonna puke.

                                 KAT
                                 (holding up a trash can)
                        Better before the date, than on the date.

           INT. HALL HOUSE - EVENING

           Denny opens the door to find an equally nervous Adam in a 
           FULL SUIT.  Skinny black tie.

                                 DENNY
                        Nice threads.  Come on in.

           Adam enters.  Denny shakes his hand.

                                 DENNY (CONT’D)
                        I’m the old man.  Denny Hall.

                                 ADAM
                        I know.  You were in Witness Protection, 
                        right?

                                 DENNY
                                 (a little surprised)
                        I was.  A hundred years ago.
           FLASHBACK - INT. PORTLAND CLUB - NIGHT

           1994.  Shirtless and sporting a BLUE MOHAWK, a 24 YEAR 
           OLD DENNY bangs the shit out of some drums with his 
           GRUNGE PUNK band, WITNESS PROTECTION.

           In the audience, a 23 YEAR OLD KAT with PURPLE HAIR and a 
           HELLO KITTY BARRETTE holds a sleeping, TWO-YEAR-OLD Mia 
           with AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL HEADPHONES on her delicate ears.

           A SWEATY DUDE flies out of the mosh pit, a little too 
           close to Kat and Mia.  Not missing a beat, Kat boot-kicks 
           his fat ass back into the pit.

                                 MOSH PIT OAF
                                 (yelling back at Kat)
                        BITCH!

                                 KAT
                        THANK YOU!  THAT’S JUST ANOTHER WORD FOR 
                        FEMINIST!

           Kat smiles back at Denny who continues to obliterate the 
           drums onstage.  Cut back to:

           INT.  HALL LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Adam looks at Denny, trying to make sense of musician-
           turned-dad standing before him.

                                 ADAM
                        So...like, what happened to you guys?

                                 DENNY
                                 (a wry smile)
                        We fought the man and the man won.  
                                 (then)
                        I still play.  When I get the itch. 

                                 ADAM
                        Cool.  I have a couple of your CDs.

                                 DENNY
                        Well.  Bless your heart.  They make 
                        lovely coasters. 

           Mia appears.  She and Adam share a nervous smile.  Then -

                                 MIA
                        OK.  We should go.
           INT. ADAM’S CAR - EVENING 

           Kat, Denny and Teddy wave from the front porch as Adam 
           and Mia pull away in his car.

                                 DENNY
                        Be careful.  I hear the mosh pit at the 
                        last Yo-Yo Ma show was insane.

                                 KAT
                        Have fun!  Don’t get pregnant!

           Adam laughs.  Mia shakes her head.  

                                 ADAM
                        Man.  Your parents are so cool.

                                 MIA
                        I know.  They’re cooler than me.

           INT. ARLENE SCHNITZER HALL - NIGHT

           A historic theatre in downtown Portland.  An OLDER CROWD 
           fills the lobby.  Adam and Mia stand there, awkward.

                                 ADAM
                        Wow.  The scene is very...

                                 MIA
                        “Early Bird Special?”

           Adam laughs and nods.  The HOUSE LIGHTS start to blink.

           INT. ARLENE SHCNITZER HALL - BALCONY - NIGHT

           Mia and Adam settle into their seats, far from the stage.

                                 ADAM
                        Sorry.  They’re kind of nosebleeds.

                                 MIA
                        It’s OK.  You don’t come to Yo-Yo Ma for 
                        the view.

           The MUSIC STARTS.  MORPH TO:

           Mia and Adam LISTENING TO THE PERFORMANCE.  He shifts 
           awkwardly in his seat, trying to get into it.

           He notices Mia’s eyes are closed; she’s in another world.  
           He looks down at her fingers playing along, like “air 
           cello.”  Adam smiles.
           Mia glances up, catches him looking.  She looks away. 

           As the music swells, Adam finally reaches for Mia’s hand - 
           their first touch.

                                 ADAM
                        Whoa.  Your hand’s freezing.

           Embarrassed, Mia jerks it back, but Adam doesn’t let go.  
           He blows on her hand, warming it up.  

           She looks down at their intertwined fingers in the dark.   
           She leans over and whispers.

                                 MIA
                        You have calluses.

                                 ADAM
                                 (smiles)
                        So do you.

           EXT. HALL STREET/ HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mia stands with Adam by his car, not sure what to do.

                                 MIA
                        OK.  Um, well, thanks.  Goodnight.

           Mia starts to go, leaving Adam standing there, not sure 
           if she’s blowing him off or what.  

           After a few steps, Mia suddenly turns and looks back.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Um, Adam?  Why me?  Why did you ask me 
                        out?

                                 ADAM
                        I dunno.  I guess...music’s my life, but 
                        I’ve never seen anyone get into it like 
                        you, y’know?  When you practice, it’s 
                        like you go to some other place.
                                 (beat)
                        And you get the cutest little crease in 
                        your forehead.

                                 MIA
                        You watch my forehead when I practice?

                                 ADAM
                        Sometimes.  All the time.
                                 MIA
                        Oh.   Well, I like your suit.

                                 ADAM
                        Thanks for noticing.

           And, in a burst of exuberance, Mia turns back to him and 
           goes to kiss his cheek.  But she stumbles...and her lips 
           just graze his neck, but mostly get air.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Whoa -- what was that?

           Mortified, Mia pulls back.

                                 MIA
                        Sorry, that was, um - see you at school.

           Mia, quickly turns and practically sprints to her porch.

           Adam watches her go, bemused.  Then calls out -

                                 ADAM
                        Hey.  For the record, it took me three 
                        weeks of delivery tips to save up for 
                        those tickets.  

                                 MIA
                                 (a little smile to herself)
                        Totally worth it.

           INT. HALL HOUSE - NIGHT

           Kat and Denny jump from the window trying to look casual 
           as Mia enters.  Teddy’s little pajama-clad feet sprint 
           out of the room - all of them obviously spying.  

                                 MIA
                        Subtle.  You guys should join the C.I.A.

                                 KAT
                        But wait.  How was it?

                                 MIA
                        Total disaster.  

           And as soon as she’s out of her parents’ sight, Mia makes 
           a giddy little jump.  CUT TO:

           EXT. PORTLAND HOSPITAL - DAY

           The EMTs jump out of the Ambulance. 
           INT. ER TRAUMA UNIT - DAY

           The scene is chaos.  Mia runs behind the EMTs rushing her 
           body past the ER, straight to the TRAUMA UNIT where a 
           TEAM of DOCTORS and NURSES is already waiting.

                                 EMT
                        Collapsed lung, broken ribs - looks like 
                        three - abrasions on the legs, face.  
                        Brain contusions, full extent unknown.  
                        And an internal bleed --

           The trauma team takes over, swarming Mia’s body like 
           locusts with IVs, ultrasounds, x-ray.

           A CURTAIN is yanked closed. 

           Mia, now outside the curtain, is not sure where to stand 
           or sit.  She turns, sees a NURSES’ STATION.  And 
           approaches.

                                 MIA
                        Excuse me?  Where’s my family?  Are they 
                        here?  Are they coming?  

           TWO NURSES breeze past her like she’s not there.

           Mia notices THE ER PATIENT SIGN-IN SHEET.  She tries to 
           look at the names, but ANOTHER NURSE grabs it -- 

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me, I was looking at that.

           -- And walks away with it.  And now it really sinks in.  

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        OK, I may not be dead.  
                                 (beat, scared)
                        But I’m definitely not with the living.

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        Ruptured spleen!  We need to move!

           The curtain FLIES back open and the trauma team is on the 
           move with Mia’s body again.

           Mia, already out of breath, follows them.

                                 MIA
                        Jeez.  It’s like I’m the baton in some 
                        really awful relay race.

           The SURGEON looks down at Mia’s body as they rush her to 
           surgery.
                                 DOCTOR
                        If she wants to stay, she better start 
                        swinging.

           Mia just looks at him, her eyes going wide.

                                 MIA
                        What!?  Like I have a choice?  What am I 
                        supposed to do -- breathe harder?  Tell 
                        me what to do?!

           The team rushes past THREE RESIDENTS, all chatting in the 
           hall.

                                 TRAUMA NURSE 
                        Hey guys.  Ruptured spleen.

           Their look up, their interest suddenly piqued.

                                 OTHER RESIDENT
                        No way.  

                                 RESIDENT DOCTOR
                        I’m scrubbing in!  

                                 MIA
                                 (running, trying to keep up 
                                 with the doctor)
                        Am I...go to die?

           The team keeps moving with Mia’s body, focused, intense - 
           offering her no answers.  Mia feeling helpless, lost.

           They keep going, past a WAITING ROOM.  Mia notices on a 
           TEENAGE COUPLE who sit quietly.  Her gaze falls on their  
           entwined hands.  Mia wishes she had that right now.

                                 MIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It was fast, but I think Adam and I were 
                        falling for each other that first night.  
                        In books and movies, the happily-ever-
                        after is just assumed.  
                                 (beat)
                        But in real life, it’s more complicated.

           EXT. PORTLAND DIVE CLUB - NIGHT

           CLOSE on Adam holding Mia’s hand and carrying his GUITAR 
           as they approach the back entrance of a thumping hole-in-
           the-wall club.

           The other, older bandmates, SCOTTY and JO, carry in their 
           DRUMS, GUITAR, etc.
           Liz, unloading HER BASS and AMP from her PINK DODGE DART, 
           nuzzles up to Adam the minute she sees him.

                                 LIZ
                        Adam!  Biscuit!  Mmm, you smell yummy.

                                 ADAM
                        Thanks, I bathed.  Liz, this is Mia.

           Mia looks way out of place. 

                                 MIA
                        Um, hi.

                                 LIZ
                                 (not sure what to say)
                        Oh, uh, hey. Welcome to our little world.

           Mia already wants to go home.  CUT TO:

           INT. PORTLAND CLUB - NIGHT

           Faceplant plays, tearing up the place.  It’s LOUD.

           Mia, watching Adam from the wings, is surrounded by 
           SCENESTERS getting into it, knowing every lyric.  

           A GUY spills his BEER all over Mia as he dances.

                                 ADAM
                                 (singing)
                        Cause suicidal girls need it too/ You may 
                        hate yourself, but I love you/ They all 
                        say you’re clinical/ I just say they’re 
                        cynical/ Suicidal girls need love too...

           Mia overhears TWO CLUB GIRLS behind her.

                                 CLUB GIRL #1
                        You know Adam totally wrote that for 
                        Darcy when she cheated on him in rehab.

           They glance at a nearby rock-hottie - DARCY (19), making 
           out with a TATTOOED DUDE wearing guy-liner.  

                                 CLUB GIRL #2
                        Oh please.  He wrote it for Jess.  She 
                        did the psych-ward vacay before Darcy 
                        even knew what a razor blade was.

           She turns reverentially to JESSE (20), a badass bombshell 
           slouched against a back wall, playing with a LIGHTER.
           Darcy and Jesse are clearly a certain type of girl.  Mia 
           is not that girl.

           She tries to ignore this truth, turning her gaze back to 
           THE STAGE - 

           Where Liz and Adam now play a killer back to back guitar 
           solo.  They have amazing chemistry. 

           Mia feels more out of place than ever.

           BACKSTAGE - LATER

           In a graffitied GREEN ROOM, a BOTTLED WATER, an empty 
           BEER CAN and a piece of cheese float in a tub of melting 
           ice.

           The air is thick with conversations about music.

           Liz chats with her PINK-HAIRED friend, ASTRID (18).  

           As Adam changes out of his sweaty T-shirt, Liz reaches 
           out and tweaks his nipple.  They all laugh.

                                 LIZ
                        You know you love it, fame whore.

           Mia finds herself backed out of the circle, sitting alone 
           on a JANKY OLD COUCH.  Scotty plops down next to her.

                                 SCOTTY
                        So, what bands are you into?

                                 MIA
                        Just, um, classical mostly.

                                 SCOTTY
                        Right on.  I love me some classic rock.

           Mia just nods.  She watches COOL PEOPLE take turns 
           talking to Adam.  After a beat, she stands up and exits.

           EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

           Mia walks out into the cold night, not sure where to go.

           She turns as Adam runs out, catching up.

                                 ADAM
                        Where are you going?  Don’t you like me 
                        anymore? 
                                 MIA
                        Yeah.  I’m just...I don’t want to keep 
                        you from basking in it.  Go.  Bask.

                                 ADAM
                                 (gives her a look)
                        OK.  Scale of one to ten - how miserable 
                        is this?

                                 MIA
                        Um...six-ish?  It’s so weird.  You have 
                        fans.  And ex-girlfriends.  And ex-
                        girlfriends who are fans.

                                 ADAM
                        Ouch, really?  Only a six?

           Mia shrugs.  There is a long awkward beat.

                                 MIA
                        I just feel like some social experiment.  
                        Maybe you should date Liz?   She’s 
                        stunning and you guys clearly have a lot 
                        in common.

                                 ADAM
                        True.  One thing Liz and I have in common 
                        is that we both like girls.  
                                 (beat, then)
                        She and Astrid are together.

                                 MIA
                        The one with the pink hair?
                                 (Adam nods)
                        Wow.  Go Astrid.   
                                 (beat, then)
                        I’m sorry.  This just isn’t my scene.

           He takes her hand, blows on it to warm it up.  

                                 ADAM
                        I get that.  But maybe you could try?  
                        There’s an after-party at Darren’s and --

           -- Mia is tempted, but looks up just as Adam’s backstage 
           posse pours out the club, all loud and laughing, full of 
           fearless energy.

                                 MIA
                        I have, um, my curfew.

           Adam nods, trying to be a sport.
           EXT.  HALL HOUSE PORCH - NIGHT

           As Adam drops Mia off, band members and friends call out 
           from the window of his parked car in the street. 

                                 SCOTTY
                        Do it!  Kiss the Amish girl!

                                 JO
                        Yeah!  Rumspringa!

                                 ADAM
                                 (an embarrassed laugh)
                        They’re not really pigs, they’re just 
                        drunk.

                                 MIA
                        They’re drunk pigs.

           Adam laughs, then pulls Mia out of view of his friends, 
           trying desperately to have some kind of moment with her.

                                 ADAM
                        Look.  You’re not a social experiment, 
                        OK?  I just bummed you can’t come out.

                                 KAT
                                 (through the window)
                        Oh Mia, just go.  It’s fine.

                                 MIA
                        MOM!?

                                 DENNY
                                 (through the window)
                        Kat, get away from the window!

                                 ADAM
                        Wait.  Your parents are cool with you to 
                        staying out?   But you don’t want to. 

           Mia looks at him, dying to say yes, but overwhelmed by 
           insecurity.

                                 MIA 
                        I’m just...catching a cold is all.

                                 ADAM
                        Right.  Well, let me know when you get 
                        over it.  

           He lets go of her hand as he turns and jumps off the 
           porch, a small gesture that breaks Mia’s heart.
                                 KAT (O.S.)
                        Hey Adam?

           They both turn to see Kat standing in the OPEN DOORWAY.  
           Mia is suddenly mortified.

                                 MIA
                        Mom.  Get in the house!

                                 KAT
                                 (to Adam)
                        We always have these Stragglers Dinners 
                        on Sundays.  Y’know, for whoever happens 
                        to drop by.  You’re welcome to crash.

                                 ADAM
                        Thanks, maybe I’ll check it out.

           Adam smiles and heads back in the car with his screaming 
           friends.  Mia turns to her mother, incredulous.

                                 MIA
                        That was so wrong on so many levels.

           Mia storms off to her room.  Denny intercepts Kat trying 
           to follow her.  He gives her a you crossed the line look.

                                 KAT
                        What?!  The boy’s obviously smitten with 
                        her and she’s tanking with her crazy 
                        insecurity.  We can’t let her bomb, Den.  

                                 DENNY
                        So?  They’ll figure it out.  We sure did.

                                 KAT
                        Yeah, because I didn’t act like a crazy 
                        insecure girl.

                                 DENNY
                        No, you acted like a crazy stalker girl.

                                 KAT
                        It worked, didn’t it?
                                 (then) 
                        I just wish she’d realize how amazing she 
                        is.  Why doesn’t she know?

           All of a sudden, the sounds of Mia in her room playing 
           cello echoes through the house.

           Denny and Kat suddenly stop.
                                 DENNY
                        Is that...that’s not a CD, right?

                                 KAT
                        No, it’s her.  She’s kinda kicking ass, 
                        huh?

                                 DENNY
                        Kinda?  Man, when did she get this good?

                                 KAT
                        I dunno.  Maybe she’s fueled by her 
                        newfound, sexual frustration.

                                 DENNY
                                 (winces)
                        Thanks for ruining it.

                                 KAT
                                 (then, seductive)
                        C’mere.  I’ll make it up to you.

           Kat playfully pushes him on the couch.  Mia’s Cello 
           swells and merges with a LARGER CLASSICAL PIECE...

           INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

           A LARGER CLASSICAL PIECE that plays from a little BOSE 
           STEREO as the trauma team operates on Mia’s body.

           A dozen doctors and nurses are wedged around her body 
           under HOT LIGHTS as Mia watches off to the side. 

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        It’s nothing like TV, where the floors 
                        are clean and the doctors share witty 
                        banter over the patient.

           The scene is surreal, like a war zone.  Blood is 
           everywhere. 

           TWO SURGEONS work in unison, wearing CLEAR PLASTIC FACE 
           SHIELDS that get splattered with blood as they slice and 
           suck.

           The floor is disgusting.  Piles of BLOOD-SOAKED GAUZE and 
           TRASH, WRAPPERS from needles and tubes.  

           A nurse replaces the surgeon’s sweat-soaked BLUE MASK, 
           slipping a clean one on him.  

           Mia looks on in horror as they work her body like a piece 
           of meat.
                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Careful.  That’s my body.

           Mia shudders, leaning against a counter.  She notices 
           some laid out MEDICAL UTENSILS.  Mia slowly pushes one 
           off the counter.  It falls, CLATTERS LOUDLY on the floor.  

           Nobody looks up.  Nobody saw it.  To them, Mia is not 
           there.  The utensil is back on the counter.

           Frustrated, Mia takes a WHOLE TRAY and flips it off the 
           counter, a CACOPHONY OF NOISE ripping through the room.

           The team keeps working, the music keeps playing.  

                                 SURGEON
                        Call the blood bank.  I need to two units 
                        of O-Neg.  And keep two ahead.

                                 OTHER SURGEON
                        If we need more, maybe we can get a match 
                        from a relative.

           The mention of relative shakes Mia.

                                 MIA
                        I need to get out of here.

           She turns and tries to walk through A WALL.  She bounces 
           off and hits the floor.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Ow.

           She stands as a nurse walks through the operating door 
           with a BAG FULL OF BLOOD.  

           Mia brushes past the oblivious nurse and the bag of 
           blood, as she runs out the swinging door.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALL - OUTSIDE OPERATING ROOMS

           Mia, in the hall now, passes other HOSPITAL STAFF who zip 
           by, oblivious.

           She notices other OPERATING ROOMS, starts peeking in 
           their WINDOWS.

           One room has an OBESE PATIENT, clearly not her family.

           One room is empty.
           Mia stops when she sees a TEAM working on a MAN with 
           Denny’s physique.  His face is covered as they work on 
           his HEAD.

           Mia slips into the room when a RESIDENT DOCTOR steps in 
           to observe.

           INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

           Unlike Mia’s operating room, the mood here is less tense, 
           calm.

           Mia watches as the Resident quietly approaches the table.  
           He whispers to an ATTENDING NURSE.

                                 RESIDENT DOCTOR
                        Then car accident out by Cedar Creek?

                                 ATTENDING NURSE
                        Yeah.  I think we’re getting all of them.  

                                 SURGEON
                        We’re almost done here.  No long-term 
                        damage, just have to relieve the swelling 
                        here.  This guy lucked out.

           Mia sees DENNY’S PIPE & WALLET on a nearby try.  Mia 
           sighs, relieved to know her dad’s in good hands.  CUT TO:

           INT. HALL HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Denny enters the kitchen as Mia helps Kat plate food for 
           a TAKE-OUT BUFFET.

                                 DENNY
                        Hey, Mia.  I found this loitering 
                        outside.  Do we want him? 

           She looks up to see Adam standing with her dad. 

                                 ADAM
                        Hey.  Hope it’s cool I came.

                                 MIA
                                 (fumbling an egg roll)
                        Yeah.  No, it’s totally cool.

           The house overflows with a motley crew of old bandmates, 
           new teacher colleagues, a few kids.

           Willow, who is now pregnant and wearing hospital scrubs, 
           barges in.
                                 WILLOW
                        I just worked a double and need to feast.

           OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN WINDOW, a game of pick-up basketball 
           by aging Punk Dudes is starting up in the DRIVE WAY.

           Henry pokes his head in.

                                 HENRY
                        Hey Den, you in or what?

                                 DENNY
                        I am.
                                 (then, turning to Adam)
                        You play?

                                 ADAM
                        I’m no LeBron, but I get the basic 
                        concept.

                                 DENNY
                        Mia?  Can we borrow your young lad?

           She gives Adam a look - go ahead, if you want.  Cut to:

           LATER

           Mia, Kat and Willow, who is stuffing her pregnant face, 
           watch the pick-up game from the kitchen window.

           Despite Adam’s modesty, he and Denny set each other up 
           for some sweet shots, turning it into their own show.

                                 WILLOW
                                 (whispering to Mia)
                        Well, if it doesn’t work out with you 
                        two, maybe your old man can date him.

           Adam grabs Teddy from the sideline and holds him over the 
           basket for a dunk.  Teddy LOVES it.  So does Mia.

           Back on defense, Adam goes to block a pass, and as he 
           catches it, he suddenly winces, gripping his hand.

                                 ADAM
                        Ow.  Fuuuuuu -
                                 (remembering kids are there)
                        -uhaaax Machine.  A bee just stung me.

           Denny rushes over, looks at Adam’s hand. 

                                 DENNY
                        Don’t move.  I have a trick.  
           Denny takes Adam’s hand and proceeds to SUCK the stinger 
           out from his palm.   Mia looks mortified.  But -

                                 DENNY (CONT’D)
                        Got it.

                                 ADAM
                        Wow.  That’s impressive.

           Everyone laughs and applauds.  Kat calls through the 
           window.

                                 KAT
                        And on that note, maybe we should nosh 
                        before Willow eats everything.

           EXT. HALL HOUSE/ BACK YARD - EVENING

           As everyone heads inside, Mia catches up with Adam.

                                 MIA
                        I’m so sorry.  Do you feel violated?   
                        Was that just totally weird?  

                                 ADAM
                        Hm.  I guess the only weird thing is that 
                        I’ve hung out with you a few times now, 
                        and as of this moment, I’ve been more 
                        intimate with your dad than I have with 
                        you. 

           He gives Mia a look and smiles.

                                 MIA
                        I guess, um, we’ll have to fix that.

                                 ADAM
                                 (nods, moves close to her)
                        I guess we will.  
                                 (even closer)
                        I wonder what we could do.

           And closer until finally...they kiss - this time for 
           real.  Adam knows exactly where to put his hands, but Mia 
           fumbles trying to figure it out.

           Adam laughs a little.  Mia suddenly pulls back.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Hey, wait.  Don’t stop.

                                 MIA
                        Sorry.  I’m just not at your skill level.
                                 ADAM
                                 (kissing her more)
                        It’s not a test, Mia.  It works better 
                        when you’re not judging yourself.

           He goes back to kissing her.  And she goes back to trying 
           - awkwardly.   

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        Yeah, it’s pretty embarrassing.  But I’d 
                        rather be back there.  Than here.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Mia walks through a hospital corridor, desperate to find 
           the rest of her family.  She comes upon -

           A WAITING ROOM

           Where a HANDSOME DOCTOR talking to a YOUNG BOY (10) in an 
           ARM CAST and his PRETTY MOTHER.

                                 HANDSOME DOCTOR
                        So, six weeks, Mister, and you’ll be as 
                        good as new.  Let’s get you checked out.

                                 PRETTY MOTHER
                        Thank you so much.

           They follow the doctor out of the room revealing TWO OLD 
           PEOPLE, sitting nervously on chairs.  Mia gasps.

                                 MIA
                        Gran?  Gramps?!

           GRAN - in a dirt-stained Gardening Smock, WELLIES and 
           ANGEL NECKLACE.  She also clutches her ANGEL KEY CHAIN.  

                                 Mia CONT’D)
                        Gran thinks angels are everywhere.
                                 (looking around)
                        I’m not so sure.

           And GRAMPS - a tough old cob in a flannel shirt and muddy 
           work boots.  Mia sits down next to them.  They don’t see 
           her.

                                 MIA
                        What have they told you?  Where’s Mom?  
                        And Teddy?   
                                 GRAN
                                 (suddenly turning to Gramps)
                        I just can’t sit here waiting.

           She pops up and heads to the nearby NURSES’ STATION.  Mia 
           follows.  The YOUNG NURSE looks up.

                                 GRAN (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me, my name is Estelle Hall.  My 
                        son, Denny Hall and his wife Kathleen and 
                        their two children were in a car accident 
                        this morning and we need to know --

                                 NURSE
                        -- Ma’am, I know.  We are working on it, 
                        but I need you to be patient.

           The Nurse looks relieved as a woman in a BEIGE CARDIGAN 
           and BIRKENSTOCKS, LIDDY HALL (40s), tries to sneak past.

                                 NURSE (CONT’D (CONT’D)
                        Liddy, hey.  Thus is Mrs. Hall.   The car 
                        accident at Cedar Creek?   That’s her 
                        family.  Do we have any updates?

                                 LIDDY 
                                 (trying to be brief)
                        Right, Hi, Mrs. Hall.  I’m Liddy Davis, 
                        your social worker.  I just got assigned 
                        your case three minutes ago, so I’m 
                        trying to find out everything now --

                                 GRAN
                                 (following her)
                        -- But we don’t know what’s going on.

                                 LIDDY
                        I don’t either yet.  I know this is very 
                        difficult, but please bear with me while 
                        I get all the facts.  I do know that, 
                        Mia, is it?

                                 GRAN
                        Yes, that’s our granddaughter.  
                        She’s going to Juilliard.  

                                 MIA
                        Really Gran?  You have to bring that up 
                        now!?

                                 LIDDY
                        Well, she’s in surgery right now and it’s 
                        proceeding.  I’ll try to get an update.
                                 (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 LIDDY (CONT'D)
                        Do you have anyone to call?  Relatives 
                        who could be here?  The stronger you can 
                        be, the more it will help your family.

           Mia suddenly turns and looks at Gran.

                                 MIA
                        Adam!  Call Adam. 
                                 (then)
                        Crap.  Who gives their Gran their 
                        boyfriend’s cell phone number?  
                                 (thinking, then)
                        Kim.  Call Kim.

                                 MIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I was afraid to tell Kim about Adam.  We 
                        had a pact - we were the girls who 
                        weren’t going to date until college.    
                        And now that was changing.  

           INT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

           Mia works on her laptop.  Kim edits YEARBOOK PHOTOS on 
           her computer, while sucking down a giant FRAPPUCCINO.

                                 KIM
                                 (talking to her laptop)
                        OK, Hilary Weaver, I’m erasing your 
                        double chin in this photo, because even 
                        though you’re kind of a bitch to me in 
                        Latin, I am the bigger, better person.

                                 MIA
                        I need to tell you something.

                                 KIM
                                 (not looking up)
                        Something about having a boyfriend?

                                 MIA
                        Maybe.  How did you know?

                                 KIM
                        Please.  It’s the hottest gossip since 
                        Jen Farrow dropped out to have her baby.  
                        Anyway, I knew before you did.

                                 MIA
                        Shut up.

                                 KIM
                        Come on.  A guy like Adam going to see    
                        Yo-Yo Ma?  He was buttering you up.
                                 MIA
                                 (beat)
                        I was afraid you’d be pissed at me.

                                 KIM
                        Why would I be pissed?  My bestie’s 
                        finally gettin’ some.  If it can’t be me, 
                        it might as well be you.  You are gettin’ 
                        some, right?

                                 MIA
                        Um...sort of.

                                 KIM
                        Good.  Just promise me you won’t turn 
                        into one of those “we” couples.  
                                 (beat)

           Kim gags.  Mia smiles.

                                 MIA
                        Oh no.  We’ve already decided we won’t do 
                        that.

                                 KIM
                        Seriously, if you turn into one of those 
                        girls, I will shoot you.

                                 MIA
                        If I turn into one of those girls, I’ll 
                        give you the gun.

                                 KIM
                        Deal.  
                                 (then, leaning in)
                        So, what do you mean “sort of?”

                                 MIA
                        It’s just...he’s Adam.  He’s been with 
                        tortured college girls.  The only thing 
                        I’ve tortured is my pillow.  

                                 Kim
                        Well.  Practice makes perfect, right?  

           Kim spins her laptop to Mia, revealing a YOU TUBE VIDEO 
           titled How to Be a Great Lover.  

                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        Look.  It’s French so they really know 
                        what they’re doing.
           Kim hits PLAY and a FEMALE, FRENCH-ACCENT narrates the 
           FUZZY COUPLE making out.

           The IMAGE suddenly gets VERY GRAPHIC, and Mia quickly 
           slams the laptop shut, scandalized and laughing.

                                 MIA
                        Oh my god, Kim!  That’s like porn.

                                 KIM
                        It’s not porn, if it’s educational.  
                        I’ll send you the link.  
                                 (beat)
                        It is very educational.

           CLOSE ON a SMILING WAITRESS walking past them with TWO 
           CUPS OF COFFEE.   CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Liddy carries TWO CUPS OF COFFEE to Gran and Gramps in 
           the waiting room.  She takes a seat next to them.

                                 LIDDY
                        OK.  I haven’t gotten to speak to 
                        anyone’s doctors yet, but Denny is still 
                        in surgery.  And Teddy was conscious when 
                        he arrived.  He is getting a catscan now.  

           Gran and Gramps seem a little relieved at this.  So does 
           Mia.

                                 LIDDY (CONT’D)
                        A soon as they’re done, they’ll assign 
                        him a room and you can go see him.

                                 GRAN
                        OK.

                        Now, Kathleen, is it?  We’re having a 
                        difficult time locating her in the 
                        system.  
                                 GRAN
                        No, Davidson.  She goes by Kat Davidson.  

                                 GRAMPS
                                 (barely audible)
                        Never took his name.

                                 LIDDY
                                 (reassuring)
                        Oh.  OK, great.  I can look her up that 
                        way.

           Mia watches as Gramps covertly pours his coffee into a 
           nearby plant.  He starts pulling DEAD LEAVES off the 
           neglected tree, letting them fall to the floor.  They

           EXT/ INT. HALL HOUSE -DAY

           Falling leaves in October. 

           A week from Halloween, Kat puts the finishing touches on 
           the front yard made over with the kind of gusto most 
           folks reserve for Christmas - skulls, spiderwebs, ghosts 
           hanging from the tree.  

           Mia opens the front door to find Adam holding a PIZZA. 
           Teddy immediately grabs the pizza and runs off with it.

                                 ADAM
                        Yo, dude.  You forgot my tip.

                                 MIA
                                 (trying to be sexy)
                        I’ve got your tip right here.

           It’s so awkward, Adam assumes she’s joking.  

                                 ADAM
                        See?  You’re smart and you’re funny.

                                 MIA
                        Yeah, I’m a total...riot.

           Adam proudly holds up a GARMENT BAG.

                                 ADAM
                        So, check it out.  I just scored the best 
                        costume ever.

           He unzips it, giving her a tiny peak of a FRILLY SHIRT.
                                 MIA
                        You’re going as Puffy Shirt Seinfeld  

                                 ADAM
                        Try Mozart.

                                 MIA
                        Wow.  You must have big plans.

                                 ADAM
                        We do.  It’s our first Halloween 
                        together.  And the band has a huge show, 
                        which you can’t back out of because you 
                        already promised you’d go.

                                 MIA
                                 (genuinely pained)
                        Yeah, but I also promised Teddy I’d take 
                        him trick-or-treating and he’s --

                                 ADAM
                        -- Going as a devil, I know.  We already 
                        discussed his costume at length.  He was 
                        afraid people would laugh because his 
                        devil suit is really just red footie 
                        pajamas.  But I told him that PJs, plus 
                        pitchfork, plus devil ears and pointy 
                        tail is so fully Satanic, no one will 
                        question him.

           Adam fist-bumps Teddy who has wandered back with a piece 
           of pizza dangling from his mouth. 

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Now, we’re taking Beezlebub out at five 
                        and the band doesn’t go on until ten.  
                                 (beat)
                        So, you better bring it because I’m gonna 
                        be looking hot - in an 18th Century way.  

           Adam turns, jumps off the porch, heads to the street 
           where his car sits, FLASHERS ON and PIZZA DELIVERY SIGN 
           strapped the roof.

           Mia stands at the door watching.  Teddy looks at her.

                                 TEDDY 
                        How come you don’t want to see his band?

                                 MIA
                        Because.  I’m...an idiot. 

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. MIA’S ROOM - LATER

           Mia is distracted, rehearsing her cello.  She stops -- 
           thinking.  

           Her looks at the WEDDING PHOTO of her mom and dad on her 
           dresser.  The bride wore black, the groom wore leather.  
           Mia gets up.

           INT. HALL HOUSE - EVENING

           Kat tries to sew a DEVIL TAIL onto TEDDY’S COSTUME, but 
           can’t thread the bobbin on the OLD SEWING MACHINE.

                                 KAT
                        Stupid piece of...argh!...

           She beats the crap out of the machine as Mia enters.

                                 MIA
                        Mom.  I need your help.

                                 KAT
                        I can’t promise you results, but I’ll 
                        try.  Lay it on me like a wet rag.

                                 MIA
                        OK.  I need to know who the all time, 
                        coolest rock chick is.

                                 KAT
                                 (looks up)
                        Oh.  That’s one I can actually answer.  
                                 (then)
                        Although, it’s kind of a Sophie’s choice.  
                        I mean, you’ve got Debbie Harry, Joan 
                        Jett, Siouxsie Sioux, Poly Styrene and of 
                        course, the Kims: Gordon and Deal.  And 
                        that little Yeah Yeah Yeah’s chick is 
                        definitely on my radar --

                                 MIA
                        -- Well, whoever’s the coolest, that’s 
                        who I need to be for Halloween.

                                 KAT
                                 (suddenly touched)
                        Oh, Honey, I’ve waited your whole life 
                        for this.  
                                 (beat)
                        You can finally borrow my clothes!  

           CUE COOL MONTAGE MUSIC -
           MIA’S HALLOWEEN MAKE-OVER:

           Kat fights her way out of an overstuffed closet, dragging 
           GARBAGE BAGS and BOXES.

           Kat, Mia and Teddy empty the bags onto her bed, sorting 
           through TIE-DYED VINTAGE SLIPS, COMBAT BOOTS, VINYL MINI 
           DRESSES and god-knows-what-else...

           Kat throws pieces at Mia to try on.

           She even slips on a few memory-lane outfits herself.  

           Even Teddy struts around in so many HEAVILY STUDDED BELTS 
           he falls over.

           Kat tilts her head, examining Mia in a mod mini-dress.

                                 KAT
                        Hm.  I’m thinking a pastiche of looks 
                        might be the better way to go.  
                                 (then)
                        Don’t move.

           Kat leaps off the bed, darts back to her closet and 
           emerges with a banged-up BOX.

           She reverentially takes off the lid --

                                 KAT (CONT’D)
                        This is the closest you’ll ever get to a 
                        family heirloom.

           And pulls out a perfectly, threadbare VELVET UNDERGROUND 
           T-SHIRT.  She holds it up to Mia.

                                 KAT (CONT’D)
                        Perfect.

           She then dives back into mountain of clothes.  A pair of 
           SNAKE SKIN PRINT LEGGINGS fly out. Some SILVER DOC 
           MARTENS.

           A PLATINUM WIG gets painted with COBALT MANIC PANIC 
           STREAKS.

           MIA’S FINGER NAILS get colored with a BLACK SHARPIE 
           MARKER.  So do TEDDY’s.

           Some D.I.Y. SAFETY-PIN JEWELRY goes on.

           Kat, now in another outfit, does MIA’S MAKE-UP.

           Mia looks down examining the Velvet Underground T-shirt.
                                 MIA
                        I can’t believe your parents never gave 
                        you anything else.

                                 KAT
                        Oh, they gave me plenty.  Like, mostly, a 
                        big fat lesson on how not to be a parent.  

           Mia suddenly feels bad for her mom.  They all know - but 
           don’t discuss - Kat’s painful childhood.

                                 MIA
                        Sorry, Mom.  Sorry I brought it up.

                                 KAT
                        It’s not your fault.  So they sucked, so 
                        what?
                                 (then, refusing to dwell)
                        The way I see it, you get two cracks at 
                        the whole parent-child thing.  My first 
                        one blew chunks, but the second one’s 
                        been a beaut.  I have zero complaints.  
                                 (beat)
                        Now, do not take that shirt off lest 
                        someone grab it and try to sell it on 
                        ebay.  Oh, and you’ll need this.

           Kat holds out a small, stick-on NOSE RING.  Then steps 
           back, admiring her work.  

                                 KAT (CONT’D)
                        I am a genius.

           INT. HALL HOUSE - EVENING

           Adam in his Mozart Costume, set off by a pair of RAY-
           BANS, hangs with Teddy in his Devil Costume (with a 
           hastily sewn-on tail) and Denny.  

           Kat walks in with Mia.  The boys gasp - Mia looks killer.

                                 ADAM
                        Whoa.  I wasn’t sure you had it in you.

                                 KAT
                        Are you kidding?  Check the family tree.

                                 TEDDY
                        Wow, Mia, you look sexy.

                                 MIA
                        Teddy!  You don’t even know what that 
                        means.
                                 TEDDY
                        I’m seven.  I know what it means. 
                                 (beat)
                        Now let’s rock this.

           As they head for the door, Denny pulls Adam aside and 
           whispers.

                                 DENNY
                        If any dude looks at her, punch him. 

                                 KAT
                        In the nuts.

           Adam nods, getting the protective message.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD SIDEWALK - EVENING

           As they trick-or-treat, Adam plays candy-swap with Teddy, 
           clearly tilting the trade to Teddy’s favor.

                                 ADAM
                        OK, Lucifer, I’ll trade you my Twix for 
                        your candy corn.

                                 TEDDY
                        Deal.  I hate candy corn.
                                 (then)
                        Why can’t I go see your band tonight?

                                 ADAM
                        Sorry, man, it’s not an all ages gig.

                                 MIA
                        You can listen to the CD at home.

                                 TEDDY
                        I know, but Faceplant’s known for their 
                        live shows.

           Adam and Mia try not to laugh.  Mia reaches out and grabs 
           Adam’s hand.  MORPH TO:

           INT. CLUB - NIGHT

           CLOSE on Adam and Mia holding hands as they enter the 
           club.  The place is packed with everyone in costume.

                                 ADAM
                        I gotta go set up.  You cool for a few?

           Mia hesitates, then shoves him away.
                                 MIA
                        I’m fine.  Go.  Get out of here.

                                 ADAM
                        Is that you or the costume talking?

                                 MIA
                        What costume?

           Adam exits.  Mia smiles.  Liz’s girlfriend, Astrid, 
           dressed as a PINK HAIRED FLAPPER GIRL dances over to her.

                                 ASTRID
                        Oh my god, I freaking love those pants!  
                        Did you get them in Seattle?

                                 MIA
                        ...Yeah.

           A GUY IN A HILARY CLINTON MASK comes up.

                                 HILARY CLINTON MASK GUY
                        Aren’t you in the Crack House Quartet?  
                        Man, I’ve been hearing about your shows.

           Adam’s band steps on stage, the guitar rips and the place 
           ignites.  Astrid grabs Mia’s hand, pulls her to the pit.

           Mia stands there frozen for a moment as all the bodies 
           bounce around her.  And then - she starts to dance too. 

           Adam looks down from the stage, surprised to see Mia, her 
           arms wide open, starting to tear it up in the pit.

           She lets out a primal scream and goes wild.  Astrid 
           laughs and screams back as Adam and Liz rock out.

           LATER, AFTER THE SHOW - Adam, sweaty from playing, finds 
           Mia in the crowd.

                                 ADAM
                        I’ll load up and we can get out of --

                                 MIA
                                 (grabbing him)
                        -- No, don’t.  Let’s stay.

                                 ADAM
                        Really?  You never want to watch the 
                        other bands.

                                 MIA
                        I do tonight.
           LATER

           ANOTHER PUNK BAND in SKELETON COSTUMES rock the stage as 
           Adam, Mia, Liz, Astrid, Scott and Jo dance in the pit.

           The place is a madhouse with everyone in costume having 
           fun.   

           Except for one GUY IN A HELLRAISER COSTUME who keeps 
           trying to dance too close to Mia, grabbing her.  She 
           gives him a stern look - back off, Dickhead.  

           But Hellraiser Guy doesn’t get the message and grabs Mia 
           again. 

           Adam is about to jump in, but Mia turns and lets her 
           elbow fly and, clocking the guy in the face.  He goes 
           down - hard.

           Liz and Astrid hi-five Mia as Adam looks at her with 
           newfound awe.  And they all keep dancing.

           EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

           Later, Mia even helps load gear in Liz’s pink Dodge.

           Liz mouths “Love her” to Adam as she starts the car.  
           Then calls out the window as they drive away.

                                 LIZ
                        Bye, Adam.  Bye, Super Cool Chick.

           Mia smiles as Adam turns back to her, the two of them 
           alone now against the back brick wall of the club.  

           Adam moves in closer.  Takes Mia’s cold hands and blows 
           on them, warming them up - a habit at this point.

                                 ADAM
                        You were so cute in the pit.           
                        You totally took that guy down.

                                 MIA
                        He had it coming.   
                                 (he laughs, then)
                        Hey, Adam?  Do you, um, like me better 
                        ...like this?

                                 ADAM
                        Like what?
                                 MIA
                        You know, like tonight?  With the clothes 
                        and the make-up and the grrr.

                                 ADAM
                        Well, I definitely like the grrr.
                        And it’s cool that you weren’t chomping 
                        at the bit to leave.  And dancing with 
                        you was fun.  And so is doing this...

           He leans in, kisses her neck.

                                 MIA
                        I know.  But do you like me better?

           Mia looks him in the eye.  Adam just shakes his head.

                                 ADAM
                        Mia, Mia, Mia.  Don’t you get it?  You’re 
                        the same you I liked yesterday and the 
                        same you I’ll like with tomorrow.  
                                 (beat)
                        You’re one of the punkiest girls I know, 
                        no matter what you wear or listen to.                                                                                                                                                                                 

           And with that, Mia throws herself into Adam with sudden 
           gusto, finally letting go as they make out.  

           And this time, there’s nothing awkward about it.  Just 
           pure, unbridled, teenage hotness falling against the 
           wall.  CUT TO:

           INT. OPERATING ROOM -DAY

           A nurse leans against the wall, exhausted after Mia’s 
           long surgery.  Everyone peels off their bloody smocks as 
           Mia watches her body being wheeled out of the room.

           She follows...

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY/ OUTSIDE ICU - DAY

           TWO ORDERLIES pushing Mia body down a long hallway.  They 
           arrive at TWO LARGE, METAL DOORS.

           One of them hits a BUTTON on the wall, the doors open and 
           they enter.  Mia follows them in.
           INT. ICU - DAY

           ICU is a fortress within the hospital.  Disturbingly 
           quiet, except for the rhythmic hum of machines keeping 
           fragile people barely alive.

           Semi-private rooms form a horseshoe shape around a 
           SPECIAL NURSE’S STATION, which is manned by HEAD NURSE 
           DAVIS (40), a hawk silently tracking everyone’s move.

           Just walking past Nurse Davis gives Mia a chill as the 
           orderlies wheel her body into her assigned room.  

           Another nurse with LOLLIPOP SCRUBS, drawn-on eyebrows, 
           and airbrushed fingernails of beach scenes quickly takes 
           over from the orderlies.  Her badge says NURSE RAMIREZ 
           (30s).

           Mia turns and sees the patient in the room next to hers -  
           Denny, now out of surgery, his head bandaged.

                                 MIA
                        Great.  We’re practically roomies.

           She darts over to get a closer look now that he’s not 
           surrounded by doctors.

           But when Mia gets a foot away from his bed, she suddenly 
           stops.  The man is not Denny.  Not by a long shot.  He’s 
           much older.

           Mia’s heart sinks, a fresh wave of confusion setting in 
           as she backs out of the room.  

           She turns back to her room, where the Sweaty Surgeon from 
           before, clearly exhausted, writes notes as Ramirez reads 
           Mia’s chart. 

                                 SWEATY SURGEON
                        I’ll just finish writing the orders and 
                        she’s all yours.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Girl’s been through the ringer, huh?

                                 SWEATY SURGEON
                        This is the easy part.  The Mom was DOA 
                        and Dad died on the table.  Kid’s waking 
                        up an orphan.  If she does wake up.

           As Mia stands there, listening in shock, we CUT TO:
           EXT. SCENE OF THE CAR ACCIDENT - DAY

           ORANGE FLARES illuminate the fresh layer of snow on the 
           highway as we get the full view of the accident - a 
           haunting tableau.

           It looks like an atom bomb went off.  Vehicles reduced to 
           twisted metal carcasses.  Debris everywhere.

           AMBULANCES, FIRE TRUCKS and POLICE CARS parked in random 
           fashion, their lights all spinning.

           Emergency workers swarm the scene.

           One EMT rushes past us pushing a stretcher.  Her stricken 
           face says it all.  CUT BACK TO:

           INT. ICU - CONTINUING

           Mia looking back at the bed she thought was her dad.  The 
           man’s WIFE comes in as HIS NURSE hands her something.

                                 OTHER MAN’S ICU NURSE
                        Here.  They got his pipe at the scene.

           The nurse hands her DENNY’S PIPE.  The wife looks 
           confused.

                                 Wife
                        Oh.  This isn’t George’s.

           Mia realizes the man must be the other driver.

           Mia stumbles back, catching herself on a chair, A RUSH OF 
           IMAGES flooding her mind:

           Denny, pipe in hand, glancing up from his chair as he 
           reads a pulp novel.

           Denny flipping a pancake with a flourish.

           Kat jumping off her bed.

           Kat’s fingernails being painted all different colors.

           A ROW OF SHOES by the FRONT DOOR.  Denny’s WINGTIPS.  
           Kat’s MARY-JANES.  And SMALL BLACK CONVERSE SNEAKERS.

           Mia suddenly bolts up.

                                 MIA
                        Teddy!
           Mia pushes herself out of the chair.  She rushes past 
           Nurse Ramirez checking her body’s vitals, past the stern 
           gaze of Nurse Davis and follows an orderly out of ICU.

           Mia runs...CUT TO:

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           The punk music blasts from the open windows of the pink 
           Dodge Dart flying down the highway.

           The pounding of the DRUMS is overtaken by...

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

           Mia’s pounding footsteps, running through the hospital 
           halls.

           She runs past -

           THE WAITING ROOM

           Where Libby approaches Gran and Gramps, who look up with 
           expectant faces, hoping to hear good news they won’t get.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        It’s just me and Teddy now.

           Mia keeps running until she gets to a HOSPITAL MAP on the 
           wall, her eyes quickly scanning and finding...PEDIATRIC 
           UNIT. 

           Mia takes off running again.

           She passes a COUPLE of YOUNG PREGNANT LADIES and THEIR 
           HUSBANDS, all carrying PILLOWS - headed for Lamaze class.

                                 MIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Mom always said he thought I was his 
                        other mother.  Because I was the first 
                        one he saw.

           EXT. HALL HOUSE - DAY

           CLOSE-UP: KAT’S HUGELY PREGNANT BELLY stretches out a 
           black BIKINI KILL T-shirt under her winter coat.

           Mia (10) stands bundled at her Mom’s side as Denny, Henry 
           and their bandmates load his drums into A VAN covered in 
           PUNK STICKERS parked in front of the house.
                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        Three days before Mom was due, Dad had a 
                        show in Olympia.  He didn’t want to go.  
                        But Mom wouldn’t hear of it.

           The guys regard Kat’s belly with terror.

                                 KAT
                        Oh stop it.  If I pop, you have plenty of 
                        time to get back.  And if I don’t, you’ll 
                        have missed a good gig for nothing.  I 
                        don’t want that on my conscience.

           Kat is too stubborn to fight with.  Denny looks at Mia.

                                 DENNY
                        Just make sure she takes it easy.   

           Mia nods.  Denny glumly gets in the van.

           MINUTES LATER, as the van disappears down the street, Kat 
           turns to Mia.

                                 KAT
                        OK.  Let’s go Christmas shopping.

           INT. MALL STORE - LATER

           Kat books along at a disturbingly fast clip, carrying 
           shopping bags.  Mia practically jogs just to keep up.

           Kat stops at a bin of UGLY SCARVES, starts loading up.

                                 KAT
                        One for Gran, one for Aunt Suze, one for  
                        Willow.  Willow would like this, right?
                                 (Mia shrugs)
                        Eh, who cares.  Y’know, Mia, pregnancy is 
                        the one time in life when you can make 
                        all kinds of crazy decisions and nobody 
                        holds it against you.  It’s like a free 
                        pass to be Courtney Love.

                                 MIA
                        Who’s Courtney Love?

                                 KAT
                        Please tell me that’s your budding 
                        sarcasm.

           Kat heads for the check out, but suddenly grabs her side 
           and drops the scarves.  She winces for a long beat, then -
                                 KAT (CONT’D)
                        OK.  It might be time to call Dad.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        I called him.  But there was a snowstorm 
                        and they closed the roads.  

           INT. BIRTHING CENTER - DAY

           The place is very granola.  A macramé FAMILY OF OWLS 
           hangs on a wall.  NEW AGE MUSIC.  AROMATHERAPY CANDLES.

           Kat, Mia’s hand, breathes through a tough contraction.  
           She smiles victoriously.

                                 KAT
                        See, Mi?  Women are superior beings.  We 
                        can handle the worst kind of pain.  
                        You’ll find out one day.

           Mia nods.  Then Kat let’s out a DEMONIC SCREAM, and --

                                 KAT (CONT’D)
                        Screw this Lillith Fair, wind chimes 
                        shit.  I want some freakin’ Melvins!

           The terrified MID-WIFE suddenly turns to Mia.

                                 MID-WIFE
                        Hon, maybe you want to get some fresh air 
                        outside, huh?

                                 MIA
                        No.  I’m OK.  Here’s the CD she wants.

           Mia pulls a home-made PUNK MIX from Kat’s bag.  

           LATER: The Melvins are now cranked on the stereo.  Kat 
           gives the final push just as...

           Denny comes rushing in.  The Mid-wife turns to him.

                                 MID-WIFE
                        Nice timing.  You want to cut the cord?

           Denny smiles, nods...then faints.  Mia looks at Denny on 
           the floor, then to Baby Teddy who looks up at her --

                                 MIA
                        I guess I could do it.

           The Midwife helps Mia as an exhausted Kat cheers her on.
           LATER: Kat, Mia and a revived Denny huddle around a 
           newborn Teddy, all blissed out and exhausted.

                                 KAT
                        So?  How was the show?

                                 DENNY
                        Nothing compared to this. 
                                 (beat, then)
                        I’m taking a break from the band.  You 
                        guys are the only gig I care about.  

                                 KAT
                        Really?  You want to do that?
                                 (Denny nods)
                        OK.  Just promise me you’ll still play 
                        sometimes.  Even for run.

                                 DENNY
                        Definitely.
                                 (then, a wink to Mia)
                        Nice work with the cord.

           A high-five between Denny and Mia.  Kat pulls Mia into 
           the bed with her and Teddy.

                                 KAT
                                 (closing her eyes)
                        Mm.  Hospitals can bite me.

           INT. HOSPITAL - LOBBY OUTSIDE PEDIATRICS - DAY

           Mia runs up, sees a sign and proceeds to the pediatrics 
           wing.

           Mia searches room after room, past kids who are waiting 
           to get their tonsils out -

           Past kids chemotherapy kids without hair =

           Then skids to a stop when she hears a familiar voice.

                                 WILLOW
                        Ooh.  Tapioca and chocolate.

           Mia turns.  And there’s Willow standing next to Teddy in 
           his room.  He’s conscious, WEARING a HELMET, and hooked 
           up to all kinds of beeping machines.

                                 MIA
                        Teddy!

           Mia runs in.  
           INT. TEDDY’S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Teddy seems...really tired.  But Mia doesn’t care. 

           She reaches out, touching Teddy - on his leg, his arm, 
           his cheek, looking in to his eyes, making sure it’s him.

                                 MIA
                        You’re here.  You’re OK. 

           Teddy just swipes his hand as if shooing away a fly.  Mia 
           smiles.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        It’s OK.  All that matters is you’re 
                        here.

           Teddy notices Willow, still in her coat, holding an OLD 
           SUITCASE covered in hand-painted decoration.

                                 TEDDY
                        Why do you have Mom’s suitcase?

                                 WILLOW
                        Oh, I stopped by your house to pick up 
                        stuff for everybody.  It’s kind of drag 
                        to hang out in the hospital without any 
                        your stuff.

           Willow opens the suitcase.

           Mia notices some of the items inside - BOOKS for Denny, A 
           BALL OF YARN AND KNITTING NEEDLES for Kat, Mia’s CELLO 
           BOW.  Mia looks away.

                                 WILLOW (CONT’D)
                        Thought you might like these.

           Willow hands Teddy his DRUMSTICKS.  He smiles, taking 
           them.

                                 TEDDY
                                 (sleepy voice)
                        Willow rocks.

                                 WILLOW
                        Check it out.  You can hear the rhythms 
                        of the machines.  Bee-buh-BUM, Bee-ba-
                        BUM, Bee-ba-BUM.  Pretty cool, right?

           Teddy nods.  Then picks up a container of pudding from 
           his tray by the bed.
                                 TEDDY
                        Mia can have my Tapioca.  I think it’s 
                        gross, but she likes it.

                                 WILLOW
                        OK.  I’m sure we can get it to her.

           Willow looks up as Gran and Gramps enter the room.

                                 TEDDY
                        Gran!

           Gran looks wrecked, like she’s been crying.

                                 WILLOW
                        Oh hi.  I got here right when they were 
                        assigning his room, so I thought I’d just 
                        hang out.

           Gran goes straight to Teddy, clutching him like she’s 
           holding on for dear life.  

           Willow immediately picks up on how bad things are.  She 
           turns to Gramps with a questioning look.

           He nods, and fighting off tears, starts to COUGH and 
           CLEAR his throat.

                                 GRAMPS
                        Excuse me.

           He steps back into the hall.  

           Gran, looks away from Teddy, trying to keep a grip on her 
           emotions, but she is quickly fraying, on the verge of 
           hysterics.

           Willow takes the briefest moment to acknowledge the loss 
           of her friends, then holds the pain at bay and springs 
           into nurse-mode.  She looks at Teddy.

                                 WILLOW
                        How about we eat this pudding, huh?
                                 (opening the chocolate)
                        Get our strength up.  And then your 
                        Grandparents get their lunch too.

           Gran pulls away.  Trying to act normal and not freak out 
           Teddy.

                                 GRAN
                        Yeah.  Gramps needs his pill.
                                 TEDDY
                        OK.  And I’ll take my pill too.

                                 WILLOW
                        And I’ll be right here with Teddy.  I’m 
                        not going anywhere.  And we won’t talk 
                        about anything too important until you 
                        guys get back.

           Gran nods grateful to Willow as she steps out.

           Mia pokes her head out of Teddy’s room and sees Gran and 
           Gramps walking away down the hall, their arms around each 
           other.

           She turns back to Teddy, watching him lightly tap his 
           chocolate pudding with his drumsticks, splattering 
           Willow.  She laughs

           Mia looks at them.  If you didn’t know better, Willow 
           could be his mother.  And it would be OK.

                                 MIA
                        Willow?  Am I going to die?  What can I 
                        do?  How do I get back?

                                 TEDDY
                                 (then, a little confused)
                        We were coming to visit you guys.

                                 WILLOW
                        I know.  But now I came to visit you.

           Willow squeezes Teddy’s hand.  As Mia observes their 
           sweet interaction, a NOISE outside suddenly interrupts 
           her thoughts.   

           She walks to the window, and looks down at the PARKING 
           LOT covered in WHITE SNOW and sees...Liz’s PINK DODGE 
           pulling in.  

                                 MIA
                        Liz?  Who called Liz?

           The driver door opens.  And Adam gets out.  Mia gasps.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        You came! 

           Mia quickly turns back to Teddy and Willow, who is 
           keeping him calm and occupied.
                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        I just have to see him.  And then I’ll be 
                        back.

           Mia tickles Teddy’s toes peeking out from the blanket.  
           Then runs out of the room.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLS - DAY

           Mia runs.  She can’t get to Adam fast enough.

                                 MIA
                        You’re here!  You’re here!  You’re here!

           INT. MAIN ENTRANCE DAY - DAY

           A Nurse points Adam in the direction of ICU.  He takes 
           off running. 

           INT. HOSPTAL HALL - DAY

           Mia runs, dodging people in the hall.

           INT. OTHER HOSPITAL HALL - DAY

           Adam also runs, dodging people.

           INT. HOSPITAL OUTSIDE ICU - DAY

           As Nurse Davis steps out of the unit talking to a 
           HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR, Mia slips back in the ICU doors.

           INT. MIA’S ICU ROOM - DAY

           Mia ducks inside her room.  Ready for Adam.  She even 
           primps a little out of habit - not that he’ll be able to 
           see her.

           She takes a deep breath, turns and looks back --  

           And spots him coming through the WINDOWS OF THE ICU 
           DOORS.

           She jumps up, running to greet him, and just as she gets 
           to the doors, she hears --
                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        What do you mean I can’t see her?  This 
                        is bullshit!

           ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOORS, OUTSIDE ICU

           Is the Head Nurse Davis, blocking Adam’s entrance.

           Adam can’t get in.  Mia can’t get out.  

                                 MIA
                        No!  You have to let him in.  Or me out.

           Mia can see Adam through the window, looking right past 
           her, not realizing they’re practically face to face.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Adam!

                                 ADAM
                        Mia!

                                 HEAD NURSE DAVIS
                        Young Man, you need to calm down.

                                 ADAM
                        I need to see my girlfriend.

                                 HEAD NURSE DAVIS
                        I’m afraid that’s not possible.

                                 MIA
                        Just let him in!

                                 ADAM
                        You don’t understand.  I would have been 
                        here sooner.  We were in the middle of a 
                        sound check and my car doesn’t start in 
                        the snow and Liz had to lend me hers and -
                        - Mia, she needs --

                                 HEAD NURSE DAVIS
                        -- She’s being well taken care of.

                                 ADAM
                        I’m grateful for that.  But I really need 
                        to see her.  She needs to know I’m here.

                                 HEAD NURSE DAVIS
                        I’m sorry.  Visitations are restricted to 
                        immediate family only.

           This fact is like a punch to Mia.  She starts to pound on 
           the door.
                                 MIA
                        JUST LET HIM IN!  PLEASE!

           IN MIA’S ICU ROOM, Nurse Ramirez looks up from checking 
           Mia’s vitals, hearing the commotion outside ICU.  She 
           shakes her head, hating Nurse Davis.

           BACK WITH ADAM PLEADING WITH NURSE DAVIS.

                                 HEAD NURSE DAVIS
                        Do I need to call security?

           Adam gives her a defiant look.

                                 ADAM
                        This isn’t over.  I’m coming back.

           As he slowly backs away, Adam stumbles.  

           But suddenly someone is there, helping him up - Kim.    
           He turns to her and they fall into a desperate hug.

           Mia watches, touched, as Adam and Kim exit the corridor.

           After a moment, Nurse Davis - satisfied the threat of a 
           young punk has been thwarted - turns and re-enters the 
           ICU doors. 

           And Mia darts out the doors, running through the hospital 
           trying to catch up to Adam and Kim.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        The weird thing is it wasn’t until after 
                        Adam and I were a couple, that I realized 
                        he and Kim couldn’t stand each other.

           As Mia keeps running, we MORPH TO:

           EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Mia chasing after Kim as she angrily walks off.  Adam 
           hangs back by his car at the coffee shop.

                                 MIA
                        Kim, wait.  He was just joking.

                                 KIM
                        Yeah, Mia, Adam’s hilarious.

                                 MIA
                        C’mon, he didn’t mean it that way.  Don’t 
                        go.  We’ll give you a ride.
                                 KIM
                        No way.  I’m not getting in his car.

           Kim stubbornly keeps going.  Mia sighs and finally jogs 
           back to Adam.

                                 MIA
                        Why do you have to be so harsh with her?

                                 ADAM
                        Me?  I was trying to be nice.  She’s the 
                        one who’s all uptight.

                                 MIA
                        Look.  Just because she can’t sit around 
                        and have deep conversations about your 
                        favorite bands, doesn’t make her uptight.

                                 ADAM
                        Mia, I’m not dating Kim.  I’m dating you.

                                 MIA
                        So?  You could at least try to be 
                        friends.   For me.

                                 ADAM
                        I’m sorry, but it’s just not there.  You 
                        can’t force these things.

           Mia looks away, annoyed. 

           EXT. VINTAGE SHOP - DAY

           As Mia and Kim try on clothes, Mia is still wound up.

                                 MIA
                        You know what the problem is?  He doesn’t 
                        like anybody who isn’t exactly like him.

                                 KIM
                        Um, hello - he likes you.  And you’re 
                        nothing like him.

           Mia stops.  Kim has a point.

                                 MIA
                        I guess.  That’s what makes this is all 
                        so confusing.

                                 KIM
                        So deal with that.  But don’t drag me 
                        into your couples drama.  Besides, I 
                        don’t really click with him either.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KIM (CONT'D)
                                 (off Mia’s look)
                        What?  Not every girl swoons over some 
                        melancholy guitar boy in skinny jeans.

                                 MIA
                        But...I want you guys to be friends.

                                 KIM
                        Yeah, and I want to live in New York and 
                        have a not-psycho mother.  But as the man 
                        said, you can’t always get what you want.
                                 (Mia smiles)
                        Look.  I accept Adam because he loves 
                        you.  And he accepts me because I love 
                        you.  But we don’t have to love each 
                        other, ‘K?  
                                 (then)
                        And you better buy that vest because it 
                        looks hot.

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

           Mia catches up to Kim - who is now alone - as she steps 
           off an elevator.

                                 MIA
                        Kim, what happened to Adam?

           Kim keeps walking

           Mia spins back to a nearby window with an angle on the 
           parking lot.  The Pink Dodge is pulling out.  Mia lets 
           out a painful sigh.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        As long as you comes back.

           Mia turns back to catch up with Kim, who just looks lost.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Oh Kimmy, there you are!

                                 KIM
                        Great.  This is the last thing I need.

           MRS. SCHEIN (40s), a controlling drama queen with big 
           hair and a bigger purse, is barreling towards Kim.

                                 MRS. SCHEIN
                        You scared me, Kimmy.  I didn’t know 
                        where you went and this place is huge!  
                        Did you get to see her, what’s going on?
                                 KIM
                        Mom, no, she’s --

                                 MRS. SCHEIN
                        -- Oh god.  Oh no!  It’s the most 
                        horrible thing that could ever happen!

           Mrs Schein is on the verge of a public meltdown.  She 
           dramatically steadies herself on the chair of a nearby 
           WAITING AREA.  

           Mia can’t but be a little bemused by this.

                                 MIA
                        Wow.  She doesn’t miss an opportunity, 
                        does she?

                                 KIM
                        Mom, stop it.  If I’m not allowed to cry, 
                        you don’t get to.  Mia is still here and 
                        that’s all I can deal with right now.

                                 MRS. SCHEIN
                        I have a right to my emotions, Kimmy!  
                        I’m a mother.  I feel things as a mother!

           People stare as Mrs. Schein dissolves into Greek Widow 
           sobs.

           Kim sighs, throwing up her arms.

                                 KIM
                        OK.  I need to take a little walk. I’ll 
                        be back later.

           A dapper, OLDER GENTLEMAN COUPLE nearby give Kim a nod.

                                 OLDER GENTLEMAN
                        Hon, go.  We’ll sit with her.

           Kim mouths “thanks” and bolts.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

           Kim walks with determination, talking to herself.

           Completely unaware that Mia is walking beside her.

                                 KIM
                        You see what happens, Mi?  If you go, 
                        I’ll be left alone with that sack of 
                        crazy. You know I can’t handle her.
                                 MIA
                        I dunno.  Looks like you’re stepping up.

           Kim stops at an elevator, rapidly pushing the button over 
           and over out of frustration.

                                 KIM
                        How can this even be happening?  How?

           The elevator doors open, Kim steps on.  So does Mia.

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           Mia stands next to her best friend who can’t see her, but 
           she can’t help trying to communicate.

                                 MIA
                        Kim?   
                                 (nothing, then)
                        KIIIIM!

           Kim just takes deep breaths, trying not to freak out.

           INT. PORTLAND HOSPITAL CHAPEL - DAY

           Kim looks around the small, hospital chapel, taking it 
           all in.  Then --

                                 KIM
                        This is their idea of non-denominational?  
                        We get a token Star of David and they get 
                        all this...

            Giant crosses are everywhere.

                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        What about the Muslims, huh?  No prayer 
                        rug?  And the Buddhists?  Couldn’t spring 
                        for a little gong?  

           Kim plops on a seat in the back.  A couple of moments 
           pass, she closes her eyes.  She starts to chanting 
           quietly in Hebrew (The Lord’s Prayer). 

                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        Mizmor l'david -- adonai ro-ee loh ekh-
                        SAR beeNot dehSHEH yarbeeTZAY nee al-may 
                        mih-noo-KHOAT yinna-ha-LAYnee --

           Kim stops, too overwhelmed to finish.  Then, quietly -
                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        Please don’t die, Mia. 

           She is unaware that Mia has taken the seat beside her.

                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        I can understand why you you’d want to.
                        But if you go, there’s gonna be one of 
                        those cheesy Princess Di memorials at 
                        school where everyone puts flowers and 
                        notes next to your locker.  I know you 
                        hate that kind of thing.

           Mia makes a face - she does hate that kind of thing.   

                                 MIA
                        Kim?  It’s nice to hear someone actually 
                        talk to me.  Instead of just about me. 

           Kim stands, wiping her eyes.

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Mia walks with Kim who returns to her mom, now holding 
           court in the waiting room.  Mrs. Schein looks up.

                                 KIM
                        C’mon, Mom, let’s go get some coffee.

                                 MRS. SCHEIN
                        OK, Kimmy.

           Mia watches as Kim walks away with Mrs. Schein.

                                 MIA
                        I should check on Gran and Gramps.

           INT. HOSPITAL - ICU WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Mia walks up to the waiting room outside ICU.  Liddy is 
           now leading Gran and Gramps towards ICU. 

                                 Liddy
                        ...Now, she’s still unconscious, but her 
                        vital signs are improving slightly.  
                        They’re running tests to see if her lungs 
                        are functioning and whether she can be 
                        weaned off the ventilator.

                                 Gran
                        Well, that’s good news, isn’t it?
                                 Liddy
                        It’s a good step for her lungs.  
                                 (beat)
                        The big question mark is her brain 
                        contusions.

           Gramps nods stoically.

                                 LIDDY (CONT’D)
                        We don’t yet know when or if she can wake 
                        up on her own.  
                                 (trying to be reassuring)
                        The first twenty-four hours are the most 
                        critical and she’s getting the best care.  
                                 (then)
                        It’s good for her to have a short visit. 

           INT. ICU - MIA’S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Liddy leads Gran and Gramps to Mia’s ICU room.  Mia 
           follows them in. 

           They steel themselves when they see her body.  Mia looks 
           away, not wanting to face it herself.  Then.

                                 GRAMPS
                        Hi, Duck.

                                 MIA
                                 (smiles)
                        You haven’t called me Duck since I was 
                        five.

                                 LIDDY
                        I’ll leave you guys alone now.

                                 GRAN
                        Can she...hear us?

                                 LIDDY
                        Truly, I don’t know.  But your presence 
                        can be soothing.

           She exits.  Nurse Ramirez comes in, straightens Mia’s 
           blanket.

                                 NURSE RAMIREZ
                        Of course she can hear you.  Doctors and 
                        nurses like to think they run this show, 
                        but they don’t.  She does.  So talk to 
                        her.  Tell her to take her time, but tell 
                        her to come back.  You’re waiting.
                                 MIA
                                 (incredulous)
                        “Come back?”  I’m right here, where am I 
                        supposed to “come back” from?!  Like I’m 
                        just supposed to open my eyes and this is 
                        all over?  Should I just stay here in the 
                        room?  What?

           Gran looks at Mia’s body.  She clutches her angel 
           necklace and forces herself to be chipper.

                                 GRAN
                        You hold on.  My angels tell me you’ll be 
                        back at that cello before you know it.

                                 MIA  (V.O.)
                        The whole Juilliard thing was Gran’s 
                        idea.  Well, sort of.

           The sounds of Mia’s cello take us to...

           INT. COLLEGE RECITAL HALL - NIGHT

           Mia on stage, performing an intense solo, her eyes 
           closed.

           Gran, Gramps, Mom and Dad are in the audience.  Teddy 
           sits in between Adam and Kim, keeping things cordial.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        Even though I was still in high school,  
                        Mrs. Christie had scored me a spot at the 
                        university’s spring concert.

           Mia finishes her difficult piece.  The spellbound 
           audience erupts in applause.

           ON STAGE, Mia is overwhelmed as people start to stand.

                                 MIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        That had never happened before.

           IN THE AUDIENCE, Gran notices a REFINED HUSBAND and WIFE 
           talking to each other in the row ahead of her.

                                 REFINED HUSBAND
                        Incredible.  You just don’t hear that 
                        kind of depth from someone so young.

                                 REFINED WIFE
                        And you can’t teach it.  That kid’s 
                        Juilliard material.
           Gran perks up at the mention of this, already scheming.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        We were all supposed to go to dinner, but 
                        Adam was just back from a week-long tour 
                        and we didn’t really feel like 
                        celebrating as a group.  
                                 (beat)
                        And I wasn’t going to chicken out this 
                        time.

           INT. MIA’S ROOM - NIGHT 

           With the house to themselves, Adam and Mia burst through 
           her bedroom door kissing.

           Mia suddenly stops herself.  Pushes Adam away.

                                 ADAM
                        Hey.  Where’re you going?

                                 MIA
                                 (nervous)
                        Do you want to play Scrabble?  I love 
                        Scrabble.  

                                 ADAM
                                 (with a look)
                        Scrabble is the last thing I want to play 
                        right now.

           He flops on her bed.  She takes a seat in a nearby chair.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing over there?

                                 MIA
                        Just...sitting.

           He gets up, walks over to the cello leaning against the 
           wall.  He spins it around, plucks a string.

                                 ADAM
                        You have no idea how jealous I am of this 
                        thing.

                                 MIA
                        Jealous?  Of my cello?

                                 ADAM
                        Uh-huh.

           Adam picks up the bow and holds it out to her. 
                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Play me.

                                 MIA
                        What?

                                 ADAM
                        Play me like you play this cello.

                                 MIA
                                 (her heart racing, then)
                        UM, OK.  
                                 (taking the bow)
                        You have to sit on the floor.

           Mia sits on the edge of the bed and makes Adam sit on the 
           floor in front of her.  

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        This is, um, a Shostakovich piece I’m 
                        trying to learn.  

           She grips him with her legs the way she would hold her 
           cello.

           She leans down, a little nervous, then slowly drags the 
           bow across his chest.

           She starts to play faster and WE HEAR the music she plays 
           to.  Her hair grazes Adam’s cheek as she plays.

           It starts to get more and more intense, Mia really 
           getting into it, until -- 

           Adam grabs her wrist, the MUSIC STOPS.  He smiles.

                                 ADAM 
                        My turn.

           Adam scoops her onto the bed.  DISSOLVE TO:

           Adam laying next to Mia, “plucking” her torso like his 
           guitar.  Mia laughs; it tickles.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                                 (playful)
                        Stop laughing.  This is serious.

           Adam lifts her shirt a little more with each “strum” 
           until they are tangled up in one another.  MORPH TO:    
           EXT. HALL HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           Gran walks up to the porch in the early morning sun, a 
           woman on a mission.

           INT. HALL HOUSE KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

           Mia yawns as she walks in, surprised to see Gran at the 
           kitchen table drinking coffee with Denny.

                                 MIA
                        Hi Gran.  It’s early.

                                 GRAN
                        Not too early to plan.

           Gran lays a JUILLIARD APPLICATION on the table.

                                 GRAN (CONT’D)
                        This is your future.  

           Mia looks at it.  Denny seems a little uncomfortable.

                                 DENNY
                        Whoa, Mom.  Let’s not pressure her.  She 
                        just woke up.

                                 GRAN
                        Didn’t you hear her last night?  You 
                        can’t teach talent like that, Denny.

                                 DENNY
                        I know -- trust me, I know.  It’s just --
                                 (then, to Mia)
                        Mia, your talent is your gift.  You get 
                        to decide what to do with it.

                                 GRAN
                        Well, you better decide fast.  You have 
                        to send a video just to get an audition.  

           And with that, Gran stands and grabs her purse.

                                 DENNY
                        You don’t want to stay for breakfast?  
                        Kat and Teddy will be up soon.  

                                 MIA
                        Well, at least, Teddy will.

                                 GRAN
                        Next time.  I’m planting my tulips today.
           Gran exits.  Mia looks at her dad.

                                 MIA
                        You really think...I have a gift?

                                 DENNY
                        Yep.  But the bigger is question is what 
                        you think.

           Mia sighs.  She isn’t sure yet.

           INT. MIA’S BEDROOM - LATER

           LATER: Mia slips the application in her BACKPACK.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        I carried that stupid application around 
                        with me for three weeks.  Too scared to 
                        fill it out.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

           Mia hugs Adam goodbye as Liz, Scotty and Jo wait by their 
           crappy VAN (like Kat and Denny back in the day).

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        Faceplant got to play the South by 
                        Southwest music fest in Austin.  

           The SCHOOL BELL rings.

                                 MIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        While I got to take a History exam.  

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Mia sits in class, writing an essay.  Her backpack hangs 
           open off her chair - Juilliard Application peeking out.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - AFTERNOON

           Mia and Kim hang out, studying.  Mia’s CELL PHONE RINGS.  
           She reaches her backpack to grab it.  

                                 MIA
                                 (on her phone)
                        Adam!  Hey.

           Kim barely looks up.  
           INT. AUSTIN CLUB - NIGHT

           Adam is backstage, celebrating with Liz, Scotty and Jo 
           somewhere in Texas.  We intercut: 

                                 ADAM
                        Mia, guess what.  We just got signed!

                                 MIA
                        You did?!  For real?!   

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah, and we just played the best set of 
                        our lives.  It was insane.  Man, I wish 
                        you were here.

                                 MIA
                        That’s so great.  Are you famous now?

                                 ADAM
                        Not yet.  But at least we’ll get to 
                        record in a real studio with a real 
                        producer.  It’s a big step --

           Liz grabs the phone from Adam.

                                 LIZ
                        -- Hey, Mia.  I’ll have you know some 
                        Texas skank totally tried to tear off 
                        Adam’s leather pants and I head-butted 
                        her for you.  You’re welcome! 

                                 MIA
                        Wait -- what?   Adam, when did you get 
                        leather pants?!

           Kim, overhearing this, rolls her eyes and pretends to 
           choke and die on her scone.

           Mia laughs, then notices the Juilliard application 
           peeking out of her open backpack, daring her.

                                 MIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I figured if Adam could chase it, then so 
                        could I.

           INT. MIA’S ICU ROOM - LATER

           Mia watches as Gran turns to Gramps who is sitting there, 
           starting to doze.

                                 GRAN
                        Hey.  I’m going to go see Teddy.
                                 GRAMPS
                        OK.  I’ll come with you.

                                 GRAN
                        No.  I think I’m OK for now.  I just want 
                        to check in with his doctor again.  They 
                        said you have to watch him for seizures.  
                                 (beat)
                        You stay with Mia.  Then we can switch.

                                 GRAMPS
                        OK. 

           She kisses him on the forehead and leaves the room.  
           Gramps settles back into his chair.  Mia watches him.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        It’s weird.  He sits the same way Dad 
                        does.

           We MORPH from Gramps sitting in his chair to...

           INT. HALL HOUSE - DAY

           Denny sitting in his chair, listening to Sinatra, grading 
           papers.

           Mia walks up and hands him the filled-out Juilliard 
           application.  He looks up.

                                 DENNY
                        Really?  You want this?

                                 MIA
                        I do.  Can you film me?

           Mia holds out a VIDEO CAMERA.  Denny breaks into a wide 
           smile.

                                 DENNY
                        Turns out I’m available.

           INT. HALL HOUSE - DAY

           The furniture’s been cleared to one side.  Denny has the 
           camera duct-taped to an old tri-pod.  Mia finishes 
           playing her piece.  Really good, as always.

           Kat applauds from the hallway. 

                                 MIA
                        OK, that just makes me more nervous.
                                 KAT (O.S.)
                        Sorry.  Just ignore me.  

                                 TEDDY
                                 (holding a WHITE BOUNCE CARD)
                        Yeah.  Pretend we’re not here.

           Mia looks at Denny shaking her head, then.

                                 MIA
                        Dad.  How was that?  Honestly?

                                 DENNY
                                 (thinks about it, then)
                        Well, I think -- 
                                 (beat)
                        Oh, C’mon, Mia, who am I kidding.  I’m 
                        just some old dude who occasionally 
                        played drums in an early 90’s punk band.  
                        You blew past me ages ago.

                                 MIA
                        I think I could do better.

                                 DENNY
                        Then fire it up.  We’ve got daylight to 
                        burn.

           Mia starts again.  The low sounds of the cello again 
           mingling with...

           INT. HOSPITAL/ ICU - EVENING

           The sound of Gramps quietly snoring.  He has fallen 
           asleep next to Mia’s bed.  

           Mia tip-toes out of her room towards Nurse Ramirez who 
           quietly chats with YOUNGER ICU NURSE at the Nurse’s 
           station as they look at a PORTLAND WEEKLY NEWSPAPER.

                                 YOUNGER ICU NURSE
                        ...Girl, I know.  I miss every good 
                        concert because I’m always working.

           They look up as Nurse Davis enters the unit.  They 
           immediately break apart and look busy.

           Mia looks at the open paper left behind the counter - an 
           article about BROOKE VEGA.  Looking cool as ever.

           There is a small mention of FACEPLANT.  Just looking at 
           it hurts.  
                                 MIA
                        Great.  Maybe they can do a cover of 
                        Girlfriend In A Coma tonight.  She’s more 
                        his type anyway.
                                 (beat)
                        After Adam’s band got signed, things were 
                        different.

           INT. CLUB - NIGHT

           Faceplant plays.  CLOSE on Mia’s faces as she watches 
           from the wings.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        They were still playing the same clubs, 
                        but now they were selling them out.

           PAN to the audience.  It’s PACKED.

           AFTER THE SHOW, Adam is practically mobbed by fans, 
           mostly COOL-LOOKING GIRLS.  Liz is mobbed by girls too.

           Mia hangs back, bored, TEXTING on her phone.

                                 MIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And when they weren’t playing here, they 
                        were gone playing somewhere else.

           EXT. HALL HOUSE - DAY

           Again, the band waits by the van as Mia and Adam kiss 
           goodbye.  

                                 MIA
                        I feel like this is all we do.

                                 ADAM
                        Don’t blame me.  You’re the one leaving 
                        for Juilliard.

                                 MIA
                        I only got invited to audition.  I didn’t 
                        get in.

                                 ADAM
                        Yet.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        And when they actually were in town, they 
                        were still working.
           INT. REHEARSAL STUDIO - DAY

           Mia eats TAKE OUT as Adam skips his meal in favor of a 
           nap on a nearby BEAN BAG CHAIR.  Annoyed, Mia tosses a 
           Fortune Cookie at his head.  He keeps sleeping.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        And he wasn’t working or touring.

           INT. BOOK BARN - DAY

           In the back room, Adam helps Mia sort through cheap 
           classical records.  He holds one up of a crazed-looking 
           composer.

                                 ADAM
                        What about this?  The guy looks a drunk.  
                        And, traditionally, drunks are 
                        responsible for some great music.  

           Mia laughs and looks up as a trio of SLUTTY ROCKER GIRLS 
           boldly make their way to Adam.   

                                 MIA
                                 (under her breath)
                        Big classical fans, huh?

           One of the girls bats her lashes at Adam.

                                 SLUTTY ROCKER GIRL
                        You’re the guy from Faceplant, right?  

           Adam smiles and nods.  Mia wants to punch him.

                                 MIA (V.O
                        And he started forgetting things.  
                        Like...my birthday.

           INT. HALL HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mia picks at a PIECE OF CAKE surrounded by her family and 
           Kim.

                                 MIA
                        Thanks, but I’m not really hungry.

           Mia gets up and heads to her room.  Kim follows.

           Denny calls out, after.
                                 DENNY
                        Hey, Mia, even the best guys are jerks 
                        sometimes.

                                 TEDDY
                        Except for me.  I’m not a jerk.

                                 KAT
                        Exactly.  Because you have me as your 
                        mother.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL REHEARSAL BOOTH - DAY

           Mia pours herself into practicing her cello.  We pull out 
           to the hall, to where she and Adam played in their side 
           by side booths.

           Only now, the other booth is empty.  Mia plays alone.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        And just when I thought it could end...

           INT. MIA’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Mia opens the door to her room to find Adam.  Half her 
           entire ceiling has been covered with a THREE-POSTER, 
           PHOTOCOPY MURAL of AN OLD FRESCO DEPICTING GREEK GODS AND 
           GODDESS PLAYING MUSIC. 

           The seams are taped together, the whole thing held up by 
           about a thousand staples.  Adam holds a STAPLE-GUN.

                                 ADAM
                        I’m sorry.  I suck for forgetting your 
                        birthday.  

                                 MIA
                                 (looking up)
                        I know, but this great.  
                                 (beat)
                        What is it?

                                 ADAM
                        This is your own Jolari Hall.  In San 
                        Francisco?  The theatre where you’ll be 
                        auditioning for Juilliard.  The 
                        building’s a landmark.  This is the 
                        ceiling.  

           Mia falls back on her bed, studying the mural.
                                 MIA
                        It’s...overwhelming.

                                 ADAM
                        I know.  And wait until you see it in 
                        person.  We played two shows there last 
                        summer.  

           Adam lays down next to her, takes her hand.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        So, here’s the plan.  You look at this 
                        every night, getting used to it.  And 
                        then when you’re there auditioning, it 
                        won’t seem scary.  Just look up and you 
                        the stage will feel like home.

           Mia rolls over and smiles at him.

                                 MIA
                        You still suck for forgetting my 
                        birthday. 

                                 ADAM
                        I know.  But I’ll pay my penance.

           LATER: Adam and Mia hang out under the new mural.  He 
           plays with his guitar, she studies a copy of JANE EYRE.

                                 MIA
                                 (then, looking up)
                        Hey Adam?  How come you’ve never written 
                        me a song?

                                 ADAM
                        I’ve tried.  I just don’t do love songs.

                                 MIA
                        What are you talking about?  Half your 
                        songs are about love.  And other girls.

                                 ADAM
                        No.  They’re about love gone terribly 
                        wrong and girls who have tortured me. 

                                 MIA
                        So what you’re saying is I don’t give you 
                        enough grief?  I’d have to dump you to 
                        get a song?
                                 ADAM 
                        Or cheat on me with some jerk in rehab, 
                        maybe steal one of my guitars and try to 
                        sell on ebay - y’know, something romantic 
                        like that.

                                 MIA
                                 (thinks, then)
                        Eh.  Too much work.

                                 ADAM
                        No pain, no gain.

                                 MIA
                        Ooh.  I know how to make it hurt.  
                                 (with a wicked grin)
                        I won’t let you kiss me until I get a 
                        song.

                                 ADAM
                        Even you couldn’t handle that.

                                 MIA
                        Please.  It’ll be easy.

                                 ADAM
                        Really?

           In one fell swoop, Adam puts down his guitar, grabs Jane 
           Eyre out of Mia’s hands, and flings an it across the 
           room.  

           Then pins Mia’s hands over her head, his lips hovering 
           inches above her face.

           It’s hot.  Mia’s eyes flutter.  She makes him kiss her.  

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Ha.  You can’t even resist me for 10 
                        seconds.

                                 MIA
                        At least I tried. 

           She gets up to get her book, but Adam pulls her back.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Stop it.  I have to study.

                                 ADAM
                        No you don’t.  I know how Jane Eyre ends.  
                        C’mere.  I’ll show you.

           And he kiss her even more.  CUT TO:
           INT. ICU - NIGHT

           Nurse Ramirez is making kissing noises into her CELL 
           PHONE as she sneaks a call in Mia’s room.

                                 NURSE RAMIERZ 
                        ...And did you put your jammies on? 
                        Good...Now let Pappi read you a book and -
                        - of course, I’m taking you to the park 
                        tomorrow, unless it snows again.

           Gramps stirs himself awake.  Yawns, checks his watch.

                                 GRAMPS
                        OK, Duck.  I think I’m gonna go visit 
                        with Teddy for a bit.

           He stands, squeezes her foot.  As he stands, Mia decides -

                                 MIA
                        Well, I’m going with you.  I don’t want 
                        to be here alone.  

           Mia follows Gramps as he makes his way out of ICU.  

           Mia notices the Other Driver’s in his room next door.  He 
           is now awake, talking to his wife and DOCTOR.

                                 OTHER DRIVER’S DOCTOR
                        Everything looks good.  We may be able to 
                        move you out of here tonight.

           This news is like a punch to Mia.  Who huddles closer to 
           her grandfather as they leave ICU.  

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - EVENING

           Mia walks with Gramps, watching him.  He looks tired.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        Gran was supposed to take me to San 
                        Francisco for my Juilliard audition, 
                        but...

           INT. HALL HOUSE LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Gramps, Mia, Teddy, Denny and Kat play GUITAR HERO.

           Gran hobbles into the room wearing a CAST BOOT.
                                 MIA (V.0.)
                        She broke her ankle working in the garden 
                        and couldn’t drive.  

           Gramps leans over to Mia and whispers.

                                 GRAMPS
                        Suppose I could take you.

                                 MIA
                        Really?  You would?

                                 GRAN
                                 (disappointed)
                        Wait -- what?  But...that was going to be 
                        our girls’ trip.  I found an adorable 
                        little bed and breakfast.  And we had 
                        plans for high tea at the Fairmont.

                                 GRAMPS
                                 (winks at Mia)
                        So.  I like high tea.

           Denny flops down next to crestfallen Gran and pats her 
           leg.

                                 DENNY
                        It’s OK, Mom.  We all know Juilliard was 
                        your idea.

                                 GRAN
                                 (stewing)
                        He don’t know high tea from high tide.

           EXT. GRAMPS’ TRUCK/ HIGHWAY - DAY

           In the back of GRAMPS’ OLD PICK UP, Mia’s cello is 
           strapped down with several bungee cords as they drive to 
           San Francisco.

           INT. GRAMPS’ TRUCK - DAY

           Inside the truck, classical plays on the radio.  Mia, 
           with her eyes half-closed, plays “air cello” to the 
           music.  Gramps glances over.

                                 GRAMPS
                        You nervous?

                                 MIA
                                 (totally)
                        No. 
           Gramps nods, looks back at the road.

           INT. JOLARI HALL/ LOBBY - DAY

           Mia waits outside her audition, nervously tapping her 
           cello.  Gramps isn’t sure what to do with himself.

                                 GRAMPS
                        Maybe I’ll wait outside.

           Mia nods.  He exits.

           Her cell phone BEEPS, getting a text.  It’s from Adam.  

                                 ADAM’S TEXT
                        LOOK UP.

           Mia lets out a deep breath.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Mia Hall?

           Mia looks up as the doors open.  It’s her turn.

           INT. JOLARI HALL/ THEATRE - DAY

           A FOURSOME of STONE-FACED JUDGES watch from the empty 
           theatre.  

           On the HUGE STAGE, Mia looks like a pebble lost in the 
           ocean.  Sink or swim time.  She closes her eyes, her bow 
           shaking as she begins her Shostakovich concerto.

           The first couple of notes are rough, but Mia forces 
           herself to open her eyes and look up.  And there it is --

           The ceiling mural that Adam hung in her room.  Only 
           bigger, better and more beautiful.  Achingly so.

           And something happens - Mia ignites.  In that moment, her 
           playing goes to new place, the best we’ve seen her.

           The poker-faced judges suddenly sit a little straighter, 
           a little more focused -- Mia has them.

           INT. JOLARI HALL/ LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Gramps, having snuck back in, leans his head against the 
           door, enjoying the sound of his grand-daughter kicking 
           ass inside.
                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        We didn’t talk about it.  We just enjoyed 
                        the rest of the time, playing tourists.

           INT. FAIRMONT DINING ROOM - DAY

           In a palatial, Victorian dining room set off by silk 
           ballroom drapes, giant potted palms and gilt chandeliers, 
           groups of Females dressed to the nines enjoy high tea.

           Except in one corner is the lone male - Gramps, in his 
           flannel - sitting with Mia.  He enjoys high tea too.

                                 GRAMPS
                        These lemon cookies are outstanding.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        Something had happened in that audition.  
                        I finally played the way I heard it in my 
                        head.  And when Gramps drove me home...

           EXT. HALL HOUSE - DAY

           Slow-motion as Gramps’ truck pulls up.  Mia looks at her 
           house with new eyes, like it’s not her home anymore.  

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        I suddenly had this vision of myself.

           FLASH - Mia in NEW YORK CITY, in a RED COAT on a crisp 
           wintery day, lugging her cello.

                                 MIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I just knew.  
                                 (beat)
                        Which suddenly made other things even 
                        more complicated.

           EXT.  OUTSIDE RECORD/ COMIC STORE - DAY

           Adam and Mia hang out, drinking coffees and talking.

                                 ADAM
                        So, are you going to tell me?  Did you 
                        knock ‘em dead?  They gonna let you in on 
                        a full scholarship or what?

                                 MIA
                        I did...okay.

           Adam seems a little relieved.
                                 ADAM
                        Oh, well, that’s OK.  There are lots of 
                        good schools around here and maybe --

                                 MIA
                        -- Actually, Adam.  That’s a lie.  
                                 (beat, he looks at her)
                        I played better than I’ve ever played in 
                        my whole life.  It’s like...I was 
                        possessed for three perfect songs.

                                 ADAM
                                 (a slow smile)
                        Oh man.  I wish I could have seen that.
                        Yo Mama better watch his back.
                                 (then)
                        Hey.  Why did you downplay it?  Why 
                        didn’t you call me right away? 

                                 MIA
                        I didn’t...I mean, you guys are in the 
                        studio doing recording and --

           Adam scoops her up.

                                 ADAM
                        -- Stop it.  This is great news.  We 
                        should be celebrating,

                                 MIA
                        You’re right, we should.  
                                 (thinking, then)
                        But when?  You’re in Olympia and Seattle 
                        this weekend.

                                 ADAM
                        You could come.  But that’s probably not 
                        a celebration for you.

                                 MIA
                        Probably not.  

                                 ADAM
                        And then we’re back in the studio for the 
                        final mix, but -- hey, look.  Let’s go 
                        somewhere around here tonight.  Mexico 
                        City?

                                 MIA
                        Sure.  
                                 (under her breath)
                        We’ll go the same burrito place we always 
                        go to.
                                 ADAM
                        What?

                                 MIA
                        Nothing.  It’s a beautiful day.

           INT. BURRITO PALACE - NIGHT

           Adam and Mia’s date is tinged with awkward silence as 
           they eat their burritos.  Adam looks at her, smiles.

                                 ADAM
                        Hi.

                                 MIA
                        Hi.

                                 ADAM
                                 (then)
                        Things are getting complicated, aren’t 
                        they?

                                 MIA
                        Our schedules are too hectic.

                                 ADAM
                        That’s not what I meant.

                                 MIA
                                 (looks away)
                        I know.

           Adam tries to make a joke of it all - release the 
           tension.

                                 ADAM
                        Hey.  I was reading that Willamette has a 
                        really good music program.  And Salem’s 
                        getting cooler by the second.

                                 MIA
                        Except, I’m not cool.  But speaking of, 
                        maybe Faceplant could move to New York.  
                        It’s the heart of the punk scene, right?  
                        The Ramones.  Blondie.

                                 ADAM
                        Thirty years ago, maybe.  And even if I 
                        wanted to move, there’s no way the rest 
                        of the band would.

           The WAITER brings the check.  Adam goes for his wallet.
                                 WAITER
                        No, man.  It’s on the house.  I saw you 
                        guys play three weeks ago.  Great show.

           Adam shrugs, proud and embarrassed at the same time. 

                                 MIA
                        He’s right.  You guys keep getting 
                        better. 

           INT. ADAM’S CAR/ OUTSIDE HALL HOUSE - NIGHT

           Adam and Mia sit as he drops her off.  She forces a 
           smile.

                                 MIA
                        Maybe I won’t get in.  I sortof hope I 
                        don’t.  Then I won’t have to choose.

                                 ADAM
                        Well, if you get in, isn’t the choice 
                        already made?  I mean, I’m not the guy 
                        who keeps you from going to Juilliard.  
                        And If the tables were turned, you’d let 
                        me go.

           Mia stares out the window, at Teddy’s skateboard on the 
           lawn.

                                 MIA
                        I already have.  In a way, you’re already 
                        gone, right.

                                 ADAM
                                 (a painful admission)
                        I guess.

           His reaches for her hand and blows on it to warm it up.  
           Mia looks away so he doesn’t see her eyes watering.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        If we just had a big fight, things would 
                        have been so much easier.  We could’ve 
                        made up.  But this was worse.  
                                 (beat)
                        It’s like we were breaking up in slow 
                        motion.

           INT. MIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mia walks in, drops her bag.  Looks up at the ceiling 
           poster, a corner piece has flopped down.
           She climbs on her bed, trying to get the corner to stick 
           it back up.  But it falls again - dragging a bigger piece 
           with it.

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - ELEVATOR DOOR - NIGHT

           A couple of ORDERLIES pushing carts stacked with DINNER 
           TRAYS brush past Mia, shaking her from her day dream.  
           She looks up and sees Gramps already on the elevator.

           The door START TO CLOSE, but Mia is edged out as TWO 
           DOCTORS rush up and jump on the elevator.

                                 MIA
                                 (call to Gramps)
                        Fine.  I’ll just take the stairs.

           Mia turns away and jogs to a nearby stair well.

           INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWELL - EVENING

           Mia runs down a few flight of stairs.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        If I’m really kind of ghost, being able 
                        to fly would be a big help.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - EVENING

           Mia steps out of the stairwell and turns for the 
           pediatric unit, but looks up, startled to see -   

           A posse of cool walking towards her - Adam, Liz, Scotty, 
           Jo and several other MUSIC SCENE KIDS, all headed up by -- 

                                 MIA
                        Whoa.  This cannot be real.

           BROOKE VEGA (22), in the flesh, a chick so swaggering and 
           cool she makes Liz like a forgettable wall flower.

           Brooke’s wearing her trademark bubble skirt, torn 
           fishnets, knee high boots, and giant sparkly sunglasses.

           She’s the sun, around which her admiring planets revolve.  
           She throws her arm around Adam as they walk.

                                 ADAM
                        Thanks for doing this.  I’ll have you out 
                        of here in fifteen.
           And as the group passes a gawking Mia.

                                 BROOKE
                        Anything for you, Baby.  How you holding 
                        up?

                                 MIA 
                                 (watching them)
                        “Baby?”  What to do you mean ‘baby?’    
                        You guys just met.

           Mia sees Kim following the group from behind, like a 
           little puppy trying to play with the big dogs.  Mia 
           follows them too.

           AS THEY WALK, Brooke looks Adam -

                                 BROOKE
                        So, what’s the plan?

                                 ADAM
                        Actually, I hadn’t really thought beyond 
                        just going up there and causing a ruckus.

                                 BROOKE
                        Well, you’re in luck.  Because causing a 
                        ruckus is one of my favorite hobbies.  
                        What should I do?  Let out a primal 
                        scream?  Strip?  Smash a guitar -- oh, 
                        damn.  I forgot my guitar. 

           They all step onto an elevator.  Mia makes sure she gets 
           on this time.

           INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Mia and Kim get wedged to the back.  And then Kim calls 
           out.

                                 KIM
                        Um, I have an idea.  
                                 (Everyone looks at Kim)
                        Maybe someone could scream, like, “Oh my 
                        God, it’s Brooke Vega” and then everyone 
                        will be looking at you and that’s when 
                        Adam can dart in.

           Brooke smiles and pulls Kim close to her.

                                 BROOKE
                        OK.  That works.
           And - ding! - as the elevator doors open, Brooke steps 
           off, linking arms with Kim, who is kind of freaking out.

                                 MIA
                                 (smiling, loving it)
                        Kim, you so owe me for this!  

           And as the posse gets closer and closer to ICU, PEOPLE 
           stare, some start to follow.

           A rock-star train gathering steam and passengers, until  
           they come upon...  

           THE NURSES’ STATION OUTSIDE ICU

           And, in the most bad-acting voice ever, Kim screams -

                                 KIM
                        OH MY GOD, IS THAT SUPERSTAR BROOKE 
                        VEGA?!  IT IS!!

           And the place falls to a hush.  Several younger nurses 
           look up in awe.  Especially a YOUNG MALE NURSE.

                                 YOUNG MALE NURSE
                        Oh hello.

           It’s enough to get everyone’s attention.  

           Even Nurse Davis steps out from ICU to see what’s going 
           on.  Adam dives behind a FICUS PLANT to avoid her as she 
           wonders away from the doors to get a closer view.

           The other staff stuck inside ICU peek through the 
           windows, watching.

           Brooke climbs onto the nurses’ station.  And before 
           anyone can pull her down, she starts to SING -- 

           A raw, SOULFUL BALLAD that just stops the world for a few 
           minutes.  We realize that underneath all the rock-star 
           affectation, this girl’s just an incredible singer.

           People are taking cell phone pictures, video, Tweeting. 

                                 MIA
                                 (standing next to Kim)
                        Oh my god.  If I weren’t already dying, 
                        I’d be totally dying!

           And as Brooke has the whole place in the palm of her 
           hand, she glances over her shoulder at Adam and whispers -
                                 BROOKE
                        Go for it, Doll.

                                 KIM
                        Yeah.  Let’s do it!

           And with that Adam and Kim charge towards ICU DOORS, full 
           speed.

           Inside, Nurse Ramirez, furtively hits the wall button on 
           to open the doors and -

           They pop open, just as Adam and Kim slip inside.

           INT. ICU - NIGHT

           But Adam and Kim skid to a stop when the gravity of being 
           in ICU suddenly chills them.  The whiff of death zaps 
           their exuberance.

           They look around, carefully whispering.

                                 ADAM
                        Where is she?  Where’s Mia?

                                 NURSE RAMIREZ
                        She’s over there.  Go on.

           They make a move.  Mia sees Adam coming towards her room.

                                 MIA
                        I just want to feel him touch me.

           But before Adam can reach Mia’s room, he is suddenly 
           moving away from her.  HUGE GUARDS have him and Kim by 
           the shoulders and are dragging him out.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        NO!  Let them go!

           Nurse Davis smirks triumphantly in the doorway.

                                 NURSE DAVIS
                        Get them out of my hospital.

           Mia runs out after them, glaring at Nurse Davis as she 
           passes.

                                 MIA
                        Bitch.
           INT. HOSPITAL OUTSIDE ICU - NIGHT

           As Adam and Kim get dragged out, the other kids scatter 
           before they get busted too.  Brooke blows Adam a kiss -

                                 BROOKE
                        Sorry, Hon, I gotta jet before I miss my 
                        show.

           And off she goes down the hall, followed by a couple of 
           ONLOOKERS begging for her autograph.

           Adam and Kim get dragged off in then other direction.  
           Mia follows.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY/ ELEVATORS - NIGHT

           Mia follows as the guards pushing Adam and Kim off the 
           elevators.  

                                 GUARD
                        This way.

           They pass a familiar rainbow mural as they turn towards -

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES - NIGHT

           Mia follows the guards hustling Adam and Kim to the door.

                                 GUARD
                        You can tell the police your sob story.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Adam?  Is that you?

           Adam and Kim both turn to see...

                           ADAM
                                                         KIM
           Willow?  
                                             Willow?

           And there she is, boldly confronting the guards.

                                 WILLOW
                        Excuse me, where are you taking them?

                                 GUARD
                        They were caught trying to break in to 
                        ICU.

                                 KIM
                        Only because Jabba The Nurse wouldn’t let 
                        us see Mia.
           Willow smiles at the guards and takes out her CELL PHONE.

                                 WILLOW
                        Hi.  I’m an RN at Cedar Creek and I did 
                        my training here.  So, if you’d like we 
                        can straighten this out with Dr. 
                        Carruthers, director of community 
                        affairs?  
                                 (starting to dial)
                        I doubt he would be pleased to know this 
                        is how his hospital treats someone who is 
                        trying to visit his critically wounded 
                        girlfriend.  Can I get your names, 
                        please?

                                 GUARD
                        Uh, we were just following orders.

                                 WILLOW
                        How about I save you the paperwork and 
                        just take care of it.  The patient’s 
                        family is here and waiting for these two.  

           They shrug, then let Adam and Kim go as they shuffle off.

                                 MIA
                        Go Willow.

           Kim throws her grateful arms around Willow.

                                 KIM
                        Thank you.  You’re the best.

           Willow starts walking with Adam and Kim.

                                 WILLOW
                        C’mon, guys.  I’ll get you in to see Mia.
                                 (then, fighting off emotion)
                        She needs you now.  More than ever.

           Mia’s hear suddenly drops.

                                 MIA
                        Wait -- what do you mean I need them now 
                        more than ever?  And why aren’t you with 
                        Teddy?
                                 (it suddenly hitting her)
                        Where’s Teddy!!

           Mia searches Willow’s face.  Her eyes are read and puffy.

                                 WILLOW
                        Over here, you guys.
           They turn down a hallway and suddenly Mia recognizes they 
           are at Pediatrics.  She looks down the hall and sees 
           social worker Liddy and a Doctor standing near -

           Gran and Gramps collapsing into one another against the 
           hall.

           Mia stumbles back.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        And that’s how I know.  Teddy is gone 
                        too.

           INT. MIA’S ICU ROOM - NIGHT

           Nurse Ramirez looks up as Mia’s machines suddenly start 
           going off like crazy, blinking like a desperate S.O.S.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLS - CONTINUING

           Mia runs, careening through the hospital like a caged 
           animal trying to escape.

           FLASH - Young Mia running, pushing a smiling Teddy in a 
           stroller.

           Mia tears down another hospital hallway.

           FLASH - Mia, a little older, running, pushing Teddy on a 
           his skateboard.  He’s laughing.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        He will never graduate from T-ball to 
                        baseball.  He’ll never see one of Adam’s 
                        shows.  He’ll never finish telling us his 
                        robot story.  He will never learn to 
                        drive.  Never kiss a girl.  Never fall in 
                        love.  

           Mia runs past MATERNITY WARD with newborns all fighting 
           their way into life.

           FLASH - Teddy and Mia running.  Getting chased by Adam.

           Mia runs towards the hospital doors ready to burst 
           through them and get out of there.  Ready to go.

                                 MIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to be the survivor.      
                        This is not something you survive.
           And just as Mia holds out her arms and makes contact with 
           the handles - something happens.  The doors don’t budge.  

           They’re locked.  Mia starts to shake and bang on them,

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        C’MON!  I thought it was my choice, 
                        right? Isn’t it?!
                                 (throwing herself into them)
                        Open the damn doors!

           Tears are running down her cheeks now.

           She falls in front of the doors crying and banging.

           And suddenly she feels WIND BLOWING AGAINST HER.  A GALE 
           FORCE pushing her back from the door.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        No!  I don’t want to be here!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. ICU - NIGHT

           Mia is suddenly back, standing in her ICU room.

           Her body is surrounded by a new group of nurses and 
           doctors furiously working on her as her monitors 
           franticly blink and chirp.

                                 NURSE RAMIREZ
                        Her BP and pulse ox are dropping.

           A bleary-eyed DOCTOR, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, 
           yanks down her covers and lifts her gown.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Her abdomen’s rigid.  Ultrasound.

           Nurse Ramirez does the ultrasound as the doctor flips 
           through Mia’s chart.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Jesus.  Splenectomy, brain contusions, 
                        collapsed lung.  Kid’s a frigging mess.  
                                 (checking the ultrasound)
                        Damn.  Full of fluid.  Maybe a slow leak 
                        from perforated bowel.  Car accident, 
                        right?

                                 NURSE RAMIREZ
                        Uh-huh.
                                 DOCTOR
                        Yeah, let’s get her back to surgery!  
                        Now!

                                 MIA
                        No!  Let’s not get me back to surgery!  
                        Just let me go!

           The team works rapidly, detaching monitors, sticking 
           another tube down her throat.

           A PAIR of ORDERLIES rush in with a gurney and heave her 
           body onto it.  Mia’s still exposed from the waist down.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Well, cover me up, at least!

           Nurse Ramirez reaches over and grabs a blanket covering 
           her up.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           And just before they whisk her body away, Nurse Ramirez 
           leans over and taps Mia’s forehead three times with her 
           acrylic nail and whispering -

                                 RAMIREZ
                        We can only carry you so far, Sweetheart.  
                        After this, it’s all you.

           Mia touches her forehead like she can feel it.  OK, that 
           was weird.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY OUTSIDE ICU - NIGHT

           Adam and Kim stand in the hall as the ICU doors burst 
           open and Mia body is wheeled back out.

           Adam and invisible Mia are now suddenly face to face.  
           She looks at him for several seconds.

                                 MIA
                        I’m so sorry.  For everything.

           But Adam’s looking past her.  He gasps.

                                 ADAM
                        Oh god.  Mia.

           Mia spins back to see what he’s looking at.  She gasps 
           too.  The two of them looking at the horror show that is 
           now her body.
                                 MIA (V.0)
                        I spent the whole day avoiding it, 
                        looking past it, pretending it wasn’t 
                        that bad.  But Adam’s reaction suddenly 
                        makes it...real.

           And this is the first time we get an eye-full of Mia’s 
           injuries - she looks truly terrifying; her face is 
           covered in cuts, tubes everywhere, her hair in clumps of 
           dried blood, and her hand bandaged. 

                                 ADAM
                        Your hand.

                                 NURSE
                        Out of the way, please!

           They shove past Adam, rushing Mia’s body to an open 
           elevator.

           Mia follows, as if dragged by some invisible force.  Adam 
           just stands there in shock.  Watching her go.  

           INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           The elevator doors start to close.  Mia, next to her body 
           and surrounded by doctors, - looks back at Adam, alone in 
           the hall with Kim.  He starts to back away.

                                 ADAM
                        I...I have to go.

           And as elevator doors shut, Mia closes her eyes so she 
           doesn’t have to watch him disappear.  

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        In a way, this makes things easier.  
                        We’ve known for months things could end.  
                        We just didn’t want to admit it. 
                                 (beat)
                        Even two weeks ago.

           INT. LIZ AND ASTRID’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A NEW YEAR’S PARTY rages.  A banged-up Christmas tree 
           decorated with GUITAR PICKS anchors the room.

           We follow Liz dancing through the party with a piece of 
           MISTLETOE, playfully giving a peck to every CUTE GIRL.
                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        Even Kim came to Liz’s New Years Eve 
                        Party.  For the college-boy factor.

           We glide past Kim chatting up some EXOTIC COLLEGE BOY in 
           the corner.

           We continue out the back door and up onto...

           THE ROOF

           Where Adam and Mia hang out, having a little too much 
           fun.

                                 ADAM
                        ...and every time we see each other, we 
                        should do one thing we’ve never done, so 
                        we’ll have all these memories that are 
                        cooler than anything that could distract 
                        us while we’re apart, y’know?

                                 MIA
                        Totally.  Like right now we should, um...

           Mia looks at the SWIMMING POOL in the courtyard below.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Jump into that pool.  

                                 ADAM
                        That’s the stupidest idea I’ve ever 
                        heard.
                                 (then, smiles)
                        Let’s do it!

           He stands.  And pulls her up as they walk to the edge.

           Inside, people are starting to count down to midnight.

                                 EVERYONE

                                 MIA
                                 (looking down)
                        You know what, maybe we shouldn’t.

                                 ADAM 
                        Too late.

           Adam grabs her hand.  They share a look, then...JUMP.

           SPLASH!  They land in the pool, then pop up, laughing.
                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        FOTHER MUCKER!

                                 MIA
                        IT’S FREEZING!

                                 EVERYONE

           But exhilarating.  Other copy-cat PARTIERS start to dive 
           into the pool all around them.  Adam pulls Mia close.  

                                 ADAM
                        Just promise me one thing.  No matter 
                        what happens or where we are, we’ll spend 
                        next New Year’s together.

                                 EVERYONE

                                 MIA
                        I promise.  

           And they kiss as the new year begins, everyone singing 
           and celebrating around them.

                                 MIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I knew it might be a lie.  But saying it 
                        felt so good I forgot how cold I was.
                                 (beat)
                        Until the next morning.

           EXT. HALL HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

           Denny and Kat and Teddy serve New Year’s Brunch to the 
           usual crew of friends and kids, including Henry, Willow 
           and their baby, LUNA.

           Denny is in full pancake making mode.

           Mia drags in, tired and cold.

                                 WILLOW
                        There she is!  

                                 DENNY
                        If you’re still drunk, you’re grounded.  

                                 MIA
                        I’m not drunk.

           Kat hands Mia a mug of coffee.
                                 KAT
                        How’d it go?  Did you get to see Adam?

                                 MIA
                        Yeah.

                                 WILLOW
                        Ooh spill.  Tell us everything.

                                 MIA
                        It was...perfect.

           Mia then looks up at Kat.  And suddenly a flood of tears 
           come rushing.  Kat immediately jumps up, protectively 
           shielding her daughter.

                                 KAT
                        OK, that’s it, everybody.  The buffet is 
                        relocating to the living room.  Let’s go, 
                        move it.  Take your Mimosa and your 
                        Stumptown’s finest with you.  

           Kat shuttles everyone out, even Denny, still holding his 
           spatula.  

           Kat shuts the kitchen door and heads for the sink, piled 
           with dishes. 

                                 KAT (CONT’D)
                        OK.  I wash.  You dry.  And when you’re 
                        ready,  we’ll talk. 

           CUT TO: Kat and Mia wash for several minutes in silence.  

                                 KAT (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s 50’s housewife bullshit, but 
                        I always find doing the dishes calming - 
                        the warm water, the soapy bubbles.

           Mia looks out the kitchen window.  At the driveway where 
           Denny and Adam first played basketball.  She sighs.

                                 MIA
                        It’s just...it’s like we had this perfect 
                        year and a half and I never even thought 
                        about the future.  About it taking us in 
                        different directions.

           Kat gives her a sad, knowing smile.

                                 KAT
                        Really?  I thought about it.
                                 MIA
                        I know.  I’m only 18, right?  What do I 
                        know about love?

                                 MOM
                        Actually, I was thinking just the 
                        opposite.  
                                 (beat)
                        The love you guys have is real.  It’s 
                        just your age that makes it inconvenient.  

                                 MIA
                        And if we weren’t musicians we could at 
                        least go to college together and it would 
                        be fine.

                                 KAT
                        That’s a cop-out, Mia.  All relationships 
                        are tough. 

                                 MIA
                        I guess.  But music’s pulling us apart.

                                 KAT
                        No.  Music can’t do that.  Life might 
                        give you different roads, but you choose 
                        which one to take.  
                                 (then)
                        Adam’s not trying to keep you from going 
                        to Juilliard, is he?

                                 MIA
                        No more than I’m trying to make him move 
                        to New York.  It’s all stupid, anyway, I 
                        may not even go.

                                 KAT
                        Maybe not.  But you’re going somewhere.  
                        I think we all know that.  And the same 
                        is true for Adam.

                                 MIA
                        So...what do I do?

                                 KAT
                                 (after a long beat)
                        I don’t know.  I can’t tell you what to 
                        choose.  Either way you win.  And either 
                        way you lose.  
                                 (then)
                        What can I say, Mia?  Love’s a bitch.

           Mia nods and looks out the window, knowing she has a huge 
           decision to make.  The Sunday morning DISSOLVES TO:
           INT. ICU - NIGHT

           Evening in the ICU.

           Mia’s body is back in her room.  The quiet hum of the 
           machines has been restored.  Everything is calm.

           Too calm.  Mia’s body looks bereft of color.  And the 
           machines beep at a different, slower rhythm.

           Mia is curled up on the floor beneath the bed her body 
           lays in.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        I just want to sleep.

           She looks out and see Nurse Ramirez’ BRIGHT YELLOW CROCS 
           in front of her.

           Ramirez looks down at Mia’s colorless body.  She sighs 
           and pats Mia’s hand.

           She’s spent too much time in ICU to believe everyone can 
           be a miracle.

           Mia looks out and now sees Gramps’ boots in the doorway.

                                 GRAMPS
                        May I?

                                 NURSE RAMIREZ
                        Of course.  

           Ramirez steps out, leaving Gramps alone with Mia.  Gramps 
           takes a seat on one side of her bed.  

           Mia crawls out from under the other side, pulling her 
           spent self into a chair so she is looking at Gramps 
           across her lifeless body.

           He looks like he’s aged hundred years in one day.  He 
           lets out a deep sigh.

                                 GRAMPS
                        You know, Duck, there’s so much bullshit 
                        in the world, sometimes it’s hard to know 
                        where to begin.
                                 (beat)
                        Like, when they say the good Lord never 
                        gives you more than you can handle.  I’m 
                        not sure I buy that one. Only so much you 
                        can take, right? 
                                 (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRAMPS (CONT'D)
                        What I mean is, you don’t have to hang on 
                        for us.  If you need to go...
                                 (his eyes well)
                        Then you go.  We still love you.  And 
                        nothing changes that. 

           Mia, touched, reaches out for Gramps’ hand, even though 
           he can’t feel it.

                                 MIA
                        Thanks.  For understanding.

           He nods, then       stands and shuffles to the door.  He 
           gives her foot a squeeze before he exits.

                                   MIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        He made it OK for me to go.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. ICU - OUTSIDE MIA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Mia’s surgeon gathers with Nurse Ramirez, Liddy, Gran, 
           Gramps and Willow, giving them the difficult news.

                                 SURGEON
                        ...And what concerns me is her increasing 
                        lack of brain activity.  We can’t reverse 
                        that.  We can only make her as 
                        comfortable as possible...

           TIME LAPSE IN ICU

           Several people making their way past Mia’s bed, OLD 
           RELATIVES she barely knows. 

                                 MIA
                        Lots of people showed up.  My Great Aunts 
                        Myrnie and Bernie, some people from 
                        Gran’s church...

           Liddy and a CHAPLAIN help usher people in.

           Willow, now with Henry and Luna, say goodbye.

           Gran says goodbye.

           A MAN IN KHAKIS makes his way past Mia’s bed.

                                 MIA  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And him - I have no idea who that guy is.  
                        What if he came for someone else?  That’s 
                        awkward.   
           And then Kim walks in and sits next to Mia’s body.  Her 
           hair is frizzy mess at this point.  She flops in a chair.

                                 KIM
                        You would laugh, Mia.  I have total 
                        dumpster hair.
                                 (beat)
                        This day has been so insane.  I just wish 
                        you were here to see it. 

           Mia smiles, nods - she was here.

                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and by the way, Adam’s pretty great.  
                        I suck for never telling you that before.

                                 MIA
                        But he couldn’t handle this.
                                 (then, sadly)
                        But I guess it’s pretty intense, right? 

                                 KIM
                        We tried to break into ICU to see you - 
                        and Ms. Brooke Vega totally helped us, 
                        which was surreal all on its own.  But 
                        then these huge security guys grabbed us, 
                        and Mia, I wasn’t scared at all.  I was 
                        like “what’s the worst that can happen?  
                        They take me to jail?  My mom freaks out?  
                        So what?”  That would be nothing, Mia.  
                        Nothing compared...
                                 (breaking down)
                        To losing you.  

                                 MIA
                        Oh Kim.  Please stop.

                                 KIM
                        Mia, you can’t go.  
                                 (through her tears)
                        You’re the only real friend I have, and I 
                        know I tried to make it sound like I was 
                        super tight with those girls at 
                        Photography Camp, but honestly, they’re 
                        kind of shallow and they’re just not you -
                        - 

                                 MIA
                        -- Kim.  Just shut up for two seconds.

           Kim suddenly stops.  Swallows her tears for a moment.
                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me.  
                                 (beat)
                        You are going to be OK.  You are.  I’m 
                        not gonna lie.  Losing me is going to 
                        hurt - the kind of pain that doesn’t feel 
                        real at first, and when it does, it will 
                        take your breath away.  And the rest of 
                        this year will suck with all the cloying 
                        your-best-friend-died sympathy you’re 
                        gonna have to deal with.
                                 (beat)
                        But you will.  You’ll get to leave 
                        Oregon.  You’ll go to college.  You’ll 
                        make new friends.  You’ll meet tons of 
                        great guys.  You’ll fall in love and 
                        become a photographer.  And one day, 
                        you’ll have a kid who you won't smother 
                        and embarrass like your mom does to you.  
                                 (beat)
                        And, Kim, you’re gonna be a stronger 
                        person because of what you lost today.

           Kim calmly lays her head next to Mia, wiping away a tear.  
           After a moment, she takes out her CELL PHONE.

           She has a PICTURE OF MIA LAUGHING.  Kim lets out a 
           bittersweet smile and holds it up.

                                 KIM
                        No matter what, Mi, this is how I will 
                        remember you.  
                                 (beat)
                        You were so happy that day.

           Seeing the picture of herself, Mia suddenly stops.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        People always say certain moments are 
                        going to be the best day of your life - 
                        like your sweet sixteen, or Prom, which 
                        for the record, kind of sucked.  
                                 (beat)
                        The best day of my life was the one I 
                        didn’t even plan for.

           EXT. HALL HOUSE/ BACK YARD - DAY

           End of summer.  It’s early morning, but already hot.  Kat 
           stands over A GIANT WATERMELON in backyard, calling over 
           her shoulder.
                                 KAT
                        Hey, Babe?  Remember when I tried to be 
                        gardener a few summers ago?

           INT. HALL HOUSE - DAY

           THUNK!  Kat heaves the watermelon onto the table.

                                 DENNY
                                 (laughs, impressed)
                        Well, even a blind squirrel gets a nut 
                        once in a while.

                                 KAT
                        Yeah, well we’re going to need some other 
                        squirrels to help eat this.

                                 DENNY
                        Let’s call Henry and Willow.  
                                 (then)
                        Hell, it’s Labor Day, let’s just call 
                        everybody and barbecue.

                                 MIA
                        Can Adam come?

                                 KAT
                        Sure.  We haven’t seen nearly enough of 
                        him lately.

                                 MIA
                        He’s just been busy with the band.

                                 DENNY
                        Well, if the rockstar can handle a humble 
                        picnic with a bunch of squares like us.

                                 MIA
                        Dad.  If he can handle a square like me, 
                        he can handle squares like you.  Maybe 
                        I’ll call Kim too.

                                 KAT
                        Let’s just make it a blow out like the 
                        olden days?

                                 TEDDY
                        When Dinosaurs ruled the earth?

                                 DENNY
                        Exactly.  When dinosaurs roamed the earth 
                        and your mom and I were young.
           MONTAGE: ACCIDENTAL LABOR DAY PARTY.

           Music plays.  Watermelon is passed.  Steaks, veggie dogs 
           and corn mingle on the grill.

           Everyone is packed into the backyard.  Adam and his band, 
           Kim, Henry, Willow, their new baby, Gran, Gramps, Aunt 
           Suze and her family.

           Denny turns on the SPRINKLER.  Teddy and the kids run 
           through it.  It’s so hot, even the adults run through it.

           Adam and Mia laugh, getting soaked.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        It was so hot, I just kept dousing myself 
                        whenever I needed to cool off.

           All the lawn furniture from the front porch - and some 
           pieces from inside - have made their way to the backyard.

           Later in the afternoon, the sprinkler still runs, turning 
           the brown grass into a slippery mud.

           Teddy streaks his shirtless torso with mud, running 
           around like a refugee from Lord Of the Flies.

           Adam, Mia and Kim throw mud at each other, which 
           escalates to Adam tackling Mia into the mud, rolling in 
           it, laughing.

           They get back in the sprinkler to get clean again as the 
           sun sets.

                                 MIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        When it started getting dark, most folks 
                        left to go see the fireworks.  
                                 (beat)
                        But a handful stayed.

           Adam, Liz, Astrid, Henry, Willow (with the baby) and Kim 
           all stay.

           DARK NOW, they have the chairs around a CAMPFIRE roasting 
           marshmallows.

                                 MIA (V.O.)  (CONT’D)
                        And then the instruments came out. 

           All the musicians - except Mia - play, while others sing 
           and dance along.  Teddy and Kat cut a mean rug together.
                                 MIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I remember watching them, thinking ‘this 
                        is what happiness feels like.’

           Mia looks up to see Adam and Denny are carrying her cello 
           out of the house.  She blushes.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, no no no.  I’m not giving a concert.

                                 DENNY
                        No, we don’t to play for us.  We want you 
                        to play with us.

                                 MIA
                        No way.

                                 ADAM
                        Why not?  Are you a classical music snob?

                                 MIA
                        It’s not that.  It’s just the two styles 
                        don’t fit together.

                                 KAT
                        Says who?

                                 WILLOW
                                 (rocking her baby)
                        Please, Mia?  I never get to hear you 
                        play anymore.

                                 HENRY
                        C’mon.  It’s just family.

           Adam takes Mia’s hand, looks at her.

                                 ADAM
                        Het.  I really want to play with you just 
                        once.  Please?  I’ll never ask again.

           Mia looks at all of them.

           Mia hesitates, then grabs her bow from her dad and takes 
           a her cello.

                                 MIA
                        Fine.

           Mia starts slow at first, joining in with notes here and 
           there from her cello.

           But Adam gives her a look, encouraging her.  He signs a 
           lyric about heartbreak.
           Mia jumps in, making her cello sound like a breaking 
           heart.

           Meanwhile, Teddy has picked up a BONGO and is pounding 
           out a sweet groove.

           And Denny’s jamming on base, going back and forth with 
           Adam.

           Watching them, Mia really dives in, starting to tear it 
           up on her cello and elevating the entire song, making it 
           richer and deeper.

           Everyone plays.  It’s like one of those great Springsteen 
           encores where musicians of all genres share the stage in 
           an exuberant symphony. 

           Even Kat picks up a tambourine and shakes the shit out of 
           it with happy abandon.

           And it’s best song of the movie - even better than Mia’s 
           audition. 

           With fireworks in the distance illuminating their 
           backyard, impromptu stage.  Mia radiates joy as she 
           plays.  She shares smile with Adam.   

                                 MIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The thing is.  Mom and Dad always had 
                        their scene.  And Adam had his.  And I 
                        was always jealous because I didn’t.  
                                 (beat)
                        Until Labor Day.  That was my scene. 

           Mia looks back her dad playing to Teddy banging a bongo 
           to Kat dancing with the tambourine -- and whatever party 
           they’re at right now, Mia wants to be with them. 

           They keep jamming, the song carries us to --

           INT. HOSPITAL ICU - NIGHT

           Mia, alone now, seems to rise up out of her lifeless body 
           in the hospital bed.

           She stands there for a moment, looking at herself.  She 
           reaches out and brushes her hair off her forehead, then 
           turns to go.

           She walks out past the nurse’s station.  Past the other 
           patients.  Past the Other Driver who, even more awake 
           now, is now being wheeled out the ICU doors.
           Mia hears the song from Labor Day as she goes.  It’s 
           comforting.

           She walks past the waiting room, where the Chaplain 
           comforts her friends and family.

           Past the HOSPITAL CAFETERIA where the worn-out SURGEON 
           and TRAUMA NURSES who worked hard to save her grab a late 
           dinner --

           And rounds a corridor to the MAIN WAITING ROOM with the 
           LARGE DOORS.  The doors that were locked before. 

           It’s dark now, but as Mia approaches, the SKY OUTSIDE 
           GETS BLUER, BRIGHTER -

           And then slowly, the music starts to change.  We hear 
           something else, but we’re not sure what it is yet.

           Mia’s hand hits the door handle.  It gives, opening up.

           But Mia suddenly stops, looking up at the speakers in the 
           ceiling playing their hospital muzak.  A familiar tune.

           It’s the YO-YO MA song Mia and Adam first held hands to.  
           She smiles, letting is wash over her.

                                 MIA
                        OK.  Just after this song.

           As she takes a step back into the hospital, the song gets 
           louder, as though it is coming from somewhere.

           Mia starts to follow it.

           The deeper she goes into the hospital, the louder it 
           gets, as if Yo-Yo Ma himself were playing it live at the 
           end of some hallway somewhere.

           Mia keeps going...

           And going...

           Until she is stunned to find herself standing back in her 
           ICU room.

           And Adam is sitting next to her body.

           GIANT EAR MUFF HEADPHONES are on her body’s ears - like 
           the ones her parents put on her when she was little and 
           they took her to punk clubs.

           Only these are BLASTING YO-YO MA from Adam’s iPod.
           Mia suddenly realizes what he’s up to.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Adam.  No.  

           He gently takes Mia’s hand, trying to peek at her injury, 
           but ends up UNWRAPPING THE BANDAGE. 

           Mia walks around the bed so she can see his face.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        It’s too late.

           Adam examines her bare hand.  It’s only scraped up, but 
           doesn’t look seriously wounded.

           He holds it delicately, blows on it to warm it up, then -

                                 ADAM
                        Mia --

                                 MIA
                        -- Don’t.

                                 ADAM
                        Stay.

           Mia looks at him, unable to say anything.  He leans into 
           her, looking at her, not flinching.  Holding her hand.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        I know there are no words for what 
                        happened to you today.  There is no good 
                        side of it, there is no silver lining.  
                                 (beat)
                        But there is something to live for.  And 
                        I’m not talking about me.   I...I don’t 
                        know what I’m talking about.  Maybe I’m 
                        just in shock.  Maybe I haven’t digested 
                        what’s happened.   
                                 (beat)
                        But all I can think of is how messed up 
                        it will be if your life ends here.  I 
                        mean, I know.  I know that your life is 
                        forever fucked because of this, and I’m 
                        not dumb enough to think I could erase 
                        it, but I just can’t wrap my head around 
                        the idea of you not getting old, not 
                        having kids, not going to Juilliard, and 
                        not getting to play for all those people, 
                        so they can get chills the way I do every 
                        time I see you pick up that bow.  Mia.

           Nurse Ramirez pokes her head in.  Adam jumps.
                                 NURSE RAMIREZ
                        She’s barely got any brain activity.  
                                 (with empathy)
                        Just so you’re...prepared.

           Adam nods.  Ramirez sighs and leaves them alone.  

           Adam doesn’t give up.

                                 ADAM
                        C’mon Mia, don’t make me write a song.
                                 (beat)
                        If you stay, Mia, I promise you I will do 
                        whatever you want.  I’ll quit the band, 
                        and I’ll go with you to New York if 
                        that’s what you need.  But if you need me 
                        to stay away, I’ll do that too.  Maybe 
                        coming back to your old life would just 
                        be too painful, maybe it would be easier 
                        to erase it all.  And that would suck, 
                        but I would do it.  
                                 (beat)
                        I can lose you like that if I don’t have 
                        to lose you today.   
                                 (beat)
                        I will let you go.  If you stay.

           She closes her eyes and covers her ears - she can’t take 
           Adam going on and on.

           And soon Adam is drowned out by the sound of CELLO.  Mia 
           playing as she is flooded with IMAGES -

           Sitting at the breakfast table this morning.  Laughing as 
           she gets hit with flying oatmeal from Teddy.

           Walking down the street and hearing people utter the word 
           “orphan.”

           Walking arm and arm with Kim in New York, skyscrapers 
           casting shadows on their faces.

           Holding Teddy on her lap, tickling him till he rolls off 
           her bed laughing.

           Looking down at her hand as she plays the cello.

           Looking down, holding Adam’s hand.  They both have 
           calluses.

           Riding her bike next to Denny skateboarding, bringing 
           home her first rented cello.

           Kat holding sleeping two-year-old Mia at a punk show.
           Kat dressing Mia up for Halloween.

           And the cello getting louder and louder and louder.  Mia 
           playing harder and harder until her hand starts to bleed - 

           In ICU, Adam looks down at Mia’s comatose hand.

           Mia, playing cello, lets go of the bow.  It falls.

           The SCREEN GOES WHITE.  And The music stops.

           Silence...that seems to go on forever.

           And then everything fluttering and OUT OF FOCUS as...

           A fluorescent ceiling light becomes clear through eyes 
           blinking slowly - Mia’s POV. 

           And then -- Adam’s hopeful leans over the bed.   He looks 
           at her.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Mia?

           She looks up.  Awake and alive.

           Fade to black.
